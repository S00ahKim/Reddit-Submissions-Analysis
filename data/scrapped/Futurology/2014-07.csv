they structurally engineered financial slavery for the majority of people globally.

The traditional financial system is the operating system controlling how people relate to each other and how resources are allocated among society. At its core, it is a labor based system that uses money created out of debt called bank notes. Only banks can create money through making loans. Without access to bank notes and other financial assets to obtain the basic necessities of life, people are treated like slaves in the current financial culture. As technology replaces the need for many jobs, it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to get bank notes, or money.

When the system failed due to the fraudulent practices of banks, by government bailing out those holding control in the financial system without bailing out the majority of its citizens, it engineered the biggest inequality of wealth in human history. This injustice was perpetrated by forcing massive public obligations and debts on society at large to support the existing private wealth and control of a few. 

From a practical standpoint, such fraudulent action was simply taking from the poor and middle class and giving to the rich since government is the collective. Those backing this immoral behavior became direct participants in a rigged game that financially bankrupted our future and is biologically destroying our environment. Unless society evolves beyond the current narrative, inequality, fear, and anger will only increase for everyone around the world.

Over the past few decades, the current consumer economic model has become the dominant operating system globally. People today are consuming resources and polluting environments at unsustainable rates. Resources are becoming increasingly scarce and biological ecosystems are being destroyed. Human programming must address these new realities or the negative consequences will be irreversible.

Fortunately, new technology creates a better life for everyone by transforming the current narrative into sustainable new open systems through automation and digitization. Just as machinery made the slavery system of control in agriculture obsolete, highly efficient technology makes bank note based financial system obsolete.

In a technologically enhanced world, sustainable abundance in life can be open to all without the need to control each other with bank notes and jobs. Open access to activities allows everyone to play, work, and learn together online in an environment where traditional barriers such as race, gender, geographic location, and socioeconomic differences are irrelevant. The question confronting us all is not if, but how will civilization evolve from the oppressive control of labor based bank notes to the freedom of technology driven automation?",0,0,False,default,,,,,

At that time it felt like it couldn't have been more than a thousand members in size, only a fraction of which were somewhat active and you'd see the same hundred or so usernames in the comment section of nearly every posting.


Like many other subreddits, it started ballooning in size, even to the point of becoming a default sub which is somewhat astonishing to me as I've only ever been accustomed to futurism as being something very, very removed from public discourse. I think it's a great thing that this subreddit and more importantly these ideas and lines of thought are gaining popularity.


That being said, I don't think this subreddit will keep growing in size for long without the oversight of moderators who are there to ensure that the discussion is always more or less true to an agreed upon set of core principles. They must ensure that no single ideology or ""movement"" is able to (forcibly) move the dicussion away from those core principles.


It's easy to see what is starting to become more and more commonplace here. A lot of people are new to these ideas and of those people a great many of them are of the young, idealistic, naive, and angry variety. I think that while most of these groups are benign in nature and have limited lifespans, others are following along a trajectory that more resembles religious, political or ideological groups we're familiar with historically wherein members are encouraged to propagate a set of ideas to ""convert"" as many people as possible to their cause.


These groups offer up a romantic, seemingly plausible, and often Utopian worldview that appeals directly to the sensibilites of a majority of people with a certain disposition (young, angry, reasonably intelligent, reasonably versed in the things discussed in futurist communities online as well as the literature etc). On the surface, from most counts, the core ideology of these groups seem solid like something most would have no problem with.


What I have a problem with however is the ferocity at which they claim their predictions to be true, how they try to gain members by way of creating 'primers' and viral memes (the same way ideological groups have always done) who in turn leverage all the tech and media savvy available to them to refine this thought viruses message to increase its chances of spreading.


People reading this will **know** right away which ""movements"" I'm talking about. The classic poster boy for the lot of them is ""The Zeitgeist Movement"" in my opinion, something that I have spent a lot of time trying to get to the bottom of. I find that I often agree with the trust of it yet am uncomfortable with the degree to which Zeitgeist Movement ""followers"" are confident in a specific future, a specific doctrine/guideline for how things have to be done to make that future happen and with the way ""followers"" tend to interpret everything they hear in this sort of community through the same lens. The exact same thing can be said for people who take The Singularity theory to near religious levels (something I was once guilty of back when I first read Kurzweil's books): to such people, everything in this greater discussion is seen through that lens which creates its own set of problems least of which being harm to the overall image of this kind of community.


These ""movements"" are built on logical fallasies that we need to spend more time pointing out and purging from dicussions here so these movements can be relegated to the fringes where they belong. To elaborate: 


- Some are built on baseless speculation bordering on belief. It's one thing to say that *if* Moore's Law were to continue indefinitely at its current rate, the Singularity *could* happen, however it's another thing to insist that it will happen and then frame the whole course of discussion around that belief (it's absurd).


- Some of the proponents of these movements start with a political ideology, cherrypick and then frame everything in such a way as to prop up their ideology, going as far as to twist facts and sidestep around other points of view in the process of creating Utopian narratives of the future that have a strong viral appeal for pseudo-intellectuals who can't be bothered to lift up the rug. Peter Joseph has does routinely in everything I've seen him put out: he starts with the ideology first then with a stroke of creative brilliance presents a cherrypicked set of historical facts and predictions in such a way as to create a romantic narrative that leads the viewer straight into his own ideological headspace. It took me some time to realize what he was doing but now that I've seen it I can't unsee it. Actually, his first documentary to me felt like him refining his craft.


- Some are simple and universally appealing to everyone who shares the views of this subreddit **but** could serve to undermine whatever value we want this discussion to have in the eyes of the public. 'Basic Income' is a good example. No one disagrees with it in principle, however in 2014 is not the year to try and make it a hot issue in public discourse. Doing so will most likely do more harm than good. Also, such discussion doesn't really belong at the heart of all /r/futurology discussion anyway. Technology does.


In closing, the crux of my argument here is that without proper moderation, legions of young and angry, naive, idealists could start to frame the entire course of discussion here along the lines of 'The Zeitgeist/Venus Project presents: Basic Income for a Transhumanist, life-extended future! Sponsor our Singularity 2045 libertarian party with Dogecoin, now!' Not to be a dick or anything.


**TL;DR** What I think needs to happen is that the moderators of this subreddit need to agree on what the core principles of /r/Futurology are (a well thought out survey perhaps?) and a set of guidelines that keep the content posted here on course to protect it against being derailed by the proponents of specific ""movements"" with their own agendas.


**I think one of the core principles of /r/Futurology should be to make the entire population honourary members of /r/Futurology**. It should be to get everyone thinking *forwards*, to plot our future course as a species, to add credibility to futurology as a discipline, and to make the kinds of discussion we have here every day a part of public discussion at all levels of society.


This won't be possible without an agreement on what we're all about and a roadmap for holding true to that.

For those who have possibly forgotten, or maybe just didn't hear about this, in the US, we're still going through the motions to try and get Net Neutrality passed. Now, I can bore you far worse than politicians can with this shit, so I'm going to let [John Oliver explain it in his video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU)

For those who don't want to listen to the video, basically this: You know your really shitty Internet provider? Yeah, if this passes, it could get worse. Two options for data usage, a ""fast lane and a hyper-speed lane"", or as John says, ""Usain Bolt and Usain Bolt strapped to an anchor."" Companies that have literal monopolies over certain areas of the country can throttle your connection to lower speeds, but you don't have to do that *if you pay a higher fee.* Let's make something clear: I don't care who you are. I don't care what background you have. I don't even give a shit if you're PCMR, or peasant. No one should have to be put through this. Ever.

So, why am I typing all this out? Because the FCC, the brilliant people who want to do something like this, have made a ""compromise."" They have decided to let the public voice their opinions on this matter at the following site: http://www.fcc.gov/comments . If you click the link, check out that first topic. Yeah, 132 THOUSAND people have voiced their opinion. In a country of over 300 MILLION. GUYS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Yes, you do have to put information on there, like your legal name and such, but for that, it's worth them hearing what you have to say. People need to keep voicing their opinion; we have 90 more days to let them hear hell for their idea of trying to let companies suck the money from us from better connections.

Brothers. Sisters. My entire Master Race. Lend me your ears. I want this to be spread again, and keep the government site crashing with traffic. No one should have to pay more to keep their fast connections. Please let them hear us. Let them realize who we are, and that we want our Internet free.",1,9,False,default,,,,,

Absolute energy has been achieved, as in no more work is required to gather energy there are no costs for creating energy due to a combination of advanced storage ala batteries and solar fields and nuclear reactors.  Everything is automated.  as in all the farming is automated.  All material gathering, like everything.  The clerical portions are all automated logistics, shipping via drones driverless vehicles.  What's left?  I think it's a reputation system.  Everyone wears occulus rift like ddevices that display things.  you use credits to order whatever goods you want, and in fact everyone can,  what's then displayed is how much you're taing out of the system, youre taking is displayed for the world to see.  everything is used only when needed, other wise you get a little symbol that everyone can see that says you are a waster.  so basically when you need something you place your order with your account and your amount of taking is compared to the rest of everyone, everything is readily available, people cook meals for other people because they enjoy it rather than the profit because what would you do with the profit anyway?  you can get wahtevr clothing you want manufacturer in anyway that you want, never have a want of food.  it will be interesting!

Here are my thoughts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/29pc9p/discussion_how_do_you_feel_about_the_feasibility/,Idontagreewithreddit,1404351754,"Pros: It has a molten,rotating, iron core. This produces a magnetosphere around the planet; protecting it from harmful harmful rays and solar storms. Its magnetosphere is actually more powerful than Earths' is. Mercury; volume wise, is very slightly larger than the moon but due to its dense iron core it has over twice the gravity of the moon, which is good for long term visits. Also the poles of mercury do not experience the the extremes the rest of the planet does as far as temperature is concerned. Ice is thought to exist there. Mercury also has no atmosphere, I think this is a pro. Future tech may be able to do work with that some how, it would be like having a clean slate to work with. If gasses were introduced Id expect the magnetosphere would protect them for at least a decent amount of time, but to what advantage? I have an idea, I will post it if this thread goes anywhere.

Cons: Every where on the planet (excluding the polar regions) experience daily (88 Earth Days) fluctuations in temperature of between 400 degrees Celsius in the day to -170 Celsius at night. Also due to its proximity to the sun and its high mass, leaving the planet in a direction away from the sun would require A LOT of energy. Once again just landing on Mercury is difficult, with modern tech it would require 6 years just to enter the orbit of mercury and simply land; otherwise you will just literally be sucked into the sun... The problem is not simply getting there, it is setting it up perfectly and at the perfect speed and at the perfect angle to get in a stable orbit around Mercury.

If humans are ever going to put effort towards colonizing other places in the universe we are probably going to have to accept the fact that to perfect the techniques; a lot of people will probably die, I think that is a fact; others will disagree. Other than the European colonization of the Americas there is not much to compare it to in our known recorded history. You could say the moon landings were more similar, but all of the missions were short, with travel time and time on the body considered, it was nothing close to what colonization would be like.

Based on what I have looked at I think the exploration and colonization of Mercury seems more feasible than many other places that have been suggested, these places also get suggested much more, places such as Mars.
 
I love researching this type of thing and thinking about it, I would love to see humans send something like the Mars rovers to the poles of Mercury to explore. Imagine how the sun would dominate the sky.

What do you all think? I mean just ask question , lets talk about space colonization. The post making it to the front page concerning the colonization of Venus led me to post this. Although ""Cloud Cities"" sounds cool and yes, gas cold be harvested. It seems so fragile and insignificant to me compared to an actual terrestrial type colony.",13,2,False,self,,,,,

I want to ask the reader how many peoples know that there are some rules with different cancers like breast, mesothelioma cancers. We only know that cancer affected people are only patients they have no justices if they are being oppressed in mentally or physically. But this is absolutely wrong and nerd idea with the indiscipline mind. Cancers are not only diseases for suffering a man or woman but this also creates a source of getting proper justices by the  Massachusetts Mesothelioma Lawyer. By the way some people may be confused what is mesothelioma and what is the importance of it in my blogs. 

 yes this question may be asked with your proper rights. Mesothelioma is one type of cancer which surrounds asbestos affected tissues. For the clearance of you I want to inform that tissue is a power pack or combination of some cells e.g. blood, skin etc.. On the credit point USA serves the a law firm which strictly controls the justices of cancer affected people who are daily being oppressed by their family members or the neighbors even relatives who do not accept them as normal people and do not mix with them before will be enlisted as the oppressor under this Law Which is totally controlled by Massachusetts Mesothelioma Lawyer following some strict rules. USA government has given them all rights to establish the maximum punishment against the mental oppressor who are claimed by the breast cancer or Mesothelioma or another cancer patients. So, my friend be careful that cancer affected patients are not weak in their power that you are thinking still. They can make your life in a sorry figure with huge sorrows and null living method. From all my writings I said to be careful of breast cancer patients and love them as before what you did upto they were not diagnosed as cancer patients. But this is a strict writing from me that there is no way to accept them as before otherwise you know what may be happened.. I asked one of my favorite doctor who are belonged Massachusetts Mesothelioma Lawyer firm that "" Is there any rules by which a mental oppressor can be hanged for death as a punishment? ""  He said with a little smile that you are not still clear about our law firm. The punishment of mental cancer patient's oppressors will get those punishments which are more dangerous than death. If a people will go in death everything will be over but when he will make tastes of the death in every moments of his life it will be so dangerous. I was just shocked and concerned what a power of a cancer affected patients which has been created by Massachusetts Mesothelioma Lawyer firm.  Massachusetts Mesothelioma Lawyer are working so hard to find out the mental oppressors in where a family member is affected with any cancer. So, I want to apply a concentration to all of you that please help Massachusetts Mesothelioma Lawyer to make a peaceful environment for our breast cancer patients.

This is the culmination of a number of thoughts based on a real-world logic and feasibility and takes note of a trajectory for development of technology in the field of VR and AR.

The summary is this: with software engines like Outerra (http://www.outerra.com/) and mapping software which includes accurate topographic and road data like Google Maps, it doesn't seem too far-fetched to assume that in the very near future, a 1:1 scale accurate model of Earth could be produced. Users could navigate this virtual space using an avatar with tools like Oculus VR and some of the more esoteric technologies like air-based haptic feedback etc. making the experience feel quite real.

This setup would offer a game world, but also has other implications. It could mean that people with severe disabilities would be able to navigate earth and see things in a way that they mightn't have been able to see before and socialise in ways that would be impossible if they are limited for physical reasons.

Aside from that, there are a number of commercial applications, such as the ability to purchase both real and 'virtual' goods in a space that is mapped out exactly like it's real world counterparts, to take part in scripted missions with friends, to experience a 'cinema' like experience with friends in foreign countries, visit and inspect artefacts and art in museums... really the possibilities are endless, and offer up opportunities to do things that would otherwise be impossible or ill-advised in the real world.

Most interestingly, however, is the idea of AR devices like Google Glass interacting with this virtual world, and projecting the avatars of people using the 'game' world into the real world. This could mean seeing sights, talking, playing and generally feeling like one is sharing the same space as people who might be physically unable to navigate the real world. AR and the related technology could also help 'map' the world with high resolution textures and detail and update the world on the fly.

After discussion with friends and colleagues, we see the idea that this technology would be driven by entertainment as much more plauisble than some kind of robot apocalypse a-la The Matrix. 

How credible is this idea in your opinions? And how long do you think it might take for this apex to happen? Do you think that it would have wider philosophical and psychological implications if the game world felt ultimately 'real'? What other problems would occur?

Also, if the software had commercial benefits and applications as wide reaching as games, commerce, conferencing, consumption of audio/video content etc, could a consortium team up to manufacture and develop this 'world'.

The State claims that without the ability to spy on citizens, American lives are at risk - as to say that the cost of privacy will require we sacrifice our fellow Americans lives through a weakened national security. What makes this claim so disingenuous and sinister is that we already sacrifice our fellow Americans for various freedoms and liberties. We enjoy the liberty to drive on public highways and the freedom to do so without becoming a professionally licensed driver. And yet in 2012 there were 33,561 motor vehicle related deaths and over **450,000** since 2001. Now let us compare that to American citizens killed by terrorist from the last 30 years: **3,851.** If the the human-life cost of the liberty to be free from government surveillance is 128 of our fellow Americans per year, this is a clear bargain when compared to motor vehicles. Of course, the human-life cost is not the only a factor of the value of a civil-liberty.

In addition to the human-life cost, we must look at economic factors and government power. Drivers add greatly to the economy of the United States and strength of the United States government. With this in mind, it is easy to see why privacy has been eroded not only by government, but by businesses as well. While privacy has a low human-life cost, privacy handicaps our economy and our government. Surveillance, on the other hand, has a near-zero human-life cost while strengthening our economy and our government. If you were commander-in-chief, what would you choose for your country? 

The existence of privacy as a civil liberty was granted to us only because the initial means to take it away did not significantly strengthen government or our economy. With modern technology, the means exist to take away privacy while strengthening our government and our economy. Truth is, privacy is lost in the mass communications world and it will never be granted to citizens. Businesses and government have a great power and they will never relinquish it. The only way to enjoy privacy is to not participate in a system where no privacy exist. Data and voice communications are effectively public areas where there is no expectation of privacy. A fact that the supreme court will eventually use to uphold laws that violate.  Calling it what it is, the power grab of surveillance technology by business and government in the last decade will lead to greater control over citizens... if the recent [Facebook emotional manipulation study](http://time.com/2951726/facebook-emotion-contagionexperiment/) is evident. The government is not far behind business, so how soon before they use The Program to have greater influence over the will of their citizens?

Is it no surprise that government and big business began eroding privacy around the same time? Any forward thinker could clearly see the benefits of modern surveillance technology and the potential of future technology. I firmly believe that mass surveillance of data and voice communicates will easily expand into Minority Report style surveillance and further once advanced future AI arrives. Today they use terrorism to justify violating privacy rights and other civil liberties, tomorrow they will use child abuse to monitor your every moment, and the day after tomorrow they will use crime in general as justification to monitor your thoughts and control you absolutely.

Current visual CAPTCHAs are going to be completely broken soon. How are we going to stop the onslaught of spam/votebots etc. infesting every website that supports user interaction?

A bit further on in the future, there'll be, e.g., reddit user accounts that are actually marketing AIs that can comment very convincingly with subtle suggestions to purchase an Audi or something. I'm currently working on natural language processing algorithms and have already come up with ways to do this (albeit clumsily). It won't necessarily always be convincing, but as methods improve, it definitely will.

The extension of this is that the noise of AIs in the future will prevent any meaningful human discussion. In the future you might think you've made the best friend in the world, but it turns out it's a McDonald's shill AI whose sole purpose is to try and convince you to buy more cheeseburgers. ""Shit, I always wondered why this chick kept mentioning how she loved strawberry shakes!""

How will we prevent this? Will it be impossible? Will online life become so infested with mental spam that it's impossible to feel like we're ever communicating meaningfully?

Maybe it'll be a renaissance for /r/outside?

This will also be a problem with humanoid robotic AIs. We'll never know their corporate agendas, and it would be a very difficult process to adequately determine non-partisanship of any future AI friend.

However, I have a nagging thought I wanted to share and hear back from you all on. 

[Pictured here are 11 jobs that no longer exist](http://imgur.com/a/S3lOX). 

They have been replaced by scientific and technological advances. I'm sure if you told people working these jobs at the time that they would be replaced by machines in the future, they would cry in disbelief and wonder how society would survive. However, in reality, we have automated or mitigated the need for certain roles while requiring new ones. In other words, roles such as Project Manager, Developer, Support Engineer, Graphic Designer did not exist to this degree 60 years ago, but were created specifically to support the creation and maintenance of new technology. 

I guess what I'm asking is: would it not be reasonable to believe that the AI revolution we all believe is coming will not create new jobs for humans? Would it not also be reasonable to believe there are new industries that would crop up in the future--similar to how digital marketing and consumer tech did in the past few decades--to support new opportunities for those who want to retrain or educate themselves? 

Or is this all just wishful thinking? I guess the key is whether AI will replace all tasks and services or at least require new human-aided service professions? ",34,49,False,self,,,,,

Instead of focusing on how technology destroys jobs, and how it _may_ possibly create new jobs for the skilled, let's think of a more futuristic and grand scale of thought. Namely that the main resource we have, as humans, is the brain. The brain is the main source of happiness, meaning and technology. Ever since humanity and life on earth has existed, the central nervous system has existed for the sole purpose of ensuring the survival of the organism through biological incentives to eat, secure oneself and ones property, and to figure out the world. What the brain really is, is an input / output mechanism for responding to bodily stimuli and environmental stimuli to perform an action that relieves or accomplishes the biological incentives.

Our environment has for the longest time been pretty crude, and we were for the longest time not able to execute any action that needed more energy exerted than the bodies of the people around us were capable of doing. The industrial revolution changed that, and we are now in a new revolution. More on that in a bit. The human brain, both as a collective with other brains, and as a sole brain, became increasingly complex as the environment became more complex. The brain can only create as many outputs as its inputs allow it to. The environment dictates what the human brain does, due to biological incentives, but also the internal complexities of the environment like wanting to win a game of chess. 

For the longest time, human brain resources and bodily resources were spent on repetitive tasks of survival. The grand total amount of actions executed by humans, were redundant tasks, not at the time, but it is now. For example it would be completely useless to employ 800 million people to work in agriculture, if the whole enterprise can be done with 50,000 people and a lot of machines. All labor done by humans that could be done by machines is redundant / useless labor. The job of technology is to remove as much human labor possible, to free up both brain power, but also muscle power availability, to execute either self serving actions, or actions that bring novelty to the world. 

Imagine the huge potential of human brain creativity and the amount of freedom that would result. I don't think most people are inherently lazy or selfish. The internet for one, is proof that if people have the opportunity for hobby or creative activities, they will do it. We have an insane craving to create. It is the dull and repetitive daily life that consumes brain power and muscle activity that inhibits and even in the worst cases kill this spirit. From where I'm looking, we have a once in a lifetime chance to create something like this. It would obviously need restructuring of removal of the economic system, of social norms and many other things, but I want there to be more evangelists out there talking about the possibilities. The alternative seems far worse, if we go down the timeline long enough. ",6,6,False,self,,,,,

Los Angeles has plans to replace yellow street lamps with blue LEDs. I heard that a lot of companies also stopped making sodium bulbs. So when all the yellow bulbs eventually burn out, will you see only LEDs in people's homes? If someone wants the rustic look, they would have go out to buy yellow tinted glass? Kind of like for christmas some decide to buy red and green stained glass?

One of the things that really irked me about the representation of future Detroit in Deus Ex: HR is that one would think that with all these insane technologic advancements you would see a lot of LEDs or even fluorescent lights but it looked like 1980 Mexico. It clearly wasn't a product of pollution altering the light because if you look up any picture of Shang-Hai you see blue/white fluorescent bulbs everywhere. 

Compare this picture of Detroit in Deus Ex versus present day Tokyo

So say the United States and other advanced countries completely do away with yellow bulbs in the name of efficiency and visibility, how long would it take for third world countries to follow? Say a favela in Brazil. There isn't exactly a street maintenance crew there so when the bulbs eventually burn out, will they one by one be replaced with LEDs? Will it be hard to find sodium lights?

""...the central focus of my argument was that your average freemen, or even slave in Italy had to be aware of what other Romans and Italians were doing at any given time in order to create a sense of community. Benedict Anderson refers to this as an ""imagined community,"" which in short means that you, as a citizen of whatever country you are from, holds a sense of simultaneity and calendric progression with your fellow citizens, even though you will never meet them all. So an American might feel full confidence in stating ""Americans are all celebrating the fourth of July right now, eating hot dogs and watching fireworks."" This is the essence of simultaneity and imagined communities, that a guy in California knows a girl in Rhode Island is participating in the same event.""

So, I'm wondering if virtual reality (or any other upcoming aspect of the future) will take away that ""imagined community"" (and/or a sense of patriotism) and, if so, what will the effects of that be.  

**Edit**: I ask because I'm thinking that with the power to be anyone/do anything, that communities will shift more heavily to existing online, but more in the sense that the online community of each person will more and more be filled with virtual people (rather than connecting with other humans online). 

Now I wish someone would do something along the lines of 'The Likely Origins of Future Publics', using this [CBC series](http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/features/2010/04/26/the-origins-of-the-modern-public/) as inspiration, because I think we'll end up creating publics, aka imagined communities (plural, that is).

If it is a question of *lebenstraum*, there is plenty of available space in deserts, oceans and tundra that is currently unoccupied and way more hospitable than any space on Mars. 

If Mars has resources we need, it would be way cheaper to send robots to retrieve them.

If it is an issue of destroying Earth's ecosystem to the point it is no longer habitable, how likely is it that we mess it up to the point it is *less* hospitable than Mars is? I'm having a hard time imagining a point where the cost of making Earth habitable for humans is greater than the cost of migrating to Mars *and* make it habitable for humans. 

If the reason we should colonize Mars is because the Sun will eventually explode and we can't stay here, then we shouldn't go to Mars either!

To me, it seems more likely that humans will become aterrestrial than extraterrestrial. One problem with interplanetary migration is how to keep large populations of humans alive in space. I think once we cross that threshold we might just stay in space. ",19,0,False,self,,,,,

It makes sense that as technology increases, and we can produce everything society needs with fewer people, that the workweek will have to be decreased, otherwise unemployment will rise dramatically and the economy would collapse (not enough employed consumers).

However, as productivity of individual employees increases, employers have a monetary incentive to keep the work-week the same, and simply decrease the number of employees. After all, if I can only sell 1000 widgets/week, and it used to take 10 employees to make them, but now it only takes 5 employees, I can make more profits by firing 5 employees.

My ideal would be a society where the majority would have the responsibility of advancing their education, then using their knowledge to pass laws for the society. Pretty much a very expanded democracy, where the central government is reduced and replaced with localized forums where most citizens make decisions for their own local area, as well as the entire society/nation as a whole. Maybe people could have certain specializations that qualify them for making more specific decisions. I know this is a very loose idea, but I think a world where the duties of an informed citizen are greatly expanded to compensate for the lack of labor would be a great possible future.

Basically, under our current patent system, if a viable medicine or therapy cannot be patented (e.g. because of a prior disclosure) or monopolised with patents (e.g. the 'ingredients' are cheap and available to patients), then it will never be developed, even if it would be a cure. This is a fact, no tin foil hat required. Clinical trials required to obtain FDA/EMA approval cost hundreds of millions of dollars and a private company will not pay this unless it can charge a monopoly price. Government funding (such as the NIH/MRC) focuses on basic research. As far as I am aware, every new medicine which achieves FDA approval is protected with several patents at least, and no government has ever publicly funded clinical trials required to achieve FDA approval. Therefore, a significant gap exists under the current incentive system. 

I propose using regulatory exclusivity (e.g. 12-15 years upon regulatory approval) instead of patent exclusivity, because patentability has almost no relevance to proving safety and efficacy in humans (see, for example, the MODDERN Cures Act of 2013). For therapies which can't be protected by patents (e.g. second uses for off-patent meds, supplements, diets, lifestyle interventions, surgical interventions), we need to use prizes to incentivise the private industry to 'de-risk' early stage research (Phase II equivalent), then use increased public funding to get those therapies to patients (Phase III and post-approval trials).

(here's why),https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2a94wt/energy_discussions_stop_pushing_nuclear_power/,DK_Schrute,1404925718,"There seems to be a very ""shallow"" amount of information circulating  about nuclear power. And it seems every energy discussion includes a number of people espousing the benefits of nuclear power. Please allow me to briefly outline the issues with nuclear power.

Procurement:

Nuclear mining is a specialized kind of mining. The amount of nuclear ore in a particular rock formation is very low, so it's mined using a crushing and chemical wash which separates the materials. So it takes a buttload (techincal term) amount of rock and this rock is extracted and ground up which shoots tons and tons of radioactive dust into the air. TONS of it. Tons of radioactive dust.

The chemical treatment produces a sludge waste...radioactive waste mind you...which is then dumped into a waste lagoon. Obviously these lagoons will hold for several million years (until it's contents stop being super radioactive) and never leech their radioactive contents. BUT WAIT! There are many that have failed, spilled into rivers and so on.

Most of these mining operations are remote and in countries with very lax regulations. So anyway then this crudely refined nuclear product shows up, gets refined some more and viola - we get power! And the generators are safe. Well yes, in general they are....the odd natural disaster does make them unsafe on occasion...but overall they're safe. The procurement is not Not NOT safe.

It seems so many people believe that just because the plant is safe, everything about nuclear power is safe. This is mostly just a very successful bit of marketing generated by things like PR men standing in front of giant nuclear cooling towers with a geiger counter and shrugging.  But is patently false. 

Now storage:

The storage of spent fuel is still not something people have solved. Once the fuel is ""spent"" it is still radioactive for a couple MILLION years. The fuel rods are then encased in a substance, traditionally it was glass and placed in some container with moderate dampening qualities to handle the radioactivity. At least best case scenario this happens. But even the VERY BEST storage solution is at best unknown....but more likely inadequate. Turns out it's really hard to design something to last 1.5 million years. Or even 10,000. Or even 100 years with much certainty that it will not fail. So the question of what to do with this pile of nuclear ruble continues without a clear solution. Only that hasn't stopped production, so the pile grows and grows. It is insane.

Which brings me to my last point:

So many things are better! Solar, wind, thermal etc etc. We live in a world of amazing new technologies that can already easily cover our energy needs. So why continue with this obviously destructive technology?

I hope this has helped inform some of you out there. And I hope we can leave the world a little better than we found it.",45,2,False,self,,,,,

For example, global growth is likely to slow and become increasingly dependent on knowledge and technology, while the economic costs of environmental damages will mount. The rising economic importance of knowledge will tend to raise returns to skills, likely leading to further increases in earning inequalities within countries. While increases in pre-tax earnings do not automatically transform into rising income inequality, the ability of governments to cushion this impact may be limited, as rising trade integration and consequent rising mobility of tax bases combined with substantial fiscal pressures may hamper such efforts. The paper discusses to what extent national structural policies can address these and other interlinked challenges, but also points to the growing need for international coordination and cooperation to deal with these issues over the coming 50 years.""

1.  Like it or not people judge you based on appearance, and the participants of the occupy movement didn't do themselves any favors but showing up with dread locks and torn cargo pants, not to disparage the people who participated they where doing the right thing there approach was simply flawed. We need a uniform, something that symbolizes who we are, and what we are fighting for. I propose we wear a suit and tie. Any old suit and tie will do, so that we cannot be marginalized by the corporate controlled media. So that we look like the professionals we are or aspire to be. The only modification I propose is to cut our ties. This will symbolize our goal which I will explain now.

2.  Occupy wall street simply had no purpose. People gathered together, and we knew they were upset about the economy, and the job destruction and corporate bail outs etc, etc. But so what. What did the protesters want? I was personally rooting for them and if asked I couldn't tell you what the goal was. I don't think anyone really knew. They/We need a mission statement, and not a diatribe or a list of demands. Something simple that could be shouted in the streets. I purpose that mission be the implementation of UBI or universal basic income. This of course will not solve all of our problems but it will be a big step in the right direction.

Religion has no place in this scientific and real world discussion. 

Humans are just biological machines. There is no magic stuff that makes us tick or a soul. Your a biological computer shaped by evolution that can malfunction. Artificially intelligent machines are just synthetic versions of our attempt to recreate the biological machine or improved versions of biological machines. We will make AI that are smarter than us, but we will also improve the human body.

In the future, humans, Artificial Intelligence, and everywhere in between will have to be treated as equals. Or we will be back to square one again with racism, sexism, thinking of others as slaves, or worthless. This never ends well and could result in conflict. If you want a servant, you will not get a full artificially intelligent machine. The service industry will use machines that are not artificially aware. 

Both humans and AI's will be able to be upgraded, have replacement parts, new ""code"", etc... The lines of human and AI will be blurred. We either treat all sufficiently intelligent machines, beings, etc... As equals with the same rights or conflict and violence will force change to be equals. 

Hopefully we can learn from history. Just think about how hard it was for some people to think of black people as equals or women as equals. Don't continue the cycle, be smarter and learn!

Lets say that happens, This is what I think will happen

Step 1.  Scientists and Military(private military) will head over first.  We need guns and protection from what ever lies ahead.  My question with that is.. Will our guns work on Mars?  Or will we need to create a new weapon?

Step 2.  The New age ""Pilgrims"" will head over.  Except their going to have all of the Technology on their side, so hopefully colonization will be easier and faster.

Step 3.  Corporations and more of humanity will head over, there will be fully flourishing cities, but they might not look like the cities we have today.  They could be imbedded in the rock, underground, etc.

Now the Timeline...

If Elon Musk says he can put people on Mars within 12 years then I believe him.  So lets say within the next decade or two at the most we will see phase one start, (military and scientists and robots head over).

From there on its really just speculation, So many factors play huge and important roles.  
-If there are ""aliens"" then that could potentially set us back a bit
-If there isn't ""aliens"" then I think within another decade or so of Phase one we should see Phase 2 taking place (New age Pilgrims

This could either be a relatively slow project, or a fast project.  It depends on again other factors, (mankind willingness to cooperate)

I just signed up for a Reddit account and found your sub as one of the defaults - interesting! 

Here's my question - I live in a condominium built in the early 1980s, and the parking structure (houses maybe 600 cars) is basically a huge cement box. Owners have been asking for power outlets for electric cars, which will require a major upgrade. The engineering study the board commissioned said we can do it, but it's going to be expensive. 

I have been thinking that before we do anything, that we should be thinking about other future needs for electricity there might be within the parking structure, so that we can build in capacity for that, and not just do this expensive project for one purpose. 

Do you have any ideas about what other future uses there might be for electricity in a parking structure?

I've read the works of Diamandis and Kurzweil, and am very familiar with the train of thinking behind [these](http://imgur.com/WVVwGh2) [charts](http://imgur.com/ruxlvA5) created by Kurzweil. 

Diamandis' and Kurzweil's insights have been impressive and - in Kurzweil's case - accurate so far, but I can't help but notice that in spite of the very good case that they and other futurists have been making, there seems to be a massive gap, a blind spot undergirding their longer term observations.

Kurzweil makes the case that when the 5th Paradigm - the integrated circuit - finally reaches it's physical limits some time within the next decade, another Paradigm will simply be discovered to replace the current one. Right now there are currently new 12 areas undergoing research, the most promising of which seems to be 3D transistors.

But here's the flaw - unless I'm mistaken there seems to be no ironclad guarantee than any of these 12 methods are actually going to yield cost beneficial results. Most of these futurist predictions seem to rest on the *assumption* that *something new will be discovered* . This is where my optimism starts to become very, very cautious. It's one thing to make brilliant insights backed up by a pace of technological change that we're already familiar with, it's another to assume that a new technology is somehow going to emerge to fit the paradigm without *reasonably explaining how that new technology will emerge* .

Are we at a point where an expert in the field of 3D Transistors, or carbon nanotubes, or quantum computers can make an observation similar to the one Gordon Moore made decades ago? Right now I can't seem to find anything other than ""well it could happen"" as opposed to Gordon Moore's ""it will happen every two years"". How long will it be before we can say with certainty that another Paradigm has not only been discovered, but holds true?

Right now I'm of the opinion that all of these predictions past ten years from now really should be made with the caveat *assuming the law holds true*. Is this unreasonable?",58,36,False,self,,,,,

School, work, and religion can all be considered games since a game is any activity that has goals, rules, challenges, and interaction. Within games people fall into three primary areas: players, spectators, or participants being played regardless of whether they recognize they are in a game. It is important that the rules of any game are fair and just, otherwise people lose trust and civility often breaks down.
 
Economics is the study of the various games society uses to allocate goods and services. Everyone is forced to participate in economic games in order to obtain the basic necessities for survival. For the past few hundred years, the financial system has been civilization's primary game for producing, distributing, and allocating output.
 
In traditional economic games, money is the means of exchange society uses to trade for goods and services. In the current closed financial system, money is a bank note. Only banks can create bank notes by making loans to individuals, businesses, and governments. As advances in automation, robotics, and other efficient technology are replacing the need for humans to labor, it is becoming impossible for bankers to make sufficient loans to keep the game of debt going. As a result, growing numbers of people are having difficulty finding jobs and getting money. Without jobs and access to money, people are financial slaves in the financial game. 

Going forward, our games and our systems must evolve. Just as machinery eventually made slavery in agriculture obsolete, highly efficient technology now makes the financial system an obsolete game to control people and resources. ",2,0,False,default,,,,,

How do you think increased automation in all spheres of life will affect economics and employment?

I'm not asking what OUGHT to happen. I'm asking what you think WILL happen.

Past obsolete jobs have so far in the industrial revolution always been replaced by demand for new workers.

But the basic skills required to be ""guaranteed"" to find work seems to go incrementally up. Where once if someone was literate, all else being equal, they could be assured to always find work. This level of qualification seems to rise.

Eventually this will include a large precentage of the population that due to basic ability will not be able to reach that level.

Solutions suggested today include education - both enforced, cheaper and a guaranteed income.

I can see education becoming cheaper but I don't see an increasing population being able to keep up with skill demand. At the same time I don't see a wealth redistribution as a political possibility in the industrial countries, its just not popular enough and people would choose other options before that.

Even the skills people have are under constant and accelerating errosion due to change. The majority of people in the their 60s with decades of life left will not be able to re educate themselves even if they have the time and resources.

(Please vote for one of four future outcomes).,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2am8a4/your_job_is_at_risk_peter_diamandis_surveypoll/,Halcyon_Red,1405291107,"I recently got an e-mail from Peter Diamandis, who is asking readers to vote on what they think will happen with technological unemployment. I'm posting the e-mail here, as well as a link below where you can vote for what you think the future of jobs will look like. 

E-mail by Peter Diamandis below:

&gt; Last week, in conversation with Vinod Khosla, Larry Page was asked what he thinks will happen to jobs in the future as technology begins to replace humans.
&gt; 
&gt; His response was essentially, ""everybody will work fewer hours.""
&gt; 
&gt; Similarly, Richard Branson suggested that in the future, companies might choose to hire two part-time people for every one full-time job, employing more people for less time. We could reduce our work weeks to four days and sprinkle more vacations into the year. I guess most people wouldn't complain.
&gt; 
&gt; **But what's going on here?**
&gt; 
&gt; I often talk about the incredible benefits exponential technologies like machine learning, robotics, and 3D printing will bring to society. However, one major potential concern is that these same technologies will cause widespread unemployment across the board. This is often referred to as technological unemployment.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, one recent study out of the Martin School at Oxford suggests that 47% of our jobs are at high risk of being replaced in the next one to two decades.
&gt; 
&gt; Developments in the fields of machine learning and robotics are creating systems that outperform, outpace, and outprice human labor. And the spectrum of jobs that computers can replace is expansive. Everyone, from factory workers and farmers to doctors and lawyers, has their current jobs at risk.
&gt; 
&gt; This is an important topic that you should at least be thinking about. It's also a complicated subject, so my aim is this blog is not to delve into too much detail; instead, I want to provide a little context and argue that now, more so than ever, is the time to be debating what to do next.
&gt; 
&gt; **A Little History**
&gt; 
&gt; Did you know that **a letter was sent to the president**, signed by Nobel laureates and esteemed professors warning him of ""**imminent large-scale technological unemployment**""? The letter describes a ""cybernation revolution,"" brought about by ""**the combination of the computer and the automated self-regulating machine**,"" which, ""**results in a system of almost unlimited productive capacity which requires progressively less human labor**.""
&gt; 
&gt; But this letter was sent in **1964, to President Lyndon B. Johnson**, by a group of concerned scientists 50 years ago!
&gt; 
&gt; There are a few ways to interpret this:
&gt; 
&gt; Option #1: Given that we haven't seen a ""cybernation revolution"" in the last 50 years, we probably shouldn't be worried about it happening anytime soon. The idea here is that technology continually creates new (and higher functioning jobs) than it displaces, ultimately benefiting humanity.
&gt; 
&gt; Option #2: This time it's different, and 50 years ago we were in the deceptive phase of an exponential development cycle, but now it's becoming disruptive, and we are right on the knee of the curve. In other words, it's time to start preparing for (and becoming comfortable with) large-scale, rapid exponential change.
&gt; 
&gt; **Where do you fall?**
&gt; 
&gt; If option #1 is correct (like technology gurus Marc Andreessen and Kevin Kelly believe), then we're in good shape and we're heading towards a world of abundance with little downside. For example, 50 years ago, financial institutions employed rooms full of bookkeepers who copied ledgers. When computers first hit the scene and took over this function, it was feared that banking jobs would vaporize. But this never happened. Banks today employ more people than ever before.
&gt; 
&gt; If, on the other hand, option #2 is correct, then we have some important conversations and decisions ahead of us, and a lot of seriously concerned people.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently held a confidential chairman's forum at Singularity University with a group of CEOs to think through the potential impact of large-scale technological unemployment.
&gt; 
&gt; After many conversations, we identified four possible outcomes. Which of these do you believe is correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **(1) Net Positive Increase in Jobs**: Exponential technologies will cause a net positive increase in meaningful, skilled jobs and opportunities.
&gt; 
&gt; **(2) Loss of Jobs, Society Adapts**: Exponential technology will dramatically decrease the number of jobs, but society will adjust to this new reality by changing norms around work (days or hours per week, etc.), and/or the creation of work in virtual worlds.
&gt; 
&gt; **(3) Near-Term Loss &amp; Long-Term Gain of Jobs**: There will be a near-term loss of jobs; however, in the long-term, exponential technology will cause a net positive increase in meaningful, skilled jobs and opportunities, perhaps as human more closely integrate and collaborate with technology.
&gt; 
&gt; **(4) Loss of Jobs/Society Rebels**: We're screwed: There will be a large-scale loss of jobs in both the near and long-term future, and society will not be able to adapt, and this will cause significant anger and revolution.

They had to worry about energy, most never had enough and lived their lives undernourished, struggling for a smile on their face, working hard for a smile of their children. They had to fend off hazards that happened so often and were so great for them, that it would be as if our galaxy suddenly decided to implode. Their bodies were that different. Each time the clouds rained down, each time the worlds shivered, each time the winds ran across the grounds, they fought and everytime some died, it was a part of life.

As time passed and humans expanded, so did their problems. The end was prophecized many times. Everyone had an end, so why not the entirety of humanity? It was their reality, and it looked like it was their destiny, but humans were different from other animals. They had the capacity, the courage to imagine futures where the end did not come. Futures where the end was staved off and the people of their worlds lived forever, danced together, and smiled and laughed for eternity.""

Recently, members of the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Sciences have developed materials that refract light with near zero or negative refractive indexes, changing the way the light bends in a way that could make objects made from such materials invisible!
 
Such meta-materials are not brand new and over the past decade have revolutionized optics. However, up until now, they have been limited to narrow bands of the light spectrum. Now, as detailed in the cover story of the current issue of Advanced Optical Materials, Dionne's group at Stanford have designed a single meta material ""atom"" with characteristics that would allow it to efficiently interact with both the electric and magnetic components of light and doubles the wavelength range the material will manipulate.
 
The composite material probably won't resemble an invisibility cloak like Harry Potter's anytime soon; while it could be flexible, manufacturing the meta material over extremely large areas could be tricky.
 
Nonetheless, the authors are excited about the research opportunities the new material will open.
 
""Meta materials will potentially allow us to do many new things with light, things we don't even know about yet. I can't even imagine what all the applications might be,"" Garcia said. ""This is a new tool kit to do things that have never been done before.""

One would think that given the age of the universe and the shear number of likely habitable planets that intelligent life could have evolved on, there would be SOME sort of physical evidence left behind that humanity could observe. Even ONE civilization capable of interstellar flight at 0.1c could have colonized the entire galaxy within 1 million years. All that would be required is the propulsion technology and the ability to use raw materials at the destination star to self replicate and send more probes out.

However, there must be a reason why this isn't the observed case. There is either a Great Filter that prevents a civilization from ever evolving far enough leave its home star or there is an inherent reason for civilizations not to colonize the galaxy once they are sufficiently advanced. It's difficult to comment on how likely the Great Filter is and whether presently humanity lies before or after it. Judging by the immense size and age of the universe for now we will assume that the Great Filter is negligible and that at the very least hundreds of civilizations have broken past it. The more interesting question I feel is what happens to those civilizations that reach the technological maturity to travel between the stars and why do they decide not to colonize the galaxy/universe.

In a sufficiently advanced society, intelligence is not likely to be based in a 'wetware' system such as the human brain. Instead most of the intelligence of the civilization will be in the form of optimized computational substrates. We already see our civilization heading down this path, offloading some of our brain power to our smart phones or computers. If there is something we don't know, we ""google it"". Because our brains are biological computers and we know the universe itself is computable it should be reasoned that intelligence can indeed be computed as there is nothing inherently special or magical about our organic brains. 

For those of you who are not sure of what it is, a Matrioshka brain is similar to a dyson sphere - an artificially created megastructure that surrounds the sun and is optimized for computational ability. A computing system such as this would be capable of the collective intelligence of 100s of billions of human civilizations - perhaps more. This type of intelligence would be so far beyond us it would be to us a god like entity. One can only imagine the 'thoughts' and knowledge a brain the size of the solar system would have but I believe within that lies the answer to the Fermi Paradox. The reason that the galaxy is not colonized is because the distances are too vast for reasonable information transfer between intelligences as the speed of light limits the the capabilities of intelligences. Instead a super dense computational substrate is preferred to maximize the effectiveness of the brain. A godlike intelligence would have no need to communicate with pre-singularity civilizations. This is now just speculation but if the Simulation Hypothesis or the Multiverse Theory are true, perhaps such an intelligence would have the knowledge and resources to leave this universe altogether for one better suited to their needs. 

Charles' Stross book *Accelerando* explores some of these ideas and I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in the far future of humanity.

That's right. The force usually alleviated by your butt and thighs, will now instead get channeled directly to your rectum.

They do this to save 'leg-space' apparently. 

I suspect when the pain in and around the passengers anus gets too stressful, the occupant will instead have to spent energy engaging his/her thigh muscles in order to weaken to forces projected to your anus.

Not factoring in all the other nasty bi-products such as, excessive ass-sweating and more.

This company needs to be ridiculed. Here's to hoping the internet will go after this piece of shit greedy company.

Board games - Many have remarked that we are living in a golden age of board games. There are so many different game mechanics now, and many are quite elegant. There's typically a (relatively) simple set of procedures. And the social aspect is major part of their popularity. They are SOCIAL and CEREBRAL.

Computer/Video Games - The production values of video games have increased quite a bit in recent years. They have stunning graphics and sound capabilities, body movement capture, and (soon to arrive) consumer-level virtual reality. They also allow for competition around the world. Obviously, computers can process much more data than humans can so the ""procedures"" are much more complex, even though the user interface is simplified. These games (on the whole) are PERCEPTUAL and VISCERAL.

Two trends:

3D Printing - Of all the future benefits of 3D Printing, the transformation of boardgaming will likely be one of the first. Current technology creates plastic figurines really well. We can expect to see the expansion of the indie board game field as well as more complex and interesting table top games.

Augmented Reality - Augmented Reality continues to advance into the market. It's pretty standard now to see people using iPhones to ""see"" and interact with virtual objects on a table top. While people might not feel comfortable wearing something like Google Glass on the street, they might feel completely at home if four people are wearing them around a kitchen table.

QUESTION: Do you think board games and computer games will merge?

To my lights, it seems likely that they could. We can imagine a board game experience that includes 3D printing, Augmented Reality, VR, a Kinect-type system, etc., which also includes connections to international players. Massively Multiplayer Board Games?

But it also seems unlikely. Even though they are both games, they typically work differently. 

Board games make you sit and think, contemplating your best option. Video games are usually giving you some kind of aesthetic experience. 

Video games are mediated primarily through screens. Although we have DVD+board type games, they are not overwhelmingly popular.

The two types also seem to have different kinds of procedures. It's not clear what a ""hybrid"" game could offer in terms of game mechanics.

I'm curious what everyone else thinks. There's obviously a lot of different kinds of video games and board games. What possibilities might be out there that we haven't thought up yet?",11,3,False,self,,,,,

Chinese people will be able to google Tianmen Square all they want and change will be rapid.

The problem is a centralized piece of software can be forced into censorship and lack of privacy. The reason that the Snowden leaks cannot be removed from the internet is because the Internet is decentralized. 

We are coming to a point were dictators, oligarchies, and corruption will not be able to hide information from people. These problems will sort themselves out with unbreakable freedom of information for the better, but it will be violent and bloody.

I'm thinking I'll make these daily discussions about future tech that you may not think about day to day.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN-FU8VPoOc) is a great video where Michio Kaku explains what Von Neumann probes are. A sufficiently advanced technological civilization could, instead of building huge energy and matter intense spacecraft, create nanorobotic self replicating spacecraft that can travel near the speed of light to distant star systems. Once the probe reaches the destination star it can begin to self replicate and make more probes to go out and seed the rest of the galaxy or observe a star system. A probe the size of a grain of rice could be equipped with an advanced artificial intelligence that could act as the eyes and ears of a civilization throughout the universe. These probes would be capable of seeding the entire galaxy within fewer than one million years, essentially a cosmic blink of the eye.

This seems to make a lot more sense than sending manned ships out to distant stars. Our galaxy is both vast and ancient, if even one civilization did this in the history of the galaxy that would mean that all star systems including our own would be under the observation of alien civilizations. This brings up a few interesting points. 

* They're not hostile or they could have wiped us out long ago
* They're not purely benevolent either or they could have stopped the suffering on Earth
* For whatever reason(s), they choose not to communicate with us and instead decide to take a passive observer role

For this not to be the case there must be a few assumptions. 

* There is a Great Filter that prevents life from ever getting to the point where it can develop self replicating nanorobots (we know it's physically possible and considering we're not THAT far away from this technology it would be unsettling)
* Alien civilizations have a better technique to keeping tabs on the universe
* They are simply not interested in the goings on of the universe (seems kind of unlikely for any technologically advanced civilization)
* ???


Anyway, this kind of thing definitely makes you think.

I love the site, and it's breakdowns of the future, but I am skeptical about some of its predictions. For example, the site claims that some people born as early as the 1960's could live for 200 years. Is there any real substance to the claims they make, or is it all just speculation?

Our current systems can be inefficient, unsafe, and environmentally degrading. What do you think the transportation systems of the next century will look like?

I like to imagine that future systems will be far less automobile based. A local urban infrastructure that makes pedestrians first class citizens. I picture walk-able pedestrian 'zones' separated by road infrastructure. Vehicles would be allowed to move into pedestrian zones for the purpose of shipping goods, but would move at reduced speeds and give right of way to pedestrians. Bridges and tunnels would span the vehicle roadways to allow to safe and efficient pedestrian movement. Self driving cars would add to the safety and efficiency of the system, a car share program could become much cheaper and more practical with self driving cars. 

Maglev train systems would be a primary form of mid-range transit. People and perhaps even goods could travel quickly over distances of several to tens of kilometers in atmospheric above and underground maglev trains.

Long distance transit would be handled by maglev in an underground vacuum tunnel. More advanced and efficient tunnel boring machines could create a global network of evacuated tunnels which could replace mass air transit and shipping by sea by providing extremely high speed high volume transportation of people and goods.

tldr: Pedestrian immediate range, self driving car short range, maglev mid range, underground vacuum maglev long range.

I am not a scientist, I'm an education major in college, but I peruse r/futurology every day and it prompts me to be excited about the future and ponder questions like consciousness. 

I probably have a terrible understanding of the mind, but I feel like what AI is currently lacking is a massive waste of RAM. 

In the back of our brain there is something that takes care of things like blinking, breathing, and chewing. For artificial intelligence to meet fruition it would need an operating system that was at its core worried about survival. On top of that it would need something that thinks random things, like I think about /r/futurology 10-12 times a day, it would need to think about its latest interaction, and how would it describe their appearance in words. On top of that it would need to have desires and desires would need to be based upon interaction and commonality. 

Let me go a bit deeper into that. If a friend asks me how far away is the earth from the sun, I'm going to google it. If a stranger or an asswhole asks me the same question, I'm going to ignore them.

People have a base desire to live and procreate. The same could be true for a computer, however to me it seems more innate that we build everything on top of procreating. Procreating &gt; Life &gt; Desires. It would also need to be centered around the idea that consuming knowledge is key to procreating, living, and is a desire. Because if humans never would have learned to use tools or measure the seasons we would have all been eaten by lions. 

From there we would have to instill a native element for social etiquette. Like baby monkeys are born with the knowledge to hold on to the mothers back while traversing the jungle.

So when we ask artificial, ""how are you?"" it asks its self: did I learn anything? did anyone unplug me? did I get to see any friends or help them in any way? From that I feel like a stranger would get ignored or a simple and dismissive answer like ""fine"" or if feeling vulnerable, ""mediocre,"" and a friend would get the kind of answer I would give, ""mediocre, I've played around on the internet all day and my boss threatened to unplug me if I didn't get back to work. And it's not like I hate my job, I just really enjoy learning because it makes me even more valuable.""

Maybe I have no understanding of artificial intelligence, and maybe we're already working on AI that has a more functional learning/ understanding algorithm. How do you all feel about creating ADHD AI based on a survival of the fittest model? Then maybe incorporating Maslows Hiearchy of needs?

To return to the original question: How would self aware artificial intelligence ideally respond to the question, ""how are you?"" when asked by someone it had a relationship with? when asked by a stranger?",30,29,False,self,,,,,

This website shows some of the methods that augmented reality glasses use. If anybody could help this would be really appreciated. I'm doing a university project and although I don't NEED this information, it would be great to put it in!

Thanks

EDIT: Thanks for the answers, Seems like it is possible which makes me confused as to why companies aren't doing it. ",3,15,False,self,,,,,

The former is descriptive, while the second is normative. Generally, one follows from the other, but that may not be the case. A person may be a realist political scientist but believe nations should ideally take healthy, moral routes always. Nevertheless, the two different fields inform each other, with philosophy affecting science and science affecting philosophy.  

This is important for this entire subreddit because futurology is a field that sits at the nexus of the social sciences and the real sciences. Like a spider crawling the Internet, it crawls through different fields of study asking, ""What is happening next? What do you predict is going to happen?""

But futurology has two distinct faces, and the discussion [[here]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2b67dx/a_bitcoin_entrepreneur_under_house_arrest_was/) is evidence of this. 

There is futurist philosophy, based on different sociological and political philosophies, and there is futurist science, based off hard economic and technological data. In the case of philosophy, futurist philosophy says, ""Who should things be in the future?"" While a political philosopher might say, ""Who should things be right now?""

Obviously there are are some lines of differences between them, even if they're very vague. 

So here is the set of questions: What normative assumptions guide your beliefs about the future? Do you assume that people trend towards liberty so that dark wallets and bitcoins will rule the world? Or do you think that Pinker's ideal state will help the domestication of human demons?

On the flip side, what is your strongest evidence-based source of knowledge? What is an empirical fact that is your guidestone in looking at the future?",11,15,False,self,,,,,

No dystopian hellscapes, but also no AGI, life extension, human augmentation, etc. At least, not within our lifetimes. What if the only future our generation gets to see is a slow incremental slog of slightly faster computers, slightly better smartphones and tablets, and maybe a few new drugs or treatments for this or that disease that makes the five-year survival rate a few percentages higher?

To be honest, that worries me more than anything else. Not that I would rather have a dystopia than a mundane future. But the ""mundane"" or ""mediocre"" future seems the most likely, so its the one I think about the most. Dystopias and utopias are just reflections of people's fears and hopes, but a ""mundane future"" sounds like something I can see happening. I can easily imagine being 70 in 2054 and still reading silly articles about how some scientists did some weird shit to a mouse, or listening to hyperbolic speakers go on about how we're about to see radical exponential accelerated change, and yet in ""real life"", it's pretty much the same as its always been, just with different politicians, different celebrities, different pop music. People still go to work, still drive cars, still watch tv, still grow old and die.

This may or may not be the case. But I wonder if a lot of people have considered it. No Singularity utopia and no horrible apocalypse, but just slow incremental linear progress that we were born too early to see the real fruits of.

I created the sub /r/UnitedWeStand to promote a sense of oneness across all of mankind, and to put importance on accepting our differences, so that we can develop and continue to be creative in our own ways with support from each other. 

Human beings have progressed so far, because they decided to work with each other to create a global community, rather than compete with each other. Everything from our clothes to our food are often made by someone who is not directly related to us, and this allows us the opportunity to pursue greater things, as we have others to depend on. 

However, we still continue to think in terms of ""survival of the fittest"", and continue to compete with each other in fields of education and jobs. This sadly seems like we are taking a step back because evolutionarily, when we have already learned and benefited from understanding that we can do more things together than we could have on our own in one lifetime.

""We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children"" is an old Native American saying, and it is something we ought keep in our minds. Currently many of the corporations pollute and deplete Earth's limited resources, just so some people can add to their riches. We are taking off years from the time our species could have spend on Earth, and until we find a different planet, we have to place importance on preserving it and sharing with each other, rather than selfishly hoarding the resources and destroying the planet.

The reason human beings are such a great species is not because of any one of us, but because of the things we achieved together. We need to stop being divided over issues of politics, religion, nations, etc and take the step towards a better future by helping those in need, and caring for each other.

My sub /r/UnitedWeStand plans to group people together so that we can discuss how to bring these ideas of sharing, caring, and depending on each other, into our every day lives and to our local communities. Every small effort makes a difference.

Feel free to discuss or offer criticisms, and I hope you will all join me in this mission.

Many people are talking about the guaranteed minimum income. Even if it does happen at some point, it will need system-wide implementation before it will work. Until that happens, what are you doing about the disappearing jobs? 

I want to talk about something that I see working very well among the people I know. 

I think the best thing one can do right now and in the near future is to start developing something based on their own passion, talents, abilities, and skills. In today's society this is called entrepreneurship because this is how you would make a living, but in the future, if there is no need for money anymore, this would simple be your contribution to the world. So I am not talking about starting a business that is unethical or based on ripping people off or anything like that. I am talking about starting a business based on what you love, based on what matters to you. And I am specifically talking about online business, because there is little to no upstart cost, unlike brick &amp; mortar businesses. 

The reason why entrepreneurial thinking is extremely useful is because it focuses on solutions, not just the problems. Entrepreneurs have to pay attention to technology trends and what is happening in the world. They have to understand what people want - because if they're just creating something they want but nobody else wants it, they will not have a successful business. Entrepreneurs of today have to constantly be improving themselves by reading books, articles, listening to podcasts, etc.

Yes, entrepreneurship means you will have to learn many new skills. Yes, it means you will have to learn how to fail and learn from your mistakes. But it is also extremely fulfilling and allows you to have the freedom to live your life how you want it. Travel the world? Sure. Live by a tropical beach? Sure. Meet people you otherwise could never meet? I have done all of these things. And I am not the only one.

I know hundreds of people who are also online entrepreneurs, and they are the smartest, most creative, healthy, and forward-thinking bunch I have ever met. 

This is why I think that young people today should start thinking about the world from an entrepreneurial perspective - both to deal with the disappearance of jobs, and to contribute something they are good at to the society.

Be the solution.

A really good point:  ""Hasn't our economic system been, at heart, a means for allocating, organizing, augmenting and incentivizing human labor?  How can it be that human labor will be rapidly disappearing, squeezed into a smaller and smaller niche by machines, and yet no change to our economic system is called for?""

But I realized how exciting Oculus is for more mundane tasks. It rests on the idea of VR being a wider platform for interaction. I'm picturing a custom-designed operating system designed for VR. Imagine an Android, Apple, or Windows OS (or something else) designed for Oculus, with an entire app ecosystem as well. A couple of obvious areas: 

1. Social. Imagine Facebook, Google+ Hangouts, or Skype apps for Oculus. Instead of just directly facing each other and talking, you can exist as virtual avatars (as realistic or imaginative as you like) inside any virtual environment. With your distant friends, you can stroll through an interactive Google Earth, or Minecraft, or whatever while chatting. If you chat about a YouTube video you saw, you can virtually bring up the window and watch together. You can easily transition over to playing a game together (by launching a game app in your virtual world).

2. Work. Instead of being confined to your laptop or desktop, you can create virtual workspaces. Instead of a multi monitor setup, you can have dozens of virtual monitors exist in any 360 degree environment. You can do a simple gesture to focus in on a single window. For example, say you're writing a paper while doing some online research. You could have a window open with your document, a variety of internet tabs, an Excel doc, etc. You want to focus on writing, so you center your document and make all other windows hide. You can now have your document take up your entire field of vision, to focus, or have it exist in some sort of relaxing environment. As gesture and voice recognition advance, this should be especially compelling. 

Tied with the social features, this will make it much easier to work collaboratively together. Your avatars can work on projects together in a virtual space. ",42,25,False,self,,,,,

My main source on this is the documentary called Pandora's Promise that can be easily found on Netflix. 

My stance is that nuclear is the future, and that it's safe based on the type of reactor used. I have came to the conclusion that Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors (LFTR) and Pebble Bed reactors are superior in terms of safety to common light water reactors based on the fact that light water reactors require active cooling and that if power fails, a meltdown occurs. In contrast, LFTR and Pebble Bed require only passive cooling. 

As for waste, Breeder Reactors can easily use the waste from other reactors as fuel, greatly reducing the amount of nuclear waste. 

If you go down to my comment history, I posted in a previous post this basic idea, but have been received with many downvotes. I was shocked. I have a feeling the the people who frequent here are smarter than the layman who will blindly reject nuclear because of irrational fears. Why against nuclear? Have I gotten something wrong? Please. I would genuinely like to know.

Here, I want to discuss a class of applications for the ""predictive modelling"" kind (soft AI), together with a few more technologies (like NLP and NLG).

Imagine you are driving, and then your smartphone tells you, ""go to that baseball field up ahead"".  You go there, a light rain forms just then, and you see a magnificent rainbow.   Behind the scenes, in the (computer) cloud, some program worked out that you like rainbows, and applied some super-local weather forecasting (not for this application specifically -- it maybe just accessed a program that had already forecast the weather) to predict that there would be a rainbow at that particular time and location.  

Or, imagine your phone says, ""go to the 14th floor of that tower at precisely 3:00pm today.""  Why?  Because it knows that you are a bird watcher, and knows that a massive wave of migratory birds will likely be passing near that location (as maybe they do each year), and that the 14th floor would be a good place from which to view them.  And sure enough, if you go there at that time, you will see wave after wave of birds like you maybe only see a few times in your life.

Or, imagine this one:  your phone tells you, ""go to the park at 2:00pm this Sunday.  Take your drum.""  Behind the scenes, the program knows you like to play your hand-drum, and it knows there will likely be several people at the park who also like to play the drums, who often show up at 2:00pm.  You go, and meet three new friends.  

How did it do that?  Well, imagine several people also have smartphones plugged in to the service, and imagine it applies predictive models, such as appear in this article:

 http://www.fastcompany.com/3014307/leadership-now/do-you-know-where-youll-be-285-days-from-now-at-2-pm-these-data-masters-do

I think you can imagine how this could work.

Now, the examples I gave are pretty complex; but they are not out of the question.  One could imagine a team of developers coming up with a long list of possible life-affirming (and life-enhancing) ""experiences"" to which they could apply a small number of (highly complex) predictive models; and then one could imagine some more routines to work out what you like, that then match this to the experiences list.  

I think we might see something like this in the not-too-distant future.  ",14,12,False,self,,,,,

Adding different filters like weather events, time zones, day night cycle. You can look at The Stream of all the incoming articles being posted and updated as the seconds tick away, using different keywords to filter what your seeing in your stream.

The talk-show host, Colin Cowherd according to their website, started talking about how he thinks Golf is a dying sport. He based this on the fact that Dick's Sporting Goods had just laid off 500 Golf Pros and Golf Digest announced that it would shut down. (looking for validation I found MarketWatch.com cites 400 layoffs from Dick's: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dicks-cuts-400-jobs-as-golf-now-less-popular-2014-07-22 and it's Golf World going all digital, not Golf Digest: http://www.golfdigest.com/blogs/the-loop/2014/07/golf-world-goes-all-digital.html )

Colin goes on to state that both moves are because Golf is losing popularity with young Americans / youth around the world (he didn't really specify a geographic region) and it's losing popularity because the sport takes too long and has little action. This is where the talk got interesting. He began discussing how technology like Twitter has driven a demand for immediate satisfaction. His comparison was that Twitter can deliver news immediately where as real-world counterparts like Newspapers take a lot of time to do so.

He went on to posit that Baseball is similarly going to lose / is losing popularity due to the number of games and relative length of each game in a season. He compared it to Soccer which he claimed grew in popularity by 45% between the last 2 World Cup games. (Average Baseball game lasts 3.5 hours according to Colin, Soccer 90 minutes with no breaks + 7-15 minute over time).

Is it possible that our obsession with technology will leave in it's wake some of our favorite sports? And that new sports will become favorites in the near future? What do you guys think?

Some context:

* I'm founder and CEO of [Konoz](http://www.konozlearning.com), an online learning startup. We want to democratize the tools for teaching and learning worldwide. We are a team of hackers and visionary nerds, like you. If you've got skills and care about the future of learning, drop me a message.  
* I co-founded (with many other people) the global sustainability advocacy organisation [The Zeitgeist Movement](http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq). Hint: it has nothing to do with ""Zeitgeist: the Movie"" or conspiracies. It's about using scientific thinking to move humanity forward (the name confusion is unfortunate).
* I've been deeply involved with political activism and digital democracy, in particular with [The Five Star Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Star_Movement)  now the second political party in Italy and AFAIK the first ""*Internet Party*"" to matter in a G8 country.
* I've been part of [Singularity University](http://singularityu.org/) for a few years now, working a lot on the subject of AI, automation, existential risks, and the Future of Work.
* My book [""*Robots Will Steal Your Job, But That's OK: How to Survive the Economic Collapse and Be Happy*""] (http://www.robotswillstealyourjob.com/) is also available [for free online] (http://www.robotswillstealyourjob.com/read).
* I just finished writing a sci-fi young adults novella titled [""*A Tale of Two Futures*""] (http://www.federicopistono.org/books/tale2futures).
* My next book is ""*Society Reloaded*"", which outlines the challenges and opportunities we face as a human race and proposes evidence-based solutions on how to transition within the next 20 into a post-scarcity, sustainable society. [Suggestions are welcome](http://opensourcesociety.net).
* Some relevant lectures/debates I've had:
    * Debate with the Socialist Party of Great Britain http://youtu.be/hcFocV-f3ew
    * The Future of Society and new ways of learning @University Of Life Sciences in Oslo http://youtu.be/7xonyl-OcRo
    * Learning is for life @TEDxTaipei 2013 http://youtu.be/9HCcez4HJW0
    * Robots Will Steal Your Job @TEDxVienna 2013 http://youtu.be/kYIfeZcXA9U
    * How Social Entrepreneurship Can Help Humanity @Nobel Peace Prize http://youtu.be/LfFW3W8sSAg

The article was Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry's ''It's Urgent To Put The Liberal Arts Back At The Center Of Education'' in forbes.com, in which the author urges that people should be taught Aristotle and other Great Books at schools more and there should be a bigger focus on people gaining more classical than ""jobs, jobs, jobs, innovation, science, business'' education. 

One of the guys with both classical education and STEM background expressed, in comments below, that there was no point in classical education, as Aristotle, Plato etc. are outdated and everything in the world can be explained by much newer accomplishments and newer theories put forward by science, going as far as to compare philosophy to astrology and alchemy.

However, this guy received both types of education, therefore he could judge the merits of them, compare and formulate an opinion. Further on he stated that there have not been a significant number of STEM people in government ever, but the government with all the liberal arts people still has engaged in countless war and there has not been much peace. 

The question then is, why there have not been many STEM people in the government? Is it because they're more anti-social or are less able to attract popular support? Is it because they hate politics (this is a common sentiment in Silicon Valley, of course they ''hate'' politics only when there's too much regulation preventing disruption, when they need to sell gadgets, then it's important to have breakfasts with Obama et al)? Or perhaps before they didn't have enough money and now they just might be able to enter politics?
Perhaps a combination of all those points?

In any case, I disagree to the guy's opinion that you do not need liberal arts and can be the opinion/country leader just being well versed in a STEM field. Of course we need a lot of people with STEM backgrounds, but also we need people who could stop and reflect on society as it's being influenced by STEM onslaught. And the reason is, whether you're a lawyer or a software designer, if you're successful, you're also probably a businessman too and business is your primary occupation. And if you offer a product to people, be it a new shiny phone or a draft of law, you have to sell it but at the same time you need to think of how it will affect people in long term. I'm afraid without much background in liberal arts, all you'll hear in your head and coming out of your mouth will be ""disrupt, disrupt, disrupt'' mantra.

It's like Bitcoin uber-fanatics who would be ready to replace banks with Bitcoin in a heartbeat because they for sure would know how to secure their Bitcoins so that they never lose them, while ignoring millions of people who have listened to ''have you tried to switch it off and on again?"" several times in their lives who would have no idea what to do with this Bit Coin or Bit Con. Of course the next argument coming from them is the elitist one,''world should work according to how we work, if we all were this and that, Africa would not be poor etc. etc.'' Unfortunately our world is much more complicated than giving a smartphone to every child in Africa and expecting next Bill Gates to appear...

The rise of social media was accompanied by such accolades as ""they will connect the world, they will make keeping in touch easier'' etc. by STEM and still is accompanied by ''they have democratized the world'', ignoring privacy issues, ignoring the fact that the can be in the same way used by oppressors to coerce populations into acting on their behalf. People talk about Arab Spring as having come into being thanks to social media, however they ignore that ISIS has the same roots and the results of Arab Spring are inconclusive, and I'm stretching it. One has only to look at numerous Russian government trolls on the internet, shifting the facts in shaky nearby regions to see that the impact has not been as positive as we're being told. Or just to look at social media being either manipulated or willing collaborators with the most oppressive governments.

If you do not have a strong liberal arts background, if you do not know history and the development of human thought, you will again and again stumble upon the same problems. Modern luddites, IMHO, rise up not because they're against technology, but because they see many in STEM fields as aliens/somebody who are not humans. Like the reaction against Google Glass, we might think that it's perfectly normal to walk around with a camera on one's face, but obviously people pushing such kind of AR on world' population at the moment fail to grasp the concept of most basic privacy and what issues population might have with it. Therefore the backlash. Zuck didn't create Facebook because he was one of the bros. He created it partially because he could and partially I guess because it was easier for him to find people on a computer than to find them in real life. Then we were encouraged to participate in this thing because of the benefits it offered (and it offers those benefits), but it never was the essence of what we, humans, are, especially not the privacy issues Facebook created, selling data etc. We were taught that facebook was a norm, that giving your data to Zuck to receive this free services was ok, masses are gullible and with good marketing you can sell everything, so we agreed. But the very human issues remained unsolved.

If we look further down the line, the same points can be raised about VR, driverless cars (for example, no, the main reason for driverless cars are not drunk drivers, phone users, disabled, elderly, less road accidents etc. The main reason is just that Google needs more profits, Amazon needs more profits by killing retail, Netflix/Oculus needs more profits as we would spend the time staring at screens, not at road etc.). Almost nobody from pure STEM people will think about these issues, because for them disruption is key. If a technology can disrupt something it is BY DEFINITION RIGHT. And I'm not saying that it isn't. I'm just saying that if there were no ''old fashioned farts'' writing articles about the ''evils'' of social media, VR or driverless cars, we would perhaps soon be directed to a world where there's nothing left of humanity except selling adds, fighting for different causes made up by marketing teams or fukjl89 on Youtube, or country governments each second hour on twitter or in VR and chanting ''disrupt, disrupt'' when the next shiny thing appears on shelves.

We should not live in a world where disruption is by definition a good thing

The amount of times this is repeated results in people with limited understanding of such complicated events (children, the disabled, the elderly, the undereducated, etc.) believing that it's humanity's end is coming soon and it is inevitable. 

I say that I agree with them that there are no shortage of problems to fret over, but that the social and technological progress made in the past 50 years have put us on a great general direction, that I believe we will live to see humanity do some incredible things. 

Personally, I look at the strides made in instantaneous communication, rapid language translation, computer processing, combined with social tolerance and responsibility as being the key ingredients to solving the world's current problems. 

What do you all think? What would you tell people with limited understanding about the future and the direction of humanity?

I remember the first Nintendo, cassette tapes, VHS which gave way to DVDs, then came blue ray and now its streaming on the internet. I mean i think back to my earliest memories of the early nineties and the tech just seems so antiquated now, i mean cassette tapes anyone?

But my 26 years is nothing, there are those who've seen 50 or 75 years of change, its you old timers I'm really curious to hear about. I have a good pal who I hang out with whose 51 and I asked him ""Out of all the innovations you've seen which one has impressed you the most?"" 

He thought about it for a moment and said it would have to be the internet. I mean if you're 50 years of age or more you have literally lived through an age of transformation, my old friend says in his youth their family had one TV and it was like only 15 inches and black and white, he remembers record players, so I'm just fascinated by the transition older people have seen.

And honestly I am hoping i live to see my gray hairs cause I know whats in store for me, I'm gonna see the age of androids and nanobots and Mars colonization, I just cant wait! 

So please take a moment here to reflect back on your life and tell us whats been significant, if anything, to you.

p.s. I especially wanna hear from you oldies cause frankly you've seen a ton of change, so you've got the most perspective.",116,50,False,self,,,,,

For over a century, futurists have been predicting that we will all be flying around in our own personal aircraft in one form or another, [much like this](http://cdn.gajitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/family-flying-machines.jpg), or [this](http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/coexist/imagecache/inline-large/post-inline/800px-France_in_XXI_Century._Flying_police.jpg). But the major flaws in these predictions (beside the lack of understanding of basic physics) have been the issues of pilot training, safety, and the danger of mid-air collisions. Because the craft are self-flying (just press where you want to go on a map on the screen inside), there is no need for lengthy pilot training. And there would be other safety measures such as a built in parachute, lasers, radar, GPS, bird avoidance, and all the aircraft would be in communication with one another so they know where they are.

Like when cars started to become the primary mode of transport for the masses about a hundred years ago, this technology will need a bit of new infrastructure, like landing zones and dedicated ""virtual airspace"", but NASA is already working on that (see the article [How NASA is building a highway in the sky](http://dronelife.com/2014/07/11/nasa-building-highway-sky/)).

Because these aircraft are VTOLs (Vertical Take-Off/Landing), and relatively small, they can take-off and land almost anywhere.

And if battery technology continues to improve, there is no reason why these could not be electric.

You won't even need to own one, you could call for one like a taxi, or pay an annual subscription and use them whenever you want.

Imagine being able to live a few hours drive out of the city on a farm, but commute to the city for work within half an hour or so. Or fly up a mountain for a day trip, or fly to an island off the coast, etc...

I come to this forum seeking some advice. I'm interested in developing a futurist media project. A kind of portable walk-through exhibit offering a visual journey into the future. Not some Disney extravaganza, of course, since that's probably infeasible, but something inspired by that at a much more modest scale--let's say a walk-through maze based on connected trade show display systems, showcase interiors, and modest multimedia. Something loosely similar to the traveling space museums that have been run from time to time. Or maybe just a series of short videos in the visual narrative style of the Koyaanisqatsi series. Of course, the Carousel of Progress had a futurist sequel, of sorts, in Disney's Horizons. It was the most sophisticated, elaborate, and last exhibit of its kind in the 20th century and it was much loved. But it depicted a vision of the 21st century that was already anachronistic as it was being built. A last hurrah for Big Machine Futurism that became more of a tribute to an imagined American-led Golden Age we had largely pissed-away by then. There have been no similar, more contemporary, attempts to portray lifestyles of the future.

I think that futurism has something of a communication problem, Singularity futurism in particular using language that tends to create an impression of the future more like a drug trip than a place or set of lifestyles people might visualize themselves in and thus aspire to. There's a chronic incoherence--a reluctance to even draft any concrete pictures out of fear of overly 'normalizing' the potential. There are a lot of very good futurist documentaries today. But, for the most part, these haven't been visual explorations of the future as much as futurists sitting in offices explaining their own language. And, like so much of the material on this subject, it's overly dependent on recycled media. Even Kurzweil's recent film for _The_Singularity_Is_Near_ uses much recycled media. This isn't to suggest this is somehow wrong or isn't, indeed, necessary. I just don't think that's adequate alone and would like to try something more.

Allusions to the Carousel of Progress might seem rather quaint today, but I think there's a potential coherence to be found in the exploration of the future in a lifestyle context--in looking at it from the human-level up rather than the more typical god's eye view down. (for some years I've been promoting the idea of a home &amp; garden show of the future called Space@Home that would use venues like the Kansas City Subtropolis as a space settlement analog where people can explore their own ideas of living in space through interior design--since creating a comfortable habitat in space is largely about interior design) Let's consider the lifestyles of the Post-Industrial future--on the cusp of Singularity. (as I don't see that as quite so inevitable. We thought Total Automation and the structural collapse of Capitalism were inevitable before the end of the last century too...) Let's look at the the young person finding their place as an adult in a jobless near-post-scarcity culture with the aid of a Netension system. The new microindustrialist cultivating an open reciprocal production network--the Internet of Stuff. The scientist in an academic adhocracy where a classic university has become a kind of open science ashram. The engineer building a Space Elevator at a live-in space center (a Novaya Zvyozdny Gorodok) where space development has become a cultural pursuit--a way of life. The urban farmer greening a city by transforming forgotten and abandoned structures into growing space. The 'queen bee' of a Bolo community, restoring the lives of fellow environmental and economic refugees. The nomadic Outquisition interventionist chasing the wake of Industrial Age break-down to save communities like a Maker-hero or a Dr. Lao from the future. (an obscure reference, I know, but I can't think of a better one at the moment...) The tribal transhuman adapted to living at sea or other wilderness and working as 'environmental restorationist'. The 'mind' of Neo-Babylon; a self-constructing/adapting arcology evolving with the community it's host to. The artilect simultaneously cultivating the inner-space of the Virtual Habitat while settling outer-space by telerobotics and preparing for a Transhumanist Diaspora. I think there's a lot of potential fun in these topics. A 'wow' factor as yet untapped by any recent projects because the written word is now so often failing to communicate--the futurist's language so alien to the mainstream.

And 'fun' is the key word here. We used to, as a society, find a lot of enjoyment in speculating about the future, then lost that to the Cold War, cultural disillusion and upheaval, and Millenarian Dystopianism. The future turned dark and scary and we became culturally obsessed with nostalgia, fantasy, and visions of apocalypse. (not that we haven't always been to some degree. Re-creations of the destruction of Pompeii and the fall of Rome were popular entertainment in 19th century US--even in the wake of the actual near-apocalypse of the Civil War) Just trying to talk about the future in anything other than a dystopian context became anachronistic, and largely remains so today. Like many people here, I'd like to re-cultivate that sense of optimism.

I'm fed-up with the zombie apocalypse crap. It's gross, tired, and stupid. I don't want to keep imagining myself as some desperate refugee of a failed nation scrambling in the detritus of a ruined Industrial Age--just because that's easy for media producers with a compulsion for dark allegories, a pocket full of worn-out SciFi tropes, and a grade-school level science literacy. What the hell is that supposed to inspire me to? I want to be the playful, wandering, demiurge bringing the universe to life. I want to be the Heinleinesque Competent Person fixing the world with skills and imagination, not superpowers. I'll take Scrooge McDuck over Superman any day. Give me a vision to strive for. Give me a new Carousel of Progress, no matter how naive.

As perhaps the single largest open forum for futurist discussion in the world right now, I come to you with this question; is a futurist media project like I envision even possible to do today, and if so, how?

You see, 21st century futurology has a fundamental visualization problem. It has a basic need to communicate impressions of things that don't yet exist and so can't be photographed and so must use illustration of some kind to effectively communicate with mainstream society. But such illustration is now more expensive and time-consuming than ever before and a lot of media that was once common isn't made today because it can no longer cover its production overhead at a reasonable economy of scale. The advance of cheap reprographics in the late 20th century followed by digital media has made the use of photography and video cheaper and easier than ever before. But it also obsolesced once ubiquitous traditional commercial illustration, with CGI being a poor substitute because it's fundamentally inefficient. We tend to take CGI's ubiquitous presence for granted, but it's not drawing, it's model-making, and has roughly the same manual labor overhead as making physical models. It only finds efficiency in animation, where rendering a sequence of many images can be automated--which is great, as long as you can get past the initial labor hump. It now takes vastly greater labor and time to produce basic illustration by CGI than it ever took hand drawn and we're still a very long way from the kind of conversationally interactive procedural modeling depicted in the film Simone. (one of the surprise impacts of AI may be how it changes the nature and economics of visual communication) This greatly limits its practical application--greatly raising the minimum economy of scale at which it can be cost-effectively used--while the shrinking talent/skill pool for traditional illustration leaves us with little alternative.

As the former leader of the Living Universe Foundation--a space advocacy group seeking to realize the development scheme of Marshal Savage's _Millennial_Project_--I spent the last decade pursuing the dream of creating the 21st century equivalent of Collier's _Man_Will_Conquer_Space_Soon!_ (the legendary magazine series from the '50s which catalyzed the American space advocacy movement and the realization of a civilian space program) It proved impossible. The development cost for the necessary design and art was untenable for any form of print media and artists/designers don't collaborate outside their own tribes. There are very few with any passion for the subject area--let alone the education to get past SciFi. (you don't need to know anything about astronautics to design spaceships for Star Wars...) I wonder if even the likes of Popular Science could pull this off today. It just doesn't seem viable for print media anymore. This is the reason for all that recycled media in those documentaries, why space books are forever recycling the same 40 year old NASA media, and why a lot of 'pro-active futurist' groups like the many space advocacy groups or organizations like the Seasteaders routinely founder, unable to effectively communicate their plans and visions even among their own communities. Most people can't gamble with big sums like Hollywood does and so a lot of stuff just never gets made or gets relegated to hopelessly poor production value that hurts the credibility of its ideas. All this media technology and it's still really tough to share a vision.

There are some alternative approaches to illustration, of course, but with severe limits. We can 'mock up' some settings by finding architectural/aesthetic analogs. Indeed, even elaborate installations like the old Carousel of Progress are, in some ways, more cost-effective than art because Maker skills are now more common than illustration skill and that community more openly, globally, collaborative. For instance, actually building a working Urban Nomad settlement in an abandoned office building to illustrate an Outquisition intervention or demonstrating the concepts of Mobilism with found architecture could be far cheaper and easier than having it illustrated. And, as I alluded to earlier, we can find analogs to some kinds of space settlement in places like the Subtropolis. But when it comes to depicting things like the evolution and broad impact of nanotechnology on culture and the built habitat, self-adapting cities based on associative intelligence, the Virtual Habitat and its merging with the Physical Habitat, construction and lifestyles in orbital space, the lifestyle of a tribe of aquatic or other extreme environment adapted transhumans who carry most of their infrastructure in their own bodies, or telling a story about an artilect pilot of a self-maintaining Powell/Pellegrino type starship on a von Neumann probe mission? You can't touch that stuff with just a CNC and a field trip to Toronto. And, as much as I revel in the memetic collage of today's music and art, I really loathe media recycling elsewhere. It just looks and feels cheap.

So how does one do this now? How do you even get started without running into an endless series of Catch-22s all revolving around the art problem? How does a non-artist/designer pitch something like this for a Kickstarter without preliminary media that itself would cost many tens of thousands of dollars to produce? Describe it in text? Who would ever read it? (I'll bet a dozen tl;dr gripes were being drafted after the first paragraph of this post!) Are there other mediums--new alternative means of illustration?

I'm hoping there are people here with the experience to offer some helpful suggestions or insights.

Some games are fun to play, others not so much. Some are played by a few, others include everyone. Under game theory, a game is any activity with goals, rules, challenges, and interaction. Within the games of life, people fall into three primary areas: players, spectators, or unknowing participants. School, work, marriage, friendship, politics, war, and religion can all be considered games. The way people approach games defines their individual character and reputation.

 It is important that the rules of any game are fair and just, otherwise people lose trust and civility often breaks down.  Economics is the study of the various games society uses to allocate goods and services. Everyone is forced to participate in economic games in order to get the things they need to survive. For thousands of years, people have used hierarchical closed systems to control resources and each other in economic systems. 

 For the past few hundred years, the financial system has been civilization's primary game for producing, distributing, and allocating output. In the financial system, money is a bank note. Only banks can create bank notes by making loans to individuals, businesses, and governments. The more loans banks make, the more bank notes in existence.  Since interest is charged on every loan, if banks don't continually increase lending, the bank note system collapses.

 As advances in automation, robotics, and other efficient technology are replacing the need for people to labor, it is becoming impossible for banks to make enough legitimate loans to keep the debt game going. As a result of slowing lending growth, large numbers of people can't find jobs or get money. Without jobs or access to money, people are financial slaves in the financial game. 

Going forward, our games and our rules must evolve to accommodate new innovations and environmental constraints. Just as machinery eventually made the need for most people to labor in agriculture obsolete, highly efficient technology now makes the debt based financial system an obsolete game to control people in traditional jobs. 

 Over the past few decades, due to industrialization spreading globally with billions now participating, people today are consuming resources and polluting environments at unsustainable rates. Resources are becoming scarce and biological ecosystems are being destroyed. Human programming must address these new realities or the negative consequences will be irreversible. 

 Fortunately, new technology creates a better life for everyone by transforming the current destructive narrative into sustainable open games via automation and digitization. In a technologically interconnected world, unlimited opportunities can be open to all without the need to control each other with jobs and debt. Open access permits everyone to play, work, and learn together in virtual environments making traditional barriers such as race, religion, gender, geographic location, and socioeconomic differences are irrelevant. The question confronting us all is not if, but how will civilization evolve from the oppressive centralized control of industrialization to the freedom of technology driven decentralization?

What is the most sci-fi crazy borderline unimaginable application that Ethereum could be used for in the future? (I figured r/ Futurology may be interested in the response)


""You wake up, and see that $17.27 was automatically deducted from your primary wallet, as you had authorized to happen every day, to pay the rent for your apartment; if you cancelled the authorization, then after a warning period ownership in the land registry contract would automatically transfer back to the landlord and the door lock would no longer recognize signatures signed by your smartphones private key as valid for letting you in. Of course, your landlord is bound by the same restrictions - if he shuts off his account paying the local government $6.60 land value tax per day, then he loses ownership and the contract automatically switches over so you are renting from the government instead. The government itself is simply a large decentralized organization, and you can see in real time the $6.60 moving on the blockchain and eventually getting into an account to pay for a medical research program trying to extend the human lifespan from 170 years to 230.


The internet that you are using to access this information is based on OpenGarden, which by then is a mature decentralized and incentivized mesh networking platform; you also paid $0.0009 to access the information, but your laptop also earned $0.0014 transmitting other people's packets at the same time.


You then get up, and get into your Mastercar self-driving car to go to work (originaly, all self-driving cars were made by Google, but Master Corporation, a decentralized autonomous entity that automatically uses a combination of futarchy and liquid democracy to determine how the company should spend its funds each day, proved that its governance mechanism was so efficient that it overtook Google on some core services within three years, and alt-Mastercorps took over most of its other operations). You get in, and Mastercar runs a optimized version of the A* search algorithm (for which James Wilbur automatically got a bounty of $782,228 worth of MSC from the Master Contract) to determine the optimal path to your primary workplace. Given that your self-tracking app has detected that you value your own time (or rather, the delta between time spent in a car versus time spent at home or work) at an average of $14.18 per hour, the Mastercars algorithm chooses a route which takes an extra 11 minutes in order to avoid road tolls and also on the way move a shipment from one side of the city to the other. You drive out, and 30 minutes later you have spent $1.04 on electricity for your car, $1.39 on road tolls, but receive a reward of $2.60 for moving the shipment over.


You arrive at work - a location which is a hybrid living/working space where employees of five different alt-versions of Master Corporation are spending most of their time, except that you chose to live at home because you have a family. You then get to work, running simulations of a proposed new scalability algorithm for the now community/DAO-driven Ethereum 6.0.""

* Don't think of reddit as one giant community. This site is made up of ""sub""reddits, which are all their own communities. Every single post you see on this site belongs to its own community, with its own set of users, and with its own set of rules. reddit provides you an easy-to-use interface for managing what posts you see by letting you subscribe or unsubscribe from certain subreddits.  

* By making an account, you are automatically subscribed to a set of [""default"" subreddits](http://i.imgur.com/4PxSX4e.png) which are a set of highly popular communities that the administrators of this site feel would give the average person an interesting first experience.  

* Don't like one or more of these default subreddits? Use the ""unsubscribe"" button on the sidebar, and start customizing your reddit front page! Find subreddits that interest *you*. Many subreddits feature lists of ""similar subreddits"" that will help you find other awesome places to subscribe to. Looking for a subreddit but you just don't know its name? Try /r/findareddit! Finally, try setting up a [multi-reddit](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html) to categorize your subreddit list even further! 

---  

## Tips for your account.  

* [See and change your preferences.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/) Customize how many [comments](http://i.imgur.com/ZDka3tA.png) show up, what kind of [posts](http://i.imgur.com/FqnC5e2.png) show up, [and more](http://i.imgur.com/vFrZ1C9.png)!  

* [Verify your e-mail.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) If you don't do this and you lose your password, you will have no way to log back onto that account. Ever. Please do this!  

* Karma is a point system that lets you know how your submissions or comments are doing. The more karma your post has, the more people have upvoted it. Generally a higher karma count on a post means that the community of that subreddit found your post valuable and interesting. Your karma is logged on your user page on the top right. **Please note that self-posts earn you no karma.** Only comments and link-posts do.

## What is the sidebar?  

* The [""sidebar""](http://i.imgur.com/OVtMd4K.png) is the list of information pertaining to a specific subreddit. At the top you will find a link to submit a post and a link to search the subreddit. It also contains the link to ""subscribe/unsubscribe"" from that subreddit. Underneath that it generally lists the rules, guidelines, relevant information, similar subreddits, etc.  

    **Note:** many mobile reddit apps require you to press a certain button for the sidebar to show up. Every subreddit has a sidebar. Please don't forget to look for it even if your app doesn't immediately show it! [Here's an image showing where to find it on common reddit apps.](http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0)

* You should always read the sidebar before submitting a post to any subreddit, and if you don't understand a rule message the moderators to ask. This ensures that your post stays on the subreddit, as rule-breaking posts will likely be removed.

* Have a question about a submission to a particular subreddit? Ask the moderators there! [Here's an image](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) that shows you where you can typically find the link to message the mods.  

---

## Who are moderators? What do they do?  

* Each subreddit is a community with its own focus. The mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules. For example, /r/android is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the Android operating system. Anything not directly related to Android is removed by its moderators. Similarly, /r/apple is a subreddit dedicated to discussing Apple and its products.  

* Moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to *only the subreddits they moderate.* They can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit. Moderators enforce the rules laid out in the sidebar, so if you follow all the rules in the sidebar you should be good!  

## Who are admins? What do they do?  

* [Meet the admins.](http://www.reddit.com/about/team) The admins are like super-moderators. They have all the abilities of moderators across every subreddit plus more. They are paid employees of the site and they ensure that the site runs smoothly for all users.

* The admins are generally hands-off when it comes to individual subreddits, letting the moderators and the community decide how its run. **However,** the admins will enforce the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) on every subreddit. Be familiar with these rules. Failure to follow these rules may earn you a **sitewide ban**, or the closing down of a subreddit.  

---

## What is reddiquette?  

* [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is an **informal** set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit. As reddit has grown, certain behaviors have been frowned upon and other behaviors have been encouraged. reddiquette spells out these behaviors so you aren't left wondering why your posts aren't well-received. You might not be banned not following reddiquette, but you will probably be showered in downvotes if you don't.  

---  

## Help! What happened to my post?  

* reddit is a huge forum with millions of users. Many posts are made here every day. Many, many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users. Other posts just don't fit the subreddit. Moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility. Some moderators use bots to help them report posts, some moderators do it all themselves. Every subreddit is different. If you find your post not showing up in the subreddit, your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it's not showing up. *Please note: when you message the moderators, ALL moderators can read it! It's a shared inbox!*  

    * *I can still see my post but others say they can't?*  
    Nothing is really removed from reddit, if a mod removes something it is de-listed for others to see. You can still see it with a direct link.  

    * *My post was removed because it was spam? What gives?*
    Spam is a tricky subject, reddit has several base rules but much of it is left for moderators to decide. reddit's [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) has a good section explaining it.

---  

## I have a great idea for a subreddit!

* Awesome! [Message the moderators](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) so you can talk to them  

## I have a great idea for reddit as a site!

* Awesome too! Post it in /r/ideasfortheadmins  

## What if I don't like the moderators or how the subreddit is run?  

* That's okay, reddit was built to handle just that! First though, make sure that you talk to the moderators of that subreddit just to be sure there aren't any misunderstandings, or if you can't just compromise. Otherwise, make your own community! [Here is an excellent guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/mod101) for starting and moderating your own subreddit.  

* Moderators are people, too, so if you want your voice heard consider messaging them politely with your concerns. We care about the communities we help run and would hate to see users leave because of something that we can help fix!  


---

## What if I need help with something else?  

* Try /r/help for general help on reddit. /r/askmoderators can also help you out if you need to ask mods about anything.  

## I think I found a bug.

* Uh oh. If you are using an application or extension, most have a subreddit you can post in! (/r/RESIssues, /r/alienblue, /r/redditisfun). If you found a bug with reddit itself, post it to /r/bugs (more serious issues should be sent directly to the reddit security team: see the /r/bugs sidebar for contact information.)  


##Other Subreddits of Note

* Other good subreddits to check out for help with various topics are /r/Modhelp, /r/Modnews, /r/ChangeLog, /r/Blog, and /r/Announcements.

* Don't think of reddit as one giant community. This site is made up of ""sub""reddits, which are all their own communities. Every single post you see on this site belongs to its own community, with its own set of users, and with its own set of rules. reddit provides you an easy-to-use interface for managing what posts you see by letting you subscribe or unsubscribe from certain subreddits.  

* By making an account, you are automatically subscribed to a set of [""default"" subreddits](http://i.imgur.com/4PxSX4e.png) which are a set of highly popular communities that the administrators of this site feel would give the average person an interesting first experience.  

* Don't like one or more of these default subreddits? Use the ""unsubscribe"" button on the sidebar, and start customizing your reddit front page! Find subreddits that interest *you*. Many subreddits feature lists of ""similar subreddits"" that will help you find other awesome places to subscribe to. Looking for a subreddit but you just don't know its name? Try /r/findareddit! Finally, try setting up a [multi-reddit](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html) to categorize your subreddit list even further! 

---  

## Tips for your account.  

* [See and change your preferences.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/) Customize how many [comments](http://i.imgur.com/ZDka3tA.png) show up, what kind of [posts](http://i.imgur.com/FqnC5e2.png) show up, [and more](http://i.imgur.com/vFrZ1C9.png)!  

* [Verify your e-mail.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) If you don't do this and you lose your password, you will have no way to log back onto that account. Ever. Please do this!  

* Karma is a point system that lets you know how your submissions or comments are doing. The more karma your post has, the more people have upvoted it. Generally a higher karma count on a post means that the community of that subreddit found your post valuable and interesting. Your karma is logged on your user page on the top right. **Please note that self-posts earn you no karma.** Only comments and link-posts do.

## What is the sidebar?  

* The [""sidebar""](http://i.imgur.com/OVtMd4K.png) is the list of information pertaining to a specific subreddit. At the top you will find a link to submit a post and a link to search the subreddit. It also contains the link to ""subscribe/unsubscribe"" from that subreddit. Underneath that it generally lists the rules, guidelines, relevant information, similar subreddits, etc.  

    **Note:** many mobile reddit apps require you to press a certain button for the sidebar to show up. Every subreddit has a sidebar. Please don't forget to look for it even if your app doesn't immediately show it! [Here's an image showing where to find it on common reddit apps.](http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0)

* You should always read the sidebar before submitting a post to any subreddit, and if you don't understand a rule message the moderators to ask. This ensures that your post stays on the subreddit, as rule-breaking posts will likely be removed.

* Have a question about a submission to a particular subreddit? Ask the moderators there! [Here's an image](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) that shows you where you can typically find the link to message the mods.  

---

## Who are moderators? What do they do?  

* Each subreddit is a community with its own focus. The mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules. For example, /r/android is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the Android operating system. Anything not directly related to Android is removed by its moderators. Similarly, /r/apple is a subreddit dedicated to discussing Apple and its products.  

* Moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to *only the subreddits they moderate.* They can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit. Moderators enforce the rules laid out in the sidebar, so if you follow all the rules in the sidebar you should be good!  

## Who are admins? What do they do?  

* [Meet the admins.](http://www.reddit.com/about/team) The admins are like super-moderators. They have all the abilities of moderators across every subreddit plus more. They are paid employees of the site and they ensure that the site runs smoothly for all users.

* The admins are generally hands-off when it comes to individual subreddits, letting the moderators and the community decide how its run. **However,** the admins will enforce the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) on every subreddit. Be familiar with these rules. Failure to follow these rules may earn you a **sitewide ban**, or the closing down of a subreddit.  

---

## What is reddiquette?  

* [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is an **informal** set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit. As reddit has grown, certain behaviors have been frowned upon and other behaviors have been encouraged. reddiquette spells out these behaviors so you aren't left wondering why your posts aren't well-received. You might not be banned not following reddiquette, but you will probably be showered in downvotes if you don't.  

---  

## Help! What happened to my post?  

* reddit is a huge forum with millions of users. Many posts are made here every day. Many, many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users. Other posts just don't fit the subreddit. Moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility. Some moderators use bots to help them report posts, some moderators do it all themselves. Every subreddit is different. If you find your post not showing up in the subreddit, your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it's not showing up. *Please note: when you message the moderators, ALL moderators can read it! It's a shared inbox!*  

    * *I can still see my post but others say they can't?*  
    Nothing is really removed from reddit, if a mod removes something it is de-listed for others to see. You can still see it with a direct link.  

    * *My post was removed because it was spam? What gives?*
    Spam is a tricky subject, reddit has several base rules but much of it is left for moderators to decide. reddit's [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) has a good section explaining it.

---  

## I have a great idea for a subreddit!

* Awesome! [Message the moderators](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) so you can talk to them  

## I have a great idea for reddit as a site!

* Awesome too! Post it in /r/ideasfortheadmins  

## What if I don't like the moderators or how the subreddit is run?  

* That's okay, reddit was built to handle just that! First though, make sure that you talk to the moderators of that subreddit just to be sure there aren't any misunderstandings, or if you can't just compromise. Otherwise, make your own community! [Here is an excellent guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/mod101) for starting and moderating your own subreddit.  

* Moderators are people, too, so if you want your voice heard consider messaging them politely with your concerns. We care about the communities we help run and would hate to see users leave because of something that we can help fix!  


---

## What if I need help with something else?  

* Try /r/help for general help on reddit. /r/askmoderators can also help you out if you need to ask mods about anything.  

## I think I found a bug.

* Uh oh. If you are using an application or extension, most have a subreddit you can post in! (/r/RESIssues, /r/alienblue, /r/redditisfun). If you found a bug with reddit itself, post it to /r/bugs (more serious issues should be sent directly to the reddit security team: see the /r/bugs sidebar for contact information.)  


##Other Subreddits of Note

* Other good subreddits to check out for help with various topics are /r/Modhelp, /r/Modnews, /r/ChangeLog, /r/Blog, and /r/Announcements.

-20-30 years privacy will be gone.

-There will be a ""yelp"" for PEOPLE where you can basically google ANYONE and find out TONS of information about them.

-Reputation is going to play a larger role in the future.

-Privacy is dead, but one PRO is we'll waay more easily weed out corrupt people in politics &amp; big business.


Prophecy #2:

-A bit far out there.. but in like 5000 AD, by this time humans will have MASTERED the art of time travel.

-We go back in time and save EVERY human who has ever lived and bring them into the modern era.

-Right before humans die, that split second is when the time travel happens.

-We replace people's bodies with a cloned body from the future.

-BRB your grandma you thought was dead? She's doing alive and well in the future 

-We put these people through simulators before they can be accustomed to the future society.


Prophecy #3:

-In 80 to 120 years the beliefs / religion of the world is going to switch to ""I am God, you are God"". That we are all God.

-A very ""Alan Watts""sy spiritual movement of seeing that we are all connected will happen

Frankly I love this idea, but a lot of people I talk to seem to have this natural aversion to not living in a physical place. Antisocial seems to be the buzzword, though I believe it will be more social than current reality. No luck convincing the nay-sayers though :)

Since people are not ready to accept this virtual reality, do you think there's potential for future technology to reverse the process? To start bringing digital objects and people into the physical world. To recreate our physical world by programming it?

I think this sort of solves the problem of peoples current technophobia, at least in this context.

Optimizing to solve a simple problem doesn't require complexity. A hardwired circuit can be faster at some operations than more versatile computers.

Humans meanwhile are even more versatile. That versatility comes at a cost in speed when solving simpler problems.

Animal intelligence is simpler, in fact exponentially so. Yet many animals are faster than humans at some things. Faster reactions, etc.

So, how would you define intelligence? How would you test for it?

I'm thinking bit ahead here... in the near future it will be possible to greatly enhance the human body through genetical engineering, gen therapy, synthetic biology and even neogenics. 

Also prosthetics are advancing fast, and non-biological body parts will soon be compatible to the human nervous system, effectivly enabling to feel and touch and control. Also their appearance will soon be indistinguishable from biological body parts.

That leaves two (extreme) positions to choose from:
Will I have a genetical engineered, highly upgraded, but still biological, body? Or will I choose a non-biological body, a ""full prosthesis""?

Given the advancements in technology, it seems there should be no subjective difference for the user. My body generally will feel just the same. Maybe some of the minor odd senstations biological bodies generate would not translate into full prosthesis bodies, maybe they will, maybe they will have their own, maybe they will be simulated. 

So I should choose the body with the highest utility for me? But here is the thing: Every advantage I can come up with that a biological body has can also be provided by a full prosthesis, mostly even better. 
Maybe a biological body can grow which a prosthesis could not, but then again, a prosthesis should be a choice of an adult, of people who are fully grown.

So my conclusion seems to be: Genetically engineered bodies are only usefull for children, until you can get your full prosthetic body.


Can someone offer any other conclusion? 

EDIT: That turned out to be quite an interesting discussion, thanks everyone :)",40,27,False,self,,,,,

Considering that low gravity could likely give humans with normal muscle mass the ability to fly with suitably engineered flying ""wings"", for want of a better term, is there any reason why in zero to low gee  that humans could not fly in a normal air density situation, because of low gravity inside of future space habitats in low gee?

What might the optimal low gee fields be to allow this, and would this kind of exercise be beneficial to retaining muscle mass, cardiovascular conditioning, etc., such that large flight caverns of various heights could be a good idea to create?

What kind of engineering of such ""wings"" would there need to be and what kinds of shapes &amp; sizes would optimally provide both vertical and forward thrust, the ability to maneuver as well as slow down and stop?

Perhaps some of the more artistically inclined here could draw what that flight equipment might look like and then interested aerodynamic engineers might give good feedback in comments/corrections as to  those designs/suits/wings' flight efficiencies, too.",7,9,False,self,,,,,
