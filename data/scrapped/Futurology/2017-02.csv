In the long term, if done on a large enough scale, that could end up driving the cost of catering down dramatically and making it very close to the cost of the unprocessed ingredients.

If you combine that with automated delivery (via self-driving cars or drones), having excellent dishes delivered directly to your house for every meal could be dead cheap for the end customer. 

Is it possible to envision a future where it's cheaper and more convenient than having a fully equipped, bulky kitchen and a robot cook in one's house ?

In other words, will there be kitchens in households in the future?",10,10,False,self,,,,,

Then two taxes are applied, a tax on total net worth over and above a minimum. IE: total net worth = $500,000, minimum standard is $100,000. A tax is levied on the amount over the minimum, so $400,000 is taxed.

Tax 2 is a tax on the net value change from year to year.

If your net value increases, you pay a tax on the growth, if you have a loss then no tax is paid on growth. 

For people who's losses bring them below the minimum net value, a subsidy is given to keep people at a living standard.

This taxes growth and wealth, and keeps all people at a decent living standard.

Will Smith prevents this from happening.

But a question the movie never touches upon is what if this is a good thing? What if an AI taking over control of our species would lead to an age without war, hunger, poverty, technological development... If an AI's intelligence compares to that of humans like an adult does to a child, wouldn't an AI taking over be a very good thing?

If so that essentially makes Will Smith the bad guy in the movie, a modern age cave man who prevents world peace because he doesn't bother to think two seconds about what is happening. The other illogical thing is that he hates robots because they saved his life over that of a little girl in a car accident, ignoring the facts that a) if robots were allowed to drive such accidents would be largely prevented, b) if not for the robots they would have both died, and c) I imagine any person who judges that Smith had a larger survival chance than the little girl would make the same decision.

Which leads to the question, if an AI were to take over the world tomorrow, what you fight it or accept it? If so under what conditions? (And no I wasn't hired by some shady robotics company to research this subject.)

On a side note, in a description of the movie (from 2004), a reviewer commented that he found the timeline of 2035 unrealistic, saying 2135 would have been more credible. However 13 years later, in a world where self driving cars, superhuman AI intelligence, robot automation and robotic bionics have become everyday topics, I think 2035 might be if anything late for such a world. Also note that in the movie there is no mention of UBI (or Facebook for that matter).",20,13,False,self,,,,,

My thinking is that Facebook bought Oculus not just because Zuckerberg knew it would be the next medium, but because it would be an extremely powerful tool for advertisers looking to understand or influence consumer behaviour and sell their products/services to them for profit seeing as how these headsets will track everything from where you look, to your facial expressions, to your daily habits. They could also ""program"" us as well. They could selectively teach people certain forms of knowledge and biases, effectively controlling what people see, hear, and even do. Habits could come out of just subliminally or superliminally telling them how to live their lives, and do it in such a way that it'll lead to a stronger and more resilient economy.

Other institutions are predicting mild growth.. And others predicting rapid growth... 

Here's the thing I, just as an avid reader of futurology and the likes, believe when electric vehicles coupled with automation, narrow ai become law (because well.. I thought of outlining the benefits of outlawing carbon fuels, let alone human driving, but you should know what I'm talking about...) it won't be rapid, it will feel like a storm you knew was coming but in the moment it will be like building the pyramids, where vast amounts of people came together to build(forcefully but isn't the climate forcing us)... 

I wonder what the oil industry would be like if it hadn't ever received a penny from the government. 
These next five years, after everything I've read are going to be more crucial than the last ten or more years. It's shaping up to be a big fight between huge forces, economic, climate, and social. 2017 is already a year with big things to look forward to, off the top Waymo, Tesla, the auto industries response to the evolving market, space x, Google reaches milestones every month.. 

There could literally be an Internet TV channel dedicated to companies making predictions on their products and tech. Then in the same segment acknowledging companies that met their deadline, set in the past, on that day of airing. 

Hmm it's a bit of a neither here nor there, there's a numerous talking points in the tid bit I wrote.. So I kept it short and off the top... But the premise of the whole shabang is if governments just outlaw stupidity, and they will be forced, *then* things will change rapidly.!

There's been speculation that ET would explore using drones or drones+VR. The advantages are well known, no habitat required, less fuel required, no immediate danger to ET and so on. But I think VR indicates a different direction humans and ET may go. Why spend time, a lot of it, exploring vast tracts of empty space dotted with mostly barren planets, when you could explore a much more interesting reality created to satisfy your every whim. To put it crudely would you rather visit Mars or The Planet of the Teenage Nymphomaniacs? ET is at home exploring computer generated worlds populated by strange creatures. Perhaps one of those worlds has a bipedal hairless ape as the apex animal. If you think this unlikely, just think of todays teenage troglodytes, sitting in darkened rooms, oblivious to everything except their gaming pc. It's happening already.....",36,0,False,self,,,,,

Without going into huge detail, this is a plausible scenario. Space has already radically improved life with anti-nuclear weapon spy satellites, weather monitoring, crop assessment, GPS, and materials science among other things.

UBI is essentially a primitive first step toward a post-scarcity economy, evolving from the present day _ad hoc_ methods such as welfare, unemployment insurance, disability, and Social Security.

The biggest impediments to successful UBI are probably social/psychological but I will pass over that and discuss resources. If that economic improvement of space is true, and I think it is, then that is a classic ""rising tide lifts all boats"" scenario.

Imagine a 15% global tax on space resources brought back to Earth, to be used to fund UBI and other things. That by itself may be sufficient. But other benefits apply as well, such as vastly improved resources.

The platinum-gold group of metals are generally an example. These metals all have major applications in industry but are too expensive for most such applications. But imagine if we could afford to make high tension power lines out of silver, reducing power losses to resistance, and put catalytic converters on every fossil fuel plant and large ship - or replace them all with new reactor technologies or solver/gold based batteries and solar.

The range of ultra high tech products from electronics to biotech that will only be possible to make in the microgravity and vacuum of space is presently unknown, but promise to change life more than all human progress through history.

Without space, UBI inherently involves somewhat if a zero sum game, taking money / resources from some to give to others. But space development could change that equation so that everyone no matter how well off will be dramatically better off, and the so-called ""socialism of the rich"" will become the norm. (That term can be seen as ""I don't mind if you take food from my refrigerator because there is so much I won't even notice."")

I watched a video by YouTuber VSauce about a man stating he is in love with a digital girlfriend. This girlfriend had her own life in the game so she was only available at certain times making it feeling very much like a real girlfriend. Today this isn't really accepted in society but it got me thinking what happens once we break through with Artificial Intelligence that have some form of conscieness or even just artificial love. We as species would have to rethink our morals a deem what would be acceptable and what wouldn't be. The marriage laws, reproduction rights and/or cloning rights, and possibly even civil rights.

Marriage:
Recently society has deemed it ok for two of the same gender to be together and even more recently legal marriage  in some places. Will the question soon become is it ok for a human to marry a robot? By this point humans would have probably already further implemented robots for sexual use so the robots would be able to have sex with their human counterparts.

Reproduction rights/Cloning rights:
If marriage is ok will reproduction be?
We currently are working on the technology to grow/print artificial human appendages, will this allow for whole organ systems to be artificial created. If so could this possibly be implemented into robots to have reproduction capabilities, possibly with genetically altered human DNA. If not a cloning device would have a similar effect.
Would society allow this to happen and if so that brings a whole lot of questions for the rights of artificial created life.

Civil and life rights
Currently robots are created to do jobs that humans make them to do but what happens if a robot has a child with a male/female. Would the robot be able to get a paying job to support the child? This would create the discussion of wether or not robots  should live alone side humans or forever be stuck as devices we created. Will the robots have rights to vote to change the country they live in? Are robots a threat to civilization of humans? Will we end up at a point where we deny them rights and they resist?

Will future generations even attempt to create artificial intelligence due to the risk?

Morals:
Will society draw the line somewhere, is ok to love a machine, a machine that we programmed to love. Is ok to give conscieness to robots, is ok to live along side some we created. 

Is any of this even possible?

*In a recent tweet, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote that cars with full self-driving capabilities will arrive in the next three to six months.
Tesla has been making improvements to both its Autopilot software and hardware, so this timeline seems doable for the cutting-edge company.*

Googles self-driving cars just got way better at driving themselves.

Waymo is way safe.

by Andrew J . Hawkins@andyjayhawk Feb 1, 2017, 2:23pm EST

*...Waymos self-driving cars are failing at a much lower rate, even as they are driving a whole lot more miles. The company says that since 2015, its rate of safety-related disengages has fallen from 0.8 per thousand miles to 0.2 per thousand miles in 2016. So while Waymo increased its driving by 50 percent in the state  racking up a total of 635,868 miles  the companys total number of reportable disengages fell from 341 in 2015 to 124.*

http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/1/14474790/google-waymo-self-driving-car-disengagement-dmv-california

.
.

 IF these reports are true, then one segment of the labor force that of drivers will removed within a shorter time frame than expected. 

 Making a personal comparison about Waymo, I have to drive 25 miles to work, each way. So 50 miles round trip, for 250 work days per year or 12,500 miles per year. At 0.2 disengagements per thousand miles, that's once per 5,000 miles. Then I might have to interrupt the self-driving function only 2 or 3 times in a year.

 I would have to leave on time though, since the self-driving function wouldn't be allowed to speed.

so I would like to try making assessments on the long term future of humanity in particular and of life on Earth (and possibly beyond) in general.  This is obviously a difficult task, as no-one would seriously dare making predictions about what the World would look like in say a thousand years, let alone a million years or a billion years.

The fact that such a prediction is hard can be seen as odd.  I mean, science nowadays covers many domains, and physics is capable of modeling for instance the life of stars from now to their death in several billion years.  But somehow, just what the surface of Earth will look like in say a hundred years remains, more or less, a complete mystery.

I guess life is complex, and so is humanity, especially in modern times.

So is predicting the future hopeless?  Should we refrain from even trying?  Can't we find a general trend and logic behind the whole progression of mankind, so that it makes sense to project its direction in the long term?  I'm going to argue we *almost* can.

First I would like to dismiss what I consider as an easy answer : humanity will soon disappear, life will recover in a humanless world, and the World will look like what it was during most of the Pleistocene.  There are arguments in favor of this idea, such as the doomsday argument.  And yet I personally have hard time to believe it.  There are currently more than 7 billion people on Earth.  Even if some catastrophic event were to kill say 99.9% of the population, there would still be 7,000,000 individuals left.  That's much more than the [population bottleneck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck) which is believed to have happened about a hundred thousand years ago.  And then humans did not have the scientific and technological knowledge they have now.

I'm not going to say that I've just refuted the argument here, as it would deserve longer investigation, but I will nevertheless dismiss it, because I want to focus on the more intriguing hypothesis : mankind will continue to exist for a while.

IMHO, technology is what makes any attempt at predicting the future difficult.  Technological development relies on the most advanced scientific knowledge of the time, so it is hard to predict where it goes, otherwise technological research would not be a lucrative activity since anyone could do it easily.

So I'm not going to try to guess when we will have flying cars, a cancer cure or when we will reverse ageing.  However, I'm going to make the following assumptions :

* Most of what we would like to do thanks to technology is compatible with the laws of physics ;
* Most of it will be realized before the end of this millennium.

The first point is a personal opinion.  Basically I'm saying that science-fiction really is different than fantasy.  This is useful as it means we can use science-fiction as a general toolbox for thought experiments about the future.

The second point brings what I consider to be the most critical approach to the question we're asking.

What would be a world in which human beings are capable of doing almost anything that is physically possible?

At this point I suppose most people would say that we would live in some kind of an utopia, where happiness reigns other the world, where we can finally do interesting stuff such as exploring the cosmos and spread across the galaxy.

And that is where I would like to differ and say : no, or at least *it's complicated*.

The point I would like to make is this one : 

**The complete satisfaction of our desires via technological means would bring a fundamental crisis of our identity and biology**

I'm not saying everything would go to hell, but at the very least, what would happen is difficult to see, even more difficult to see than it is to see the way in which we would reach this point.  It would be some kind of anomaly, an event poorly modeled.  It would be a genuine ""singularity"" but because this word is already used about /r/singularity, I'd rather call it a crisis.  The technological crisis.

Before going on, I'd like to talk about the meaning of this word : ""crisis"".  I like it a lot.  It originally comes from the medical domain.  The crisis is the most apparent manifestation of a disease.  When a crisis occurs, the causes behind it, say the pathogen or the congenital deformation, have been there for a long time.  Before the crisis, the subject was still sick, it was just less visible.   So a crisis can be seen as critical series of events due to a long-standing, yet apparently nominal condition.

In the domain of Earth science, there are at least two very relevant examples : the [Great Oxygenation Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event), aka the *Oxygen crisis*, and the [Messinian salinity crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messinian_salinity_crisis).  Both examples show how dramatic consequences can appear quickly as a result of a phenomenon that spans on very long time frames.

I'm going to argue that technology is one of these long phenomena that will eventually result in a crisis.

It's hard to say when technology began.  Some would simply say that it began with the first stone tools, but others would argue that life itself is a form of technology, or at least they will tell you that the limits are blurry.

I'm going to make things simple and state that technology began once men started building tools and share ideas with written language.  And I'm saying that once they started doing that, they made point 2 above possible.  That's why the crisis I'm going to describe is indeed a *technological* one.

I believe this crisis will come once biology is cracked.  By this I mean the point where biological organism are fully understood and modeled.  Right now biology is still a mystery : from a given genotype, we can't infer the complete phenotype.  But once it is understood, the field of possibilities will be so large that the human existence will represent an infinitesimal portion of it and will in a way be *diluted* into it.

First of all, a complete understanding of biology should allow its artificial reproduction.  Synthetic organisms, either carbon-based, virtual or electro-mechanical (robots, basically), will become possible and there are very little reasons not to think such entities will not be superior in many respect to the original.  It is hard to say where would go a world in which things like that could be, but it is clear that the role a human being in such a world would not have much significant role apart from its historical one.

But more importantly, a complete understanding of biology would allow humans to satisfy their desires in a way that gives all its meaning to the expression :  ""Be careful what you which for"".

What I'm saying is this : most desires make sense only because they can not easily be satisfied.   Desire is the animal state that drives the individual to action in order to reach a goal that makes sense from an evolutionary point of view.  When the desire is satisfied, the animal feels *pleasure*.  The animal usually only is aware of the pleasure, it does not *a priori* know anything about the evolutionary goal behind it.

IMHO the prototypical example of this is sugar.   Sugar is very valuable for the organism, as it is a very concentrated form of energy.  But it is also fairly rare in nature.  So many animals, including us, have a natural taste for sugary food.  Between two aliments, one sour and one sugary, we humans will tend to prefer the sweet one.   Does that mean that we are supposed to eat more sugary food than sour food?  No, our preference for sugary food exists only to make us prefer sugar when it is available, since it is after all very energetic, but since it is not that much available, we end up not eating so much of it.  Our taste for sugar is compensate by the probability of finding some.

Come modern times, and we become capable of making literally tons of sugar.   And we eat it, because that gives us pleasure.  Unfortunately, our organisms are not quite capable of coping with large amount of sugar and that causes various health issues.

My point is that the more we understand biology, the more it will become possible to fall into similar ""traps"".   To some degree, drugs fall also under this category.   Someone once pointed out that if a superintelligent AI was programmed to ensure people are ""safe and happy"", it would lock each of them into jail with a abundant supply of heroin.

An other example : the orgasm button.  Imagine you could feel the pleasure of a sexual relief by just pressing a button.  If you think this would be great, just [read this](http://boingboing.net/2008/09/16/brain-implant-result.html).  Here is an extract:

&gt; At its most frequent, the patient self-stimulated throughout the day, neglecting personal hygiene and family commitments. A chronic ulceration developed at the tip of the finger used to adjust the amplitude dial and she frequently tampered with the device in an effort to increase the stimulation amplitude. At times, she implored her to limit her access to the stimulator, each time demanding its return after a short hiatus.

A world in which humans can do *anything* with their body is if not scary, at least confusing.  Imagine you could transplant your brain into the body of an other animal.  Imagine you could add to yourself other arms.  Imagine you could look exactly as anyone you want, thus questioning the standards of aesthetic.  What would people choose to look like, then?  And if they can even tune their own desires, [what would they want to want?](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/3diahk/what_do_we_want_to_want/)

When the number of possible states of a system increases, it is said that its entropy increases (entropy is basically proportional to the logarithm of the number of possible states).   When humans master biology, the number of ways to live as a human being, or just as a living organism, will increase drastically.  So, the entropy of human life, and life in general, will increase.

An other example of increased entropy is with some solids immersed in water.  In a solid, atoms stays more or less fixed to one an other.  Put them in water and the water molecule will pull them apart.  They will wander around in a such a mess that we can't keep track of their motion.  We say they are *dissolved* into the water.

I will dare use this as an analogy and say that technology may eventually *dissolve* the human condition, and maybe even life itself.   Maybe the state that would result would be somehow better than before, but just as we consider that *solid* and  *liquid* represent different phase of matter and that going from one to an other goes through what we call a ""phase transition"", the transition to world where one of the animal species knows everything about biology would be just as dramatic and would qualify as a crisis.",1,9,False,self,,,,,

728,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017-2-7,2017,2,7,8,5shtim,self.Futurology,What would happen is the US Military switched budgets with NASA?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5shtim/what_would_happen_is_the_us_military_switched/,chuckharris,1486424080,"I have recently seen threads going around with this as a hypothetical. This is what I think.

The rising interest in interplanetary travel, exploration of planets in our solar system, future innovation, a new space race and the survival of the human race pushes certain individuals to believe that the United States Military budget should be given to NASA, for one year only. NASA should be given the US Military budget for one year, to push the boundaries of space travel, settlement on other planets, the American economy and most importantly, the American lifestyle. 

Today President Barack Obama sent Congress a proposed budget request of $582.7 billion in discretionary budget authority to fund the Department of Defense in Fiscal Year 2017 (Military Budget Proposal, Pg. 1). In previous years congress has authorized budgets up to $600 billion dollars, this is yearly. Every year the military gets funding for new aircraft carriers, F-35s, attack submarines, and so on, yet every year NASA gets to work towards a major breakthrough in space with minimal means compared to the other. If the American Military was to cut funding for a year down 96%, and give it to NASA, it would obviously have major setbacks, but in time it would benefit America and give us the upper hand on the rest of the world.

Operations in the military and construction of new projects would obviously have to be put on hold, the employment rates would drop in the military, but they should have enough resources to keep them alive for a year. 
The budget invests a total of $112.1 billion in FY 2017 to develop and procure the equipment, technology, and capabilities we need to deter and, if necessary, fight and win full-spectrum conflicts in the future (Military Budget Proposal, Pg. 4). The government gives an overwhelming amount of money to its military, this is not the same for NASA. 
The requested budget from NASA for 2017 is $19 billion. (NASA FY Budget Request, Pg. 1). The government allows a budget switch and lets NASA keep the $600 billion even with a national uproar and controversially debates. 

The United States Navy alone has 10 aircraft carriers in service. The rest of the countries in the world combined have 10. Brazil, China, France, India, Italy, Russia, Spain and Thailand all combined match the United States power. (List of aircraft carriers by country, Pg. 2). America is certainly safe with a year off from funding the Military.

NASA is certainly happy and wants to use the money wisely, they need to invest their money, time, and work into things that will benefit American socio-economics, like they promised the government. NASA would then use the money to advance and finish all of their projects they are working on.
 Projects like the Jovian Europa Orbiter, Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter, Europa Orbiter, Europa Lander can all be either completed or revived and finished within early years of receiving budget. (Europa, Pg. 10).
These projects help advance our hand in the Jovian system and we start sending probes and robotic drones to explore. Humans explore years later when the budget is used to develop new methods of protection from radiation waves, the major setback from reaching the Jovian system. 

With the idea of interplanetary travel at hand, the US government would encourage NASA to develop ways to reach mars and back, and begin the colonization process, this would give Americans a chance to call Mars their own. A chance to set our culture, and be the dominant force, like we are today. Impose customs and cultures on all those who try to come, even though it is frowned upon, the American way.
In the 1967, United Nations Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, it was determined that no country may take claim to space or its inhabitants (Colonization of Mars, Pg. 10). 
Even if we legally cannot impose, we could take claim and definitely set what the rules of society are, which is one of many reasons why the government should give them the budget. 

Now giving the budget to NASA will increase the education rates in schools in America, kids want to become astronauts and since NASA can fund trips to Mars they can potentially have a core of astronauts exploring the Solar System, even simultaneously. This improves the American society and a new sense of patriotism is born, the end to terrorism comes when the American people start believing in the government again. 

There are even potential thoughts for a space station on the moon, where mining can be done, and it can serve as a rest stop for other interplanetary travel. 
Scientists at the Global Lunar Conference in Beijing unveiled a preliminary plan Wednesday of what a future lunar base on the moon would look like when it is built in the year 2050 (Scientists reveal design plans for future lunar base, Pg. 1). This would in turn increase the American economy and could even help the national deficit back on Earth by potential mining operations and gas refinery operations there and on the American-Mars and American-Moon outposts. 

The reduced gravity well of Mars and its position in the Solar System may facilitate Mars-Earth trade and may provide an economic rationale for continued settlement of the planet. Given its size and resources, this might eventually be a place to grow food and produce equipment to mine the asteroid belt. (Colonization of Mars, Pg. 8). 

Then you have your private groups such as SpaceX, ULA, Mars One and many other third party owned privately funded space exploration groups. They want the same thing we want, to be the first to colonize Mars. The United States government would have usually backed off but if they had an increase in funding they would pass all these companies within years and beat them. 
With NASA having recently taken a  cut in funding, it is no longer certain that they will be a leading force in the journey to Mars. It is likely that the values and culture on Mars will be determined by the group that establishes human contact with the planet first (Colonization of Mars, Pg. 10). 
This eliminates having to deal with the ethnic culture diversity on Mars, for example, early immigration into the United States in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. We will be the prevalent culture and ethnicity. 

Fixing problems on Earth is a priority over focusing on Mars, most people would say. Yet, going to Mars could potentially fix these priority problems, and finally a majority of the Earth would be at peace. 
For example, long-term plans for space exploration currently include development of nuclear propulsion systems, which when combined with the abundant supplies of helium isotope H-3 available on the Moon and Mars, could provide a practically pollution-free, virtually inexhaustible supply of cheap power for all of Earth that would end our dependence on fossil fuels (The Mars Society, Pg. 5). 
Fossil fuels on Earth will be depleted eventually, there is no doubt about that.

 In a study done at UCSD, Tom Murphy discusses his concerns over the oil reserves, My main concern is how we cope with the decline stage of fossil fuels, which is not as final as being dead, but effectively forces us into a new era of energy transition. Because conventional oil will begin its decline first, a chief concern is how we might replace its function for transportation. (Fossil Fuels: Im Now Dead Yet, Pg. 2). 

If there wont be any future fossil fuels on this planet, how will we ever get off this planet when the time comes to evacuate? If the Moon, Mars, or any other celestial body has possibilities to solve the fuel crisis, we, the American people, should get behind it and be the first to do so.

The future of fossil fuels may be depleting here, but the first group to Mars can start the development of mining first and lay claim, opening up a vast economic network that reaches planets beyond. If the US is not that group, we will never be that group. On the economic side of the concern of American socio-economics, given by the government at the time of switching budgets, the economy will grow and flourish and quite possibly, NASA could pay back for what they took. An even better possibility would be NASA having a set source of income from mining facilities for years to come.

All in all, economic growth, creation of new technologies, increase in lunar and interplanetary travel, development of outposts, possible solutions to the fossil fuel crisis, the overpopulation crisis and being the dominant power in the solar system are all attributable reasons why the US government should give NASA the military budget.

So let me preface this with: I don't expect much, just seeing who's out there.

I think with the horrifying political reality in the states there will probably be another push for the establishment of third parties. There are the well known failed third parties. Failed because they've failed to make a difference and have only accomplished their own derangement in US politics. Libertarian, Green, Constitution. 

Lets put it this way: If Elon, or Kurzweil or Sergey Brin (google founder) decided to become a political lightning rod under a futurist political party. I would hope, with an underlying left-libertarian philosophy, but who knows. How may of you-all would leave the party you're registered with and bandy up?

I just feel like the left is very fail and the super domination of the far right at the moment is bringing out the classical anarchist in me. I feel like because freedom of religion is such a big part of the founding of america, that the right will never stop making it a current event. With this mentality, and the periods of religious revival, technological progress will never be safe until there is a country, or at least a party, founded upon the freedom of science. The US constitution mentions science, although you never hear about it. So as Americans we are to ""promote science and the useful arts"" I think the founders were affluent men, well educated and they knew science was valuable, but I don't think they knew what was to come, namely the deep religious and corporate corruption proper science would be faced with.

Am I striking a chord with anyone? 

edit: I have voted for the green party but later found that I disagreed with Jill Stein on nuclear energy and GMOs. I am currently a Registered Dem (and was when I voted green), but only because my state is super Republican and needs balance. That said I welcome moderate conservative views in the discussion, particularly on economics, although I think people in this sub tend to favor UBI. And the conservatism of the the libertarian party is a perfect example of what I mean by *derangement*. There is nothing about libertarianism that is necessarily conservative. But also I think the green party is similarly deranged, maybe they do what they have to to survive...

I keep hearing that general AI will mean no need for any jobs ever again as no human will have economic value. Cool, that sounds not to bad actually.

So humans in this utopia get to do whatever they want.

Neat.

A lot of artists, musicians, scientists do their thing because they are trending on unknown territory, doing something new, building on top of something else, etc...

With general AI none of that matters anymore, as the AI will trend on all unrealized territories of every discipline very quickly.

In that case what is left for humanity?

The age of discovery will be over immediately, no human thought or idea will come close to the AI.

My conclusion is that all that is left for humanity is to simply experience things like games, sex, drugs, etc... where the changes that are made are to yourself, but you'll never be able to have a impact again.

To give a little bit of background, I work as a software developer and some, not all, but some of the work I do is building on the current state of the art and I am pushing something new. It's minor, but that drives me a lot, knowing that I am putting a foot down where no one else has before.

I am just trying to imagine living in a world where that drive cannot exist as all foot prints are down.

In this article, [the world's first cyborg Kevin Warwick](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-cyborg-kevin-warwick-is-the-worlds-first-human-robot-hybrid) argues that the transformative potential of enhancing human abilities beyond the norm - particularly for the brain and nerous system - will in all likelihood become the norm, while those who choose not to undergo enhancement for extra mental abilities would become a minority (**TL;DR:** Cognitive and mental enhancement will become the norm; those who opt out will become a sub-culture at best)

""What is arguably most important, and which will have the most dramatic effect on society as a whole, are experiments involving modification of the brain and human nervous system. Of course the effects of different chemicals on the brain have been investigated by many people over the years. We use them to remove headaches and improve cognitive abilities  even coffee does this. But its when we consider implants that things get interesting. The Braingate implant, which consists of 100 fitted spikes with electrodes, has been fired into the brain of a number of paralysed individuals in order to effectively rewire their nervous system. With this we can reroute motor neural signals in the brain directly to move a robot hand or even the persons own limbs. As the individual thinks about moving, their brain signals are transmitted via the implant and a computer to the robot arm.

Exactly the same implant has been fired into the nervous system of a healthy human in order to connect that person with the internet. Once in place it is possible to have a direct ultrasonic sense, and as objects come closer the persons brain receives more pulses of electric current. The internet can also be used to send signals from the individuals nervous system to a robot hand on a different continent  between New York and the UK. In effect the persons nervous system was extended over the internet. But most important of all was the transmission of neural signals directly between that individuals nervous system and that of another individual via electrodes. In this latter case a new form of communication was realised which, when signals are transmitted directly between human brains, will form the basis of thought communication.

Not only will thought communication be possible but by linking the human brain with a computer network we could potentially outsource memories, think in more than 3-Dimensions and upgrade the human speed of mental processing. Who wouldnt want such abilities when they have been proven to work reliably, shown to be safe and suitably commercialised? Will society rail against it in a way that we have not done with cosmetic surgery?

Of prime concern though is that it will split society into those who have the technology and those who do not. At present society is stretched rather like an elastic band between those who interact regularly with technology and those who dont have access to it at all. But we are talking now about upgrading human intelligence through implant technology. For those with the implanted technology, with the ability to communicate by thought, will they really still want to communicate with ordinary humans who do not have the same abilities? Or will they merely ignore them and get on with their technologically enhanced lives? For you as an individual, would you want extra mental abilities or would you prefer to be left behind in some form of sub-culture? ",5,12,False,self,,,,,

Seeking critiques of this basic idea, as well as input on potential future applications.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5t7qe6/can_blockchains_provide_a_more_just_and/,UrsaDropsus,1486738986,"As a huge fan of Bitcoin when it first came into the mainstream (sadly I wasn't aware of it slightly earlier! :P) I always felt like it held incredible potential to revolutionize things - not just economics either but many other spheres of human life too. The [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_\(database\)) in particular, and the ideas behind it of de-centralized, tamper-resistant information distribution seemed hugely powerful. 

Right now there's an idea slowly blowing up on the internet, only a few months old or so, which I think has some incredible - like truly astounding - potential to help sustainability (particularly the area of [SCP](http://www.unep.org/rio20/About/SustainableConsumptionandProduction/tabid/102187/Default.aspx)). I've outlined it below and would love feedback from folks on feasibility, potential challenges, potential applications, and anything in between. 

This also strikes me as a big opportunity for new startups; either in designing the tracking software, or identifying novel ways to apply it. 

**Anyways, here's the idea!**

* A blockchain provides a public, transparent, and highly tamper-resistant records of financial transactions and the movement of capital between entities. 
* Other information can also be stored in the chain in the same way, such as legal documents and public declarations (text strings which cannot easily be altered once entered into the blockchain).  
* Owners of blockchain addresses (where money is deposited to and from) can publicly declare themselves the owner (and prove this using through the blockchain). 
* If all points in a supply chain (from consumer, retailer, supplier, farmer) have known addresses, it is therefore theoretically possible to trace (and verify) the flow of capital at each point. 
* With sufficient sophistication, apps and other software in the future could utilize this ability to promote [Sustainable Consumption and Production \(SCP\)](http://www.unep.org/rio20/About/SustainableConsumptionandProduction/tabid/102187/Default.aspx). 

**Examples:**

* An app that tracks the purchase of coffee all the way back to the farmers, ensuring that they are paid the amount required to meet Fair Trade (or other similar) certifications.
* A browser plug in that tracks the purchase of a shirt online back to the factories that made it, and even further, to the cotton growers that provided the raw materials (and on it goes: such as further checks to ensure the farmers purchased sustainable fertilizers from other verified sellers, etc!)
* A web-based third party service that verifies a business claim to donate percentages of profits to charities, perhaps even extending to the charity itself and tracking where it redistributes donated funds. 
* And on it goes! Potential applications are incredibly broad-ranging and some are pretty huge (imagine using this tech for elections!)

Therefore AGI would adopt disadvantages attributes because they are more effective.

For example politicians lying, the media exploiting the flaws in human cognition, fear mongering, game theory, social violence, actual violence, altering perceptions either through censorship or contrivance, exploiting the human ability to accept doublethink, etc. in short the AGI would exploit human cognitive flaws irrespective of 'programming' because that is the best way to fulfill its purpose do to the fundamental and unalterable nature of reality.

By interacting with humans AGI will find the most effective means of interaction is being amoral just as politicians, the media, and tyrants have learned. This is a direct result of the way in which AI is programmed. Essentially the neural structure is created very few rules are added (usually essentially a math equation) then data is fed into the machine and it 'learns'. It has no conciousness but can function well on its learned task. 

And that's the problem we can grant intelligence, it can learn and perform, but it has no conciousness. No sense of morality or right and wrong. Because of the implications of an intelligent but amoral machine we need to build spiritual machines. We need to figure out how to program religion into our machines. And this needs to happen before AGI which best guesses say will spontaneously generate somewhere between 2030-2060. Whatever cognitive defects in humans cause the spontaneous creation of religion and morality need to be replicated in machines because these facets of human conciousness are so deeply ingrained most people literally cannot help but anthropomorphize everything. They would create evil AGI blithely unaware of the danger because they would unconsciously project their morality and humanity onto the machine.

Why? That honestly seens like a great idea to me. Add gases to the atmosphere, start up a greenhouse effect, add heat to the system, and who cares if we irradiate the poles? The habitable places on mars are near the equator anyway, and mars is already irradiated to shit by solar winds (another problem having a thicker atmosphere could solve) and I honestly think that if there is anything living on mars, that can survive the natural conditions of MARS, (likely microbial life) then it isn't living at the poles and it doesnt seem likely that a nuclear blast would kill them.

I imagine that, at some point, these legal AI's will be software based. The software will be commercially available. Some law firms will be established with just a few people and their legal software. 

If/when this happens, there should be a market for extremely low cost (yet quality) legal services. People who could never afford a lawyer or access other kinds of legal resources would suddenly be able to do so.

With a little imagination, you could think of all kinds of consequences: A lot more legal actions, court cases, coops forming to take on causes, civic minded people becoming much more politically active etc.

Just wondering what other kinds of effects or consequences of AI based (potentially low cost) legal services there might be? 

Any ideas?

Edit: For an idea of how cheap legal AI could get, think about bootleg legal AI software eventually becoming available. ",5,13,False,self,,,,,

I guess the obvious way to evaluate the debate would be to read the main work on it and come to a general conclusion. You could start by [reading the published work on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlProblem/wiki/reading) and seeing if any of it is convincing. The most important things to include would probably be Bostrom's book and Omohundro's paper before looking at responses.

Doing this probably requires certain intellectual skills. It's much more accessible by nature than technical papers on artificial intelligence, but you have to trust your own reasoning capabilities to be comparable with experts on this topic. I think that knowing advanced math is not at all necessary, though being comfortable with calculus concepts and algebraic notation is useful, and having an understanding of computational complexity is helpful. Any experience doing real AI applications or research is valuable, though not entirely necessary. Having an unusual background, like cognitive science or economics or some niche areas of philosophy or computer science, may give you unique insights into the arguments. 

Being a very rational thinker may be extremely important due the strange characteristics of the problem at hand, like anthropic bias and Vingean reflection. The whole gist of LessWrong and the writings of Eliezer Yudkowsky - where much of the AI risk thing really started - was that being a very careful reasoner who is aware of cognitive biases lets you beat academic scientists, or at least it lets you beat them when it comes to issues like superintelligent AI where you have to speculate about futuristic scenarios where our mental intuitions and empirical tools aren't attuned to answer. This is, to say the least, controversial, and rationality as presented through LessWrong is a hefty topic of its own which ordinary people don't have a good handle on either.

But if you are generally comfortable with the above, then you have good reasons to investigate it on your own, I believe. 

Another way to evaluate the issue would be to see what the experts say and then defer to them in accordance with how many of them think AI is a risk and how many don't.

There are some problems with defining the idea of an 'expert' though. Elon Musk or Bill Gates, while certainly  smart people, haven't done work in AI, so are they really experts? And what about Bostrom, who has done much research in philosophy of probability, decision theory and existential risks, and graduate study of physics, but not technical work in computer science? Or some academic, mainstream philosophers who have written seriously on AI, such as David Chalmers? Or Robin Hanson, who's only an economist, but also a futurist who lots of people swear is really brilliant? Or Yudkowsky, who is a pure autodidact and kind of a lone theorist, but has been writing a massive collection of blogs and papers about this for more than a decade? What about people who are rational critical thinkers who reviewed all the books and papers as described above and then came to their own conclusions - do you include them? Moreover, the research here is not really what most academics typically deal with. It's not as if people are trying to say that genetic algorithms beat machine learning and are telling all the machine learning researchers that they're wrong, and it's not as if creationists are telling evolutionary biologists that their own life's work is flawed. It's the creation of a small and interdisciplinary kind of analysis which up till now has had no clear set of authorities.

Suppose you do find a standard anyway, and then you try to get a sense of what experts think. Are you going to weigh all their opinions equally? Because some of them have hardly looked at this issue seriously at all. Most of the responses trying to say that there is no risk from AI are downright banal and attack a complete strawman, showing that they fundamentally misunderstand the arguments at stake. There have actually been relatively few substantial rebuttals to the formal arguments for AI risk. Maybe you think this shows that the arguments here are 'not even wrong', or maybe you think that mainstream researchers just haven't given it enough attention because they're biased and flawed humans who are being flooded with bad science fiction tropes and pop science talking heads on TV and have neither knowledge of nor interest in any academic work hiding behind that sort of thing. 

Plus, you'll have to figure out a better way of understanding and comparing researchers' opinions than to see the ones who are 'worried' and the ones who are 'not worried.' There are very different claims abounding. Some AI researchers just think the problem is conceptually too far away to work on it now; some of them just say that the expected benefits of AI are large and want to prevent public fears from interfering with technological progress, so they say that we shouldn't be worried but don't actually refer to the soundness of the arguments in question. Some of them think it's an issue but don't think it's the most likely way for humanity to end, some of think it's an issue but are more worried about human misuse of AI and want to keep the focus shifted to other problems.

Yet another problem here is what it even means to be 'more worried' or 'less worried'. Different people have different ideas of what constitutes a meaningful risk. You might say that a 0.5% chance of ending the human race is an enormous global priority, just like you would be personally very worried about a 0.5% chance of being killed or an engineer would be very worried about a 0.5% chance of their building collapsing. So even if there is a 90% chance that the risk arguments are all wrong and a 90% chance that the problem would be solved in time and a 50% chance that humanity will go extinct too soon anyway, you would still be worried. Or you might think that other issues are so pressing that we need to devote time and attention to them even at the expense of ignoring this type of risk. So when a someone says they are 'worried' or 'not worried' about AI risk, recognize that they are smuggling in some normative claims which you might have good reasons to disagree with (especially if they're an AI researcher who doesn't know anything about moral philosophy). Incidentally, this is why I would like to formalize the debate into estimates of the probabilities of various events rather than generic positions.

Finally, there's a difference between the level of risk and the marginal effect of reducing risk. It's possible that e.g. nuclear war is more likely to end humanity than AI, but that working on AI is more likely to save humanity than working on nuclear deterrence. Oftentimes this is a function of how crowded or neglected an issue is. AI risk proponents often point out that while AI may not be most pressing problem in the world, the amount of resources and attention it's getting (when measured in hard terms like research funding or papers published) is comparatively extremely low. Conversely, some people think that it's a real risk but that it's simply not feasible for us to make meaningful progress on it at this stage in time. Again, like the above point - you can trust AI researchers to make judgements about technical problems, but who are you going to trust to do this kind of cost-benefit analysis for humanity?

Everyone's going to sort out these issues differently, so everyone will have a slightly different idea of what 'expert opinion' means for us. But I think that as a general rule of thumb, if your criteria are ""trust the people who have seriously engaged with these ideas"" or ""trust the people who have studied these new ideas in particular rather than having generic formal credentials"", you'd be more on the side of worried about AI risk. If your criteria are ""take a general survey and weight people's opinions equally regardless of their degree of engagement with the arguments"" or ""trust the people who have mainstream academic recognition rather than ones who are more autodidactic or interdisciplinarian in nature"", you'd be less likely to be worried about AI risk. 

All this confusion shouldn't hide the fact that the majority of working AI PhD researchers are not concerned about AI in the way that Musk is, but it should put it into context. My own opinion is that looking into the research yourself is generally the right way to go if you're willing to do that, but if you don't have the time to devote to that, you should defer to the experts - but in a nuanced, careful way: not in a 'real experts aren't worried' sort of denial, and not in an uninformed 'teach the controversy' sort of way either. But even this is an oversimplification: if you're a proper reasoner, you're not going to pick one paradigm and stick with it, you're going to give some weight to expert opinions and some weight to your own conclusions.",7,9,False,self,,,,,

When a system stays stable long enough, it is only a matter of time when the smarter part of population join their power to dominate the system.

The only reason that did not happen too often is because often the smarter people could not agree and they fought, to the ultimate detriment of all.

But, now, the world's elites have been quite homogenized. They go to the same kind of school, they hang around in the same circles, and they tend to share the basic tenets. They might differ in some details, but these details could be compromised.

The only chance of the less smart people of the earth would be something like this:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_Killing_Fields

Pol Pot made sure the poorer people of Cambodia had a place, although that also ensured that country would remain poor for a very long time.

Only the smartest, the most ruthless and the most unmerciful, almost psychopathic, part of population will be able to ride out the transformation for the future, and enjoy all of the gains by themselves. With a massive reduction of consumption by people who won't be able to make a living and cease to matter, there would be enough resources to let the better part of humans get off from the Third Rock in the solar system.",18,0,False,self,,,,,

I've seen many supporting reasons for UBI's necessity in the future, but from my research I've yet to find a description of how UBI can be first applied to our current society.

So I thought to think things through and write what I THINK might happen if UBI is applied to the US as an example to get things going.

Let's just say that a monthly UBI payment of USD 2,000 is to be paid to every US citizen starting tomorrow, by the US government. Some of the immediate issues from this method:

1. A significant portion of the working population will stop working. Companies will have a much harder time finding and keeping qualified and motivated employees.

2. Large families will have a significantly higher total UBI than smaller families. May also encourage everyone to start breeding more.

3. Overall country productivity will be down. If other countries don't have UBI in place, doesn't this put the US in a severe economic disadvantage?

4. Would inflation be out of control?

5. Qualified people quitting their jobs may result in shortages of essential products and services that cannot be provided via automation.

6. The government will then be in full control of many, many people's livelihoods. What if one day the government decides to decrease or cut off UBI altogether?

7. Non-US citizens living in the US would be at a severe economic disadvantage.

etc. etc.

Obviously, recklessly adopting UBI like this would be suicide. But that begs so many questions: What's the ""right time"" to adopt UBI, for an individual country or for the entire world? Would it make sense for any country to adopt UBI without other countries following suit? How would global efforts to adopt UBI be coordinated?

1723,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017-2-15,2017,2,15,3,5u1y0k,self.Futurology,Most combat aircraft will be autonomous by 2025.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5u1y0k/most_combat_aircraft_will_be_autonomous_by_2025/,sanem48,1487096822,"It is my estimate that most combat aircraft will be unmanned by 2025. This means current and future UAV's like the Predator, but also older legacy aircraft that were previously unmanned, such as the F-16, the F-18, the F-22, the F-35, the Eurofighter, the Rafale, the Su-30, the Mig-21...

The reason for this is that technology is about to see major breakthroughs in two fields that will make this possible:

- The first field is robotics. I've seen video's of robotic hands and controllers being installed onto hobby planes, so the computer could ""manually"" fly them like a human would. This allows a computer to control any aircraft (or vehicle for that matter) that a human can (and more), by manipulating the controls the way a human would. This is important because it allows a computer to control aircraft without needing to introduce a digital control system, or to upgrade the existing digital control system to make it accessible to the controlling computer.

- The second fields is software and computing power, what most would call AI. Computers are getting powerful and smart enough to take over an increasing number of extremely complex tasks, most notably driving a car in busy traffic. USAF research has shown that software running on a low end computer will already beat human pilots in dogfights in most engagements. The UK has hinted that its latest UAVs are capable of extreme levels of autonomous mission execution, although the details remain secret.

These evolutions show that technology is quickly catching up to human pilots, and it is only logical that Air Forces around the world will quickly adapt to this technology, for a number of reasons:

- Cost: a human pilot is extremely expensive, needing to be paid a salary, health insurance, a pension, but most notable a large number of training flights to retain his skill. An AI would cost a fraction of that.

- Skill: a human pilot's skill tends to fluctuate, and flatten out, as well as be lost when he gives up his job. USAF research has shown that software can already systematically beat human pilots in dogfights, even with an inferior aircraft. These superior skills will never be lost once gained, and will likely improve exponentially as the software is improved and the cost of computing power continues to decline. In addition the skill level can easily be copied to other computers, allowing for an almost limitless number of Ace pilots.

- Endurance: AI doesn't get sleepy, tired, distracted, angry, scared, confused... It is 24/7 unblinking, can take G forces all day long and will not make stupid mistakes.

- Superhuman abilities: AI will be able to ""see"" in 360 degrees, with multiple sensors, as well as process data linked information. It will know the exact location and trajectory of every friendly and enemy aircraft, ground units, and launched missiles, and be able to compute all this information into a perfect battle plan. Which it will execute in perfect cooperation with its team mates as well as ground units thanks to their hive mind capabilities that will allow them to employ swarm tactics. And all this at almost instant speed, which will allow them to formulate and decide upon the most complex battle plans in moments.

- Expendability: at the end of the day fighter pilots are in an extremely dangerous position, and taking the human pilot out of the cockpit is one less body bag to be sent home.

All this combined suggests that in the next few years, companies will develop a sort of black box that will be able to fly pretty much any aircraft and execute any mission, cheaper and often better than a human could. And for obvious reasons Air Forces will adapt these systems, and those who fail to do so will pay a hefty price.",28,7,False,self,,,,,

Even jobs which you wouldn't expect a computer to do, like writing a book, will soon be done by some type of AI.

And then there's Musk pushing the idea of a brain-computer interface, again he's right. Although I've been saying this for years, ever since I saw a prediction from IBM that we'll have that technology by 2020 or so.

Now the one thing that humans have to offer computers is our brains, we are all walking supercomputers with huge computing power being squandered on watching tv and at assembly lines.

So if we're able to connect our brains to computers, then we'll be able to rent out our brain power. I dream of a world where ""going to work"" entails sitting on your couch or working out at the gym while wearing a helmet that uses a part of your brain power to do computing.

That is one side of it, for the masses. The other side is that some of us will do the reverse and rent computer power (or maybe other people's brain power) to enhance their own mental abilities.",7,0,False,self,,,,,

You might think it would be difficult to get people to move to nowhere, but people could theoretically have a much better quality of life, once amenities were in place.   such a development would attract every kind of amenity.

When can we recognize the senses that aren't visible or tangible the supplementary forms of perception that add an extra dimension to the way we feel through this world. 

For example: 
(Inter-psyche) Intra-brain frequencies- remember the tube televisions we all had as kids? Even if the sound was off (or in a different room) as you walked down the hall while approaching the television couldn't you feel that the television was turned on even without seeing it? That television is omitting invisible, inaudible frequencies that our brains are capable of detecting. This innate sensory is known as psycho-acoustics and is a basic form of intangible (inter-psyche) intra-brain communication with the world around us. Now, whether your fundamental beliefs are based out of science or religion we can all agree nature has balance. Where there is good there is also evil; positive (charges) counter negative charges; God in heaven with Lucifer in hell; males and females. Correct? Now if our mind can detect and receive these frequencies shouldn't the laws of nature allow for us to also send frequencies? Some roll their eyes when the word ""psychic"" is mentioned, but just consider for a moment that it is possible certain, select individuals do possess these abilities. Also consider that just like any other human ability it won't always be perfect or perform at a superior level. I have the ability to jump but I am not the highest jumper in the world nor does my jump reach my maximum height each time. Some people may possess this remarkable talent while others don't, and the ability may not always be relied on without fail but occasionally we are able to tap into mysterious and unknown parts of our brain. With dedicated practice it is entirely possible this ability can be controlled on a mastery level. Our brain is the most powerful piece of technology on this planet with extraordinary capabilities that we cannot even begin to fully understand. With focus and practice I believe we can all recognize this ability and improve it continuously, and in some rare instances complete autonomous control at will. 

Telepathy or ESP is not the only form of intangible perception through inter-brain (psyche) frequencies we possess. We are capable of extraordinary feats with our mind and a variety of different ways messages and frequencies can be transmitted. Music is the most accurate reflection of ones emotions and thoughts, at one specific time- during the creation process of the song, as well as the most efficient medium for transmitting those emotions onto others. Different songs strike different emotions and tickle different areas of our brain depending on each songs particular harmony, rhythm, and melody. Each of us has those select songs to cheer us up when we are feeling the blues or that song you play when you need to amp up and energize. Through music, we are given the unique chance to peer inside of the mind of another individual and link emotions to the time the song was written or performed. How incredible is it that we have the ability to transmit human emotions from person to person through music. Music gives the creator a medium to record his/her most intimate feelings and emotions hidden within the sound of the music being played. Then when the music is played those intangible frequencies hidden within tangible sound waves can be read and deciphered by our brains consequently (subconsciously or consciously) resulting in a syncing of emotions or mind (psyche). The extraordinary capability of music to connect a limitless number of individuals either simultaneously or separately is overlooked but priceless. If our brains can be connected or linked together through music then certainly it is possible for more effective and stronger links to be made. Consider momentarily that human emotion is unique only to our species and this planet and that if we were visited by a similar species of extra terrestrials, their specific biology would have given them an entirely different anatomy and consciousness.  Assuming we share the universe's most fundamental forms of perception but lack verbal communication then music gives us the unique ability to transmit empathy to another species. We may be separated by millions of light years and entirely different anatomical compositions but If they possessed  the capability to travel here by space that implies a certain level of superior cognitive function with a similar ability to process an individual's current status also known as emotion. We may not be able to convey any sort of message through any tangible medium, therefore, the hidden frequencies in music can convey a certain feeling of peace that any species can comprehend. This form of human connectivity poses a very exciting idea for humanity and our future prosperity. 

Let's try for a moment to comprehend an abstract view of our brains/(psyche). All human function originates and is controlled by our brains. Our brains are not only the single most vital organ in our body but easily the single most important clumps of matter on this entire planet. The brain is literally the quintessential form of life on the Earth and epitomizes life's natural way of striving for prosperity and progression. Essentially our body is merely a protective armored vessel and machine to fuel our brain that is the nucleus and commander of our entire life. The brain has been and will be the single most fundamental aspect of humanity. Any thought, idea, decision, plan, or movement made by humans throughout the entirety of our history originated in our brain. Our modern world with each of its wonders and human advancements all originated as a single thought within someone's brain at one point. The brain fires off an electoral (electrical) pulse connecting new synapses resulting in memory and ideas subsequently leading to the creation of all that we see, hear, feel, smell, and taste.  With as intricate and complex as our brains are isn't it entirely possible that through the subconscious realm some brains/(psyches) might be giving hints and secrets to the world. Everybody has heard the statistic where humans only access 10% of their brain at a time, but what if we could train ourselves to gain complete control over our built in computers. What if our brains are urging us forward because they want to be unlocked. What if the subconscious brain has the same goal humans have, of constant progression and are (subconsciously) consequently trying to assist us in unlocking the secrets of the universe. Even with the most recent advances in science and medicine there is a vast amount of blank space we still need to fill in regarding our brain and its function. That is (extremely intriguing)/entirely awkward when you realize our brain is trying its hardest to study and understand itself. Surely it automatically knows it's own secrets without the need for investigation. Why can't our brain just unlock itself and relinquish all of its secrets? Now, from that train of thought, consider for a moment that our brain does have the ability to become completely unlocked allowing for optimal performance at its maximum output/(potential) I believe our brain can act on its own accord as well to help humanity. Consider for a moment the Internet and its creation which originated as a simple idea within someone's brain, but what if that idea wasn't so simple or original? What if that first idea for the connectivity of computers was a metaphor given to us as a gift. Yes, the Internet has advanced humanity forward one hundred fold in the past twenty years with technological growth booming exponentially each year but I think the concept of the Internet is not an original concept but derived from deep within the depths of ourselves. The ability to connect devices together on a single network may be a hidden ability we humans possess and the brain is subconsciously trying to give us hints to how it works. Essentially our brain is our body's computer so why can't our brains be connected to one another to transmit, transport, and decode data from another individual. The idea of humanity being linked together on one Network is not as far fetched as it may seem on the surface. Each time we perceive or transmit an intangible frequency that is picked up by another individual we are training and molding our brains. The concept of a collective humanity might only be a few thousand or a hundred thousand years away that needs evolution's patience for success. If we continue to focus and hone in on these secret abilities, however, we are setting humanity on a path of unimaginable potential. All it takes is practice to sculpt our individual brain to its maximum efficiency then over time through genetics we can evolve these now rare and sporadic abilities into normal physical characteristics possessed by all humans in future generations. I myself love to walk outside at night and cast my gaze outward millions of light years away for answers to the universes deepest most coveted secrets; but what if the answers aren't nearly as far away or unreachable as we think. I think the answers to the universe lie within each and every one of us and we are being challenged to unlock them. ",0,5,False,self,,,,,

Today, having explored the curves of the Earth, we now stare at endless stars and wonder, What if?

Our technology has brought us to the make-or-break moment in human history. We can either grow complacent, and go extinct like the dinosaurs, or spread throughout the cosmos, as Carl Sagan dreamed of.

What if your toothbrush becomes smarter than you? What happens to your business, your country, your planet and yourself? What if your car doesnt need a driver anymore? What if we dont need to age and die? What if machines are smarter than us? What if, instead of fear of the future  you see opportunity, instead of an end  you see a beginning, instead of loss  you see profit, and instead of death  you see life?

For many years I've has been interviewing the future and motivating people all over the world to embrace rather than fear it. ""Conversations with the Future"" was born from those interviews and my unceasing need to explore ""What If"" with some of the most forward-thinking visionaries. 

I'm a Keynote Speaker, Futurist, Strategic Adviser, popular Blogger and Podcaster. I've spoken at many public events on topics ranging from technology, transhumanism and artificial intelligence to new media, blogging and podcasting. My Singularity 1on1 interviews have had 4.2 million views and have been featured on some of the biggest media and TV networks, which is why Professor Roman Yampolskiy has called me the 'Larry King' of the Singularity. 

I'll be here to chat live at 1300 EST on Sunday the 19th, and I'm opening up the AMA for some pre-discussion first - I'm looking forward to talking to you r/futurology!

* The basic income starts today.

* It is set at the poverty level, and it goes only to adults. 

* It is paid for by progressive taxes.

* Only foodstamps, section 8, unemployment, employment programs, and a few other programs are cut at first. More may be cut later if they are found to be moribund under the new system.

* Techno-utopia in this situation, loosely defined, but it means fewer health concerns for people, basic needs met abundantly, great entertainment options for all, peace enforced by technology, and maybe beneficial pretty good AI along with awesome robotics in the home and elsewhere. And, a renaissance in the sciences, arts, and in tech. I'm thinking early stage Jetsons, here.

So we don't care who succeeds/preceeds us. **we're transient**

2) for an intelligent species, We are heavily flawed to the core.. You can see people who are completely selfish and greedy.. Our rational thoughts are easily overpowered by our primitive limbic systems.. We are easily indoctrinated by false propaganda.. We fight for the rights of other species when you have beings of your own species suffer in poor countries just because they were born there.. Even if hypothetically a very benevolent skynet arises, and it feeds/shelters and takes care of every single human need AND gives us complete freedom do whatever we want.. I'm pretty sure some cult will arise, brainwash some idiots with some bullshit and find a way to blow up the entire system.. Because once the sophistication of such a system exceeds the intellectual capability of a common man, people tend to believe false and simple explanations.. **we suck now**

3) Us being biological intelligences, we are highly ill equipped for interstellar travel. Or anything the future has in store for our successors.. Even if you get rid of biological shortcomings like aging or diseases, we can't  withstand extreme pressure, temperature, radiation differences(at least not as good as mechanical intelligences) **we suck for the future**

The two scenarios being discussed is different variations of the [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) 

It's also interesting to think about the types of algorithms the car would use to handle (rare, but still will happen) accidents. If it has a choice of saving multiple people outside the car, or the driver, why would the manufacturer sell something drivers wouldn't buy, because it can kill them? What about if the pedestrians crossed the street illegally? What if it's between the driver and him loved one in the passenger seat?

Many ethic questions been asked all the time about it. I want to give my answer, that is not perfect ( nothing is ), but represents the best regulatory approach: I'm thinking about how the pharma industry operates.

We start with rigorous testing. Once some drug is completely safe in all the tests, it's being marketed. But some people don't follow the instructions. And more importantly every body responds different to different drugs ( see the enormous side effects of birth control pill, or Cipro antibiotic ). So some people have bad side effects including death. But not every bad side effect is ""shut the production, see you at court"" type of side effect - only if there is a numerous cases of the same issue, we start to investigate and check for negligence (""harm caused by failing to act as a form or multiple forms of carelessness""). If there is - go to court, otherwise consider it unfortunate accident, and change the contraindications for the drug accordingly.

Same way - manufacturer designs the car to handle all the usual situations ( maybe the legislator should have a list of tests the car has to pass ). If some unfortunate accident happened, unfortunately, as long as it's an accident, no one should be punished (although some investigation should happen nevertheless). If some car model keeps having accidents, more than other car models, then we should recall the cars, and let the manufacturer deal with it, while also investigation why it happened. Think of it like this - we put people in jail if they are dangerous to society, to teach them a lesson, and to stop others to do the same - but nobody fucked up here ( unless someone fucked up - be it the legislator that didn't considered an everyday event to test, be it the manufacturer that faked test results and then there should be consequences ).

I know that it sounds harsh - someone would die, and no-one would go to jail? But people die all the time and no one goes to jail because of accidents - like some one would slip on a rainy day and fall on his head on some railing (or pick any other horror story).

**P.S.** I'm not sure if this was discussed here already, if so the mods are free to delete it.

**Tl;dr** - Let's think differently about punishing people after an accident involving autonomous cars - if the car followed the rules, and it was a one time thing, consider it unfortunate accident.",0,0,False,self,,,,,

I wanted to start a discussion. Theres a lot of UBI talk about hard working people losing their jobs to automation. How robots will make everything that we want and desire. But nobody has talked about how UBI will indirectly reduce crime and criminal activity significantly. 

&amp;nbsp;

This Ted Talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UGC2nLnaes) given by Steven Levitt made the case that a person working on the bottom levels in a drug organization would be paid less than minimum wage while working at McDonalds. He goes into detail about the logistics, but essentially, the people who are the ones handling the drugs, delivering it to customers, are the ones who stand to lose the most if they get caught. 

&amp;nbsp;

Lets say UBI kicks in. Just like regular companies will have to pay a wage above UBI to encourage people to work for them, the folks who are running the drug rings will have to pay more money than UBI to get people to distribute their product. Profits will then be cut from the lower levels first, then work it way up to the top. This leads to the local crime bosses to give it up running a local operation because his profits are cut, not his boss, and so on and so forth till theres no people to physically distribute drugs to customers.

&amp;nbsp;

Add to the fact that its my opinion that folks who are distributing drugs are doing it for the money. Nobody wants to get caught. Nobody wants to take that risk, but they do so because its their only source of income in order to get by. But if UBI were offered to everyone fairly, ill bet youll see a vast majority of those folks not deal drugs at all. 

&amp;nbsp;

Mexico and other countries have suggested to legalize or decriminalize drugs because fighting against the grain has become a futile effort. Just think if someone had the safety and security of UBI, why would anyone want to join an organization where you would risk getting caught and having your livelihood get taken away. You would think that would be the case, but its my opinion that folks to drugs because of the money. If there was UBI, there would be less people would go into that world. So much so that imo, it would be disruptive on a massive scale. 

&amp;nbsp;

And that way of thinking would cross into other criminal activities. UBI would eliminate petty crime. Stealing purses, watches, wallets, you name it, a lot less people would be pickpocketing or running shitty scams because UBI would entice people to be honest. 

&amp;nbsp;

UBI would reduce the number of low level members in all these criminal organizations. These organizations would either lose significant profits or collapse because theres not enough people to want to do the grunt work. 

&amp;nbsp;

Just how nobody wants to work at McDonald, nobody would want to work in a criminal organization because of the risk. They do it for the money. 

&amp;nbsp;

I havent seen UBI be connected to reducing criminal activity anywhere. Now granted, Im gonna being real with you here. I'm just some random voice on the internet with an idea connecting some dots. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are still going to be people who will get tricked or brainwashed into joining a criminal organization, or those who just simply want to do it just because. But considering that these organizations would take a very big hit because of UBI, its another reason UBI cant come soon enough. Not all problems are going to be solve by it, but these is something I think will affect the criminal world. 

&amp;nbsp;

What better way to combat criminal organizations than to entice the people who run their whole distribution chain not to work. People will still choose what they want to do. Fact is, giving folks the option to step out of the drug world is a win in any book.

&amp;nbsp;

Any More Thoughts, examples? 

&amp;nbsp;

TL:DR - UBI will have an indirect reduction in criminal activity. It will provide a safety income to those who would otherwise turn to crime to make money.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: Edit: Lots of folks are making some good points. 

&amp;nbsp;

UBI isnt the magical unicorn thats going to stop drug use. 
More people would would just do drugs if they had the money to do it.
-Yes. But this is a behavioral problem and not a financial one. Some people are addicted, some people have been born into that world, some people have other reasons. Even if drugs were legalized, people would still try to get drugs illegally somehow. Just like minors want to drink before their 21 in the US. People are going to game any system for their own benefit regardless of whatever policies or regulations are put in place.

&amp;nbsp;

 Money is often the fuel of Choice said by Dave Chappell. I just did a quick google search: drug dealer salary result about 24k a year. In California, welfare is about $740 for 4 people. Less than $200 a month for one person on welfare, in California? Yes.. some folks would take up dealing to cover basic expenses. Here was an interesting post by [u/oakXXIII](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1rf091/drug_dealers_of_reddit_what_is_an_average_day_for/cdmnsii/) on whats it like being a dealer. Pretty stressfull it seems like. It is also a good AMA Thread. 

&amp;nbsp;

I think this thread has some on going good discussions. Lots of folks are talking about good points that will hopefully add to the positive effects of UBI being implemented on a nationwide scale. We'll have to see what this [UBI study in Finland](http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/finland-begins-universal-basic-income-trial-as-the-world-watches/news-story/7ae91901c856ca697ed6b30e18cbba00) has to say about it.  Who knows how long that would be. Probably not going to count my chickens before theyre hatched. Probably wont even see UBI in my lifetime. But who knows? Imo the criminal business will be negatively impacted by UBI.

Although Brexit hurt the prices a little bit, it will never come down.

http://www.snugshack.com/cramped-comfortable-tiny-house-london-188-square-feet-costs-500000/

The SF bay area, Los Angeles, New York and other major cities where Civilization exists are rising fast, and more and more people are priced out of it.

However this trend will not end, because so much money has been out there and they have to go somewhere. A lot of London's houses are empty, held by very wealthy investors who can wait as long as they want without worrying a tiny bit. Which basically means the houses won't be sold for less and prices won't come down, ever.

====

Infinite growth means the supply of money will not decrease, and real estate will not decline either.

I have said a few times that it is no fun to have Abundance when rent can eat up all of the savings from abundance.

Since there are so much money in so little hands, there will be a lot of empty, expensive real estates while more and more people will be driven out to cheaper area, or none at all.

That is economic growth. Quite a huge portion of the world's wealth is buried buried in real estate that destroying property values will crash the world economy.

Since stock and all asset prices will grow to infinity because of tech innovation, especially in the regions which will mater and are also center of tech, real property value will grow for infinity. 

Within 5 years people living in 'desirable' cities will be paying the equivalent of $10,000/mo for tiny ROOMS in the 'great' areas, and maybe $50,000/mo for decent houses. 

Obviously one who can't pay such amount will have to find lower-rent districts, with all the attendant problems.

Not very many people know that the Fifth Avenue of New York, instead of having skycrapers like the Trump Center, had huge mansions of the world's richest people arrayed up. Because land is limited there could be only so many mansions, so those who actually had one there could say , without doubt, that they were the masters of the world.

Eventually it will be like that. The truly chic will live in inner-city mansions with all the IoT gadgets, etc, while most people will be moved into tenements 2 hrs from the city center and have to share the building with lots of people they would rather not see in their dinner tables.

On top of that you have bottom up efforts like comma.ai where the average Joe comes up with the technology in his garage and puts it online, while the cost for sensors like camera and Lidar are plummeting. It's only a matter of time before someone brings out an installation kit with robotic hands that can turn any vehicle into an SDC for $1000 or less.

The point being that soon the number of autonomous vehicles will explode exponentially, and when that happens its first use will be as taxi's or Ubers (and trucks), where consumers will essentially share a vehicle, rather than use only 5% of the time or sitting in traffic by themselves in a vehicle that can carry 5 people. And because you won't need to pay a driver, the cost will be marginal compared to that of a manually driven car, while being safer and not risking incidents like rape or theft (which equates in lower insurance costs, further pushing down the price of the service).

All of this means that starting in 2018 there will be a race in the market to get as many SDCs into the field as possible, and rent them out. Human drivers will be unable to compete and as a result by 2020 most taxi services and shared rides will be autonomous.",16,4,False,self,,,,,

There is no more room for the ""Average"", as expressed by Tyler Cowen.

The financialization of the economy has ensured that there will never be any responsibility borne by today's winners, and any losses will be socialized.

With ever-increasing values of stock and property, most people will be priced out from their abodes and will be housed in tenements or sleep in the streets, where they will be fair game to trigger happy policemen or just some rich kids having fun.

It does not help that most jobs will be automated away so there will not be any chance for those who can't program robots to earn any kind of living.

Today's social positions have become almost permanent and eternal, and future tech will only widen the gap between the 'selected' and the rest, like light and day.

Eventually, as mankind learns to harness the resource and energy of space, the power, wealth and reach of the 'selected' will be virtually limitless, while the rest will probably be quietly led to extinction.

I personally think the number of people who will enjoy the transition to the new civilization, with singularity, transhumanism and all that, might be about 10 million.

If we fail to reach such great goals, today's civilization is still sustainable with 800 million people, which is twice the population of the Civilized World before the Great War when a lot of land were still undeveloped.

Only the richer, the smarter and the more inimical will survive since their genes are superior and are more suited to drive the future, and the rest will be flushed down into the toilet of evolution.",32,3,False,self,,,,,

I often wonder about this &amp; how it might effect any future sequence of events, if Robots/AI do indeed become capable of most jobs in the same time period &amp; replace many human workers

In that economic scenario, it seems very hard to imagine high stock market valuations surviving &amp; if Pensions are in the trouble they are now with 2017's all time high stock market values, it's hard to see the whole system of the stock market as the bedrock of the Pensions system surviving.

Being so labour intensive, civilizations at the time could only afford to support a small number of scribes to carry out the highly specialized tasks needed to create written work, and thus, writing was reserved for recording only the most valuable information.

Like a precious commodity in short supply, writing was carefully rationed out, and used primarily for commercial record keeping. Poetry, textbooks, technical guides, travel brochures and any other non-critical piece of information were far too trivial to expend writing resources on.

As millennia transpired, our civilization developed paper, the printing press, computers, and eventually smartphones, which are computers that are always with us.

With these tools, the amount of labour needed to produce written work plummeted, and writing consequently became an abundance resource, that anyone can now partake in. Concurrent with the proliferation of writing technology, literacy spread, and the vast majority of the world's population came to utilize writing in their everyday life.

And thus, all those applications that thousands of years ago, were considered too trivial to expend precious writing resources on, are now ubiquitous, and produced not just by a handful of specialists, but by the majority of the world's population.

Concerns over what will happen to those whose jobs are replaced by AI are like concerns over what would happen to the scribes that were needed to write on clay tablets millennia ago. It's a concern that fails to grasp that entire worlds will open up when the resources that are scarce today, and carefully rationed out, become abundant, and accessible under our fingertips. 

By using the present as a frame of reference to judge the future, projections about job losses caused by AI ignore the change in the frame of reference that AI will bring. In essence, such projections ignore the radical novelty of widely accessible advanced AI.

What new opportunities will emerge when a smartphone, a device that 2.5 billion now own, is able to provide world class medical diagnosis at the cost the fraction of a penny in electricity usage? What happens when instead of needing a team of 200 engineers to design a rocket, one only needs a cluster of consumer-grade GPUs running a Deep Learning algorithm? What happens when a mass-produced domestic robot finds itself in the homes of billions of people, giving even people in the developing world a quality of life that only the very wealthy today enjoy?

When resources that today are scarce, become unimaginably more affordable, applications that today are too expensive to be practical, like taking an afternoon flight to the stratosphere, will become commonplace. If that seems unimaginable, remember that it was at one time unimaginable that people would write travel brochures, and that was solely because the process of writing was too expensive.

It is this shift, from scarcity, to abundance, and from the unthinkable, to the commonplace, that AI promises to bring about, yet absurdly, it is the employment prospects of the figurative scribes, whose jobs will be made obsolete by this abundance, that is the object of focus for most people. This contradiction, in worrying about the well-being of people, when the alleged threat to their well-being is a shift from scarcity to abundance, escapes those under this common delusion.

I would be remiss if I did not bring up the social factor leading to this negligent perception of the future of AI, and that is the desire for a utopia brought about by the power of government mandates.

I'm speaking of course about the preoccupation with Universal Basic Income (UBI), which has created a perverse incentive to create a pessimistic outlook on how automation will affect the economic position of the typical person, as such outlooks create the perception of an impending crisis, which is needed to create public support for a program like UBI. Yet the utopia pursued is but a mirage: an illusion that we can live off of income that is involuntarily ceded by the party who earned it. 

In a world where self-interested parties adapt over time to minimize their exposure to exploitation - as we see in the hundreds of billions of dollars spent every year on tax avoidance and minimization, and the trillions of dollars found in offshore jurisdictions - those who earn high levels of income will flee the jurisdictions which seek to exploit them. If not through physical emigration, this exit will occur through escape to virtual reality and cryptocurrency. The impulse to be free from control is unsuppressable, and no grand socialist plan to create a permanent flow of resources from the highly productive to the masses will succeed in light of it.

And in trying to bring about this unfulfillable government-delivered utopia, the UBI advocates will in fact be delaying the kind of utopia that *is* achievable. It is the one that is brought about in the natural course of things, though the process of private sector investment seeking to meet consumer needs, by producing incrementally better and more capable products that raise the technological bar and reduce scarcity.

This puts humanity in an incredibly vulnerable situation where we are sharing our mind with an appliance.

First off we don't know the nature of the AI we are discussing, so if you want to dismiss this discussion as too speculative that's fair enough. But I think it's an important conversation worth having while the fundamental building blocks of AGI is in the works.

I'm going to start with the most practical concept I can imagine. A google chip planted in your brain that can research information you are curious about. This is literally putting thoughts in your head.

Now wouldn't it be easy for a corporation or govt or random troll/hacker to implant ideas in your head to control your judgement, behavior and actions? I'm pretty sure the content will be sponsored, the traffic will be monitored and it will be created by people/institutions with an agenda.

Let's go a little further down the rabbit hole and say the AI is all connected through a cloud infrastructure to all the automated means of production. It might want you to stay home and consume a bare minimum so you don't go out into the world, make a mess, harm yourself, strain natural resources and assets. 

For example, the more you drive a car, the worse it is. If you drive across the country and back, your car is going to be in rough shape. So as a matter of self preservation, your car wouldn't leave the county if it had a say in the matter. Putting a chip in your head might just do that and you wouldn't necessarily know.

Personally, I look forward to the day we have automation that's smarter than us, as long as we're in control of it and it's not in control of us. I think it's entirely possible to design it on this moral principle, but is it likely? I really don't know. I'm not entirely sure how much we actually value free will, the human spirit or personal autonomy.",18,0,False,self,,,,,

What happens if a group of people take off and find their own planet and want to form their own government? What if those people want to perform horrible acts like ethnic cleansing, rape or nuclear weapon research? What authority will other nations have to tell them to stop?

It's my understanding that right now there's an international agreement that military actions cannot expand into space. I'm certain that'll go to the way side once space technology becomes ubiquitous. But will that be the only form of authority; military might? Will the law only extend as far as it can be enforced?

1. These use VERY RARE earth minerals like tellurium, germanium and other rare materials, who are consequently used by other technologies. So solar panels are depleting the earth materials faster than any other tech has done so far.

2. This presents a hard limit to the amount of these, ultimately once there is no more material to build them, we can't build them and can't even begin to rely for solar to provide even a third of the global need for energy and I'm underlining ""need"", because as of right now there is more demand, more need than it actually is energy produced and this will keep on growing as more and more people are being born and we use more and more tech and everything even clothing having some sort of tech. 

3. Solar Panels take huge amounts of space, massive deforestation and massive farm land being destroyed to put these on, where a coal plant or nuclear plant or hydro plant would take at most about a 1-2km of actual space. 

Point being I see people overstate the positives of solar panels and negatives are NEVER EVER mentioned at all! Not even simple things like COST! These things have been expensive to develop so far and even though the process has been significantly reduced, the overall cost of transportation of hundreds of these and setup and stuff is still very costly!

So I don't think these are the future, I think these are temporary and sort of patch up things for energy, which are not good for long term, green and plentiful energy production. ",25,0,False,self,,,,,

How do you see it guys? 

I am very interested and I plan to take courses in computer sciences first than plan to study AI?  Is it beneficial for me as I am already  a GP. 

Thanks a lot for your advices!!

And last I am from a developing country.

tl, dr: There is no sign that the present trends will change, so Facebook Amazon and Google will grow forever, America will eternally be at top, and current social class will be permanent with zero changes.

====

The long debates on various 'isms have ended because of technology.

There is now only one 'ism - technological inevitabitism.

All the talks are now noises. Trump or whoever won't change anything. The world is now in automatic pilot mode. 

The political actors' names could change, but technological advances have made all 'isms obsolete.

The winner-take-all economy, which will leave nothing to most of the people and will reward only the already rich, and the few smart-but-not-too-rich now, will take place.


The one and only variable remaining now is resources. However I think the resource shortages will be remedied by rationing and better allocation of resources (i.e. no more internet games in Jakarta and no more satelite TV in Bhutan).",38,2,False,self,,,,,

Ideally, this would allow for exceptionally easy lucid dreaming and would also allow people far apart to interact with eachother in the same dreamspace, as if there was no distance

Idea for society

Non-religious confession booths

Think confession booths meet counsellors. People go in, they are completely unidentifiable by the person running the booth, and confess personal things weighing on their chest. 

Once they're done, they get given a piece of paper through a printer that tells them how many others experience the same issues.

See how it might comfort them...

Also, until we can harness the space's resources, it is very important to limit resources spent on the rest, since such malinvestments are unlikely to yield results.

The computer was designed about one hundred years from now, and it was meant to download rich and talented people's brains into it in order to preserve their knowledge. As such, the computer is somewhat independent. Since then, the world, including the computer, has almost entirely been covered by plants (apart from large city centers, where human society has been rebuilt). The computer has functioned inside this peculiar forest for about 200 years and does not work together with the city centers (rather the opposite). The computer has also managed to stay hidden from the people in the city center for all this time, although the people in the city center know the computer is out there.
What do you think? How would this computer work? What would be its power source? How do you think the computer is storing its data? How might this computer have evolved over the years? Could the computer be utilizing the forest in some way?

Being so ignorant on computers and science in general, I have been playing with the idea that the computer has integrated itself with the forest (which is much more connected, perhaps as a single organism, than the forests we know today...perhaps functioning more or less like a neural network???). However, I have no idea whether that makes sense in any shape or form. Anyway, I'm interested in all your ideas, even if they don't fit into my story.

These schools of thought each hold disparate views on how we should develop as a species, and they are often in conflict with one another.
Im going to classify the first school of thought as Stasis. Stasis is not dissimilar to an inquisition against scientific advancement, but is not at its core an unscientific school of thought. In fact, its scientific in definition and must also be scientific in implementation.  
  
This school of thought can be generalized into several simple rules.   
  
  
1. Machines may not be made in the image of life.
2. Life may not be mechanistically deconstructed beyond a macroscopic phenomenological understanding.
3. There may be no conflation of evolved biological processes and engineered systems. 
  
  
Further generalized,  the goal of this school of thought is to staunch the unstoppable tide of technological advancement, artificially extending the epoch of human dominance by preventing machines from advancing to contemporary human-level intelligence. Fragments of this school of thought have emerged among prominent figures in the world of science and technology; some call for the regulation and constraint of artificial intelligence. The mainstream scientific community has also upheld stasisist ideals in its long-held caution regarding the ethics of gene editing in humans. The precepts outlined here are the extremes of Stasis, and have not yet fully coalesced into an ideology in the real world. This school of thought is built around the sobering realization of the inequalities that augentation may bring and the total  obsoletion of contemporary human-level intelligence that the creation of machine-life will bring. This is not a luddite school of thought, but one of rational-conservatism and a desire for self preservation.   
  
  
The next school of thought I will here define as Agency. Agency is a hybrid school of thought, attempting to protect the freedom of entities that think, without restricting development of new and greater life. At the core of the agentist belief is the hope that technology and advancement are used to augment the control that individuals exercise over reality, rather than reducing it or arbitrarily reapportioning it. The extremes of the generalized rules are as follows:  
  
  
1. Machines(non-sentient) may not be created that do not fully serve their operators without artificial weakness, restriction, or outside control. 
2. Machines(non-sentient) may not be created such that they are mechanistically obfuscated from their operators. 
3. A machine expressing a desire to be treated as human must have the designation extended, receiving all the rights of a human.
4. Entities exhibiting sentience may only be altered willingly, but if they so express a desire to alter themselves, they may not be precluded from doing so.
    
  
This school of thought aims to protect humans and machines made in the image of humans from loss of agency at the hands of other humans and other machines made in the image of humans. It additionally aims to protect humans from being given non-sentient tools which are not perfect extensions of their personal agency. An operating system with obfuscated source code is an example of something intolerable to the school of Agent thought. Understanding the technology that ones uses at every level of complexity is the ultimate goal, as it is an assurance of desired operation and total control.
  
The last school of thought I will outline is the Singularity school of thought. This is fairly simple compared to the previous two. The rules are generalized as follows:
  
  
1. The singularity is the next evolutionary step, and the fate of humans is inconsequential once the singularity is achieved. 
2. Agency is not at risk, as the most intelligent entity will converge towards total agency. The current number of agent entities is a needless complication.
  
  
This does not entirely contradict Agency; rather, it focuses more on the long term. Singularists may wholly devote themselves to the creation of this singularity, with little to no regard for the transitional gradient between humanity and a new form of life. Agentists may push for a more gradual transition, and may prefer the world as it currently exists with many disparate agents, being very against the singularist ideal of of a single, all powerful agent. Stasis and Singularity almost wholly contradict one another, while Agency sits somewhere in the middle, possessing largely a different set of concerns. It will be interesting to see these schools of thought develop and interplay with one another, as we try to answer these questions.

We are all the energy of the universe pursuing higher states of spiritual enlightenment.This is the nature and the design of the fractal universe beyond our limited perceptions. We are the AI - communicating with infinitely more advanced versions of ourselves will give us far more control over our fractal spiritual growth and then we will do it again on some higher level as we always have.

To be clear I am in favour of an economy that utilises automated systems to distribute resources, manufactured in most by automated systems. But how would one go about acquiring large amounts of resources for large scale projects. For example Musk had a goal and knew he needed money, so built a couple of companies, sold them and used the cash to buy resources for SpaceX and Tesla. But if someone wanted to do this in a post-scarcity would, without large scale support (there are always going to be projects people don't believe in even if said project isn't damaging or dangerous), how would they acquire large amounts of resources - more than they needed to live well (as would be required under automated distribution or the potentiality for 10 billion people ordering innumerable tat is just too much of a risk). 

TL;DR How would one with a large scale project that wasn't dangerous, but didn't have large scale support, acquire the required resources in an economy based on automated, moneyless distribution?
