Think about that for a while. A period of time 200 years ago where the UK's manufacturing industry hit a massive boom and revolutionised the country. During that time, work conditions were deplorable, pay was low for long, tedious hours, and there was a lot less freedoms than there is today. Now, 200 years later, Britons have a lot more freedoms - pressure groups, trade unions, women having the right to vote, and great pay for average hours. But what happened to the manufacturing industry? It moved East, to China, India, etc., because these countries have large workforces, low pay for tedious hours, deplorable working conditions, and little freedoms. Because of this, their economies are rapidly expanding, and it's almost inevitable that they will become the biggest in the world. As this happens, within the next 75-100 years, I predict the people of these countries will slowly but steadily gain more freedoms, better working conditions, and better pay for less hours. 

But then, what happens to the manufacturing industry? The cheap workers who were exploited so viciously for such an easy profit?

It's because of these estimates I'm going to take a longshot and say that countries such as Nigeria will become world leaders by about 2120; as they will undergo rapid economic expansion as the cheap manufacturing industry leaves the soon-developed South-East Asia and reaches Africa (provided robots don't dominate the industry). [A quick look at projected population charts shows that in 20 years, Nigeria's population will have more than doubled. ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth#Growth_by_country)

Thoughts?

TL;DR Nigeria and other African countries to become world leaders via manufacturing industries in about 120 years. Or at least, as predicted by me.",13,7

Now if this were to ever be discovered i'm sure that by that time we would have ships that could travel at or extremely near to light speed, so what if we were to use these two techs in conjunction with one another? To travel through space AND time at the same time? My idea was to use the light speed tech move you extremely fast through space while at the same time the time machine tech would move you through time to just moments after you left.

I had a point which I thought hadn't really been considered in the discussion and I couldn't find mention of it in any other posts on this subreddit. Here we go: 

 Is complete Terraformation of an entire planet all at once a bit overkill? Taking on such a massive project would have never been done in the history of our race, and as seen in the above post, would be extremely time consuming and expensive.  We've seen in the Sci-Fi genre miniature biomes on the surface of otherwise inhabitibal planets - would this not be a more effective option?  By doing this, there would be a natural population growth from a small initial colonisation (Because would we really be migrating an entire planet's population at the Mars grand opening) and the biomes could sprawl with population growth until there was an actual demand for the entire planet to be habitable.

   I have a feeling there will be arguments about the obvious macro issues in terraformation such as atmosphere and water content, but wouldn't having isolated communities skilled in the required fields living ON THE PLANET make the process far more efficient?

This might be a little unclear as I'm not great with explaining this sort of thing so I have a really crude metaphor for what is the current view of terraformation vs my view of terraformation.  Terraforming the whole planet at once is like living with your parents your entire life, saving money until you can buy the house of your dreams - in the meantime living uncomfortably and inefficiently - and then having a big empty house with nothing in it because you haven't really been establishing your life. On the other hand, you could move out as soon as you can afford the mortgage on that shit tier apartment - slowly climbing the real estate ladder as your life requires it and you have the resources to do so, and when you reach that 'house of your dreams' stage, you have a family and a culture to go in it.

Please feel free to rebut with the scientific impossibility of this concept, refer me to where it's already been hypothesized, or just marvel in the concept of Mars being your home away from home.",5,5

It paints quite an interesting picture of the future. Is there anyone here who's read it who has understood what Redfield predicts? How about anyone who disagrees, and why?

I'll start. First of all it should be taken for what it is, which is an exciting and interesting novel, and I imagine most of it is fiction for the sake of making an interesting story. That being said, some of the predictions it makes resonate very true with me; the human species is undergoing a massive planetary transformation that I really believe will shape our world *for the better*. Many signs point to this transformation in my mind, be it the student protests happening all over the world, the general growing belief in spiritual values, or the ever expanding world wide web, we are becoming more connected as humans and uniting in our beliefs. Something about this book speaks strongly to me and I think there is some real truth to what he's saying, but most importantly I think we are headed towards a very positive planet, a ""heaven on earth"" if you will.

I'm here because I see machio kaku and Brian green on tv. Since then I've looked them up on YouTube and have seen many of their various presentations. I'm fascinated. Combine that with my love for [Cyberpunk](http://reddit.com/r/cyberpunk) and now I'm obsessed. 

I am in a community college but taking only basic classes. Where do I go from here? I have no school advisers, no counselors and my parents try but they have no idea. My school is stupid, I'm going to transfer to a more efficient one. I've asked the staff here already and they look at me like I'm crazy, mostly because they're older and ""by the book"" so yea.

I was considering physics. I dropped out in hs so I've had NO high school science or math at all.. Long story. Some say my interest despite this is remarkable, I think I may be jumping the gun. Are careers in physics or even futurist type careers rewarding? Is it as rewarding as these scientists I see on tv and material I have access to make it seem?

I'm not just talking money I mean the years in school, getting a job, debates, theories, money, research, loans.. I asked this before but in a non science subreddit and they said it was VERY dry and tedious work usually nothing but spreadsheets? Does the passion die early for the ""futuristic"" type jobs? 

Based on what I see on tv (my only exposure) I want to be exactly like machio kaku who is a theoretical physicist. I love how they are able to tell me where things are headed based on current and past trends.What do you guys think? Am I being fooled by the fancy graphics and programs (these scientist ARE gifted in their ability to explain VERY COMPLEX math/theories to the common man) or is it really rewarding and a fun road to travel in science exploration? If not this I was considering solar and alternative energy research or virtual reality research :/

Keep in mind I have no idea what any of this is really like. It's like me saying I want to be a lawyer based on watching law and order or wanting to be a football player based on watching a few nfl games. What is reality like?",7,8

The AI is friendly though, and assures you that it will still serve you (srsly, Mass Effect) 
Would that AI, in theory, eventually break that promise? Is there one unique algorithm (I think, not a computer scientist) or series of commands that would, by chance, trigger an opposite directive in the AI? As in, could it purly by chance automatically ""change it's mind/override"" the code that says it will still serve humans no matter what?

Of course, the odds of this happening are absurdly small, but computing speed is increasing.  By the time we can Develop AI, our computing speed will have exponentially increased over ~50(?) years.

I'd see it being launched in phases and assembled in orbit, each module expanding out to potentially dozens of square miles and connecting to a larger part. Synchronized micro thrusters distributed across it's length could pivot the massive object without significant structural requirements to prevent flexing (thus reducing needed weight).

My thoughts:

I remember seeing 'Transcendent Man' and thinking about how good of a term that is to describe humans relationship with technology; it allows us to 'transcend' our archaic traits and 'evolve' into something more advanced. 

I think religion has it completely backwards. God created man? No. Through our transcendent technology, man will create god - which will undoubtedly be some form of artificial intelligence. Through this creation, we will one day transcend into godlike beings ourselves, ultimately being saved by technology.

2) What type of system will exist, fleets or individual ownership?

3) How much will a driverless fleet subscription cost?

4) What entrepreneurship opportunities does this technology create?

_____________________________________________

In my opinion, driverless cars have greater potential benefits if they are adopted as fleet systems for subscriber groups. Fleets would pick up and drop off users, taking advantage of network effects, economies of scale and centralized management. Historically, America's cars are ""turned over"" every 18 years and the average personal car is utilized for only a few hours each day.

**Benefits of driverless cars (individually):**

* Frees driving time for other activities

* Reduces traffic contribution

* Reduces car insurance costs

* Reduces need for traffic enforcement and police interaction

* Reduces accident rates, costs and casualties

* Reduces driver state concerns such as DUI's and sleep-deprived driving 

* Increases accessibility to disenfranchised classes. Children and disabled gain the potential capability to transport themselves, pending societal acceptance and authorization

* Increases fuel efficiency

**Added benefits from fleet systems:**

* Makes transportation cheap (mutualization). Requires less initial capital from subscribers and eliminates parking costs, personal maintenance costs and personal insurance costs

* Centralizes storage, maintenance, purchasing and administration, which improves these functions while saving resources

* Unlocks land &amp; road capacity. Fleets decrease need for many decentralized parking lots and garages, freeing up valuable land (huge amount in most cities)

* Further reduces accident rates, costs and casualties

* Further reduces need for traffic enforcement

* Further reduces car insurance costs

* Reduces need for road construction, street signs &amp; stop lights

* Reduces freight transportation costs (industrial/commercial use)

* Reduces delivery costs (commercial use)

* Reduces petty street crimes

* Increases potential speed limits and average speed

**Calculations and variables**: 

The main variables involved are desired service levels (quality of cars and average waiting times), number of total subscribers, number of cars needed, size of coverage area and average cost per user. Most importantly, the cost of fleet transportation is shared by many users with very efficient levels of utilization. I wonder if anyone has any idea what this calculation looks like. I wish we consumers could self-organize and say ""X number of people could and would pay $Y/year to subscribe to a fleet matching Z characteristics"". In my opinion, one ideal type of fleet will offer no-frills service to middle-income families that want to fully replace their existing transportation capabilities while reducing the overall costs. Such a fleet would have average cars, minimal waiting times and full coverage of the local metropolitan area.

**Early adoption candidates**: 

Governments, militaries and corporations are likely to be among the early adopters of driverless technology because they are large-scale organizations making strictly utilitarian decisions. For example, many corporations have incentive programs to draw middle-class employees to distant jobs. It is easy to envision a new corporate campus exploiting the economics of driverless fleets by offering free membership to employee families as a benefit that overshadows rival recruiters. There is also potential for certain countries, such as China, to lead the development and implementation of this technology without the legal and social barriers of the United States market. Consumer-focused fleets launched by entrepreneurs and innovative companies may also appear early in this market, but they are hampered by tough social and legal barriers.

**Entrepreneurship opportunities**: 

An online Designer/Planner/Calculator tool should be created to help users form groups and generate estimates based on their fleet's predicted variables. These groups are then in a position to accelerate the adoption of the technology by showing producers ""We have X people willing to pay $Y/year for subscriptions to a fleet with Z characteristics"". The company that has this data and facilitates this process will have value to future producers.

I don't see it that way. I think that a singularity-esque future will find little-to-no utility of humans. At some level, a cyborg with even a trace of humanity will be in some way a liability for a intergalactic ""life force."" At that point I feel it's probably wrong to even be talking about a race or a species because what's the point of billions of independently functioning biological beings in any other-worldly endeavor? Are we exploring the galaxy just for the pleasure of a mind (and if so, wouldn't we want that mind to look un-recognizably different from our own--thus, no way of determining their goals?) I guess it's just very egoistic to me to believe our values in our time will carry over a singularity.

I've read about how the internet might awaken due to its being a complex web of information or how it might just be some guy tweaking perfectly ordinary lines of code.  I feel like there're some key words I'm missing, because I've tried googling things like ""How Strong AI might arise"" or ""The birth of strong AI"" and somehow I don't come up with the kind of articles I'm looking for.  Anyone know where I can find what I'm talking about?

Thanks, everyone.  I'll remember you in the credits if this thing has any success.",19,38

I've been pondering what kind of emotions - if any - an artilect might have.  I've always been skeptical about the idea that an artilect would have the kind of hatred or resentment it would take to want to destroy us all, but let's not get side-tracked with that; that's not what I want to discuss.  It just seems to me that having emotions is based partly on having our needs met - or NOT met - and artilects would have relatively few needs.  On the other hand, what makes us happy?  What makes us appreciate a sunset or a beautiful song?  If someone insults you, you might get angry because you have an ego to defend.  Would an artilect have an ego?  Could it be called an artilect without one?  One of the marks of a true artilect is the exhibition of self-guided reasoning or intuition, but can't we have that without needing spontaneous emotional response?

Gotta go. Thanks in advance.",5,7

Among members of the group, I think I may have held the median age. Some were much older and some relatively younger. 

When it was my turn to add to the discussion, I simply pointed out that the innovations we're seeing now on the internet (specifically how music is being shared and the lines of possession are becoming blurred with licensing intellectual property for particular uses, blah blah) are exposing just how obsolete our economic system is becoming. I went on to add that there are technologies in development that may soon be capable of producing things automatically, further eliminating the need for human labor and leaving us in the predicament of being dependent on an economic system that necessarily requires us to work, earn money, and spend money to sustain the system. This was the gist anyway...

So, the older members of the group seemed to be taken back by this, as if I were speaking in tongues and completely off my rocker. The younger members were actually engaged. One in particular, a college student, thought it was remarkable that -I- had such an interest in things like the Venus Project and so forth. She said, ""Don't worry, they [speaking of the older members of our group] are not going to understand it the way you and I do. Just keep talking. There are people out there who are listening, and the message is getting around."" I was somewhat floored by this, honestly. For the first time in real life (not on the internet), I managed to actually find someone who understood what I am saying when more often it's ""But that's socialism/utopian... what are you, crazy?"" 

So it really makes me wonder just how much of an impact the gap between generations of people interferes with innovation. It makes me wonder about if there were enough people out there in the world with the kind of optimism I encountered in this lone college student, what kind of acceleration we might see in meaningful innovation (i.e. not the iPhone 6, please, not another one... for god sakes, I didn't buy the first FIVE versions, your next version isn't going to compel me to buy one, either). 

I don't know, maybe I'm being too optimistic with things like Honey Boo Boo on the air, but there's got to be something I can offer to the older generation that effectively communicates what it is I think of when I talk about social issues and the direction I think the future is prepared to go. Any ideas or suggestions, or should I just keep talking - rambling on like the village idiot until all the people who don't get it just die off?? Surely there's a better way, no?",3,4

My initial thoughts; if we spend a minute future(s)-thinking, then it seems like we are mandated to eliminate the chance of a volcano or pandemic killing all humanity, forever. So we should have colonies on the moon, now. Yet, if we all collectively build an artilect instead, will it have a hard-takeoff as it recursively self-improves its own intelligence essentially making it the last tool man need ever make as it turns us into super-human cyborgs that explore the universe faster than the speed of light?",18,16

I've probably been a ""futurist"" most of my life. From an early age I was a reader and the genre that I identified with most was science fiction. Not fantasy, but hard science fiction. One of the biggest moments of my childhood was my parents bringing me into the ""computer room"" to show me Pathfinder Mars pictures. The internet was new to the public still, and it was one of the first times I had actually seen it. Even as a kid I think I knew how big of a deal it would be in my life.

Fast forward through everything else to 2007. I'm a big sci-fi nerd, going to college to study astronomy and physics. I've always been visually skilled though so I took a DXARTs (digital &amp; experimental arts) class. For our final project we were tasked with building a website to explain what art might look like in 50 years. I was a little lost as to what technology might look like at the time; but being a big Civilization gamer I thought I'd do something related to that.

Anyway, I'm going through pictures from this project I had working for an astronomy/astrobiology professor organizing his teaching pictures; trying to pilfer some to use in my project. (He had a lot of Voyager disc pictures and such.) I'm listening to some internet radio, Dizzler or something. Anyway... the music had stopped playing for about five minutes while I kept working. Then out of nowhere this talkshow starts. I can't find out where it's playing from or stop it without shutting my browser with all of my tabs so I just listen. It was like my computer was talking to me directly (not really but I like to joke that it did.)

What ensued was a description of Kurzweil's accelerating returns idea and the GNR ""revolution"" he describes. It blew my mind, I googled ""accelerating returns"" and my thinking on everything changed. The weeks that ensued trying to finish my DXART project while studying for quantum mechanics &amp; thermodynamics tests was a caffeine induced blur. I remember walking home from the library at 2 AM and seeing hallucinations in the trees. I was losing my mind, it was such an information overload...

In class the final weeks of DXARTs covered cybernetics. The big name that was dropped was in lecture was ""Marvin Minsky,"" which struck some deep memory. It took me a few hours, but then it struck me. My uncle on the east coast had either talked about him or I'd seen that name on books at his house.

I've talked to the guy maybe 3 times in the last ten years because my dad is so emotionally distant from his family and we live our in Seattle. Turns out my uncle studied under Minsky at MIT for a PhD in cybernetics! I called him and he described his automated agents and his project ""Wolfgang"" to use ""emotive"" palettes in computing to have AI render music. (in the late 80's). He's a very busy guy and his son (my cousin) is very financially privileged, so there's somewhat of a cultural barrier--on top of some deep malice between my dad and his brother. Thus I haven't stayed in touch as often as I should...

Anyway his advice and knowledge set me off in a new direction. With my uncle, Minsky, Kurzweil as a basis, I envisioned a world simulated by agents that utilizes exponential growth in computing for better and better versions. To make it interactive I thought it would be cool if art from a simulated world could show up in a user's home, or recipes from a procedural culture could be used to cook interesting new foods. This was before the 3D printing thing exploded so I didn't consider pottery or other wears... But in any case... That's how I learned about the Singularity and a whole host of big futuristic ideas.

I should have kept the torch alive and pushed myself harder to make things back then. I let the distractions of youth get in the way. Women, booze, video games, contact sports, trees... You get the idea. Then I met the real world, where all hobbies take second seat to making enough to eat and pay off loans. My first job was so stressful and fascist though that I was told to ""never think for myself"" and I actually had severe medical problems from the stress.

Now I'm hopeful I can do something awesome with /r/simulate. If I can't, I hope I can help somebody else put all the pieces together and succeed.

That's a lot of personal information in that story, but for me forward facing technology for the sake of human progress is very personal. I want to see it disrupt our world and provide social-safety, food and housing for everyone on the planet.

**tl;dr:** First heard about Kurzweil on a mysterious internet talk show that started on its own, while I was working on a project to come up with a website to describe art 50 years in the future.

**What are your personal stories regarding the study of futurology, the singularity? How has explosive technological growth influenced your decisions in life? What do you want most out of it, and what drives you to continue to learn?**

(an essay on tech singularity),https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/119fyk/fear_of_the_human_uncondition_an_essay_on_tech/,OverAnalyzes,1349890859,"Let me start out by saying that I'm not a big Kurzweil fan, but I do acknowledge the basic premises of the technological singularity movement. Different time frames are always mentioned, and we should have had already learned to tame our optimism, when it comes to the matters of advances in AI. Even more so when the proponents of tech singularity themselves acknowledge that the capabilities of machine learning algorithms and virtual neural networks are not dependent on improving hardware (which would imply exponential AI capability growth), but rather on our own impotence of defining intelligence and pattern recognition logically and/or mathematically. Nevertheless, if civilization does not crumble, sooner or rather later, tech singularity seems almost inevitable, which leaves me with a sobering thought.
 
I like the black hole metaphor. The inescapable point of a maximum knowledge, maximum rationality, maximum efficiency civilization. Event horizon as the hypothetical division in advancement where we cannot possibly escape being a ""omni-maximum"" civilization. And while I have no problem with a slow spiral trajectory that gradually delivers us into the near god-like state, I do, however, feel sad thinking of the possibility of blazing past the horizon in a straight line, right for the middle.
 
Imagine this scenario, if you will. It's 2015, a bunch of top math/IT profs publish a paper of revolutionary machine learning algorithm, it's is universally good for many kinds of pattern recognition, layers itself in a crisp and adaptable manner, and can draw out surprisingly broad and reasonable conclusions. So, just for the fun of it, we get some time on a supercomputer, plug the internet in so it has access to tons and tons of data, and press go, waiting for any hypotheses it would produce.
 
It starts out really fun, finds us patterns like ""P(d)=M/IQ"" (probability of person making a duckface in a photo equals the makeup applied, divided by the IQ) and many more things deemed commonsense or irrelevant. Gradually, the layering sets in, and the hypothesis become more scarce, only a few every week, things about economics, sociology and alike. The loss in quantity comes with a payback though - more things come out new and important to us, since the machine learns about how the public reacts to it's findings, and draws conclusions of our expectations. A few months in we start to get really excited, the singularity band-wagon preaches harder than it ever has, but then the machine goes silent.
 
It still works, but it's layered pretty deep, nobody really can make sense of what the separate calculations represent anymore. We have already waited months for any output at all, many have their doubts of pitfalls this algorithm might encounter. It's taking less and less information from the web, but the unique internal memory access signatures gives us some hope that it is crunching something big and worthwhile, so the project keeps running.
 
It's been 8 silent months. There isn't much to do around the control room, so it's hard to blame the staff for barely noticing the beep. Beep. Beep. 
 
""Hey, somethings going on"" a confused voice exclaims from the corner. ""It seems that we have a new output from the machine, and our processing usage has gone down from 100 to 0.1%""
 
""Well? What does it say?""
 
What followed was the end of the human condition, a fall beyond the horizon of events. The message started out easy, a simple plan for the humanity to succeed as a civilization, with a bunch of incredibly efficient engineering solutions to solve our most current problems. For example, the DNA sequences made from scratch to grow the most efficient crops that automatically adapt to any growing conditions. Then there was the fusion reactors, the space elevator and cures for everything already here, and a few for things yet to come. Next, in a rather nonchalant manner, was the theory of everything, the most efficient Dyson sphere and results to a simulation that gave us 400-450 billion years to survive in the slow decay of the universe, if we implement this plan asap (the margin of error only due to different options on how we want our consciousness to be operating in digital form, and how many consciousnesses will want to stay for the party).
 
""Fuck, the string theory was so close"" whimpered theoretical physicists worldwide. ""We could've gotten it right like in like a few decades, now I just feel like I have beaten the game with cheatcodes. Fuck.""
 
""Yeah, and even if you'd managed to get the theory right,"" said the engineer, ""we would still have the fun of testing out different possible designs and compare efficiency vs standardization for most of the problems to be solved. Eh.""
 
Nobody tells you that there are no more events after the event horizon. There is progress, sure, and ultimate rational happiness and the maximum possible longevity, but no more events. I sort of fear that humanity will be like a teenage mom, living up to the responsibilities of an advanced civilization. A child with a mind not suited for the adult world, being torn out of it's childhood without it's consent.

I enjoyed reading the comments. I agree with Dr_Wreck about the importance of stating school over classroom. My bad on that. ClassicalFizz and marshallp both had great comments as well.

Myself I'm only beginning to really explore this thought and thus why I posted the question. I don't know enough about pedagogy and k-12 education to really have something to really suspect as a change. I do think certain things need to change and I would even argue the need to allow for individual ""day offs""  without being counted as absents held against the student. Online blackboards similar to what we have in college would become more widely used with k-12 students. Other than that, a renewed focused on field trips and trips abroad with the class. Naively I guess I wish to see education be able to leave the class room located in Middle America and tour London, Berlin, etc. This does occur at some level now, but not as broadly as I would like to see. 

Further, students becoming more trained to labs of bio relating to 3d printing etc. Ideally as ClassicalFizz points out, an ability to do apprenticeship type work so on, at later levels.

College, I'll generally repeat what many enthusiast of MOOC programs state, the ability to have the lecture online and have the sit in classes be more for discussions, group projects and ..especially for college more field trips around the nation and the world. I often think back to when I was learning of how Socrates would teach by just walking around and talking to people who literally followed him by his side. Perhaps with lectures online, discussions in person and online, when we meet in person we go for walks around the campus, city where ever to give the interaction that provides the light bulb movements. In college we have the option of studying abroad and this is nice, but by gutting the classroom, and ideally while airlines and if we really want to go far out - vactrains cut the cost of transportation and commuting time, it doesn't take all that long to get to Berlin from Chicago. Or Philly to Venice. Walking tours through areas that you are currently learning about, or just simply a walking tour of an area that vaguely connects to what you are learning about (e.g., learning about the American revolution, to manage to have a walking tour in the Netherlands that points out some side history regarding financial history and how this connects to the revolution etc.)

Eh, that's all I have. Like I said, I've only just started thinking about this, the future seems bright, just the old guard has to let go.",13,9

Only when we learn how to efficiently organize in a decentralized fashion with the aid of technology can we hope to subvert the rigid hierarchical class system that underlies every world nation and institution, undermining the true will of the people.

When decentralized, democratic and technology assisted social power eclipses that of the world's oligarchies, we will have attained global consciousness.

Hopefully this can help us encourage each other, give us an idea of what's going on in the community, and get some good ideas ourselves.

1. Went to a DC Tech meetup and made some contacts for my consulting company. See more on this later.

2. Put an artist in touch with some Singularity activist groups to help improve their branding.

This is something I particularly start pondering about when it comes to the subject of a technological singularity. What if the AI we create, or humans we digitize, are simply unable to make themselves smarter?

I just watched another fascinating lecture from another AI scientist warning us about the potential dangers of what could happen to us if we develop AGI and cause an intelligence explosion.  He wasn't all doom-and-gloom like some AI engineers are; just pointing out that we need to be VERY careful about this or it's going to end VERY badly for us.

It brought up a question in my mind, though.  If the risk of accidentally destroying ourselves is so great, why are we trying to develop AGI at all?   I mean, I understand the desire to have better and better AI that can do more and more stuff for us, but developing AGI is the primary goal of lots of AI engineers and I can't help thinking that if it poses such a catastrophic risk, as some say, then why aim for it?  

Why not just focus on enhancing human intelligence?  Part of the concern about AGI is that it would have no human element and therefore no reason to care if we live or die, but if we focus on enhancing human intelligence instead - say, by merging our brains with advanced computer systems - then the human element would be built in, wouldn't it?  I know that enhancing human intelligence carries its own threats and dangers, but I feel like we'd have more control over it.

I'm not saying I'm convinced that The Singularity would lead to our extinction, but a lot of AI engineers seem to be convinced, or at least concerned, that we're stampeding toward our own demise if we go too far down that road; as if we're not stampeding toward our own demise in lots of other ways.

Because the world is virtual, the normal constraints of physics do not apply.  A person might be able to fly, or lift objects by thought - your run of the mill superhero type stuff.  However, because a computer simulation is not constrained by the standard laws of physics that would mean that time travel to the past (at least within the confines of the simulation) could be possible. An avatar that existed within the simulation for several years could theoretically go back and witness the moment he or she was uploaded into the simulation, encountering their past self and giving their past self information from the virtual future. If the virtual world was a simulation of a world familiar to us we could envision all manner of situations in which knowledge from the ""future"" could drastically alter the virtual society's timeline.  Would future programmers of said virtual world allow time travel to the past, or would the machine allow for branching timelines? Thoughts? ",26,8

I'm looking for people to throw out ideas of things/systems that are technologically capable of being built today, but aren't. The idea is to get inspiration for a project, or maybe inspire someone else!

I'll start:

SmartFridge:

This fridge would be like your average fridge, but it would have a small camera like a webcam in the corner and the shelves would be weight-sensitive. It can keep track of your diet and display it at any time (in terms of calories and percent daily values for each thing like saturated fat etc...)

Here's how it works:

when you take something out of the SmartFridge, you quickly show the nutrition label to the camera. SmartFridge can read the nutrition label (Black text on white label is the easiest case for text-reading software) SmartFridge now knows the weight of the item with that nutrition label (total weight just before you picked up the item - current total weight).
You continue taking out all the items you need in this fashion. When you are done using them for your meal, you quickly show the camera the labels again as you put them back in. When you place an item back into SmartFridge, it knows the new weight of the item. Since it stored the old weight when you took it out, it can calculate the percent of the item you used in your meal. Multiply the percent by the calories etc.. and it knows the calories and fat and sugar etc... from that item that you used in your meal. Once you are done placing all items back into SmartFridge, it should have a comprehensive list of the exact dietary values that you included in your meal. You can display them and even keep a log!

I know this can be made because I could make it myself. Why don't I? Because I'm not that into nutrition and lack the motivation for a project like this. Maybe someone else would like to build one, or maybe someone else will have an idea that would be more interesting for me!

I frequently see people saying things like  

""Well, if we want to, we can *prevent*  machines from attaining or surpassing human-level intelligence. If we see that a certain line of research is heading in the direction of producing human-level intelligence, we'll just *forbid*  people from doing that. Problem solved.""

IMHO this is nonsense.

[Here's](http://io9.com/5952101/a-massive-and-illegal-geoengineering-project-has-been-detected-off-canadas-west-coast) a news story that's been everywhere today about 

a ""massive and illegal"" geoengineering project that's been happening off Canada's west coast. ""The experiment ... is in violation of two United Nations moratoria.""

&gt;The project ""has dumped around 100 tonnes of iron sulphate into the Pacific Ocean in a technique known as ocean fertilization."" This is supposed to encourage the growth of plankton, and for ""the plankton to absorb carbon dioxide and then sink to the bottom of the ocean.""

E.g., this is an **illegal climate modification project**  (although  presumably done with the best of intentions.) 

If international regulating bodies and national and local governments can't stop the dumping of tonnes of material, I don't see how we can stop researchers in Korea or Romania or Argentina or South Africa or India (or all of the above)  from continuing ""forbidden"" research into AI.

\---

**tl;dr:**  It may or may not be possible to create AI of human or more-than-human intelligence. But arguing that ""if we don't want people to pursue that research, then we'll just forbid it"" is nonsense.

Where you end up depends on what your location is before you traveled. So for instance, if I wanted to see if I was still living in my parents basement in a years time, I could stay where I am and warp a year into the future. Likewise, if I wanted to see what London looked like in 2045, I'd have to travel to London before I was warped. However, depending on how far you go in the future, this probably won't even matter as transport will most likely get you around the globe much faster than we could imagine.

A couple things:

1. Once the 24 hours is up, you will wake up in your bed as if nothing ever happened. You will **not** be able to remember anything!

2. If you die you wake up

3. You're allowed to take anything you can carry with you except other humans. You will arrive in whatever you're wearing so dress carefully

4. It is possible to see your future self. You can watch them all you want, however, if they see you, you will wake up!

5. If at the time period you travel to the human race is wiped out you'll still have to stay there for 24 hours, unless you die of course.

6. If at the time period you travel to, the Earth is no longer suitable for life you will just wake up automatically.

So, where do you go? Would you like to see what Christmas Day is like in Los Angeles in 2050? How about experiencing New York celebrate the turn of the 22nd century? You could even see what the human race is up to in the year 3000 A.D. if we're still here. Or you could just check if you've moved out of your parents basement by 2014 ;)

Extra question, does your date change if instead of staying for 24hrs, you stay for a year!

In other words, the universe at different times will look different.

Can there be any futures where technology eliminates a certain need for policy makers and policy leaders if the power to create future policy is taken over by individual citizens and mediated by unbiased A.I. Or would the implementation of A.I. in moderating humanity be like handing the keys of civilization over to Skynet? 

What are your thoughts, and what reading or films have you seen that give the possibility of a future with less fractured government dysfunction and of course citizen confusion? 

Partly why I even toss this out here, is that while I believe in many vital aspects of individuals in their capacities to serve as policy leaders, I truly get worn out by the inadequacy of competitions to run governments led by people and or political agendas that do more in the way of civilization stagnation than actual progressive human evolution. Then I get to thinking that maybe we really do need unbiased robot machines that are beholden to actual citizens to run our world.  ",11,7

The NFL as an organization makes roughly $6 billion per year.  Put half that aside for the next eight years, and that means $24 billion able to be spent on a Lunar Pro Bowl by 2020.  

Virgin Galactic currently offers ticket prices of $200k for a trip into the upper atmosphere.  

Now, let's say there's a push, and Virgin Galactic decides to make a shuttle that can reach the moon and return.  Let's say it even quintuples the price of the ticket for an even $1 million.  That's enough for 24,000 people to visit the moon, definitely enough money to visit the moon.  Even with prices increased to $5million per ticket, that could get around 4,000 people to the Moon, more than enough for the teams and all the production staff.  

Advertising?  What better venue?  111 million people watched the last Super Bowl.  The first game held in space?!  You must be looking at close to 3 billion viewers, at least.

Tie-ins?  If just McDonalds builds a restaurant on the Moon to feed the players, that's some major advertising revenue.  You thought Super Bowl advertising revenue was crazy?  How about the first game on the motherfucking moon?  

2020, enough time for Virgin to develop a moon-capable vehicle, and all the advertising money that would generate.  The NFL only needs to set aside half their yearly profits.  Then throw in the money from every other company wanting to get in on the premier deal.

Also, as someone who greatly enjoys his (physical) solitude, I would like to separate that from privacy if possible.  

This is a vastly complex societal issue, so I'm not going to write a book here on how I feel about it.  Some important points for discussion I think though are:

1.What role does the idea of privacy actually play in modern society, and what role could in play in the future?  

2.To build off the previous, what role does it play in the individual psyche, and what parts of that will need to be preserved (at least until we can start modifying the brain directly).

3.Are there certain aspects of ""privacy"" that will persist at the macro level if much of what we consider to be ""privacy"" is lost in the progression of our civilization?

4.To what extent do you think you will be ok with connecting with other people at the mental level, whether through some medium or a direct connection?  (there is a sort of parallel with the idea of ""sahelu"" from Avatar, now that I think about it)

First of all I am not the most educated when it comes to Transhumanism so maybe I just had incorrect assumptions to begin with. By the end of th e documentary it seemed like the government has taken what I personally was thinking about how Transhumanism could be good, and now it is bad and even seems like it should be **feared** if it continues being controlled by the government like presented in the documentary. 

Not to get all tin foil hat but I had no idea what I thought was Transhumanism actually seems to be the government Manipulating. So much of what a promising scientific field had to offer just seemed to be all completely hijacked according to the documentary. Is that correct? Is it common knowledge? 

People are both praising the video and at the same time equally discrediting it. I thought it started off great, and how I expected it to go then it gets really dark with the whole mind control and eugenics stuff, I'm not sure if I found it ""skeptical"" due to how far out it seems or if it is because its something I don't want this to turn into so I'm blocking it out. No one seemed outraged or depressed as I did after seeing it so I have to wonder what should I have felt at the end?

When we eat, we break down the food into simpler structures in order to incorporate them into our bodies. Most of the building blocks of life (fats, amino acids, glucose) seem to be pretty simple structures comprised of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. The human body is also mostly composed of oxygen (65%), carbon (18%), hydrogen (10%) and nitrogen (3%). 

It seems that we could create some sort of solar powered artificial skin that creates these simple building blocks of life and injects them directly into our blood stream. Rather than being a general purpose molecular assembler, it would be specifically streamlined to just create the building-blocks for life. It seems that in all the science-fiction that I've encountered, they have technology for creating an unlimited amount of food, but I've never seen the potential for eliminating the need for ingesting food entirely.

I would think that the process could use the water from our bodies for hydrogen and a percentage of the oxygen. The remainder of the oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen could be acquired from the air around us. This could potentially reduce our required nutritional intake to water and a multivitamin. It would also eliminate the harmful contaminants that would come with the food we ingest.

Here are some napkin calculations:

~100 watts/sqft in full sunlight

100 watts = .024 kcal/sec/sqft

.024 kcal/sec/sqlft = ~86 kcal/hr/sqft

~18.3 sqft/human

86 kcal/hr/sqft * 18.3 sqft/human = 1720 kcal/hr/human

1720 kcal/hr/human * 10 hr/day (usable sunlight) = 17200 kcal/human/day

You could probably cut that number in half, since only half the surface area of a human would be visible at any given time. If there are this many calories hitting a person exposed to the sun every day, the process would need to be much more efficient than current technologies in order to generate enough calories for the body to run on. Even so, it makes a molecular assembler that assembles food for you to then eat and break back down look rather inefficient. I think it would be interesting if, in the future, consuming food was as necessary for life as art and music.

I realize this would require overcoming some serious technical hurdles in molecular manufacturing, but it seems like it would pretty much eliminate the problem of world hunger. I, personally, wouldn't mind being removed from the food chain.

Thoughts?

**TL;DR** Nano-tech artificial skin coating to create and inject macro-nutrients.

Edit: fixed calculations based on Lord_Monkey's critique and modified some of my conclusions based on those numbers.",8,19

After watching Peter Norvig's talk at the Singularity Summit and reading some comments on how we will reach the singularity in X or Y years, I'm wondering how exactly one could know precisely when they had ""reached"" the singularity. 

For example, the Turing test was devised to give a way to *assess* and *check* whether or not a computer is able to exhibit intelligent behavior (when we define ""intelligent behavior"" as being on the level of us humans). 

Have any non-arbitrary tests been proposed to test whether or not we have ""reached"" a singularity? (if not, how is the idea of the singularity anything more than unfalsifiable gobbledygook?)",6,22

And rightfully so. It's one area I'm increasingly interested in. 

So I just read an article that said non-smokers usually live 10 years more than smokers. And that vegans and vegetarians live about 10 years longer than meat eaters.

We also know that people who exercise regularly tend to be healthier and live longer than those who don't. And people that practice stress reducing exercises like yoga and tai chi have longer life spans, even if it's just a handful of years. 

But if we were to combine all these things, and someone started their life from a very young age practicing all these health habits, I don't think it's unreasonable to think that person could quite easily make it to 100, genetics aside of course. 

Now imagine generations and generations of a family with an already long life span from just genetics combined with the those things, and we might see people living into the 110s or more. 

I know this is kind of the ""long way around"" to extending the human life span, but I'd just like to hear your input and anything else you might have to say about it. 

I think certainly medical science will allow us to live longer, but some of it must come from an overall lifestyle change as well.",5,4

**128-bit computers**

I don't just mean for novelty - I mean a legitimate need. A 128-bit machine can address 16 XB of memory at once. From http://superuser.com/questions/49549/when-are-we-going-128-bit-how-it-will-be-what-gets-better

&gt; It's 16 exabytes. To put that in perspective, 1000 petabytes is one exabyte. One petabyte is 1000 terabytes. One terabyte is 1000 gigabytes. Average today is 2 gigabytes of RAM, I believe.

I'd love to see an era where that's somehow possible and has applications. Imagine the things we'd be doing that would need that kind of power. 

To any naysayer - think of the 640KB barrier before being so sure.


**Augmented Reality**

Most people here are familiar with it, but what we're seeing today is just the briefest glimpse into what may soon be possible. Imagine being in the 1960s and networking some computers together and hanging out with Vannevar Bush and listening to his Memex ideas (  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c539cK58ees ). You might think it was a good idea, but even your wildest vision couldn't encapsulate the potential of the Internet fifty years later. 

What might be possible when we have a shared simulated environment overlaid on top of the real world? It's going to be *fucking nuts*, and my fondest hope is that I won't be too old to learn how to user it well when we finally get there.


**Nanorecycling**

This one I've been holding out hope for, for a long time. I'd like to see the application of nanomachines to garbage dumps, applied to the work of sorting materials so that we could easily recycle them. 

I know this brings on fear of the Grey Goo... but imagine if we could harvest every bit of material in the average garbage dump, sequester the dangerous ones, get metal, fuel, fertilizer... it would be incredible.
