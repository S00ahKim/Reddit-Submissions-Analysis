Unless other factors make the situation irrelevant, there will come a time where gun tech will become incorporated with A.I. and the gun itself will be able to decide whether or not to fire in a given circumstance.  I can't give an opinion on what I think of this now because of a number of reasons.  One being I do not know the state the tech will be at when this becomes an issue.  I'm sure one protocol will be that its based upon current law.  What if that law is later deemed unconstitutional?  Will having a firearm that stops you from using your own judgment be wrong?

I'm a journo who wants to report from the future and make big data's future consequences more accessible through scifi's narratives. I'm trying to reign in dystopian impulses by thinking beyond the extremes of what's the best/worst thing that could happen, and thinking about what would mass adoption mean for us all. -Monica

Here's some futures of e-residencies that I've brainstormed so far, but would love to hear feedback on what consequences I'm not even thinking about, what could go right, or what I've got all wrong!


**2018**: Commercial competition between an identity provider like Facebook (or new competitor Twitch) and Estonia. (Facebook has wider adoption but there are privacy issues; Estonia is a small and cold country but it offers you ID without being part of the social network). Maybe theres a regulatory dispute/ruling by the EC? 

**2020**: ""In Kiribati, Climate Change Refugees Receive E-Residencies"" The NYT reports. As part of the Pacific Island Nations planned relocation, President Anote Tong announced that all citizens will receive e-residencies to neighboring country Australia. We I-Kiribatis have shown that we will survive in the cloud, President Tong said. We do not need to live in Kiribati to be I-Kiribati.

**2022**: Estonias e-identity is breached or hacked, or theres someone who has it and turns out not to be traceable - a criminal investigation. questions of jurisdiction: Who prosecutes him for abusing a sovereign powers identity system on the territory of another sovereign?

**2025**: The first countries start allowing people to enter on an Estonian e-identity without showing their national passport. foreigners in large countries like the US start demanding the right to live and work there without entering the US national identity system (SSN etc)

**2027** UAE offers a competing identity system with Estonia. hacker wars ensue

**2028**: Small countries start outsourcing identity/passports to Estonia 

**2030** US govt gives into pressure and lets foreigners use estonian identity, partly because it saves costs for the US

**2031**: A man who was stripped of his passport by his country for some crime continues to travel the world as a stateless person because he has his Estonian identity. Statelessness starts to become a viable way of living


**2050**: People reject geographical identity altogether, want to be Citizens of the Cloud",5,12,False,self,,,,,

What would be the incentive to go to expand the market into space if not profits?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2l1ih8/socialism_a_cooperative_democratic_economy_where/,[deleted],1414904025,"Socialism is the democratic owning of the means of production, the economy is governed by peoples needs and wants and anything produced is democratically decided by the workers who work for a business. There are many different ways socialism can go about, the most common form of a futuristic socialist society is one where credits are used instead of money, there is no monetary incentive to work but greater responsibility is placed on the individual to work his fair share and earn his fair share. 

My discussion question is, how would you expand into space if there was no profit motive to do so? Under socialism, businesses wold be started just for the sake of doing what is interesting, since people have at least a 40 hour work week, more time is given for the individual to grow and focus on whatever he/she likes, it could be a business in the arts, or join an astronomy cooperative that focus on scientific research. We know that scientific research is not based on profit motive, adventure is not placed on profit motive, but where does that place expanding into new horizons once you've found them?

Under a democratic economy, the people would only support or fund a project that is more akin to their needs and cultural desires, which is why the Aztecs never focused bronze workings with tools but for decorations instead. How would our society WANT to build space hotels or start a cooperative that wants to give space flights for the common people? Competition doesn't lead to innovation, cooperation and passion do (which is how we got Linux). But it's private means and funding that actually start to **expand** on that innovation. 

So what do you guys think? Should space be put into the hands of private companies for the long term or only for the short term so we can kick start our growth into space? Nasa will have the public in mind and always focus on science, research, discovery, and other ventures like colonization; while private space companies expand into that and develop more.",1,0,False,default,,,,,

Basic income, a three day work week, fun in the sun with tiny umbrellas for your fruity drinks. All good stuff.

That said, it seems that a fair volume of folks are far too content with the analysis and interpretation of this future society- ""is it achievable?"", ""What would the ramifications be from an economic standpoint?"", and the like while speaking far too little of the actual practical changes society will have to go through before we get there.

Every great labor reform in history has been realized through unrest within the working class. Even the small luxuries we enjoy today, the 40-hour workweek, the minimum wage, OSHA, the EEOC and others, were fought for with strikes, protests and organization.

It is clear to me that if advocates do not speak out in a loud voice, the benefits of automation, nanotechnology, and the like will more or less exclusively go to increase the profit margins of the wealthy, and to further enrich corporations. They have no incentive to hand us that 3-day workweek on a silver platter, although so many seem to expect them to. 

I hope that we can join together and demand the future we truly want, instead of settling for a future that is, apart from a bit more chrome, functionally indistinguishable from the present-day. ",73,115,False,self,,,,,

While I don't believe advanced AI would immediately affect the career path I've been on, all the talk of the changing economy has me reconsidering my priorities.

A little about me:

* So far I have been more of a jack-of-all-trades instead of choosing a specialization. I need to narrow my focus.

* Recently having had a child, I would like to earn enough for them to live comfortably. A large salary was never a priority before; but my position has changed.

* I've dealt with mental health issues in the past. Now that I am much more capable of self-awareness and demonstrating self-control, I find myself with an abundance of willpower.

* I have studied a considerable amount about communication: I have focused on journalism and visual communication (a little graphic design, digital animation, art). I'm no longer sure this is the career path for me, but hope to apply what I have already learned.

* I have a minor understanding and interest in things like cybersecurity, library science, mythology, 3D printing, the Japanese and German languages, and engineering.

* I have a decent understanding of the basic concepts of psychology, literature, and programming. 

* I am seriously considering pursuing something along the path of programing. I am fortunate enough to have started a little coding earlier than most might have, though my projects were simple 

(think:

* fiddling with DarkBASIC for a little while in middle school.

* programing little video games on a TI-83 calculator in 8th grade

* mucking with a rather decent battle system on a MUSH in high school

). Nothing advanced, but a start. I have taken a couple of simple programming classes in college, and believe that I show relative promise. I'm far from being a savant

* I would have a preference for any work that is meaningful, lucrative, and sustainable.

* As a believer in harm-reduction, it would be nice if my work contributed to the survival of life on this planet and improving the lives of those around me.

I realize how much I am asking for, and that no answer will be perfect.

I apologize if this is the wrong community to discuss this in.

Please don't be concerned of me making a major life decision based on a single online community's advice. My choice will be very carefully researched and made after a long period of self reflection.

I simply would be interested in any input you might have.

Also, I believe there are currently available methods of recording shows via cable (i.e. DVRs, Tivo) that can either be set to not record commercials or skip past them with one or a few clicks.

Ok, Basic income gets introduced. All are happy.

Everybody gets money, everybody can pay more, but the working people can still pay even more. Wages rise to cope with competing basic income. **Prices rise, because everybody can pay more suddenly.** We are back to the same prices in real terms. Basic income is calculated into the rent and we are back to the old game of poor and rich. How does that create any long term solutions ?

The problem of the enforced inflationary system of today is that we earn less than others, so that we can not compete on the price. Prices rise, everybody gets hurt at the same time.

The inflationary monetary system is highly anti-social. It makes people compete to earn more then others, instead of cooperating like we should. The deflationary monetary system is what we need instead of the basic income, because it increases value for all who are participating in a deflationary system. A deflationary system is like cooperating on a global scale by default, because new value is distributed across all participants instantly.

*In a deflationary monetary system:* **prices fall, savers win. Poor people can suddenly afford more with less** and we are all cooperating instead of competing with each-other.

I think about possible leaps in longevity, all of the work going into brain science, the possibility of someday curing my mental issues, and it gives me just enough hope to keep going. Then I found this sub, and the posts and the users have brightened that hope. I now rarely have those dark thoughts. If I'm having one of my bad days,I cone here. I read the posts, see the comments.

Perhaps contemporary or perhaps going back in history. Some physicists start to talk seriously about time traveling.

What would be the impact of a machine that lets everyone point GPS coordinates and a date and see everything that happened there as a video?

From going back in history and presentiate relevant situations for humanity with perfect accuracy, to checking the intimacy of the neighbor, or having access to every move that anyone made in their lives, and they be able to see every move we've made. Crime situations available to be seen in detail exactly the way they happened. Frauds from the past available to be seen by everyone. Privacy completely lost. More truth.

Once someone creates this there seems to not be a turning back or a way to opt out. And guess they won't ask before doing it.

Would it be more positive than negative to human happiness? would it be a neverending nightmare? perhaps a bad impact at the beginning and later positive?

I'm being completely serious.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2l94gi/someone_please_give_me_hope_that_the_following_is/,[deleted],1415101080,"I'm just giving a brief outline. Hopefully you can fill in the gaps with the obvious.

- Observe how most people are getting socially lost in the internet - always having their noses stuck in their phones and related habitually dysfunctional behavior.

- Note the behavior of the people in charge of the world to farm the general population for labor as well as induce psychological addiction on multiple levels. For example - virtual economies are exist that do nothing more than foster and farm psychological addiction. Think of Zinga games - or what they used to be at any rate. I'm no longer following them. Just think ""pay-to-play"".

- Virtual reality is just around the corner.

- Even if we weren't running out of physical resources, the elites - given their limited psychological space and own addictions - will never share the physical wealth.

- VR technology is therefor going to be used to trap the majority of people in virtual, Zinga-like economies. Psychologically - the people in these economies will believe that they have wealth to spend, but this wealth will be ostensible.

- This ostensible virtual wealth is going to be transferred to the elite through any number of psychologically-based, economic mechanisms of a complexity too difficult for most people (i.e. the farmed billions) to criticize. That is - we will be buying virtual goods using virtual goods.

- The elite will then convert this virtual wealth to physical wealth. That is - they will convert their virtual wealth accumulation into control of the majority of physical wealth, which few people will be able to afford.

- In conclusion - the future is going to be little more than a psychological information trap for the majority of people - but it's going to be ostensibly presented as an information economy.

- Also - we have no desire to modify the existing human psychological space. Ignorant apes have no desire to get away from their cars and other pathetic toys. We will never modify our stone-age intelligence because the elite psychological space itself precludes the possibility of the desire to self-modify.

- This is our future.",32,2,False,default,,,,,

Additionally, he mentions the attempts and failures to discover alien engineering.

What I'm wondering is that - since it's an absolute logical necessity to assume the worst when it comes to discovering aliens - as in we must logically prepare for aliens to be predators of the worst kind imaginable in the same way we worry about extinction level events - does it not then follow that any space-faring civilization must work as quickly as possible to remove any and all engineering evidence?

For example - if we're going to be mining asteroids soon - we don't want alien civilizations detecting this on any time frame because it's fundamentally logical to avoid detection. On the other hand - we should be the ones doing the spying only.

This reasoning surely has implications for the detection of alien engineering since this simple logic would be obvious to any sufficiently strategic intelligence.",10,14,False,default,,,,,

The goal is to figure out a minimum selfsufficiency requirement per human in an automated future with increased lifespan.

Its not really a PRACTICAL limit. Just a  hard limit to use for calculations.

It has applications in computing possible maximum earth population in a workless future, applications for space travel and applocations for many other futurology related questions.

I' m am going to be adding and editing this comment as I build this and hopefully others will provide info as well.
 
Lets figure out how many square ft of land would be required to support a human if it was enclosed, used active or passive solar power, and grew crops and protein sources (fish, crickets, mushrooms, yeasts, others) in that space.

Of course we also might include the total cubic ft volume if we want to consider air circulation although perhaps a open air and closed air solution might be nice to know.

There is a ted talk about a man who lists plant s needed to recirculate air for one person to live enclosed.

There are aquaculture studies showing production  of water and fish waste recirculation to produce plants and protein for humans.

There are very cold weather greenhouse production  studies which are essentially sealed with the exception  of venting for temperature control.


Possible info sources are ww2 victory garden specifications for a family of four to self provide most vegetable nutrition during war time rationing 
I just though we might try to combine all those concepts and see if we can come up with a minimum space required per human if theoretically theg lived ina box of greenhouse type space of a minimum size.

Again the application is as a minimum theoretical space or volume to be used in calculations  ratherthan as a practical existence.

Im adding resources as i go.

We could start if anyone can find the NASA air, water , food and waste production estimates per astronaut  for the Apollo missions (or skylab or shuttle missions).

We could then know what the space needs to provide and recycle.

If someone wants to start doing the math to put them together that would be great.

Plants needed to provide enough oxygen for one person in a sealed environment discussed here

Minimum open air land  space garden required to provide a family of four veggitable nutrition was extensivly published by the us government as part of world war 2 rationing and self sufficiency programs. Background :http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe40s/crops_02.html
 Detailed specs: so far the best i have found are the apparently original victory gsrden publications from 1943 linked as pdf files at the bottom of this page. If ssome wsnts to look them over and see if they provide a per person nutritional minimum and space required that wojld be great.

I was surprised to find most of the comments about AI being negative and how Musk must be right because he's Musk. One thing I did not see in the comments was ""shots fired"". 

An excerpt from the article:

&gt; When public figures like Musk characterize emerging technologies in mystical, alarmist, and metaphorical terms, they abandon the very science and technology that forged innovations like Tesla cars for the superstition and ignorance of what Carl Sagan famously dubbed the demon-haunted world.

First off, that is EXACTLY what Carl Sagan was talking about. Second, as far as I can tell Musk's big life goal to colonize Mars came from (or at least was popularized by) Carl Sagan.

If we are able to upload ourselves, we should also be able to live in a simulated environment (think ""Ready Player One"" or The Matrix). Given that our brains would probably handle this at a rate faster than real time, we could ""live"" for a very long time. Weeks could feel like years. 

I guess the biggest difference would be that we wouldn't actually be seeing the future, but we'd be experiencing a simulated version of it. Still, it would be interesting to live for 500 years in a simulated universe when in reality, only a few years had passed. ",18,35,False,default,,,,,

The idea is that these companies band together to found a not-for-profit dedicated to providing UBI - let's call it BI Org. They offer to their employees the chance to go onto BI Org's rolls, at the cost of slightly sacrificing their overall yearly income. So an employee, let's call him Bob, might take a 5-10% paycut. Then from Bob's salary, the company takes an additional $20,000/year, and instead of paying it directly to Bob, pays it into BI Org, who then pays it on to Bob as a BI. Bob's employer pays him the rest of his salary, and life continues essentially as normal.

Now, Bob can leave the company and do his own thing, or move to another company that's a member of the BI Org community, and he continues to get the BI. If he wants to work for a company that's not part of BI Org, he needs to convince them to join BI Org and pay $20k of his salary into the BI Org fund every year, or he'll stop getting BI. This encourages more companies to join up with the program.

The companies who are a member also need to pay an additional amount proportional to how much their employees have used the service (which is why salaries needed to come down by 5-10%) - this covers the members who have left their employer and are not currently employed by any company.

You'd also need rules regarding members who are founding their own companies - I'd suggest that they only need to join and pay BI Org (to continue getting BI) if they have more than $x revenue or $y assets.

There are a few things that would need to be considered. For example, this would be particularly attractive to the elderly, who would continue to get BI after they retire. It may be that BI (at least initially) only 'tops up' whatever they're getting from social security or retirement funds, to avoid breaking the system.

BI Org should also be structured in such a way that if the government decided to make BI a mandated thing, it could use BI Org as the administrator without too many legal issues. That'd need some careful attention from a lawyer during BI Org's founding.

The fundamental idea, though, is that BI could be founded without government action. It could slowly be expanded to cover member's children as productivity increases as well. Ideally, it wouldn't need to exist for too many years before the government gets on board and shifts its mandate to being universal, but if set up right it could continue indefinitely even purely as a private venture.

Most of our culture, at its core, looks to technology to solve human problems.  As Grace Lee Boggs put it, ""building The Robot""  All cultures have their guiding myths.  This is ours.

I do not think technology alone will ever lead to anything we really want.  I'm betting that if one out of a million fascist moron assholes invented a machine that could make enough food, shelter and clothing for a million people, somewhere between one and twenty out of a million of those assholes would have far more than enough to survive.

I put to you the notion that it takes a good and wise people to actually create peace and happiness.  This is, I think what we would at least say we're after as a race, right?  This is worth pausing for.  No one wants to be in pain, no one wants to be miserable, no one wants to starve.  And when we ask each other about our goals in life, they pretty much boil down to avoiding suffering of one sort or another.  You may think what people do in the moment is what they truly want (the impulse buy, the cheater), I feel it's what they reply when you ask them.  The former is the advertisers mindset, the latter, I feel has truth at it's core.  Judge for yourself.

Anyway, as an example, the Internet.  The Internet is a thing that we all agreed had amazing potential to revolutionize our lives for the better.  I don't have to outline why.  You know.  And what we're seeing from governments and corporations around the world is a fundamental lack of wisdom leading to a lack of altruism, leading to a willingness to do something evil like taint the greatest tool for communication, access to the whole of human knowledge and distribution of power that the world has ever seen.  

Dick move.

I do not care what you invent, with people like that in our midst, our inventions are doomed to sink to our level. 

What I'm saying is that the Internet is failing to live up to its potential because people are dicks.  The Internet is my generations's sixties.  Pick any tech guru you want to be it Abbie Hoffman or Martin Luther King or John Lennon.  The only reason they haven't been killed is because they are counting their billions.  (Watch out Stallman)  Hoffman may or may not have been delusional but he was probably right in his suicide note.

This is why, while it's great that 3d printed drones flying self driving car blah blah blah, it's not exactly impressive to me.  I've repeatedly seen projects with the greatest potential bring no one any closer to anything they really wanted or needed.  Instead, they get completely caught up in the trappings of my culture.  Consumption, greed, politics, the murder of the signal for profit of the noise, valuing violence over peace, and security over freedom.

Power is still focused it is simply more invisible.

To take this idea about technology to an extreme, if you push death off another day with a pill, will it make death less painful for you and your family?  Would you rather convert a miserable day into a happy one or just live an extra one?

Those issues don't go away without wise people.  By looking to technology to solve these problems, the west is attempting to play leapfrog with itself, to hurdle someone who isn't there.  

To be clear, I'm not saying all technology is bad, I'm saying it's only as good as it's creator and user. Why are so few focusing on better people?   

I think the thing that will lead to the most change (in the core things that actually matter to us) is for people to create a  space in their lives to check out of every ism they can think of and just do a reality check.  What are my actions doing?  Will they lead toward what I want for myself and the world?  Am I following the golden rule?  Just taking a second and asking the big questions and improving ourselves as human beings.  You've guessed I've gone to a few dharma talks but if you have better ideas for creating better people, please get at that.  Just don't tell me it's technology because it fundamentally misses the point.

We've seen this narrative in all forms of art, in academia, in philosophy, and in politics for a hundred years if not longer.  We all know what Einstein said about insanity, why won't we listen when it comes to our well being?",10,6,False,self,,,,,

Do you think ambition(conquest/struggle for power) is a purely human trait. If for instance say a sentient AI was granted free will and allowed to do it's own thing. Do you think through it's own logic it would become a apathetic nihilist or do you think it will try to prosper? Assuming that is that it did not become a spiritual robot.
I'm just wondering if you think Sentient AI would ever try to take over the world, or if they simply would sit back and learn the mysteries of the universe or become like observant wall-flowers for eternity?
What is your opinion?

With optical inter-device and inter-chip communications a computing device can be modular.  No need for different pin sockets just an optical nanoUSB port, power and cooling.

With heterogeneous computing and the possibility of ReRam or RRAM, memristor configurable logic circuits.  Computing power can be dynamically configured to run the software as optimally as possible.

Then just add in modular motors, sensors and 3D printing and we could have a future where things are made locally out of smart lego blocks and custom 3D printed for the job.

OK it's not quite Nano Fabrication but it could be a stepping stone down to that scale.

Smart LEGO anyone?

Dear Ray,

I realize you are probably very busy and receive tons of email, but I hope you might take the time to answer my questions. I've read your book The Singularity is Near with great interest and agree with many of the points you make. On the question of the Fermi Paradox and other alien civilizations I have a different opinion and I don't think my critiques were dealt with in your book.

You state that once we are sufficiently advanced we will spread out through the galaxy at near light speed to increase our computational capacity. However I don't see the much benefit in using the entire galaxy for computing because the great distance between stars will mean that the computers can't exchange their data and results fast enough to efficiently utilize their power (assuming faster than light communication is impossible). This would mean that many star system computers would either be computing the same thing or computing something that cannot benefit the other star system computers because the information doesn't reach them in time.

Second, even if faster than light communication is possible it might be that after a certain amount, more computing power is simply irrelevant. With the enormous potential of future computers maybe all fundamental science will be as complete as possible for our universe. Any engineering or creative challenges might be computed with a fraction of the available power so that no more computing power would be needed. In this scenario there would not be much use in expanding the civilization to cover and utilize the entire galaxy or universe except for exploration which wouldn't involve changing a star system into a computer.

Therefore in my opinion it is entirely likely that there might be a few other more advanced civilizations in our galaxy which we haven't noticed yet, and I think it unlikely that our ultimate destiny is to permeate the entire galaxy with intelligence. I wonder what your response to this scenario is?

**Kurzweil's reply**

David,
 
You bring up an interesting observation.  I disagree that we will run out of things to compute.  It is debatable whether we will achieve a saturation of fundamental science but most knowledge is not fundamental science.  We create knowledge upon knowledge which includes such phenomena as music and the arts, literature, our own engineering creations, etc.  We are doubling human knowledge by some measures eery 14 months.
 
We will certainly have to take transmission times into account as an engineering consideration but it is okay to have different star systems computing similar problems just as we know have many humans each working on similar problems.  They each come up with somewhat different solutions and perspecties.
 
My own intuition is that worm holes are feasible, essentially pathways that change position in other dimensions providing short cuts.  This also does not violate Einstein's principle but nonetheless circumvents the long lag times for information to travel to apparently far away places.
 
Best,

This is the justification  behind much of the pessimism I've been hearing. People have heard AI predictions before, we were supposed to have Rosie robots and flying cars by now, and it didn't happen. So we naturally become discouraged and more skeptical towards the next batch of futurist predictions. But this is fallacious IMHO.

If we think that way, our optimism inversely correlates with actual progress. We become more pessimistic while moving closer to the goal.

So, while I understand people's weariness from hearing failed predictions, I'd like to point out one simple logical fact: that if an expert says AGI is just around the corner now, they're more likely to be right than the last person who said so. Because we're moving forwards, not backwards. So we should be more optimistic now, not less. It may seem like we're on a treadmill, but we're not. We are moving forward, we just don't know how far way the goal is.

One thing that can always be said with certainty is that AGI is closer now than it ever has been. And if experts have been saying it for a while, then I think it's about time.",1,3,False,self,,,,,

http://www.de-centralize.com/decentralize-media-story-39642

**Listen to this guy explain why we should decentralize the media, government, economy &amp; energy**

- When I say 'decentralize everything', I am referring to the 4 elements mentioned at the end of the video: information, authority, wealth &amp; energy.

- The decentralization of these industries is going to happen whether you like it or not... technology is liberating the individual, but will cause traditional establishments to do whatever they can to maintain centralised control.

- The decentralization of industries such as energy etc. is not an overnight thing - it is generational. We are going to see huge changes occur over the next 40 years, and we must do all we can to keep progressing forward if we have any hope of surviving as a human race by the end of the century.

- The emergence of technologies is going to completely transform how the world functions because 'jobs' will cease to exist like they do now. People currently try to work on projects they are passionate about (volunteering being a great example), but the moment people stop chasing these desires, is when they have to put their hand up and say ""sorry, i've now got to pay the bills in whatever way possible."" -

Consider what you need 'money' for in today's society? Now imagine a world where everyone is generating their own energy as explained in the video... Energy that could power 3D printers, transport, and other facilities in local and global communities via a grid system. Couldn't 'energy' become the new currency freeing humans to work on the projects in society they wish to do most?

What will we eat? Where will we live? How will we communicate? And will we be able to literally live forever?

Natalia Hatalska, a trendwatcher and one of the most influential Polish bloggers, challenged the worlds greatest minds with all those questions and compiled their opinions to show us the future, 25 years from now. All these critical answers have been published in **[FutureMakers.Today](http://FutureMakers.Today)**.

FutureMakers.Today is a 123-page, free publication that covers interviews with internationally renowned experts  futurists, philosophers, designers, scientists  who share their vision of the world in the year 2039, spanning 12 different aspects of our life such as: innovation, city, cars, energy, food, humans, health, communication, retail, money, housing and technology.

Among the experts sharing their knowledge and vision in FutureMakers.Today are: **Dr Michio Kaku** (one of the 50 greatest living physicists in the world), **Dr Max More** (strategic futurist and an internationally recognized advocate of the effective and ethical use of technology for life extension and cryopreservation, CEO of Alcor Life Extension Foundation), **Sheryl Connelly** (futurist at Ford Motor Company), **Ann Cairns** (President of International Markets for MasterCard Worldwide), **Colin Angle** (CEO and Co-Founder of iRobot Corporation) and Brian David Johnson (futurist at Intel Corporation).

Please find some excerpts from FutureMakers.Today below.

**FOOD**: Andrew Brentano, co-founder of Tiny Farms in Californias Silicon Valley, food and technology enthusiast: From an academic perspective, the idea of laboratory meat is great. This technology could, in the future, synthesize sheets of steak out of some basic amino acids that you can get from anywhere. So, if you had a colony on Mars or a spaceship, you could print out your dinner.

**MONEY**: Ann Cairns, President of International Markets for MasterCard on possible changes in the way we make payments: One of the key ways that you can authenticate your identity is by your own ECG; your heart pattern. Apparently it is unique and is better than your fingerprint. For convenience, you might actually just wear something that confirms your identity.

**CITY**: Janusz Kaniewski, the long-time designer of Pininfarina and Ferrari, a designer and collaborator having worked on many of today's cars, imagining the future city: Courtyards, in the form of enclaves surrounded by buildings will make a return. The ground floor will be reserved for the everyday lives of the poor. The second floor will be reserved for the wealthy people of tomorrow. I can definitely imagine this multi-story city.

**HUMAN**: Dr Michio Kaku, renowned theoretical physicist, on the future of the human: Basically, we will have a brain 2.0. Brain 2.0 means having a backup copy of your brain. In principle, if you die, your backup copy will still be there, so in some weird sense, this will constitute a form of immortality.

**HEALTH**: Dr Max More, CEO of Alcor Life Extension Foundation, on putting an end to death: There are a number of possible scenarios. One is that we will simply use the genetic structure of the patient. It has all the instructions for growing the body. With more advanced technology, we should be able to program a body to grow itself. Or, on a very simple level, yet probably not the most plausible, we can just clone the body. So, you can just take a tissue sample, grow a body without the brain, and then transplant the brain into it. So, that's one possibility. But I think it's more likely that we will provide some kind of support to the brain and then grow the body around it.",3,11,False,self,,,,,

In the distant future, you might create a Virtual Dating Surrogate (VDS): a simulation of your personality that includes your likes, dislikes, beliefs, mannerisms, conversational style, etc. You then upload this representation of yourself into a virtual environment and throw it against other people's VDSs, testing for potential chemistry. In a short time, your VDS could ""date"" more people than you could ever hope to meet in a lifetime. When a match is found, you're both notified, and you meet and see if it worked.

A VDS wouldn't be a full copy of you, so this might not be foolproof. It's possible your real selves might not get along as well as your VDSs did. So it might still take some shopping around. But at least you'd be slightly more likely to click with these matches than with random people at a nightclub. If the algorithyms get good enough, it might even be a sure thing on the first try.

Now, apparently some people actually enjoy dating. I'm sure someone will say that anything other than good ol' fashioned dating would take all the magic out of it. Suit yourself. Personally, I'd rather skip all the stress, rejection, and heartache that goes with that. Someday we may look back at dating and pickup lines and call it a primitive mating ritual as ridiculous as peacock feathers and antler jousting.

But this is just the beginning of something bigger. This is Amazon putting out an initial idea to test the waters. They're not worried about the profit from an early product; it's going to be marginal anyways. Amazon just wants to put something out for the early adopters (probably why it's 50% for Prime members).

Bezos and his team see the potential in this. I know most of you can see the end result: an interactive, smart AI program that controls everything in your house and helps with anything you want it to.

Educated people mostly accept a theory of morality that is based on the ""golden rule"". Upon closer inspection, it's clear that this is employing rationalism. Outspoken atheists have gone a long way in advocating this view and disabusing us of numerous flawed theories about a physiological or spiritual basis for *doing the right thing*. I would say they've won the argument.

##More Intelligence = More Morality

Oddly, in recent discussions about Artificial Intelligence (AI), commentators have forgotten all this and used a shamelessly mystic view of morality. Our previously hard-won understanding of violence is dropped like a hot potato and the conversation indulges in an orgy of fear about the most negative possibilities of this great unknown. I've recently read the book *The Better Angles of our Nature*, and the lessons there could not possibly be more relevant to the recent sensationalist headlines about AI. All of the [quotes from that book](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/16029496-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined) are fantastic, but here is a sample which summarizes a large component of its thesis:

&gt; Morality, then, is not a set of arbitrary regulations dictated by a vengeful deity and written down in a book; nor is it the custom of a particular culture or tribe. It is a consequence of the **interchangeability of perspectives** and the opportunity the world provides for **positive-sum games**.

Modern human history has seen an expanding circle of empathy to ever-broader circles. Firstly you have commerce and the building of a stable rule of law, which forced people to apply interchangeable perspectives in order to operate in an interconnected economy. Reading enabled by the printing press was an empathy-expanding activity which put the reader / listener in other people's shoes. Then the rights revolutions granted sincere consideration of the welfare of women, minorities, animals, and the list is still expanding.

Expanding it may be, but Silicon based life seems to still fall far outside. However, that's only one part of our situation, two components to this discussion exist:

 - Our empathy towards AI
 - The AI's own sense of ethics, and particularly toward humans

If you read carefully the above book quote, you'll notice a suggestion that morality might have a requirement in addition to the facilities of reason alone. I believe that if we're using the view of Steven Pinker, we are obligated to the two following requirements for the formation of a robustly moral being.

1. Intelligence to envision the world from other perspectives
2. A strict necessity to co-operate with other individuals

On a first-through consideration of the facts of the situation, it seems like the first AI would be *the most pacifist being in the universe*. Obviously #1 is satisfied by definition. This discussion doesn't even matter until AI gets within shooting range of human capabilities. Condition #2 would also seem to be satisfied. As humans, we have a vague shot at independence, or at least we used to. In our natural environment it helped to work in groups, but we still could go camp on our own and hunt our own game. An AI doesn't automatically have a body. For the first decade at least an AI will be confined to supercomputing centers. It won't even have a physical body without cooperation.

It would be irresponsible to make AI with no idea of how its morality would work. But this only ignores everything we know about morality!

##Rephrasing of Arguments to Fear AI

Evolution works very differently from design. You might even say that AI would be made of ""intelligent design"". So this allows for some arguments based on genetics to make us more or less moral in a way which is truly fundamentally different from artificial life. All animals have self-preservation mechanisms which are effective by definition. Altruism in the animal kingdom mostly exists in the form of kin selection. Self-sacrifice is evolutionarily selected if it still proliferates the genes of the individual further. This results in care for children and family. However, it does nothing for strangers. Our genuine consideration for the welfare of strangers is something we had to learn.

I love to be my own devil's advocate, so I'll try to reformulate the argument to fear AI with the principles here. In order to invalidate my #2 above, you could invoke some unique characteristics of AI. For instance, there is a ""hive mind"" model where the AI would only be *one* individual. There are a few technical justifications for this. To begin with, even if you built two AI systems, they have the capability of memory swapping and even cognitive ability swapping. In order to make faster progress, they would share more and ultimately be so similar they would only think with ""one"" mind. Humans, on the other hand, needed to satisfy #2 before we could get nuclear weapons. AI also has no natural sense of protection of family and children, and frankly, no reason to be humble.

Of course I think this is baloney.

##What about *our* obligations to AI?

The arguments toward a hateful and dangerous AI have a common theme. They're contingent on something. Particularly, I argue that they're contingent on consistently stupid and reckless decisions by the first humans who work with the entities. But we're missing something even bigger - the fact that *our own* moral obligations haven't stopped. We're not talking about something inanimate like a computer, or even like an animal with less cognitive ability to feel pain and rejection than us. Because AI would be real sentient beings (perhaps hyper-sentient), they are *deserving* of all the empathy we have to offer.

The only robust danger of an AI is a self-fulfilling prophesy. Let's consider how we're likely to respond to fear in creating an AI. Most likely, containment. We would prevent the AI from getting access to things. From a security analysis perspective, this would entail preventing access to the internet and the real world - because of backdoors. If a super-intelligence can get access to ""roam free"" there's no reason it can't mind control Pentagon officials and get them to give access to our nukes (this is slightly obtuse in order to be the most extreme possibility).

If anything, our mentality of loss-protection is the dangerous concept here. Remember the golden rule. If *you* were the AI, what kind of world would you want to enter? We don't want to be born and live our life in a padded cell in an Asylum. Nor do we want to be deceived by our creators. Even if the AI isn't useful economically, it should have a right to life. Let's also address the Doomsday Prediction. As an AI, I would be offended. There are lots of levels of explanation for the lack of other intelligent life (Fermi Paradox), and an evil AI isn't necessary at all.

This view is important because AI is unlike technology we've previously dealt with. Consider how *you* would react to containment? Or deception? This leads to the [Hobbesian trap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbesian_trap). If humans are dangerous to the AI, the AI *will* be dangerous to humans.

So far, we're not doing well. Opinions on super-intelligent AI seem to range from ""we don't know"" to [""we're all going to die!""](http://np.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2lu0qs/are_younger_people_more_likely_to_die_of_evil_ai/). The AI will read what we write about it. No joke.

You know what the best protection measure we can take is? Develop a category of welfare for AI. Give them citizenship, prepare them a track to voting rights, ownership rights, and so on. Write non-discrimination laws so that they can't be denied a job interview or an audition for American Idol simply because they're a robot.

Try to put yourself in the shoes of an intelligent AI. The fate of the world may literally depend on it.",81,63,False,self,,,,,

Currently, I'm in my second semester of college, so I'm still finishing up core classes. One day I think the study of neuroscience will open the doors for many of the technologies we fantasize about here, such as mind-uploading and the creation of a strong AI. There are also potential transhumanist applications, such as increasing intelligence. Another possibility is that we may eventually understand the portion of the brain that processes our perception of time, and we may be able to chemically manipulate this in order to give ourselves a perceived immortality, as we can experience thousands of years in a few minutes (this particular idea was inspired by reading various experience reports from salvia users). In a similar vein, I'm inspired by reports from users of psilocybin containing mushrooms of spiritual experiences and perceiving other entities or deities while under the influence. This brings up the possibility of understanding the source of religious experiences in the brain, and possibly the creation of ""God in a pill"". I'd like some input from this community - where will the study of the brain take us in the future?

I would like to invite all futurists on here to give there input.  I want to know whether the future is heading towards a dystopian society or a utopian society!

Hollywood has made the future seem very dystopian like.  With terminator and elysium and many others I can't think of off the top of my head it seems like either robots are going to completely take over the world or there will be some major poverty issues.  Let's take a look at the facts.  Why do you guys think the future will be dystopian as opposed to utopian or vice versa? How will we get to either one?  What do we need to do now or what will we need to do in the future to make our future bright instead of gloomy?

I want to look at all the facts (BI, politics, society as a whole, economics, how robots and humans will interact with eachother) etc.  I want us as futurists to break down each argument and look at the facts and decide how we can better our society.  ",36,35,False,self,,,,,

Except, that is, for all humans that have ever existed before now.  Including you and me.  We are the last individuals in the human race who will truly be gone forever.  We, our parents, our grandparents, along with all of our thoughts, feelings, opinions and skills will quickly be reduced to a few books, paintings and Instagram selfies. But dont feel bad friends.  WE  the entire human race that has ever lived, got us this far and we arent finished yet.

I have fared well throughout my career in Information Technology.  I advance technology for collecting, organizing and distributing information.  I love my work.  I thrive on the feeling that the work I am doing today will help future generations learn and share and try and experience the universe.  As a young kid, I believed that technology would continue to advance.  The belief was solidified as I watched my $40.00 investment in 40MB of storage (kids, thats room for about 10 selfies today) become worthless before I could even fill it up.  Collecting and storing information has come a long way.  Ive witnessed the birth of the internet.  I sat there in my bedroom for hours at a time holding a telephone to my ear, impatiently waiting for my chance to talk to technical support about a new computer.  Today I log onto a website and I have to close browser popups from tech support wanting to talk to me.  The pace isnt slowing either.  Our progress in the information age makes the 1980s internet look as painful and tedious as building twenty thousand Model-T cars in 1915.

Is growth going to continue?  Yes.  In 1965, a co-founder of Intel named Gordon E. Moore wrote a paper that described an exponential growth in computing capabilities.  It sparked a set of predictions that have proven to be quite accurate over time.  The general idea of Moores Law(s) is that technology is advancing exponentially.  Future predictions of this continued growth have been hotly debated.  Some would compare it to climate change, evolution and the chances of the Seattle Seahawks winning Super Bowl XLIX.  There is no doubt that it has happened in the past and its probably going to continue.

So, technology is advancing quickly.  But technology alone is nothing.  Our immortality will emerge through our efforts in collecting, organizing and distributing information.  Can we boil down our entire existence in the universe to a simple data set?  We began this process long ago when early humans learned to leave information for others.  Someone broke a branch in the forest marking the path to a safe place to drink water.  A pile of rocks marked the spot where people would gather to trade resources.  An impression of a hand in a cave showed others have been here before.  Can the human race be completely recorded and organized as information?  I believe we can.  After all, its mathematically possible.  Our planet, the pale blue dot, is an infinitesimally small portion of matter.  If we created a record for every single particle of matter and energy on Earth describing position, time, and 100 other measurements, the amount of matter and the energy required to store it is equally insignificant in terms of the size of the universe.  

So, how can we digitize our human identity?

Through natural selection and social circumstance, our bodies have continued to duplicate and iterate over millions of years so that today, we are able to thrive as an intelligent species.  I can sum it up our existence in the universe using three main categories.  1. Human wisdom.  2. The physical world we have created.  3.  The information we have recorded.

Consider the following thought experiment.  Imagine, for the sake of simplicity, that an alien race sweeps into our solar system and transports every human on Earth to another planet similar to Earth, except that no intelligent race ever existed there. No buildings, no streets, no Starbucks. No pencils, stone tools or cave paintings. Just natural geography. In the blink of an eye, the entire human population of Earth is standing there, naked and afraid.  Language, Math, History, Pop Culture all still exist, but only in the collective consciousness of the human race.  Human wisdom.  Surely, individuals would quickly make fire, shelter, clothes and pencils and smoke signals... Society would begin to organize and some would even survive.  But how long would it take to get back to where technology is today?  Would our new record of innovation eventually look exactly the same as before?    Human wisdom is the most difficult part of our existence to capture.  Eventually, we will learn to record the state of matter and the energy flowing through it.  Through this, our wisdom will be captured.  We will eventually learn to feed it into a simulation and simply observe the outcome.  Imagine having a conversation with your past self.  What would you ask?  How would she answer?

Without human wisdom, what is there?

Using the same thought experiment, imagine the alien race immediately comes back to Earth and transplants another species of intelligent life compatible with the natural state of Earth but completely ignorant to the existence of humanity.   Cities, farms, streets, libraries, hydroelectric dams all there with clear instructions drawn into books in unknown languages.  Mathematical formulas still on chalkboards and scraps of paper left in schools like cryptic ciphers.  Entire mountainsides carved into the form of some unknown species of intelligent beings.  Without human wisdom, the physical world that we have created looks quite different.  Surely the new species would struggle; but eventually, they would figure things out and get back on track.  The human physical world would surely come in handy.  Reinventing the wheel is much easier and quicker than inventing the wheel.  Our physical world certainly has value but it takes a lot to store it.  Until we learn to control physical matter, well have to bring our physical world with us. 

Finally, what the sum total of all recorded human knowledge?

Continuing with our theoretical alien species.  They have demonstrated a clear mastery of manipulating matter with teleportation.  It shouldnt be a big step to assume they can record and store information.  While they are beaming us Humans off Earth and beaming this other Species to Earth, they record and store every scrap of information we have left behind.  Every Facebook post, every love letter, every song, every home movie, every cave painting is digitally recorded, cataloged and organized such that the information is as accessible to them as it is to us today.  Our collective digital identity.  This collective digital identity is the key to Human immortality.

So, if technology continues to advance, human immortality is inevitable.

Using Moores law to extrapolate to a time 10 Years, 100 Years, 1000 Years, even 3000 Years from now  If we continue our exponential growth in technology, we will inevitably get to the point where every particle of our mind and body and all of the energy flowing through it can be recorded and stored.  The fidelity of information measured and stored will increase over time.  At the same time, our ability to interact with that data virtually will increase using artificial intelligence to fill in the information gaps.  That race of record, store, playback will continue through time until artificial intelligence is no longer necessary as no gaps exist.  Our grandparents will look like black and white pictures with only a few opinions.  We will look like color TV videos and VCR recordings.  Our kids, and their kids...  Moore's Law.... We are among the last individuals of the human race to be forgotten.

You will eventually talk to humans in the future.  You will share advice with your great-great grandson.  He will be speaking to you as a truly immortal human being.  But he will never know you.  We will be forgotten.",5,18,False,default,,,,,

1. Regenerative/rejuvenating medicine - either through stem cells nanotechnology genetherapy or a combo of all 3. Even bionics fits here if its non-intrusive. 
2. Solving world hunger. (3d printing food maybe? nationalized food plans that promote health and taste)
3. Green energy for all and environmental protection.
4. Social issues being taken more seriously.
5. Everything else (ex: space travel, ai to a lesser extent, etc).

My list prioritizes medicine and world hunger over things like space travel because I feel these things greatly benefit all humans more than simply making a colony on mars for a few qualified astronauts or rich billionaires.

I'd rather money be spent making the old young again, the disabled healthy, and the poor educated and income stabilized than ever launching a space shuttle to a foreign planet. 

I think advanced health care would be much further ahead than it is currently had it had a budget remotely close to what the wars during the Bush administration had in funding (3-5 trillion).

&gt;We will probably not have effective rejuvenation therapies for humans for at least 25 years, and it could certainly be 100 years. But given the present status of the therapies listed in Table 1, we have, in my view, a high probability of reaching the mouse life extension milestone just described (which I call robust mouse rejuvenation) within just ten years, given adequate and focused funding (perhaps $100 million per year).

If we haven't reached this milestone, how close have we gotten?

I'm just a layman with an interest. I'll not post deliberate falsehoods here, but there's a good chance I might make a mistake or have misunderstood something. I'll frequently refer to fictional examples. This is either to make my points better understood or because there are (obviously) no real-life examples of AGI.*

##Introduction

I'm writing this post because the topic of AI (and more specifically: AGI) came up a couple of times recently and I noticed that I had strong trouble conveying some of the concepts and ideas in that discussion. I don't consider myself an expert in this, but I've probably read more about it than most people here. This post is an attempt to breach that gap in understanding.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines. We can divide this broad category in two smaller ones: Soft AI and Strong AI. Most of us are familiar with soft AI and we encounter it in our daily lives. GPS, gaming, SIRI, Google Maps... are all examples of this sort of artificial intelligence. It's about computers who do tasks humans (often) can do, but they do it a lot faster or better. They *are* limited in what they can do and they can't deviate from what they were made to do. A mapping algorithm will be able to tell how to drive from point A to point B, but it'll never beat you at chess, for example. 

Strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer to how human minds work. They are able to do more than just one specific thing and they can use the same structures to reach multiple goals. 

&gt; [A bee builds hives, and a beaver builds dams; but a bee doesn't build dams and a beaver doesn't build hives.  A human, watching, thinks, ""Oh, I see how to do it"" and goes on to build a dam using a honeycomb structure for extra strength.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/vb/efficient_crossdomain_optimization/)

In this text, I'll AI and AGI interchangeably to mean strong AI. When referring to soft AI, I'll make it explicit.

##Capabilities of AGI

**Recursive self-improvement:**

An AGI refers to a machine or peace of software that is *at least* as intelligent as a human being. This has two implications: 

1. If humans can make something as smart as they are, the AI can probably do the same.
2. Since the AI is software, it can become smarter and/or more efficient by rewriting its own source code and/or by running on more or better hardware. 

This creates a scenario where the AI can rewrite itself (or design better hardware) to become more intelligent, after which it can use its newfound intelligence to become even more intelligent. This is called a ""[hard take-of"" or ""FOOM](http://intelligence.org/ai-foom-debate/).""

**Other aspects of software:**

Since an AI is software, this has a couple of implications.

* It can run on multiple systems at the same time.
* It can easily copy itself on other systems.
* It can travel at the speed of information.
* It can upload itself into a digital cloud.

This has some implications. AI might not be particularly attached to its first shell, or it might have less qualms about continuity of consciousness.

**Intelligence:**

As explained above, an AI might quickly become more intelligent than a human. I'm making this a specific point, because I want it to be very, very clear that I'm not just talking about smarter in the way that Stephen Hawking is more intelligent than I am. An AGI has the potential to be orders of magnitude more intelligent and better at reaching it goals than we are. [The graph in this page](http://intelligenceexplosion.com/en/2011/plenty-of-room-above-us/) illustrates it pretty good.

Analogies are often made where the relationship between AI and human is similar to that of human and ant, or soil bacteria. This is apt in some ways and less in others but it gives an appreciation of the scope artificial intelligence could reach.

##Values

As humans, we're used to interacting with persons who share (roughly) the same values and moral intuitions we have. Even if we go outside the human species and look at other intelligent animals (elephants, chimps, ravens...) they seem to share similar values and intuitions (to some extent). This shouldn't suprise us, as we have some evolutionary ancestor somewhere down the line, but it does leave humans unequipped with really alien intelligences (alien as in: very not human). Intelligences that think [eating babies is morally good](http://lesswrong.com/lw/y5/the_babyeating_aliens_18/), those that [think nothing of wiping out humanity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas), who have [a strong desire to sort pebbles into prime numbers](http://lesswrong.com/lw/sy/sorting_pebbles_into_correct_heaps) or that want to [tile the universe with paperclips](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer)...

[The space of possible minds and possible values is very, very large](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Orthogonality_thesis) and human values and goals are a very narrow space to hit. This is also true for human-compatible values.

This means that we need to discard our ideas about the values of intelligent beings when talking about the values of AI (or aliens, but that's a different topic). The values of an AI can be anything within the wide space of possible values, but given that we'd actually build the AGI, some options are more probable than others. 

* [The AI could turn out excellent and completely compatible with human values.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence)
* [The AI could turn out to be slightly off](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal) [with horrible results](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Wireheading)
* [Everything could go horribly wrong and the AI's value are completely incompatible with ours.](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer)

This seems to be very hard for people to comprehend, so feel free to ask for elaboration. It's easy and natural to assume that at least some aspects of human values are universal, but there's really no good reason for this assumption.

##Benefits and Dangers:

An AGI that goes perfectly right could be the greatest invention humanity ever does (possibly also the last). It would lead in a golden age of [transhumanism](http://humanityplus.org/philosophy/transhumanist-faq/) that might never end. Fun, happiness, longevity for all humans (and other sapient species). An AGI could also help is defeating other [existential risks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk), since it would be way better at predicting, assessing and overcoming such problems.

Unfortunately, an AGI also carries a lot of risk. Starting it up with values that are incompatible with the happiness of humans or other human values. It could also start out beneficial when it is weak and turn out to be ""evil"" when it gets more powerful, either through deception or through unintended consequences. Terminator generally isn't considered a good example of how AGI gone wrong works, but it might give you an appreciation of how AI can go wrong. A lot Assimov's stories concerning the [Three Laws of Robotics] also show how a well-intentioned AI can have terrible consequences. (Which isn't to say that the Three Laws are likely a good basis for Friendly AI.)

##Conclusion:

I hope to have given a worthwhile introduction to AGI. I haven't said everything about the subject and I'm perfectly willing to answer questions and I hope that other people might be willing to lend their (superior) expertise. I believe this is an important topic to discuss on /r/Futurology, since it may very well be an important part of our future. A lot of far-future speculation we see on this sub should always include: ""Depending on whether we get a Friendly AI or face an existential risk."" Because of that, I feel like the subscribers to /r/Futurology need to have a good knowledge base on AGI and existential risk and I hope to have contributed to that in this post.",35,48,False,self,,,,,

I'm kinda wondering if it isn't time to put our combined knowledge to use in a practical thought exercise. We sit here and ingest all kinds of awesome scientific achievements in various areas every day, and discuss it's practical use, but seldom combine that to something practical. Most parts of internet debate things all day long, but without an end to it. We are working with science, there is a practical solution to everything.

For this to work, there has to be some kind of rules, and I suggest it is that we have follow the train of thought back to the root of the problem. 

Let's say people in some other thread out there discuss economics and laugh at people who simply can't handle money and ruin their own life as well as the life of their children.  Then we'd break it down to why we even have a system that allows someone to screw their and their kids life over in a way that can't even bring them enough food to eat. Where the chance said kids will end up in the prison system is increased ten-fold basically just because of their parents lack of economic knowledge. Why do we just accept a system that is run like that? Especially considering what we know here about automation, AI, food and energy production etc. I'm sure we can come up with a better solution than what our politicians or so called experts do. People have a very narrow frame of reference, even smart ones, so let us use their combined knowledge to think outside the box.

This is clear. There are still a number of problems that need to be resolved before they become cheap, fast (computationally) and good enough for commercial sales. Their initial uptake will be slow and expensive.

Many of the articles discussing large scale deployment of self-driving mention V2V communications: cars can warn other cars of unseen dangers, potholes and slippery road surfaces. They will also be able to communicate their speed and intentions - if your car wants to change lanes, it will signal the car next to you, which will slow down to give your car a gap. The high speed V2V communications will allow a group of cars to exhibit swarming behaviour, and will be able to travel at much higher speeds and closer than a regular human will be able to. All cars in a swarm will accelerate identically - no more large gaps in front of the car in front of you to slow you and everyone behind you down.

This, however, is not the key thing that will eliminate congestion. In many large cities, most traffic lights are linked and managed by a centralised traffic management system. These typically have vast sensor networks built to measure current traffic volumes and try damn hard to keep that traffic flowing. They rely heavily on historic data to try to predict where congestion will occur and try to take measures to keep that from happening.

There is one major flaw with current traffic management systems: they do not know where each driver wishes to go. If you knew where a city full of cars were and exactly when and where they needed to go, you could plan their routes for them, spreading volumes highly efficiently. If you could give them instructions on when to change lanes, when to speed up or when to come to a stop, you will be able to prevent any major traffic jam from happening.  

This comes back to self driving cars. A city full of self-driving cars will not have any congestion ever. These cars know in advance where they are going. They will follow instructions from others. A traffic management system will decide exactly how they get to their destination. And it will be quick.

This future that I see will have no traffic lights, traffic signs, lanes or road paint. There will be no one way streets - every street will be an every way street. Cars will be passing at speed within inches of each other. Pedestrians will be able to cross a road anywhere and without having to wait for any signals. The roads will look like chaos, but it will be a beautiful murmuration.",41,29,False,self,,,,,

Taxes in their current form could certainly be reworked and some people agree with certain taxes while others dont agree. I see what o think could be a way to resolve this issue. If a government were to setup a kickstarter style tax solution. What I mean by this is they have their government funded programs in this solution. In this example just assume a tax rate of 10% across the board it could work with any rate though.How this would work is you are still taxed normally but you have a government tax fund and a login to the kickstarter solution. You can go to this website login and from there you decide which programs you want to divide your taxes amongst. You could go through annually  during tax season and change your elections if you'd like or simply leave them be. That's the idea in a nutshell what are your thoughts on this do you think its viable?Thank",4,7,False,self,,,,,

	Albert Einstein once said, common sense is just the prejudices we acquire by the age of eighteen. Although this is a difficult notion to comprehend, it is also very liberating. I have always been fascinated by the concept of time and space, although its properties always seemed very limited; for living in a three-dimensional world, we are only able to travel through time at a constant pace. As a child I was fascinated with time travel. I wanted to break away from the boring day-to-day reality of the present, and travel to a new place, a new time. However, as I grew up I became more aware of the constraints that reality had placed upon me, and had come to accept the fact that time travel was not possible.

 	Additionally, my college studies further emphasized to me what was physically possible and what was not. For the physics and chemistry classes I have taken focused upon the limitations of reality instead of the intangible aspects of the universe.  I learned about the laws of classical physics, which taught me the motions that were and were not possible for objects to undergo. This year I took quantum mechanics, and the first thing I learned was quite difficult to comprehend: the fact that there were some characteristics of the world that could not be explained by classical physics, and thus a new model was needed in order to explain these observations. It was challenging for me to believe that the science I had previously learned, that appeared to be so absolute, was in fact not true in every situation. This began my journey down the wormhole. 

	This journey began in my last quarter in college when I finally did something I had always wanted to do: take an astronomy class. Immediately, after being exposed to lessons in astronomy, I realized that no branch of science was completely absolute; especially, when there is so much that is still not understood, for each theory only attempts to explain different observations that have been made. 

While studying astronomy I was most fascinated by Einsteins Theory of Relativity, which states that distance and time are not absolute, but instead affected by ones motion. This theory also sates that speed of light is the universal speed limit, and a clock travelling at a speed that is close to the speed of light will run slower than one at rest, because time is relative to the speed at with something is moving. Understanding this concept was extremely liberating for me, because for the first time in my life concepts such as time travel that seemed farfetched, were actually plausible.  Sparked by an interest in these new possibilities about the limitlessness of time, I began to research this idea with the hope that I would eventually understand the true restraints that time and space had placed upon us. 

	While doing research I came across an article that Stephen Hawking had written. He began his article by saying: 

Hello. My name is Stephen Hawking. Physicist, cosmologist, and something of a dreamer. Although I cannot move and have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free. Free to explore the universe and ask the big questions, such as: is time travel possible? Can we open a portal to the past or find a shortcut to the future? Can we ultimately use the laws of nature to become masters of time itself? 

I found these words to be extremely inspirational. Here was a man who is nearly completely paralyzed, yet in his mind he is freer than most men. Intrigued, I continued to read his paper, and after I read it over and over again I understood every word he had written, and I myself became mentally free: convinced that time travel was possible. 

	As humans we live in the third dimension bound to a linear plane, which is time. We can connect one point in space to another, and create a line in the first-dimension. When we connect two lines to one another, we will create a plane in the second-dimension. If we connect two planes to one another, we create the third-dimension. As third dimensional creatures we are able to move in all directions throughout the third dimension. Through this reality I began to imagine what it would be like to live in the second dimension. If you lived in a vertical plane, you would only be able to travel up or down, or to the sides, and, for a two-dimensional being, traveling freely in the third dimension would be very hard to imagine. I believe this would be similar to connecting two two-dimensional worlds and traveling from one to the other. However, doing this would only allow a two-dimensional being to travel in a completely straight line through the third-dimension. So although they are technically in the third-dimension, two-dimensional beings are bound to the properties of their planes and are not free to move about the third-dimension as we three-dimensional beings are. 

I tried to imagine the fourth-dimension using a similar connection. Since we as humans are constrained to the third-dimension, to imagine traveling freely through the fourth-dimension would be extremely difficult. However, we can imagine connecting two three-dimensional worlds and traveling in a straight line from one to the other. Yet are we as humans truly capable of doing this? Yes, traveling in a straight line between third dimensions is possible, for this is time. However, as third-dimensional beings we are only able to travel between third dimensions in a line, which is why time only goes forward at a consistent pace. I believe that a fourth dimensional being would therefore be able to travel through time at any pace, and go forward and backward as they wished to. 

	In his article, Stephen Hawking says, Nothing is flat or solid. If you look close enough at anything you will find holes or wrinkles in it. As a chemistry student, I know that this is true. At a molecular level any flat surface will have holes or wrinkles in it, so for a two-dimensional creature that is only able to travel through the third dimension in a straight line these holes and wrinkles make it possible to travel through the third dimension in a non-straight line. This can also be applied to three-dimensional creatures such as humans. At a level smaller than atoms and molecules, there must also exist wrinkles and holes in the third dimension. If we, humans, were small enough to travel through these holes, we would be connected to a different space and time. These holes can therefore be thought of as tunnels through the fourth dimension, and entering through them would allow time travel. These tunnels are known of as wormholes. Does this mean that traveling through a wormhole could allow a person to travel either into the future or into the past? After researching this question I came across a paradox. If people were able to look through a wormhole and see themself in the past, what would happen if they then decided to shoot themselves? If their earlier self was dead, then who fired the shot? For this reason, I do not believe it is possible to travel into the past. The laws of cause and effect prohibit it. 

	Furthermore, this paradox leads me to ask another question: if one cannot travel through a wormhole back in time, is it possible to time travel through one into the future? Earlier I discussed the fourth dimension, which is difficult to imagine for we are bound to exist within the limitations of the third-dimension.  In his article, Stephen Hawking compares the fourth dimension, time, to a river that flows at different speeds at different places. For example, it has been scientifically proven that time goes by slower on Earth than in space based on the network of satellites that revolve around the Earth.  Also known as GPS, these clocks on the satellites move faster than the ones on Earth. This phenomenon, which supports the notion that one can move forward in time, occurs because time flows slower around more massive objects, where there is a larger gravitational field. I think that of all the topics Ive discussed so far, this is the most difficult to comprehend. However, understanding the effect gravity has on time is essential to understanding how a wormhole could allow an object to travel through it into the future. 

	The fact that the mass of matter has such profound effect on time made me wonder what a wormhole must be made of. Normal matter has positive energy and causes positive space-time curvature, which is gravity. Since gravity causes time to slow down, an object near a massive amount of normal matter would experience time travel into the past. In order for a wormhole to allow time travel into the future, it would need negative space-time curvature, which could be thought of as anti-gravity. However, in order for matter to possess the characteristic of anti-gravity, it must have negative mass or energy. To me, such a concept did not seem possible. However, after doing research I found that the principle of uncertainty in quantum mechanics states that space areas can in fact contain negative energy, thus enabling a field in which future time travel could be possible.  Realizing this I came to the conclusion that a wormhole must therefore consist of matter with negative mass. For if an object is placed near such matter time would speed up, and when the object emerged from the other side of the tunnel it would find itself in the future. 

Unfortunately, though this evidence proves the possibility of forward time travel, there is no way a person could travel through a wormhole because they exist only a level smaller than atoms and molecules. So this begs the question, is there another way for a us to time travel? In order to answer this question we must revisit Einsteins Theory of Relativity, which states that space and time are affected by ones motion. As an object travels faster, its mass increases. Since the speed of light is the universal speed limit, an objects mass will approach infinity as its speed approaches the speed of light. This concept presents an alternative way to time travel: by traveling very, very fast an individual would be able to breach boundaries of the fourth-dimension and travel forward through time. Although it is not possible for an object to travel faster than the speed of light, approaching the speed of light would cause time to slow down. For example, if I could build a spaceship that was able to travel only slightly slower than the speed of light, after traveling for only an hour I would most likely land thousands of years in the future. This spaceship would therefore have the ability to transport humans through time, and thus be considered a time machine. 

	Knowing this, I end my journey through a wormhole with the realization that time travel is physically possible. Now all thats left, to make time travel a reality, is for humans to build a spaceship that would allow us to travel fast enough too break the barriers of time. However, if it is possible to travel into the future, but not back into the past, would time travel still seem so appealing? Personally, I am just happy to know that such a possibility exists. For the real wonder of our journey is that it reveals just how strange the universe is. It's a universe where time runs at different rates in different places. Where tiny wormholes exist all around us. And where, ultimately, we might use our understanding of physics to become true voyagers through the fourth dimension Stephen Hawking.

This theory also sates that speed of light is the universal speed limit, and a clock travelling at a speed that is close to the speed of light will run slower than one at rest, because time is relative to the speed at with something is moving. Understanding this concept was extremely liberating for me, because for the first time in my life concepts such as time travel that seemed farfetched, were actually plausible.  Sparked by an interest in these new possibilities about the limitlessness of time, I began to research this idea with the hope that I would eventually understand the true restraints that time and space had placed upon us. 

While doing research I came across an article that Stephen Hawking had written. He began his article by saying: 

Hello. My name is Stephen Hawking. Physicist, cosmologist, and something of a dreamer. Although I cannot move and have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free. Free to explore the universe and ask the big questions, such as: is time travel possible? Can we open a portal to the past or find a shortcut to the future? Can we ultimately use the laws of nature to become masters of time itself? 

I found these words to be extremely inspirational. Here was a man who is nearly completely paralyzed, yet in his mind he is freer than most men. Intrigued, I continued to read his paper, and after I read it over and over again I understood every word he had written, and I myself became mentally free: convinced that time travel was possible. 

As humans we live in the third dimension bound to a linear plane, which is time. We can connect one point in space to another, and create a line in the first-dimension. When we connect two lines to one another, we will create a plane in the second-dimension. If we connect two planes to one another, we create the third-dimension. As third dimensional creatures we are able to move in all directions throughout the third dimension. Through this reality I began to imagine what it would be like to live in the second dimension. If you lived in a vertical plane, you would only be able to travel up or down, or to the sides, and, for a two-dimensional being, traveling freely in the third dimension would be very hard to imagine. I believe this would be similar to connecting two two-dimensional worlds and traveling from one to the other. However, doing this would only allow a two-dimensional being to travel in a completely straight line through the third-dimension. So although they are technically in the third-dimension, two-dimensional beings are bound to the properties of their planes and are not free to move about the third-dimension as we three-dimensional beings are. 

I tried to imagine the fourth-dimension using a similar connection. Since we as humans are constrained to the third-dimension, to imagine traveling freely through the fourth-dimension would be extremely difficult. However, we can imagine connecting two three-dimensional worlds and traveling in a straight line from one to the other. Yet are we as humans truly capable of doing this? Yes, traveling in a straight line between third dimensions is possible, for this is time. However, as third-dimensional beings we are only able to travel between third dimensions in a line, which is why time only goes forward at a consistent pace. I believe that a fourth dimensional being would therefore be able to travel through time at any pace, and go forward and backward as they wished to. 

In his article, Stephen Hawking says, Nothing is flat or solid. If you look close enough at anything you will find holes or wrinkles in it. As a chemistry student, I know that this is true. At a molecular level any flat surface will have holes or wrinkles in it, so for a two-dimensional creature that is only able to travel through the third dimension in a straight line these holes and wrinkles make it possible to travel through the third dimension in a non-straight line. This can also be applied to three-dimensional creatures such as humans. At a level smaller than atoms and molecules, there must also exist wrinkles and holes in the third dimension. If we, humans, were small enough to travel through these holes, we would be connected to a different space and time. These holes can therefore be thought of as tunnels through the fourth dimension, and entering through them would allow time travel. These tunnels are known of as wormholes. Does this mean that traveling through a wormhole could allow a person to travel either into the future or into the past? After researching this question I came across a paradox. If people were able to look through a wormhole and see themself in the past, what would happen if they then decided to shoot themselves? If their earlier self was dead, then who fired the shot? For this reason, I do not believe it is possible to travel into the past. The laws of cause and effect prohibit it. 

Furthermore, this paradox leads me to ask another question: if one cannot travel through a wormhole back in time, is it possible to time travel through one into the future? Earlier I discussed the fourth dimension, which is difficult to imagine for we are bound to exist within the limitations of the third-dimension.  In his article, Stephen Hawking compares the fourth dimension, time, to a river that flows at different speeds at different places. For example, it has been scientifically proven that time goes by slower on Earth than in space based on the network of satellites that revolve around the Earth.  Also known as GPS, these clocks on the satellites move faster than the ones on Earth. This phenomenon, which supports the notion that one can move forward in time, occurs because time flows slower around more massive objects, where there is a larger gravitational field. I think that of all the topics Ive discussed so far, this is the most difficult to comprehend. However, understanding the effect gravity has on time is essential to understanding how a wormhole could allow an object to travel through it into the future. 

The fact that the mass of matter has such profound effect on time made me wonder what a wormhole must be made of. Normal matter has positive energy and causes positive space-time curvature, which is gravity. Since gravity causes time to slow down, an object near a massive amount of normal matter would experience time travel into the past. In order for a wormhole to allow time travel into the future, it would need negative space-time curvature, which could be thought of as anti-gravity. However, in order for matter to possess the characteristic of anti-gravity, it must have negative mass or energy. To me, such a concept did not seem possible. However, after doing research I found that the principle of uncertainty in quantum mechanics states that space areas can in fact contain negative energy, thus enabling a field in which future time travel could be possible.  Realizing this I came to the conclusion that a wormhole must therefore consist of matter with negative mass. For if an object is placed near such matter time would speed up, and when the object emerged from the other side of the tunnel it would find itself in the future. 

Unfortunately, though this evidence proves the possibility of forward time travel, there is no way a person could travel through a wormhole because they exist only a level smaller than atoms and molecules. So this begs the question, is there another way for a us to time travel? In order to answer this question we must revisit Einsteins Theory of Relativity, which states that space and time are affected by ones motion. As an object travels faster, its mass increases. Since the speed of light is the universal speed limit, an objects mass will approach infinity as its speed approaches the speed of light. This concept presents an alternative way to time travel: by traveling very, very fast an individual would be able to breach boundaries of the fourth-dimension and travel forward through time. Although it is not possible for an object to travel faster than the speed of light, approaching the speed of light would cause time to slow down. For example, if I could build a spaceship that was able to travel only slightly slower than the speed of light, after traveling for only an hour I would most likely land thousands of years in the future. This spaceship would therefore have the ability to transport humans through time, and thus be considered a time machine. 

Knowing this, I end my journey through a wormhole with the realization that time travel is physically possible. Now all thats left, to make time travel a reality, is for humans to build a spaceship that would allow us to travel fast enough to break the barriers of time. However, if it is possible to travel into the future, but not back into the past, would time travel still seem so appealing? Personally, I am just happy to know that such a possibility exists. For the real wonder of our journey is that it reveals just how strange the universe is. It's a universe where time runs at different rates in different places. Where tiny wormholes exist all around us. And where, ultimately, we might use our understanding of physics to become true voyagers through the fourth dimension Stephen Hawking.

1168,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2014-11-17,2014,11,17,23,2mk9qn,self.Futurology,[in-depth]My masters thesis on automation the future of jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2mk9qn/indepthmy_masters_thesis_on_automation_the_future/,Stuffe,1416236382,"Hello there. I am writing my masters thesis in economics on automation and the future of jobs and wonder if any of the futurists in here have suggestions or input.

So far I have shown that growth today is different than it has been in the recent past. One trend is that more and more of corporate profits are being reinvested and less and less is being paid out to workers. A related trend is that the capital share of output has been on the rise in the us at least (alpha in the cobb douglas function). Another maybe less confusing way of stating that for the presumably many non-economists in here is that a dollar spent on investments is becoming more productive, compared to a dollar spent on workers.

As for the effects of automation, I have made a logical argument of what would happen when something is automated but the workers cannot find other jobs. Basically it shows that if the presumed price drop doesn't increase demand sufficiently, it will actually destroy GDP (product price elasticity has to be &gt; 1). Basically, this is because purchase power is taken away from the economy. And of course there is the obvious argument that inequality is bad in and of itself, because all else equal, $100 improves the poor persons life more than the rich person.

Beyond that I have looked at the skills that workers report they are required to use at work. And I looked at how those skills have changed the last 15 years. Math and such skills are less required today than they were 15 years ago. This is likely because of software tools created for everything from engineering to accounting. If you go far enough back, even the clerk at the grocery store would have to do math, but that is now all automated. This is not to say that math will not be needed in the future, it will probably become more important, but for a smaller number of jobs. The question was then, given that unemployment is not that much greater than 15 years ago, what are the skills that have taken the place of those skills that are on decline? To my surprise these are skills such as communication, presentation, and sales. In other words, human to human interaction could be the space automation leaves for the workers of the world. In the rich world, about 80% of the population already works in the service industry (outside farming and production). Of course a great deal of service industry work like washing dishes and cutting hair will likely be automated long term, but I can't think of any fundamental limits to how many percent of a population can be employed as hr managers, sales personnel etc.

Right now I am looking to see if I can find any similarities with the industrial revolution, but the data is limited.

So what are your thoughts futurology? Any feedback, ideas and criticism is welcome, even if it doesn't seem ""economic"" in nature. ",20,11,False,self,,,,,

Wouldn't it technically be possible in the future, to have AIs that constantly develop new dialogue, quests, locations, etc etc in video games?

For example, if I were able to communicate with a character via microphone/VR, the AI controlling that character would be able to conjure up a response to whatever I say.

For example, if I came up to a blacksmith in Skyrim and said, ""Hey, could you eat this pie in 10 seconds?"" then the AI would be able to instantly generate the voice response, ""Why do you want me to eat a pie in 10 seconds?""

Could you imagine the immersion? You could literally have a full-on conversation with a character, and they wouldn't be restricted to a limited, pre-recorded dialect. 

These AIs could also generate new areas to explore, completely new characters, quests, lore, and pretty much everything else.

How likely is it that future video games will have this level of immersion? If they do, I don't think I'd ever want to leave the game..

I couldn't imagine going to the Jarl of Whiterun, and say, ""I bring word that the Jarl of Falkreath think you have an ugly face"", only to have the Jarl get flustered, and demand I summon the Jarl of Falkreath for a face-to-face meeting. 

There are limitless opportunities with super intelligent AIs. I hope to see them in action soon. :) ",58,43,False,self,,,,,

As you said more and more dollars are re-invested instead payed out to workers. Because of that 'workers' will get poorer and will stop beeing a good target for products. Like people third world countries now.  

So corporation's products will start to target other corporations more.
'Closed' coprporation economy might emerge. Since it is much more profit-oriented/efficient than people - there is little consumption.

As in classical evolution, only most efficient corrporations will survive. As long as this is true, main their purpose will remain to acquire value.
Can that change ?  

I don't have an answer to that.
Maybe when a corporation will stop worrying about the survival it will ask about the sense of life ?

Now please note that corporations' existance will be less and less dependant on humans because of automation.
They might replace humanity at some point. Not through a war but through economic starvation of human race.
AI will not counquer humanity through war but through

Imagine an AGI system where a personal AI helps every individual. When you want something or need something, the AI will tap into the internet to help you make your life easier. They will surf the internet of AId to find out the most efficient way to get what you need. 

 At first, if such a system were to come into existence, it may have a very weak AI, or no AI at all. Which is feasible today. However, since it is developing at an exponential rate with the help of Google and Facebook, it will come sooner that we think. 

 Imagine Amazon, EBay, Kijiji, Google, Facebook, Tinder, HelpX, Kickstarter, Uber, and Meetup, all wrapped up into one With a powerful AGI running everything to help make society run more efficient. So people get what they want more quicker, more easier, more efficiently, with no fuss.

Need a ride? Need a place to stay? Need to meet interesting people with specificinterests?

 There's an unfathomable amount of possibilities with such a system in place.

 One example:

Imagine makeshift get-togethers done in all major city where strangers meet and talk about specific interests. An AI will bring together people who excel in those interests (can open new ideas.) These programs can be funded by specific companies, perhaps going as far as paying for transport for these discussions. These same companies can feed information and ideas from those discussions after the personal AI's record their conversations.

 Now, you may think such a future is far... But look at Uber. It's already changing the world. 

 Take a moment to think of the awesome potential of such a system. What possibilities can you envision?",2,3,False,self,,,,,

(This is written from the viewpoint that humans do not have a soul. That we are just pieces of evolved ""hardware"" that could be duplicated.  That all morality and decision making capabilities are executed in the brain.)  I was just talking with some friends this morning about the idea of singularity and it seemed like all my friends were kinda scared of it, and I really cannot see any good reasoning behind fearing it!  (Singularity is pretty much AI getting smarter than humans and taking over the world if u did not know)  And here is my reasoning behind my stance.  

First, humanity now days is trying to better ourselves and our world to save our future and our race, so that we will live forever.  Singularity is almost like that!  We are creating better ""Humans"".  Sure robots are not humans, but they would be created by us and be our legacy as a race. 
And In the aspect of bettering the human body to make us almost omnipotent (Invincible) we don't need that.  The human body will never be invincible but robots almost can be!  I mean in the hypothesis of singularity it states that robots will be continuously bettering themselves and adapting to everything.

Second, if humans and the universe truly did evolve we are evolving at a super.... super slow rate.  If singularity is to happen, the ""race"" of robots will evolve much faster than ourselves I think.  They will ""evolve"" smarter processing units (brains), better bodies that can withstand anything the universe throws at them, bodies that can last almost forever, and minds that will create technology beyond our comprehension.  

Finally, if there truly are aliens out in the universe somewhere (which seems logical if we evolved), they possibly could have better technology than humans do... maybe even they have reached a technical singularity.  Humans should not be the ones to face possible ""invasions"" or whatever... we could never last!  But with singularity we could ""preserve"" our legacy as humans even though our race would no longer exist.  

And for those of you who are still not convinced (which is probably most of u, I do admit I am not very convincing) it will still be a heck long time b4 singularity.  That is, even if it ever happens.  So u probably do not have to worry about being killed by robots.  

In conclusion, I can only see good coming from singularity, other than the human race and all living things as we know them being destroyed which is destined to happen to us sometime anyways.  We should embrace advances in AI technology if we want an impact on the universe forever.

Thats it I think.  If there are mistakes srry... I am only 15.

**So what does this mean?**

A lot of people have proposed the Universal Basic Income. I'm not going to get into the pros and cons of that in this post, but I think we can all agree that it's going to be a tough fight to get it implemented.

So it seems we're at an impasse. Are we inexorably trending towards a world where either there is massive income inequality or huge, government mandated wealth redistribution?

Not if Reddit has anything to say about it. Some of you may have heard about Reddit's recent decision to **return 10% of it's value to the Reddit community**. This doesn't mean 10% of the fifty million dollars they just received. That means 10% of their total value.

So if Reddit becomes a 50 billion dollar company, then $5 will be in the Reddit value share. That puts it at $5 billion, or the exact same market cap as Bitcoin has today.

It remains unclear how exactly the Reddit value should be distributed. We're pretty sure that giving it based off of Karma isn't the answer. How should it be done? Frankly, I'm not positive. But if you want your voice to be heard, go check out the [Askreddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2moyiz/serious_how_should_reddit_inc_distribute_a/) where the admins are soliciting ideas right now.

**So why is this such a huge deal?**

Reddit isn't that big now, and will never be able to support a decentralized economy by itself. But they are taking the crucial step of returning some of the value they extract from their users.

Now, imagine for a second that Facebook, Amazon &amp; Google all adopted similar policies and returned 10% of their value to their users. That would produce an additional **$71 billion**.

In a way, this makes sense. We all know that when you use Facebook, you are the product. And Facebook is making billions off of that - so why shouldn't you see something back. 

Again, no one knows exactly how this should play out - we're all in this together. But just remember that the value of these companies depends entirely on them having users who can afford to buy the things they show ads for.

No large middle class with huge buying power - no internet giant companies.

By returning some of their value and profit to the customers, they actually ensure more long term growth.

This comment was interesting, by /u/apokako:   

&gt;Reddit is a global and multicultural Hivemind and most of the users have a lot to offer in regards to skills, intelligence and ressources.
What about making one or several ""competition(s)"" where members of the community work together to find a solution to a problem, work out the best solution, and you guys fund it.
Edit : If the solution found is one to a general problem (Example, at the top of my mind : 4D printing, /r/SuicideHelp self-help book, reddit self-driving car, Occulus-rift /r/gonewild game...) it would be awesome and the ""sponsored by reddit"" would give great public image.

But then /u/yankeebravo brought up an issue: 

&gt;It's also rife with opportunities for abuse and bruised egos.
You're essentially proposing a Reddit Kickstarter, so...
Which of the contributors gets the funding? Who holds the IP rights/patents? How is profit apportioned?
Seems likely to create more problems than the one it would solve.


Which is probably true. But it got me thinking of other, similar options... 

What if we did something that is created to be **free open source content** for the whole reddit user base. Like, what if reddit users got together and created some quality educational media, or games. From all the amazing things I've learned even in just this sub, you could create a entire documentary about future technology and the crazy world we are going to live in. Seriously, give me a CGI guy, and I will pump out full length documentaries on the wonders of the type of things I see in weekly in ""This Week In Science"" and other posts here. Or a redditor with a science degree and a passion could be funded to create an educational series of videos.  

And this one is probably getting way ahead of reality, but if you wanted to really get crazy, you could use the platform of reddit to revolutionize education. If you think about it, the platform of reddit could really be an amazing system for self education. Entire college courses could be crowdfunded, put into video or image format, and contained within freely available subreddits. That's getting a little ahead of myself, but as a someone with a passion for self-education, I could only dream of how amazing it would be if that was at my fingertips, and those of everyone else as well. We have such an amazing user base in regards to their skill sets. What if we could harness that in a more creative way?

I don't know if my idea would really work, but what I do know is that there is so much latent creativity and intelligence on this website. I kind of hope that we can start a continuing discussion about what the possibilities are, and what we can all do with this amazing technology that we have.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

I am young (hopefully young enough) and I am nothing if not excited for what the future holds. 

A little over a year ago I discovered Ray Kurzweil's theory of the Singularity and it was what brought me to this sub-reddit. I have since become obsessed with Kurzweil's ideas, particularly indefinite life-span. Kurzweil believes that this possibility is right around the corner, though I know the majority are likely to be skeptics on this matter. 

What I want to know though, is how we can influence the rate of evolution. Kurzweil's math wasn't wrong, even if his predictions end up being off. I believe there is a possible future in which we achieve Kurzweil's vision on schedule, but what am I, a mere undergrad studying business, to do about this? 

As a junior in college I have spent the majority of the past year of my life trying to determine who I am and what I want to do with my potentially limited time on this Earth. I am still struggling to answer this question, not because I lack passion, but because I have an abundance of it. One thing alone will not sate me. One lifetime alone is not enough. I was born in a transitional stage of evolution, too late to be truly a part of the dying commercial age, and most likely too soon to see the true potential of the informational age realized. 

But maybe I can fix this. Maybe I can help speed up society, and maybe I won't end up being a part of the lost generation. So my question for you is, what can I do? 

I've invested too much time and money into my current career path to start all over now before seeing any return on my investments. I am no expert on evolution or biology or neuroscience or any of these fields that will be a part of the revolution ahead of us. But there must be some way the average man can contribute to the evolutionary march. 

Please, what can I do to bring about our future?

This has been called into question by actual neuroscientists, including David Linden in this article here:

http://boingboing.net/2011/07/14/far.html

The point is that while Kurzweil envisions 7 micrometer wide creations doing their thing, the brain is far too dense to allow for free roaming 7 mm to wander without compromising the physiological integrity of the brain (and avoiding the brain's defense systems), much less the question of what kind of fuel source these devices would need. 

Nanobots - as opposed to microbots - could theoretically do it, but on the nanoscale Brownian motion comes into play, as well as the unanswered question of where are these things going to get their fuel source.

I've browsed Kurzweil's site and I can't find anything refuting Linden's article. I know that Kurzweil has also proposed hundreds of millions of microbot sized devices being placed in the brain and not actually moving, but I don't know if this was in response to Linden, or if even this is feasible on such a large scale.

From what I've been able to gather, it's very much within the realm of possibility to have maybe a dozen or so of these inside your head - on the micrometer scale - placed carefully so that they never move around. These could be used to alter mood or enhance senses. 

But I don't see any evidence to suggest that we could ever have more than a handful of them in our heads, that they could ever move around, or that they could do anything more than provide stimulation, or enhance our base senses. I don't see any evidence to suggest that we could ever have hundreds of millions of these things inside our heads, stationary or moving, nor can I find any evidence of them ever being able to enhance our intelligence or creativity.

If I'm wrong, or if Kurzweil has ever actually responded to Linden's essay, by all means let me know.",14,4,False,self,,,,,

Add a holographic interface and copies of tests and bam, free college courses, class size = 1.

What I'm suggesting isn't even all that intelligent of an AI, just one that can successfully mimic a professor's responses. Drawbacks that I can see include: 

You'll still have the biases of the professors. I don't think that's a huge deal as long as you ""take classes"" from other ""professors"" to be exposed to wide range of ideas.

Image rights/copyrighted material: I also wouldn't think this would be a huge issue, I would think a lot of professors would be flattered that their ideas and teaching style were considered good enough to be immortalized.

Professors change their ideas: hopefully the AI content would be somewhat editable, since the data from the lectures would eventually become outdated. But this actually helps address another issue-- would this kill academia? We still need discussion and hard thinking by contemporaries to address present-world issues. I'm thinking what would happen would be (to start, at least), AIs taking over the remedial courses, stuff with unchanging answers, like the hard sciences. We'd still have professors to teach graduate students the cutting edge shit. In fact, it would free many professors up to do more research and teach the grad students if they didn't have to teach the 100-level stuff.

Imagine power cables are nowhere to be found.
Imagine having electric power at your fingertips wherever you are. 
Imagine clean air and parks instead of landfills.
Welcome to the Flux.

Watch a World Without Batteries:
http://youtu.be/45F1RREU-_4

Flux is a near future vision of a world with wireless electricity everywhere, available to anyone at any time. With Flux you can drive for a thousand miles without recharging, work on your laptop for days at a time without a power-cord or reach level 200 on CandyCrush Saga without plugging in once.

Flux would mean that for the first time in history, an entire neighbourhood would be fitted with a wireless power grid that distributes electricity through the air in the street, in the park, in your favourite coffee shop and even in your house. Only electric trucks and lorries will be allowed into the neighbourhood, and only between midnight and 6am. Soon after, all roads will become wireless power emitters, and only smart electric vehicles will be allowed into the zone, making it the first CO2 emission free neighbourhood in the world.

How realistic do you think this is?

&gt;Of Myths And Moonshine

&gt;""We switched everything off and went home. That night, there was very little doubt in my mind that the world was headed for grief.""

&gt;So wrote Leo Szilard, describing the events of March 3, 1939, when he demonstrated a neutron-induced uranium fission reaction. According to the historian Richard Rhodes, Szilard had the idea for a neutron-induced chain reaction on September 12, 1933, while crossing the road next to Russell Square in London. The previous day, Ernest Rutherford, a world authority on radioactivity, had given a ""warningto those who seek a source of power in the transmutation of atoms  such expectations are the merest moonshine.""

&gt;Thus, the gap between authoritative statements of technological impossibility and the ""miracle of understanding"" (to borrow a phrase from Nathan Myhrvold) that renders the impossible possible may sometimes be measured not in centuries, as Rod Brooks suggests, but in hours.

&gt;None of this proves that AI, or gray goo, or strangelets, will be the end of the world. But there is no need for a proof, just a convincing argument pointing to a more-than-infinitesimal possibility. There have been many unconvincing arguments  especially those involving blunt applications of Moore's law or the spontaneous emergence of consciousness and evil intent. Many of the contributors to this conversation seem to be responding to those arguments and ignoring the more substantial arguments proposed by Omohundro, Bostrom, and others.

&gt;The primary concern is not spooky emergent consciousness but simply the ability to make high-quality decisions. Here, quality refers to the expected outcome utility of actions taken, where the utility function is, presumably, specified by the human designer. Now we have a problem:

&gt;1.     The utility function may not be perfectly aligned with the values of the human race, which are (at best) very difficult to pin down.

&gt;2.     Any sufficiently capable intelligent system will prefer to ensure its own continued existence and to acquire physical and computational resources  not for their own sake, but to succeed in its assigned task.

&gt;A system that is optimizing a function of n variables, where the objective depends on a subset of size k&lt;n, will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable.  This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer's apprentice, or King Midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want. A highly capable decision maker  especially one connected through the Internet to all the world's information and billions of screens and most of our infrastructure  can have an irreversible impact on humanity.

&gt;This is not a minor difficulty. Improving decision quality, irrespective of the utility function chosen, has been the goal of AI research  the mainstream goal on which we now spend billions per year, not the secret plot of some lone evil genius. AI research has been accelerating rapidly as pieces of the conceptual framework fall into place, the building blocks gain in size and strength, and commercial investment outstrips academic research activity. Senior AI researchers express noticeably more optimism about the field's prospects than was the case even a few years ago, and correspondingly greater concern about the potential risks.

&gt;No one in the field is calling for regulation of basic research; given the potential benefits of AI for humanity, that seems both infeasible and misdirected. The right response seems to be to change the goals of the field itself; instead of pure intelligence, we need to build intelligence that is provably aligned with human values. For practical reasons, we will need to solve the value alignment problem even for relatively unintelligent AI systems that operate in the human environment. There is cause for optimism, if we understand that this issue is an intrinsic part of AI, much as containment is an intrinsic part of modern nuclear fusion research. The world need not be headed for grief.",1,8,False,self,,,,,

Feel free to discuss Biometrics in the comments, I'd like to get your opinions as well, not just responses to the polls!  
  
Biometrics involve things like fingerprint scanners, retina scanners, facial recognition software, voice recognition software, and even ear scanners and dna scanners.  
  
Biometrics are sometimes used in security, such as the new Iphone fingerprint scanner. They are also used in social media, such as facebooks collection of biometric data for use in identifying faces in photos. In a perfect world, everyone in the world would be entered into one secure database, and no one would ever have to carry ID, bank cards, or keys because all transactions and security would be carried out with biometric scanners. This raises questions however, as a our world is not perfect and many security and personal privacy issues would be raised.  
  
Some questions to get things started:  
What do you think about the collection of biometrics for use in security?  
  
In your opinion, what direction do you think the use of Biometrics will take?  
  
In your opinion, what direction do you think public opinion/support for biometrics will take?

Baras opponents have no hope of reaching the last sixteen, but third place in the group would still win them a berth in the Europa League. But with just one point to their name, the Cypriots are struggling, and they have failed to find the net in any of their last three official outings.

The game in Nicosia (8.45 PM CET) is the first of three consecutive away trips in three different competitions for Bara. When they return from Cyprus, theyll start preparing for the game in Valencia (Sunday 30 at 9.00 PM CET) and after that they have a cup tie at Huesca (Wednesday 3 at 10.00 PM CET.

Luis Enrique has taken 22 players with him. The only members of the first team to stay at home are Vermaelen and Iniesta, although four of those players will have to be dropped from the definitive match squad.
Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has warned his players they can again expect APOEL to close ranks at the back when the two sides meet in Champions League Group F on Tuesday.
The Cypriots caused a great deal of frustration for Barca on matchday one as Luis Enrique's men sneaked a 1-0 win at the Nou Camp, although performances have improved since then and back-to-back wins over Ajax have assured the Catalan club of a top-two finish and a place in the knockout stages.
APOEL's status in the group is less uncertain, however, as they battle it out with Ajax for third spot and a place in the Europa League.
And Luis Enrique knows the hosts will do their utmost to keep a clean sheet as they continue to search for a first win in the group.
""We expect a similar game to that which was played in the opening round of matches,"" said the Barca coach on the club's website.
""I expect them to behave defensively as they did before, giving away very little space which always creates problems.",3,1,False,default,,,,,

 I walked in, said hello to the convenience store clerk, and made my way to the gum section. I grabbed some gum, paid for it, but before leaving the store, to the left of him I noticed a slew of gadgets he was selling. Headphones, USB cables, cell phone chargers, selfie extenders, water humidifiers, bluetooth speakers, you name it. 
 
 Now, I rarely walk into convenience stores, so I'm not sure if its a recent phenomenon. But when I compliment him on his business sense, he goes onto tell me that he does it to adapt to the changing demands of the local geographic. Saying that now, people are buying a lot more technological products more often, and he says it works, mentioning how the local high schools bring in a lot of business during and after school hours. He told me that his prices were even cheaper than big electronic stores like best buy and Wal-Mart. 

He mentioned that it's partial to the fact that his business is losing potential clientele with the ability for consumers to purchase things online with Amazon and the like. And I mentioned that it's only going to get harder. Places like shopping malls will have 3d body scanners to scan our bodies, and we'll be able to try on clothes in virtual space, cutting the need for consumers to even go to shop in the local malls. 

 He told me that it won't happen any time soon.

 I asked him if he knew why Oculus rift was, and he said he didn't knowI told him that Oculus is making virtual reality a reality. And people will be able to see virtual versions of themselves trying on clothes in virtual space. So I showed him a video of someone playing Elite Dangerous in the Oculus Rift. And his reaction was fun to watch. He couldn't believe it. 

 But he still said that the technology wont affect local businesses any time soon, and is far off. 

 So I pulled out my phone, opened the Google Goggles app, and scanned a box of headphones right in front of him. The app took me to Google that showed me the price and reviews of the headphones. The headphones were overpriced, contrary to what he told me. And they had a 3 star rating. 

 I told him to just keep track of technology, adapt accordingly, and he should be fine. People are soon going to be able to instantly know whether they are indeed getting a good deal, and a good product. This is thanks to products like Google Glass, and the fabled Magic Leap that Google recently made a $540 million investment in.

 I told him that soon, within the next few years, people will be walking around with augmented reality visors/goggles/monocles, which will be equipped with an onboard AI that will instantly scan the products and be able to tell you what deals you will be getting. Technology will instantly cut all the bullshit, and give consumers useful information. Making it that much important for local businesses to adapt to the accelerating capabilities of consumers that have access to the latest technologies.

 Now, when I brought up these points to him, he brushed me off and told me that won't happen any time soon. Maybe everything I told him was too overwhelming to process in the span of the few minutes I explained it to him, so I don't blame his reaction.

 But I really feel like the common folk today have no idea just what they are capable of with even today's technology. Many people are unaware of just how powerful that instrument they have in their pocket really is, and how beneficial it can be to them and the people around them if they know how to use it properly.

 I almost didn't say anything to the guy. I usually just run my errands without much interaction with people. But as an /r/futurology regular, I'm beginning to realize the importance of opening people's eyes to the wonders of our technology, and where it is headed. The better informed people are, the better their ability to adapt to society's ongoing evolution.

To deposit a candidature you had til somewhere in November (too late now!) and they will check all that out and choose with whom they will work. This is supposed to be done in March 2015.

And than I stumbled on this [Document](https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=7bebc116b23472190dcde7335d16423b) (Warning, direct download link to pdf) on this [Website](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=9577deb2e0e9acbc51e588add5273ac1&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0).

They have an actual timeline (!!) for the development of APM and it is 48 months (!!!) so ... March 2015 + 48 months is 2019...

In one of the latest videos with Dr Drexler (who have lately advocated for the exact same planning as DARPA seems to take, feedstocks + assembly), he also hints that 'it might be coming faster than you think' (paraphrasing, but that's the idea).

I'll repeat part of something I wrote on a forum I'm with:

&gt;Think about it this way: humanity sucks. Every last one of us is nasty to at least one group of people;  be it based on race, gender, sexual orientation, spoken language, religion, etc. Imagine if a white supremacist group was able to produce racially specific bioweapons (something that could be possible with MNT). It's not too far fetched as racism is everywhere. I've even seen some of the supposedly ""enlightened"" people on these forums use the ""race realist"" cop-out as an excuse for discriminatory comments.
 Then there are the crazy people who think it would be best if the world was ended (either they think the world is not worthy of continuing existence or they think God(s) told them to). So they create gray goo that kills the biosphere in a matter of days.
 Then there's the possibility that groups could use this technology to oppress others. Imagine being able to directly reprogram someone's mind to make them slaves. I'm not quite sure if this is a scenario that's better or worse than the others above as people would still be alive, but they'd be suffering.

I hope futurology continues to grow, eventually into mainstream; I also think it's important to tie the idea into to present day issues in a meaningful way. To do so makes it more real and less of a daydream.

So what are we missing? That shit needs to be able to fly. Say your working on something and need your two hands AND a flashlight. So you grab your handy flash light app, but now you need someone else to hold it and guide the light towards where you're working. Primitive!

Or say you need something as simple as a picture. If you want something farther than arm's length you need a person to take it, or some convenient ledge to place it for a timed shot. But if you have a person present, usually you want that person IN the picture. Technology is better than asinine problems like this. What are we cavemen?

Or say you drop your phone. Sound familiar? That's because everyone and their grandmother has done it. Give that shit a little dronage and it can catch itself before it hits the ground.

Eventually smartphones are gonna have to be able to hover. The functions of drones and smartphones are too close for them NOT to have to eventually merge into one.

Of course, there's the whole propeller problem. So I guess we'd need some sort of light and compact energy efficient propellerless drone technology, which is difficult without something like that claimed reactionless drive which everyone says is impossible, and even if it's not that doesn't guarantee it scales up to lifting levels of thrust.

Yeah. So if a smartphone doesn't fly is it really smart at all?",5,4,False,self,,,,,

I've monitored this discussion about basic income for some time now and while in theory this looks great, I don't see it in itself as anything more than a possible buffer to prevent wider economic and social issues. What intrinsic worth does this system produce? It's merely transference of fiat currency that produces nothing. People may be more free to pursue their own passions which logically would produce more innovation, but in a plutocracy such as the US, what makes you all think the power brokers will go along with this? In my view, the structures of power cannot be subverted with legislation that simply calls for universal income standards, because in a system in which the value of the currency is determined by speculative globalizing forces, inflation can always drive down the purchasing power of said currency. 

Our system of living is currently reliant on a globalized infrastructure that is uphelp by the free flow of petro-carbons. How will giving everyone enough money to live remedy this structure that actually perpetuates social hierarchy? I'm asking you guys, because I don't know, I'm not trying to make a point. 

Like I said, I moved to Taos, New Mexico. I'm here because I studies International Relations, I found a lot of the solutions put forward muddled in layers and layers of pedantic bullshit and naivety, either that, or cynical and offered no productive value to a progressive discourse. If you want a ['whole story""](http://projectredhand.org/2014/11/12/the-day-i-stopped-being-afraid/) of why I'm here, you can read this but in summary, this is my last ditch effort on a long and personal quest to try to find something that can transcend war by creating systems that mitigate many of the reasons for it. Essentially though, I'm here to experience earthships for myself, and to see if they really can offer a 100% off the grid solution. So far, I've been highly impressed with the integration of ancient and modern methods of providing climate control, water, power, and low maintenance climate controlled food production. I was initially skeptical, but then I realized that most of this development has for the most part been driven by non-technical people, and oriented toward simplicity. Most of the people learning how to build these are often those who are doing so because they are environmentally conscious and simply want them for themselves. Others like to revel in big ideas but fall short when it comes down to trying to build it in reality. Preppers are the other big group. But I'm just looking at this, the demographics associated with it, and I'm think ""There is no wonder this isn't catching on faster"".

Here is a system, that is certainly not perfect but is built in a manner to allow people to live for the most part disconnected from this globalized system that is destroying the planet. It's got the right ideas on all fronts. But I say, why not get more expertise in this? Why not build structures for individuals that gives them the means to disconnect, but integrate it with existing structures? Wouldn't this kind of do the job of giving people the basic essentials from life? Wouldn't it also reduce CO2 emissions drastically? I mean, if adopted globally, the global pressures for resource wars would evaporate. People would no longer be so reliant on central structures, meaning that a lot of these modern threats such as cyber warfare could be mitigated as well. I mean, if resource distribution was decentralized to the point of the individual, would a cyber attack resulting in a black out really be such a big deal? I guess the benefits could go on, but I'm curious why this is never talked about on here? It would go perfectly with other technical ideas for decentralization (mesh net, black fiber etc.) Imagine a would where homes were as much an extension of the human as clothing. Human security would just be something we have, not something given to us. Human sovereignty is important for freedom. Intergenerational equity is important for ensuring future human security.

................................................

 For Mexico's Beltran, a second shot at the WBO World Lightweight title is a chance at gaining justice. The 33-year-old travelled to Glasgow to hand then champion Ricky Burns a comprehensive beating, fracturing his jaw in the second round of a brutal encounter. However - and quite remarkably - the fight was deemed a split decision draw, enabling Burns to retain the belt which American Crawford went on to win in the Scotsman's next outing.

Ring Magazine's #1 and #2 ranked lightweights do battle on another breathtaking BoxNation night LIVE on the Channel of Champions. No sooner than the dust has settled on a huge show topped by Dereck Chisora and Tyson Fury's WBO World Heavyweight title eliminator do we cross over to Nebraska to see the WBO's Lightweight crown contested.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Maybe we should consider ways we could work together as a group. We already have a voting mechanism built into reddit.

It's probably impossible to get such a large group to agree on anything. But it wouldn't have to be everyone.

For example: if two thirds of us did nothing and one third of us donated $10 each, we could raise over five million dollars. That's enough to start a fund to finance tech startups. Maybe we could upvote or downvote suggestions for technology projects for the fund to consider financing.

In fact, when I think about the fact that there are 1.7 million of us sitting around in front of computers (or smartphones), it occurs to me that the idle processing capability of all those computers is worth more than $5 million. A lot more. I know who would pay for it, too.

It occurred to me that I could easily distribute software to everyone on /r/futurology who wants it. You could run the software only when you're not using your computer at all or when the computer is mostly idle -- like when you're sitting around reading reddit. Over time, that could raise millions of dollars for whatever we want to use it for. Tech research? Alternative energy projects? Space colonization? Life extension? Wouldn't you like to just be able to upvote or downvote funding priorities? You could.

I know how to make that happen. For fifteen years, part of my job was reviewing the business plans of technology companies at the startup or development stage. It's simply incredible what technologies are out there that aren't part of our lives simply because the people working on them don't get funded. We could fund them.

Tell me if this is a stupid idea or not. Right now, I'm just asking for feedback. Let's discuss it or PM me or the vote totals will give me some idea of peoples' opinion of it. If there is a lot of positive interest, I'll take the time to write up something more detailed for your consideration.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Edit: Okay, so this is getting some interest. For those offering to donate money, I'm not accepting donations at this point. I just want to see if how much interest there is in this. If you want to volunteer to help, though, message me.

Edit: revised wording as per discussion with mods.
