&gt;three houses were built in different parts of the US ... and became popular tourist attractions during the 1980s.

&gt;polyurethane insulation foam ...  [was sprayed onto balloon forms] for easy, fast, and cost-effective construction. 

&gt;They were ergonomically designed, and contained some of the earliest home automation systems. 

&gt;Mason believed Xanadu House would alter people's views of houses as little more than inanimate, passive shelters against the elements.

&gt;""No one's really looked at the house as a total organic system"", said Mason, who was also the architecture editor of *The Futurist* magazine. ""The house can have intelligence and each room can have intelligence."" 

&gt;The estimated cost of construction for one home was $300,000. [In 1980s  dollars. Maybe $750,000 in 2013 dollars.] Roy Mason also planned a low cost version which would cost $80,000, to show that homes using computers do not have to be expensive. The low cost Xanadu was never built.

&gt;By the early 1990s, the Xanadu houses began to lose popularity because the technology they used was quickly becoming obsolete ...

&gt;The Xanadu house in Kissimmee, Florida used an automated system controlled by Commodore microcomputers. ... The automation concepts which Xanadu House used are based on original ideas conceived in the 1950s and earlier. 

&gt;The kitchen was automated by ""autochef"", an electronic dietitian which planned well-balanced meals. Meals could be cooked automatically at a set date and time. If new food was required, it could either be obtained via tele-shopping through the computer system or from Xanadu's own greenhouse. The kitchen's computer terminal could also be used for the household calendar, records, and home book keeping.

&gt;Computers in the master bedroom allowed for other parts of the house to be controlled. This eliminated chores such as having to go downstairs to turn off the coffee pot after one had gone to bed. The children's bedroom featured the latest in teaching microcomputers and ""videotexture"" windows, whose realistic computer-generated landscapes could shift in a flash from scenes of real places anywhere in the world to imaginary scenes.

Our first manned mission into the cosmos is now approaching a planet we have labeled as having high potential to home underdeveloped intelligent life. This planet is about 10x the size of earth, made up of nearly identical chemical components.*

*Upon arrival the natives inquisitively draw closer to this ship full of beings who have the ability to traverse the stars and perform spectacles in front of their eyes. Peace is made.*

Now imagine, to make an easier example, instead of finding a different species on this new planet- we land on this homely world to find MORE human beings. 

**::Now for some questions::**

Is this possible?? I've always pondered the thought.

How would we deal with this type of situation??

Seeing as animals have been known to grow to fit their environment, would they be ~10x bigger than us??

What do you think this discovery would entail in our world, and our new brothers?? 

Assuming they are aware enough to begin documenting their history, thoughts, etc, how long would it take to translate and learn to communicate with them??

I subscribe to their monthly playpak so I can give myself study breaks on campus playing whatever strikes my fancy.

The former CEO Steve Pearlman sort of destroyed the first shot at success based on this article. http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/28/3274739/onlive-report

Though I'm inclined to think it was launched a couple of years early. The technology was ""ready"" but the customers were not ready.

What do you guys and gals think about virtualization as a whole? Do you think it plays a role in our future? For gaming, or computing, either really.

Personally I feel like it might do away with the rapid obsolescence of mobile devices. Once we enter ""5G"" where devices can hand off connections between WiFi, cell service, etc. seamlessly(at least that's my understanding of the theoretical 5G concept).

Apps that require a great deal of processing power, advancing beyond the capabilities of older model devices could virtualize the service in server farms and stream the resulting screencast to the device as seamlessly as OnLive usually works under ideal circumstance.

While today we still deal with dead spots in a decade most populated areas will be wholly covered by 4G and 5G technology should be moving forward nicely.

By then it might be possible to offload the heavy lifting to servers that can respond to economies of scale better than continual updating of consumer level devices. This might stand a chance at letting you use your device until it literally ceases to function due to wear. All the while it keeps up with the latest apps. Since hardware changes are usually minimal between 2 year contracts, a 4-6 lifecycle of a phone could conceivably be achieved this way.

But if you do make it to the Future, what you find, when you get there, will be another Now.  If you don't have the basic capacity to enjoy being in a Nowif your emotional energy can only go into the Future, if you can only hope for a better tomorrowthen no amount of passing time can help you. - Eliezer Yudkowsky**


I read this passage recently in an [article on Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ou/if_you_demand_magic_magic_wont_help/) (which is a must read), and for some reason it made me feel uneasy. I thought about it overnight, and I realized that it bothered me because he was describing me. And he was describing much of the r/futurology community, and futurists in general.


Many people in the futurist/transhuman/singularitarian community -- including me -- just cant fully enjoy the present. We nostalgically pine for an imagined perfect future. We think of augmented reality, humanoid robots, AI personal assistants, space travel, exponentially growing computer power, genetic engineering,3D printing, and think they will make the future better, more exciting than the present. We find hypothetical future inventions and science much more exciting than things that are happening now, today, in the real world.


We take for granted the mundane miracles that happen in our present reality. If you arent in awe every time you use your smartphone, if Skypeing a loved one across the country doesnt still blow your mind, if Netflix doesnt make you giddy, then why do you think youll feel differently when augmented reality contact lenses, brain machine interfaces, or autonomous cars are the technological norm?


Futuristic and exciting things become mundane and unappreciated once they are reality.


If I told you in 1990 that in 23 years you would be walking around with computers in your pocket more powerful than 80s supercomputers, that you would have access to the worlds information anywhere you want at the touch of a button, that a computer would beat the top Jeopardy players of all time, your mind would have been blown imagining the amazing future that 2013 must be.


But for most of us it doesnt feel amazing. It feels...normal. Weve acclimated to this world and it doesnt excite us anymore. So we spend our time gazing into digital crystal balls, discussing and debating the amazing future that awaits us in 10, 20 or 30 years.


But what we dont realize is that Eliezer is 100% right. If we arent amazed by the present, if we see the Future as some technological salvation waiting to save us from our unexciting lives, then we will never be happy. Because once we get to the future it becomes the present, and were already bored by the present.


Anyway those were just a few thoughts I had about this. 


**What do you guys think? Do you think this is a problem in the futurist community? Is it possible to love futurism and still be blown away by the present? Do you use futurism as a salve to distract you from your boring present? Be honest. Do you take full advantage of the mundane miracles available today, or are you waiting just another 10 years for the really cool technology to change your life? What do you guys do to make the most of, and fully appreciate, the amazing present we live in?**",22,60,False,default,,,,,

Our current progress says that from a practical standpoint clothing is becoming obsolete(ex:temperature controlled homes that can truly withstand the elements). Someday entire cities might have similar climate controls. So that leaves only the social side. Will nudity once again be considered normal(think Futurama)?

A lot of stuff in that sub-reddit is probably garbage, but there does seem to be a general trend in mysterious murders and suicides in the last few months. And it seems to be on a trend, on whistle-blowers, gun-industry folks and media executives that report on failed indictments against corruption in the bank bailout.

It sounds like preparation for a massive total war.

On top of that, the recently proposed [FEMA Camps Bill, H.R. 645](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr645/text) puts military installations near or in major cities.

&gt; (1) CLOSED MILITARY INSTALLATION- The term closed military installation means a military installation, or portion thereof, approved for closure or realignment under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) that meet all, or 2 out of the 3 following requirements:

&gt;* (A) Is located in close proximity to a transportation corridor.
* (B) Is located in a State with a high level or threat of disaster related activities.
* (C) Is located near a major metropolitan center.

I'm mainly a subscriber to the abundance model and am pro-gun-legislation, but stuff like this is scary.

It is a pity because its not a place to share different opinions and I feel that if you're not a Kurzweillian/technology enthusiast then you can't participate.

Why would anyone want to live in that kind of world, we humans do not do everything as a function of practicality but rather of what brings us happiness and pleasure and love and comfort. Wouldn't that sort of reality push us towards an even more consumerist and materialistic society than we already are?

Its true technology could cure pretty much every disease and help us achieve space travel, increase our lifespan and **that is amazing**, I'm not bashing that, I'm simply introducing a different perspective of things to get you guy's opinions, don't you think that we should try and work on our society and on ourselves to become a more tolerant, compassionate and evolved species instead of having smart phones and stupid people?

Tissue printing is getting feasible and 2D bio printing will soon be under $200 for a self-made rig. Genetics technology is also getting cheap at an incredible rate, so I can see everyone sequencing themselves regularly fairly soon.

Both subreddits have congealed into the New-Age proving grounds of a cybercult, a cult which preaches an imminent rapture that will separate us all from our worldly norms and into heavenly immortality.  

These days, the majority of the threads on the boards merely have the *trappings* of scientific foresight, without the substance. In lieu of articles about chip density or the ""qualification problem"" of A.I., /r/futurology has been inundated by links to eschatological websites that refer to the Singularity as though it was the second coming of Christ!

The hedonic treadmill represents an age old problem and is itself responsible for the progress of humanity in many ways. I'd say the treadmill is of huge importance, considering even if the singularity does come about and we're all living in techno utopias, what's the difference if we're still not happy?

I'd say the hedonic treadmill is best represented by the fact we are continually unsatisfied even with these technological 'miracles' pervading our everyday lives. ""Everything's amazing and nobody is happy"", says Louis C.K. Our parents scorn us for taking our privileges for granted and don't understand why we're not satisfied with what we have. 

I see nothing to be surprised about; it's human nature, nay, *nature in general* that continually craves progress and higher levels of pleasure. And without that craving, we wouldn't be were we are today. The hedonic treadmill is arguably our greatest gift and our greatest curse. 

So what's the solution then? If we remove the hedonic treadmill then what could we base happiness off of? Pleasure doesn't exist without pain, say many. And I'd have to agree, although the optimist in me claims that there must be a solution. Chemically induced bliss? Exponential increases in our threshold for happiness? Or perhaps even a complete normalization of our emotions so that happiness nor sadness can be felt? I don't have the answer, although I will remain optimistic that some are working towards one. 

I understand that the future of technology echos the concept of infinity; I would very much enjoy our happiness going along for the journey. ",9,8,False,self,,,,,

But just like technology begets more technology and it moves in an exponentional fashion, we've seen some social justice movements and controversial issues rapidly pick up steam in the last decade or so. What do you think they will look like in the future? **For simplicity's sake, let's pick the year 2029.**

Some of these issues are very important, but I just dont know enough about them to make a fair assessment for the future. I would love to hear your thoughts, too. Also, Im sure Ive left out many important issues so please add yours and your thoughts.

 Here are some of my predictions/thoughts in alphabetical order by issue for the year 2029. I live in the U.S. BTW.

**Animal welfare / Vegetarianism** (writing about this the most since its the one Im most familiar with)

* The worst cruelties of factory farming will have been eradicated (battery cages, gestation crates, veal crates), though many other nasty practices will persist.

* % of vegetarians and vegans will have increased by a few percentage points, but a significant portion of the population will consciously decrease meat consumption. Meat consumption per capita has dropped 10 percent in the last five years; I expect this will continue.

* In vitro meat will be on the verge of being commercially viable, and alternatives for meat, eggs and dairy will have advanced to the point where it will be hard to notice the difference between real and plant-based products.

**Environmentalism**

I really have no idea where this will go. Anyone with a lot of knowledge in this field have an interesting perspective to add?

**Gun control**

* A lot of the various laws that are being talked about now will be federally enforced, e.g. background checks, closed loopholes (gun show sales), no assault weapon sales, limit on magazine rounds. 

* I think the recent boon in gun control discussion may result in some liberal states enacting stricter gun control laws than they do can federally.

* In general, I could see comprehensive gun reform happening and the U.S. becoming a country in which its much more difficult to get and keep a gun, like in Japan. This may seem crazy to think right now, but with all these shootings not letting up, it seems the way of the future. Sandy Hook was a major turning point in this debate.

**Internet freedom/privacy**

* I really have no idea where this will go. Reddit, Ill leave this one up to you.

**Immigration**

* Republicans are loosening their grip on this as Latinos are becoming a major voting bloc but I dont know what this will look like in 2029. Any thoughts?

**LGBTQ rights**

* Gay marriage advocates will continue to legalize it up and down the west and east coast states, and by 2029 itll be federally legal (I bet this happens in 10 years).

* Non-discrimination policies in the workplace will adapt to include transgender people and in general transgender folks will be much more widely accepted in society.

**Minimum wage**

* Minimum wage will continue to increase (were seeing pressure on it right now). It may never get to the point of being fair but I think itll reach a tipping point as income equality continues to increase.

**Reproductive rights/abortion**

* I really dont know where this will go. The U.S. general public has hardly changed its mind on this issue since 1973 and a slew of states in the last few years have been cracking down on Planned Parenthood and abortion restrictions. Any interesting perspectives on this one?

**War on Drugs**

* By 2029 marijuana will be sold, taxed, and treated similarly to alcohol. 

* Are there any drugs that might be decriminalized to some extent? Ive no idea.

I suppose this is a topic a few people are ruminating on today, as I saw something about ""Conscious"" or other as I was clicking over to post here, my imagination bubbling.

What the question I had was - how do we direct ourselves as a species?

I feel as though our journey as an individual has been up through to consciousness from a more animal world, and we are stabilizing a bit as [culture and cooperation and invention and progress] - civilization - all mash together in our brains and we get our shit together, so to speak. 

I imagine our societal and cultural makeup to be this biological process writ large. What are your theories, Redditors of Futurology? 

Is it a sort of directed consciousness that will guide societies into the future? If so, what form will this consciousness take?

We have governing bodies, but I feel as though these are small nodes of control which can hold the public's attention and interest only briefly, and do not encourage the participation of the citizenry except to advance their agendas. 

I suppose what **I** mean by ""consciousness"", and what I imagine being a possible outcome would be a world where every citizen of a nation or location at least has a vague idea of what decisions their group collective - be it a nation, city, cooperative business or otherwise - is currently working on. And if not a strong opinion on this direction at least a solid awareness of their participation.

As it is I feel we are in the beginning stages of this.

I just wanna make sure it doesnt drop off completely.)

No one on this subreddit seems to focus on the biological aspects of human advancement. Only the technological. I know not if this is and underestimate of the genetic code that rises from the many thousands of compromises in our DNA which is understandable. We are blind. We are deaf. We have no sense of smell taste or touch. We are weak. Or if this is brought about from the ever present short sightedness of the all too human self preservation instinct. Either one is understandable however unacceptable. Technology should be at best a secondary objective to fix problems in the intended biology. Inorganic machines unlike organic machine can be fixed easily. They do however fall short in the durability of the organic machine. The organic machine also has a much more powerful processer that does need to be aided in efficiency by its more primitive inorganic counterparts. Even with the limited knowledge of today we could create humans that have the following advancement within 10 maybe 20 years for the advancements we don't have the codes for yet. This of course only possible if someone actually gets the funding to attempt it.
 
bones nearly unbreakable and far stronger than steel of the same thickness(already naturally found in a single family of humans. Occurred last generation. Mutation dominant.)

 
skeletal muscles with twice as many cells as a normal human's and more endurance than those of a bodybuilder's.(already naturally found in humans. Occurred this generation. Only one know subject. Mutation dominant.)

 
inability to get any cholesterol or food related heart disease. Plac build up impossible.( already naturally found in humans. Occurred a few generations back. Currently more than 70 subjects.)

 
antifreeze in the blood. High risistance to cold temperatures.(genetic code known.)

 
an internal defibulator made of a store of fat cells above the heart instinctively shocking the heart back to life in the event of it stopping, and the ability to survive being frozen solid. Both found in the same animal. A frog no less. The former exists because of the latter.(code unknown could be found out.)

 
symbiotic algae that cluster around the mitocondria and are passed on through gametes. This occurs in a single species of lizards and would take awhile to decode but the possibility is still there. 


the ability to see in twelve primary colors. Occurs in a single species of shrimp the genetic code is unknown.

 
(This is the end of the summary there is far more that can be done at this point of time but this should get the message across.)

These are examples of the possibilities of today's limited understanding. After an higher understanding of DNA is astablished far greater feats of biological advancement can be obtained.

Long story short, I'm giving a presentation to a bunch of businessmen/women working in a broad range of industries. None of them are native English speakers except for myself and the presentations help them improve their English. I usually present in their native language for practice but occasionally I like to work on just public speaking so I just speak in English about what I'm interested in. I've given technology (*futurology*) talks before  (""The Singularity"" was a *huge* hit and I won a presenter of the year award with it). 

Anyway, there has been a lot of articles coming out in the past two months about the ""Rise of the Machines"" and the impact robotics is going to have on manufacturing, the impact AI will have on knowledge-based work, and how these things will affect our daily life in general as we transition from one kind of economy to another, emphasizing how humans aren't going to be a part of the labour force for much longer and how even jobs that previously required more skill and education can be replaced by large data sets working in tandem with AI/algorithims.

During the presentation, I wanted to tie these things together and basically lecture about what the world is going to look like in a world where the concept of work is entirely different, where jobs exist that we can't even contemplate now, while taking into account that I'm not talking to nerds like myself. 

I come to /r/futurology with this because I can't decide on the order I should go about presenting this information and what I should emphasize along the way. I'm not so much asking you to ""do my homework"" but if you were giving this lecture, how would you go about it? 

Of course I'll post a link to the PPT/talking points after the fact and maybe even the lecture if someone bothers to record it. Any pointers would be appreciated. Cheers!

I am looking for an article I believe I found posted on a thread in this reddit in Fall of 2012 and am having a lot of trouble relocating it. 

Unfortunately I don't remember the author or title, or even the website that it was on. It was basically in my list of things I need to investigate more down the line...

What I remember:

The article was an exploration of how we define the future, and to a certain degree, a criticism of many who claim to be living in the future. It argued that those living on the edge really only live in the ""near future,"" which is essentially the present, they are just maybe more technologically savvy. The barrier to the future or edge of the future is when a technological experience outside our ability to interpret from evolution is brought into a way that fits with our brain's evolution. 

An example of this was the airplane. When we fly we walk onto the plane, feel slight shift in acceleration and land again, nothing outside the evolutionary experience of walking or running. Those who are truly living in the future are the ones who can train themselves to overcome our evolutionary context of sensation, for example air force pilots many decades ago, dealing with the extreme g forces of experimental flight. 


I know this description is very vague, but it was a very interesting article I would like to find again, as well as any rebuttals. 


If anyone has any thoughts on what this article might be it would be much appreciated. 


Thank you!

The wikipedia article for the [Vistula River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vistula#Delta_of_the_Vistula_River) claims that there's a high likelihood that the densely populated Vistula Delta will be flooded by 2100 due to rising sea levels. Checking out the sources led me to [this BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7940532.stm) which has some good information despite its somewhat idealistic bent. In my humble opinion, the writing is on the wall: even if global warming is reversible, we probably won't get our shit together in time anyway.

With that said, we're going to have to do something about it sooner or later. As the polar ice sheets melt sea levels will continue to rise. This will threaten **trillions** of dollars in coastal infrastructure and resources. Low lying communities, major cities, hinterland/delta regions, and even entire countries like the Netherlands will be at risk of complete submersion. The extremely dense eastern coasts of both China and the US could see unprecedented economic devastation. Dealing with this shit is an obvious priority for the primary movers of global action.

Each citizen is apportioned an equal portion of this pool of money to distribute within an online system, in which projects and institutions accredited by the legislature (including charities and government organs) compete for funding.

Each citizen is responsible for apportioning their lot, perhaps multiply divided, through the system, with each institution indicating their current total in funds and the progressive impact of further funding. Journalism is reinvented as profiling those elements within the system.

This apportioning occurrs in the public domain, so that those that needed it could spend the money selfishly, but those that demonstrably did not would be pressured into spending it wisely, even encouraged to add to their lot out of pocket. The former 'wise spending' even becoming an additional datum in the human resources market (just look at the way social networking data is being used currently!), as well as bein encouraged within local social circles.

For the lazy, cash could be routed through intermediaries such as political parties, who would apportion the money on their behalf in accordance with their ideology.

Technical details, such as how quickly one can change one's funding, would be determined by the institutions themselves, which would demand, for example, a certain length of commitment to funding.

As this system stabilised, I believe it would be both effective in engendering democracy and in apportioning funds in an agile way, I believe that the proportion of taxation which finds its way into this fund would steadily approach 100%. Meanwhile, the rate of taxation could increase as citizens felt more control over tax dollars, smoothly interpolating between capitalism and a form of 'public choice anarcho-socialism'.

Have we won, or have we failed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18yvjd/suppose_we_end_up_in_an_allpowerful_surveillance/,ruizscar,1361472484,"http://ranprieur.com/

**February 20.** Last week I argued that it's better for us to have more freedom and power, which means more opportunities to harm other people and ourselves, even if it leads to more people being harmed. Obviously this has to be done in moderation, which is why I support moderate restrictions on guns and drugs and driving. Because if we increase freedom too fast, it can create so much trauma that there's a popular backlash, and a regression toward less personal power and more power monopolized by domination systems.

But there is a deeper issue: what are we working toward as a species? Suppose we end up in an all-powerful surveillance state, designed so that even if every human is a murderous psychopath, nothing bad can ever happen, and we all sit around taking euphoria drugs and consuming entertainment. Have we won, or have we failed? My utopian vision is at the other extreme: no authority, no restrictions, nothing is ever locked, the world is full of dangers, and yet it's rare for anything bad to happen, because humans have attained godlike levels of personal virtue and awareness. We may never get there, but I think that's what we should be aiming for.

More generally, I could frame the conflict between these visions as a conflict between internal progress and external progress. Is it more important to improve human nature or improve the human condition? Along another axis there is a political question: how far do you go in using central control? And which improvements work with or against central control?

I've noticed that technological progress is usually described as if improving the human condition is the only thing that matters. So if we build machines to do everything for us, that's good, even if we lose the ability to do anything for ourselves. I see tremendous potential to use technology for internal progress, but there is also the danger of improving ourselves in the wrong way.",67,128,False,self,,,,,

This leads to broader conversation on automation in general, and the even greater number of jobs that will be lost to that. And I can't believe I never put 2 and 2 together before, but it seems to me that our current economic model is intrinsically based in the premise that a huge number of people have shitty jobs that require little education. The upper class is built on the middle class, which is built on the poor, right? The system requires scarcity, whether of wealth, resources, or education.

So what happens when all those jobs are gone? Even *more* importantly, what happens when all those jobs are gone *and* the level of education does not go up? It seems to me that the more jobs lost to automation, the more necessary it is that the standard of education must go up to accomodate the lower class. My friend made the point that there will always be jobs that will be created with automation as well as destroyed - monitoring the machines as one example. Which is true, but I think we can agree that monitoring a factory requires slightly more education than assembling parts as a factory worker.

If it doesn't, then the government will have an huge unemployment rate that only continues to rise. When that happens, I see only the possibility of revolution unless/until the government is forced to greatly rise the standards of education. If they don't, then I hate to sound alarmist or anything like that, but that points to overthrow in my mind. Either direction is a huge societal shift. 

All this points to in my mind is the exponential acceleration in all directions of our lives that Silva, Kurzweil, etc. have been pointing to.",68,27,False,self,,,,,

When they go to market with this technology (and they will, of course), I don't think they're going to be doing it as a modification to existing cars - they'll be building their own. Since they haven't started R&amp;D on building their own yet, they're naturally going to have to either partner with, or buy a car company.

I don't see partnering happening. All of the car companies have been avoiding the idea of driverless cars in favor of ""assisted driving"". They all have corporate cultures that believe that everyone will want to drive their own car once NOT driving your own car becomes an option. I think Google will want complete control over the company building their cars, so they can shift the corporate culture to suit its vision of the future. A half-assed commitment from their manufacturing partner could easily sink the whole venture.

So who will they buy? They've got about $50B cash on hand. Toyota, whose cars they've been using in their tests, is right out - the company is worth $162B, so Google couldn't even purchase a controlling interest. And why would they? Toyota's success and size is based on the old car sales model, and that simply won't translate to a successful driverless sales model.

Maybe they'll stick to something home-grown. GM is worth $37B, which Google could afford, but they're not exactly known as the most forward-looking car company. Ford is a bit better - their integration with smartphones has made them a darling of the tech press - but they're more expensive at $47B, completely draining Google's coffers.

There's one obvious choice: Tesla Motors. It'll cost Google a measly $4B; its cars are already computerized to all hell; and more importantly, the people who like Tesla as a company (but haven't yet bought a Tesla car) are precisely the people that Google will be selling to - techies with an eye on the future.

So, who wants to take bets on how long it is until Google buys Tesla?",221,709,False,self,,,,,

I'm interested in hearing your opinion on what the implications to society would be if technology to ensure immortality became widespread (particularly of a form that resulted in the body not degenerating into old age).   What broader effects to society would come about from the widespread availability of immortality?

The more I tackle this question, the more I'm beginning to view immortality as a threat to mankind. Yet you rarely see discussion on the negative implications that immortality would have on society.  Since most of us would selfishly seek immortality, and I think few of us are willing to embrace its negatives.

Here is how I could see immortality negatively affecting mankind:

- Immortality could dangerously raise population levels on Earth, resulting in strict birth controls, planned deaths or collective destruction via excessive resource consumption.

- Immortality would not increase the wisdom of mankind, but rather entrench it with old ideas, decreasing social change and innovation.  Death is a necessary component of progress, because it allows for new perspectives and ideas to flourish.

- Immortality could create a completely new relationship with how we view pension and government support systems related to aging.

-  Immortality could lead to tremendous social conflict between different ages (depending on the biology of that immortality).  Who would be comfortable supporting a pensioner into eternity?

- Immortality could lead to further income inequality as wealth accumulates--without the impetus of death, charity becomes less desirable and inheritances disappear, disadvantaging those who come into society later.
 
Potential positives to mankind:

- Immortality removes the natural biological limits that time places on our individual capacity to accumulate knowledge.  This could result in a rapid increase in technological progress, rather than a stifling of it.


At the moment I believe the negative social consequences of immortality far outweigh the positives.  But I'm interested to hear what other people's thoughts on this are.

So... is it desirable to pursue the technology of immortality? ",10,0,False,self,,,,,

Suppose we surround the propeller and its motor with a pressurized hull (in other words inside the spacecraft to be accelerated), then the propeller will work but all that will happen is that the propeller and its motor will move inside the spaceship, eventually the propeller engine will crash with the inside of the spaceships hull, and to believe a net force will be excreted on the spacecraft also sounds stupid.

But is it?

Well yes, because any force excreted by the propeller engine bumping the spaceships hull MUST BE balanced by the breeze generated by the propeller against the oppose hull (very important scientific principals involved), but if you actually build a test bed and try it seems to work and work well.

The idea is presented in http://www.wjetech.cl/ (click on part 1) but the page is rather long, figs 1 to 10 are spent explaining what does not work, only figs 11 and 12 illustrate the actual idea.

But it is fig 14 thats worth a look, an experimental setup similar to what Henry Cavendish did in 1798 to determine the gravitational constant (using balancing masses and deducing the force excreted to the masses by the resulting rotation).

Again the page sends time showing what will not work (figs 15 to 22) before FINALLY showing what seems to work.

I and other (with a better understanding of the behavior of gases than me) believe the experiment is valid and therefore should not be ignored just because it really seems like a very stupid idea.

Is there a website out there that offers a list of technical explanations of all the major technologies that futurists think will have an impact in the near future? Specifically what I'm looking for is a list of explanations that are very technical and detailed so that they actually explain what the technologies are, yet concise and easily digestible so that an intelligent layman with no expertise in the relevant fields can understand them. It would also be neat if they also said something about how the technologies are having an impact currently, what the pace and direction of research currently is, and realistic and well-grounded speculations as to what their societal impact will be down the line. One thing I hope they will have - although this might be asking a bit too much - is a realistic, grounded, and relatively unbiased explanation so that it explains the practical and theoretical limitations of the technologies, as well as going over how they could be potentially misused and abused, so that the explanations don't come off as blindly utopian.

I've been looking and I haven't really found any websites like this. It would be a good way to introduce ordinary people into transhumanism, because they'll be able to easily see and digest all the technologies that transhumanists and futurists are so excited about, and why so many people think it's reasonable to suspect radical technological change in the near-ish future. It would also be a good way for current transhumanists to have a general understanding of current technological developments. So are there websites out there that offer something like this?

I had an idea and would like to share it with you folks.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19ae91/saw_this_clip_using_a_parrot_ar_drone_and_autocad/,[deleted],1361919352,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl4VWZ2t0-s Here's the clip. Once you see what it can do my idea makes sense.

Bloomberg BusinessWeek had an article about the business of disaster services last week. We went over it in a marketing class I'm in. The article had me looking at drones again. Apparently there are $17,000 models being sold by private firms to agencies and communities whenever disaster strikes and they need information on the landscape for rescue/recovery efforts.

There was the whole debate about profiteering and disasters blah blah boring rehash of moral and ethical arguments that ended with each side more furiously opposed to each other than before etc. 

But it got me thinking about the issue and I began some searching to see where drone technology had come in the three months since my last afternoon of drone exploration.

I saw this video and it hit me what could be done.


For $500~ you can obtain a drone that does what was done in the video. Imagine instead of 1 $17,000 drone you buy 34 $500 drones.

The drones are packaged in a small but durable case/base station that has enough batteries to power the drone for several days of operation. The station also has satellite and cell service(might get lucky and have some cell service available) equipment for calling home with data.

We could air drop the cases(let's forget the logistics of a case that can handle orienting itself right side up, etc. this is just a concept right now, details later) into the afflicted regions. 

Once they land and transmit their exact location home, software can rapidly design flight paths that maximize power consumption and focus attention where authorities already suspect the problem areas to be.

The drones launch, filming high definition video until its time to come home. Upon landing wireless transmission of the video off the SD card(already exists) and either inductive chargers or contacts on the landing gear prepare the drone for flight again.

On the human end the video is uploaded to a server that processes the video like we saw in the clip at the top of this post. Then it orients the models based on geotagging. 

In only a few hours we'll end up with square miles of data being made available for agencies globally. Fires, collapsed housing, evidence of people and animals in distress can be found in the models and located on a map.

The coolest part is that map can be made publicly available and similar to the Ushahidi project(might even be able to partner with them) a crowdsourced effort to analyze the large amount of data can be undertaken. 

It would open the door for individuals with limited time and resources to contribute in a meaningful way to a response/recovery effort. It would decrease response times and lower the costs of relief efforts.

The same technology could have awesome commercial applications like creating topographical maps(already being done all over, but this is an order of magnitude cheaper) or models of entire cities.

Well that was my brainsplosion for today.

EDIT: After reading this it's likely it fits better in /r/entrepreneur or something but I figured the clip was /r/futurology worthy and you guys might appreciate ideas that use ever evolving technologies to fix some of our biggest problems. Sorry if it's a bit off topic.",0,0,False,default,,,,,

TED TALK](http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_mcafee_are_droids_taking_our_jobs.html)

The structure of a modern society is **rapidly** evolving...

Sadly, fewer people are required to provide for the 'whole'. There are now more 'zombie occupations' currently in existence than ever before.

When/if the monetary system considerably slows down (due to cash flow stagnation), these expensive positions of employment will inevitably become surplus to requirement, and then what?

We are moving towards a digital existence. An existence whereby non tangible items will be 'consumed' in augmented and virtual environments.

**QUESTIONS**

* How do you think a digital occupation will operate? 

* Will the current concept of 'a consumer' even exist?

* Which **zombie occupations** will be the first to go?

**EDIT:** The term 'Zombie Occupation' is referring to a job that is dead/dying and does not really exist as a truly productive asset of society... Similar to a 'Zombie Company' = Only operating/in existence because the bank or backer is artificially propping it up [WIKIPEDIA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_company)
