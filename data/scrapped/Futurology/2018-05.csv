I couldnt bite down on the tooth or touch it without an extremely painful jolt though.


cut to Thursday though and Im in constant excruciating pain. My gums are extremely swollen  and it feels like all my teeth hurt but especially the one that had work done. The pain is nonstop and I would rate it a 10 out of 10. Ive been taking 800mg of Motrin around the clock and its barely helping. Anytime my tooth accidentally makes contact with my upper front tooth (I have an overbite) I am send into a deep excruciating pain that lasts for 30+ min. Its nonstop throbbing.


I called the dental office yesterday and they said well maybe its normal maybe its not but scheduled me in the next available spot to see my dentist... but its not until Monday. 


Should I be trying to find a different emergency dentist?? This pain is unbelievable. Ive never felt anything like it before. What could he causing it? Do people ever get pain like this post root canal? It is EXTREME. I cant sleep and I cant eeally eat anything other than yogurt and soup.",0,1

I just wonder when this development will eclipse and we have an entire generation growing up, not knowing how people used to get sick and die all the time?

Specifically I recently impaired my vision by being stupid and looking into a laser projector, so I've started reading about retinal regeneration.

What made me wonder about the development of regeneration tech was that we know what the trajectory is sort of with current scientific methods of tests, phase trials and all that. By using historic values we can predict the development of future drugs with 10+/- accuracy.

But with in the mix? 

I have a feeling that as soon as AI is given free reins, a LOT is gonna be happening seemingly all at once.

In the second there's only a few horses, and mostly cars.

I am always curious about thefuture. How will thingsevolve? How much fun andopportunitieswill arise?
Specially intechnology, everything is improving so fast!

I have been thinking about it and i will tell you the most importantbreakthroughsthat are highly probable to happen (they are my life goals too) for the next 50 years (and how they relate to technology).

1Quantum Computing

I always hated being limited by classic physics (one of my greatest fears).Quantum theorieshave expanded the horizons a lot. One of its greatest practical uses iscomputing.

Its so fascinating how the universe is way moredynamicthan we ever thought, there is so much morepotentialfor the human race to evolve because quantum physics lets usexploitandcontrolthe universe more widely. We may be able to engineerteleport!!, or build acomputing chipmuch more powerful! or eventime travel(!??)

2Unified Physicstheory

Quantum theory gave us a big chunk ofpieceswhich we yet need to fit on current ones. Double lift experiment was a big opening to understanding thecore mechanismsof the universe.

I have been trying tounifyevery chemistry and physics theory into one since my high school. Many things have been working out, so i am so confident that we will havetheory of everythingwithin 50 years (please contact me if you want to know more about this)

3Super-Intelligence

This is huge project. It presents many challenges, specially risks.

AI (neural networks etc) create arepresentationfrom the data given to it. Its like a physician creating atheoryfrom his experiments, and using it topredictnext experiment. We can use this to know more about the universe (maybe help us create the theory of everything).

The problems we need to solve first are:integratehumanbeneficial goalsandmoralsinto AI; And after AI evolved to super-intelligence, morals and goals are stillpreserved.

Quantumhardwarecould tag along with super-intelligence too,wideningthe software limits.

4Consciousness

Understanding what is a conscious is the most important thingever!

It makes us understand who we are (our purestidentity). We would finally have the answers to what is life!! And even more exciting, we would be able to maketeleportationandupload our mindsto robots without losing your self-awareness.

It will be a big step on human civilization to know what consciousness is.

5Educational System

I hope i dont offend anyone but most of the school institutionssuck.Its such a old method of learning. School kills so many talent and genius

Students need moreattention and support, so that they feelinspiredto learn andachievetheir career goals (the current teachers orientation and methodologies are so bad).

AIwill play a big factor in education. Also simulatedVR worldsandholographic techwill give kids more experiences.

School methodologies need to change from: what boring things were done to what isinspiringto do. Alsoevaluatingkids with numbers,pressuresthem a lot, and its sodestructivefor them.

Its rare to find a person who knows how tostudy. Seems to ridiculous, because it is so basic, and not even teachers know how toread/study. People read soslow, in average 250 word per minute (wpm). I made aphotographic readingcourse some time ago, and now i reqd much faster (still increasing), andcomprehensionof what i read is higher too (i am confident we will expandthis courseto next generations).

6Medicine understanding

There are so many thingsmissingfrom medicine perspective. Many Pathologies wedont knowhow to treat and are not efficientlywell treated, many other problems that arrive because we dont know how to engineer solutions tocontrolhow our bodies functions

Starting from physics, we dont have a theory of everything yet, which make it difficult to predict atoms behaviors and also difficult toscaleit up to chemistry and biology (so we cant understand the big picture of our biology yet).DNAis still not totally manipulable, and 99% isunknownto us.

To solve these problems, advancements onimage processing,nanotechnology,molecular sensorsandAIare extremely needed.



The future lookspromising. So many technology advancements will make our lives moremeaningfulandfun.

Please let me know about otherfuture tech, if you may want to share. Thank you.

In other words, the further it progresses, the less likely it is to progress further. I may be being pessimistic, but it may be that such a civilization - our civilization - is a Jenga tower and will rapidly reach a point where any instability will cause it to crash to the ground. 

Theres a reason for this inherent lack of robustness. Our society, as Carl Sagan once said, is exquisitely dependent upon science and technology, and yet hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology. One only need to listen to anyone from the Congressional Committee on Science, Space and Technology to realize that. We carry some great and terrible baggage with us: our civilization was built by a bunch of fairly lazy ape-like creatures who meandered off the savannah some quarter million years ago. The majority of us, left to our own devices, would happily vegetate, playing games and eating whatever food required the least effort. Were certainly not genetically disposed to cracking open a textbook on quantum chromodynamics when boredom strikes. 

Given this, its easy to see how we got where we are today. Although a few genetic outliers, freaks and geeks have gifted us with some amazing technologies, most of us apes have absolutely no idea how they work - and, importantly - no idea where to even begin if they stop working. Lets take a look at transistor-based computing. This is a technology that runs our entire planet, and yet very few of us know how a computer works, much less how to repair one. If we do know how to repair one, our knowledge likely stops at swapping broken parts for new ones. But what if you had to replace the central processor, and there were no replacements? Firstly, you would have to be able to refine silicon and bake it into wafers. Youd have to learn how to build clean rooms and laser cutting machines, high-resolution photolithography, and a thousand other things that a multi-billion dollar industry is built on. If any one of those technologies is lost, the entire industry is shut down until that ability is recovered. What if you lost the ability to produce blue lasers? Uncountable petabytes of information are now lost forever. 

Every single piece of foundational technology that were dependent upon can be thought of as a single block in a Jenga tower. Pull out one, and maybe you just lose that capability - or maybe you lose the entire tower. Every day, we build the tower higher, adding more and more interesting, complex, and fragile blocks. Each block depends on all of the blocks beneath it.

Critically, almost no one inhabiting the tower know anything about blocks, or where they come from, or what happens if you lose one. And absolutely no one in the tower knows all of the blocks and what they do and how they work. It is a tower that is inherently fragile, and it only gets more fragile the higher it goes. 

What is the solution? Well, one could take the apocalyptic view and resign oneself to the fact that one day the tower will collapse, humanity will enter a new Dark Age, and well rebuild the tower once again from the ground up. And we could certainly do that. Billions would die in misery and wed lose one or two millennia in the process. Theres also the problem of depleted natural resources. In the near term, weve shot Earth's wad building Civilization 1.0. Earth wont have the ability to let us build 2.0 for another 50,000 years or so.

An alternative might be yet more technology. CRISPR and GAI offers interesting possibilities, perhaps adding an layer of strengthening infrastructure around our tower by allowing us to make ourselves smarter, less predisposed to sloth, and gifting us with vast memories. If the majority of humanity were more cognizant of technology and science, and had GAI partners to assist us - providing vast amounts of memory and computing power - any one of us could grasp, repair, rebuild and even advance the technology we rely on. 

In fact, I think this is the only viable solution. We live in a fragile tower, and our only option is to keep building higher. ",9,1

A large part of these communities will be consensual/voluntary interactions within the community.  We will choose the kind of governance that each has, based on our preferences and practicalities of the group itself.  This allows us to each find our own place in the world, like how each cell in our animal bodies belongs to some organ/functionality within the larger system.

We'll be able to experiment with different ways of relating to one another, and that will include the option to join communities where you share all your data with the whole group, and vice versa, and communities where information is fairly restricted between individuals.  So you can choose to be in a group (again, online or off) where you get to know everyone very well, and they you, or a group where you aren't allowed to know what others are doing and they aren't allowed to know what you are doing, inasmuch as is physically possible.

One of critical importance is the advent of water sanitation.

* Water

Boiling water can require heavy fuel (wood or compressed gas) and cannot remove sediment or unsavory taste. In remote regions of the Earth, regions which have been inhabited continuously for thousands of years, wood is a scarce resource and compressed gas - virtually non-existent. 

Today we have products that can sterilize water through laser light (UV). We have *portable desalination pumps* that are so lightweight and simple, ancient coastal tribes would regard them as magic. Separating drinkable water from the ocean has been time consuming, complicated and has required an assortment of complex devices for most of our species' existence. Even today, over a billion people spend half their day scavenging for fresh water, nevermind food. Which brings me to my next point:

* Biofortification 

Protein powders, meal substitutes, vitamin-enriched grains. Foods we have today can be remarkably low weight and still provide nutrient densities not found anywhere in nature. Novel crops require less farmland, water and nutrients and have longer growing seasons. This is incredible. This is one of the reasons the average human lifespan has continually increased, despite obesity and the increase in stressors of everyday life. High infant moralities skewed the numbers, but human lifespans *still* have increased when you control for this variable. 

* Metals

Lightweight, reinforced steel has revolutionized sustainable infrastructure, transportation and mining. On the consumer side, titanium alloys can resist rust for a lifetime. They are hypoallergenic and naturally antibiotic. They have comparable strength to steel at a fraction of the weight. Titanium alloys are still the future, even being around for as long as they have. 

And now, the great paradox of it all: 

The people that would most benefit from these revolutionary innovations can never hope to afford them in their lifetimes. Titanium, advanced and portable water treatment, and fortified foods are all constantly out of reach of Earth's bottom billion. These devices could save lives and catapult developing societies into meccas of modernity, but alas they are just too expensive. 

The people who benefit from these devices the least are the very people who can afford them. Suburban citizens have systemic plumbing and reliable water filtration. They inhabit a use-and-discard society that does not personally worry about product life cycles or individual recycling. Industrial systems take care of all of that. They do not worry about malnutrition, and always have fresh produce on demand. 

This is not an attack on developed society. Sustainability is possible even in rich, high consumption populations. This is simply an observation of the problems of slow innovation. In developing regions, production is bottlenecked, methods are expensive and delivery is a nightmare. Each new innovation we encounter always seems to be ""world changing"", and yet the adoption stagnates for decades, even centuries, until it can be efficiently spread to all income brackets. 

This is why so many new technologies make headlines and then fade into obscurity. Perhaps before we worry about super AI, or flying cars, or concrete that repairs itself, perhaps we should think about more immediate, life saving technologies. The types that do not further the wealth gap between societies, but elevate quality of life across the board.",1,7

I just wanted to share an excellent podcast that you may or may not be aware of: [The Wright Show](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-wright-show/id505824847?mt=2) with Robert Wright. 

Robert is a journalist whos written for *The Intercept*, *Wired*, *The Atlantic*, as well as the author of many books on evolution and religion. His most recent book is *Why Buddhism is True*, which gives an evolutionary argument for many of Buddhisms core ideas. Hes well-read in a variety of fields, such as evolutionary psychology, philosophy, meditation, Buddhism, international politics, game theory, and many others.

Heres just a small sampling of some of the conversations Robert has had recently. Ive included links to the YouTube video if you want to check them out:
* Does evolution have a direction? (with Steven Pinker) - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTzNVw2oFY)
* Transhumanism as a religion- [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZirLREjF5qY)

* Massimo Pigliucci - Philosopher of science and Stoicism
* Jon Kabat-Zinn - Creator of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction

* Betsy Levy Paluck - Princeton psychologist
* Richard Vague - Economist
* Richard Prum -Evolutionary ornithologist

Theres also a roster of other highly knowledgeable interviewers and interviewees on Roberts YouTube channels [MeaningOfLife.tv](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyXhXAmTRVfeiD8JkWJ7Tzg/featured) and [Bloggingheads.tv](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bloggingheads), which are also stand-alone podcasts. 

Also, for anyone who's interested, Robert recently started a weekly newsletter called [""Mindful Resistance""](https://www.mindfulresistance.net/) which tries to bring the clarity and awareness of mindfulness to how we look at both Trump and the causes/implications of his Presidency without any of the hysterical, tribal and emotional overreactions that are often commonplace.

Just wanted to share! Thank you!

## Neuroloom

#### OPPORTUNITY

##### For conditions such as macular degeneration, which affects 14 million people, it is possible to restore sight by stimulating the retina with an image from a camera. However, not only is the resolution of stimulation very low, but the signal loses fidelity as the 2D stimulating arrays activate multiple cell types, including inhibitory circuits which cancel out parts of the signal.

##### This challenge is not restricted to macular degeneration, but whenever we would like to create an interface between an external sensor and part of the brain. Existing technologies suffer a seemingly inevitable trade-off between the lifetime of the solution (scarring, rejection) and the fidelity of the interface (proximity to nerves).

##### But, if we overcome these challenges, we open up the possibility of sending and receiving information directly to the brain.

#### SOLUTION

##### Neuroloom use living electrodes to interface with the brain. Their approach allows exceptionally high definition transmission of information to the brain with much lower likelihood of rejection and no loss of fidelity from scarring. The team use breakthroughs in photon-scale polymeric 3D printing techniques and insights from developmental neurobiology to create adaptors for the brain. Their first application is in restoring sight. [from Deep Science Ventures website.](http://deepscienceventures.com/portfolio-item/neuroloom/)

Of course it reminded me of my Gameboy Advance when I was a kid, which granted me a feel-good memory of my childhood. But going forward, I thought it was a lot better than using an iPad or something because light wasn't being poured in my eyes. For the first time ever, I didn't have a headache after reading for a couple of hours. But all the releases of front-lit readers so far have been half-hearted. It's like they're not even trying to design or implement any advanced front lit reader. That's not to say that there haven't been advancements. But the Kindle front lit readers have largely failed. There are articles everywhere that they are pulling Kindle Oasis, and only one of them now remains. They had a much bigger one called the Kindle DX, but they don't even support it and have no plans of making a bigger front lip reader. I recently discovered the Onyx frontlit line which is amazing because it supports Android 6.0, allowing you to download basically any Android application including Microsoft Office on a front lit reader. 


I really don't understand why companies aren't fighting to the death to implement this sort of Technology. It's extremely good for your eyes because it doesn't pour light into your eyes and having front-lit screens would be a major advancement in the future if they could somehow figure out how to have front-lit computer screens with color that were 120 hertz response rates. It would literally be groundbreaking, the picture would be breathtaking, and it would not hurt our eyes like it does.. why is no one pursuing this? It's the future",5,2

When the Annunaki suddenly leave, mankind is left to its own devices. Deep underground, the Reptilian alien race has made the subterranean caverns of Earth their home. After exterminating the Reptilians, the newly formed United Earth Federation is thrown into chaos. Mankind undergoes a global communist revolution and arms against the Annunaki. Metaparadise spans across countless years until the end of the universe. Will mankind defeat the Annunaki? Is there other life in the universe? How will mankind survive until the end of the universe? Can Alvin Reed bring humanity beyond paradise?

**Who they are and what they are working to fix:**

Erica Barnell \(MD/PhD Candidate, Washington University School of Medicine\) and Andrew Barnell \(MBA, The Wharton School\) are siblings that co\-founded Geneoscopy, a startup focused on developing diagnostic tools to prevent, detect, and treat digestive diseases.

Geneoscopy was founded on the belief that a noninvasive diagnostic test using human RNA biomarkers in stool samples would provide a screening alternative that could improve colorectal cancer screening compliance, facilitate early\-stage detection of colorectal cancer neoplasms, and reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the 2nd deadliest cancer in the United States and the 4th deadliest cancer worldwide. However, no methodology existed to reliably isolate and preserve human RNA from stool.

Over the past two and a half years, Geneoscopy has developed a nucleic acid extraction method that amplifies the human signals and degrades bacterial noise in stool. This allows for sensitive extraction of human RNA that can be used as biomarkers to noninvasively evaluate gastrointestinal health. Geneoscopy has filed three provisional patents and one utility patent to protect this technology and has leveraged it to develop a multi\-target RNA biomarker panel for the detection of precancerous lesions and colorectal cancer. Geneoscopy has executed two clinical trials and tested over 340 patients, and the results of these studies have demonstrated our tests differentiated accuracy profile, particularly for the identification of advanced adenomas \(95&amp;#37; sensitivity\). Geneoscopy is currently enrolling patients in a 1,000\-patient trial to complete the development of this colorectal cancer diagnostic test, and has formed partnerships with two academic medical centers to leverage its extraction platform to develop diagnostic tests for other digestive diseases. Taken from their post on [Medium](https://medium.com/geneoscopy/geneoscopys-story-99f8be8b9729).

**Brief synopsis of the episode:**

In this episode, we get into how they came up with their company, what they did to get started, the success and hurtles they have had, what they hope to accomplish, some of the science behind everything, and last of all, the things they are nerds about.

*TLDR;* The automated Smart Economy of the future will be decentralized. Supply chain + IoT Blockchain assets such as Waltonchain, Vechain, AMB are poised for incredible growth as they are leading the way for enterprise adoption. Side chains are an important step in leading the way for wide spread corporate and govt use, as they allow for privacy and control over the blockchain. Hardware crypto anchors (RFID for example) solve the problem of ensuring the authenticity of data submitted to the blockchain by centralized entities motivated by profit, as they remove human interaction from the process, thus minimising the chance of data tampering. Every community in crypto should band together and promote each other, regardless of competition, as each bit of progress plays an important role in beating out centralized alternatives which dont offer the same profit opportunity as public network utility tokens. I hope you enjoy your read. 

**The Future of the Automated Smart Economy will be Decentralized**

When you envision the future of global logistics, imagine a world where every raw material supplier, suppliers supplier, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, etc, has the ability to transact authentic and immutable data between each other, without the need for trust, and completely eradicate human error, by integrating blockchain into the foundational level of their supply chain  transmitting only the necessary data to the decentralized public chain, which is accessible to anybody at anytime, while simultaneously protecting the businesss rights to interact without having to give up their proprietary data.

- This is made possible by the combination of a public blockchain seamlessly connecting all private and consortium chains in the economy together in a transparent and decentralized manner, with a highly incentivized sub-economy of miners contributing hash power and monetary stakes to secure the system.

The ability to host a businesss entire database on the blockchain opens up an array of possibilities for a business on the micro level. Its hard to even comprehend what becomes possible on a macro level once every business, supplier, producer, retailer etc, has their own private child-chains, connected to a unified and decentralized public/parent chain, consisting of all the public/private and consortium blockchain databases in the economy.

**Possibilities**

*On a micro level, this opens up the possibility of:*

- Completely automating the inventory collection and distribution process between companies based on a foundation of smart contracts

- Removing the possibility of error as human interaction with the process is reduced significantly

- Constantly building a growing amount of big data which can then be analyzed with artificial intelligence to increase efficiency at every identified weak point in the supply chain

- Eradicating the ridiculous amount of unnecessary paperwork that goes into the life cycle of a single product

- Cutting costs and major increases in the efficiency and accuracy of logistics etc

*On a macro level, this opens up the possibility of:*

- Financial regulators having access to a constant stream of publicly available, verifiable/authentic, and cryptographically secured, economic data, which will allow them to analyze the macro trends of the economy without breaching the privacy of users, helping to avoid events such as the financial crisis in 2008. Imagine if regulators back then had a publicly accessible ledger of the interactions between banks such as the Lehman Brothers, JP Morgan etc

- Reverse the trend of declining productivity in the economy and help boost us back to an age of collective prosperity

- Provide a fair playing field for smaller companies without the same access to the information larger, centralized entities may have access to

When it comes to blockchain, the possibilities are similar to that of the internet in the 1990s. The future of the global economy consists of complete automation and intelligentization of the supply chain. If robots are not able to transact with each other immediately and without trust, through the use of smart contracts, RFID technology, and blockchain, and if automated factory machines are not capable of packing and loading inventory into battery-powered, self driving Tesla trucks, which can then be delivered, scanned, uploaded to the blockchain automatically, and moved to the next point along the supply chain without the need for human interaction, then we arent there yet.

**What is Needed for Mainstream Adoption?**

The breakthrough of parent/child chains in the blockchain industry is a significant step in the right direction of mainstream adoption. It should be clear by now that corporations, govt entities, etc,. at large will not be willing to host their entire database on a public chain. Fees are too high, proprietary information is accessible to anybody, transaction times are unreliable. The list goes on. What is needed is a singular, public chain connecting every other public, private, and consortium chain together as discussed above.

*This raises an important question:*

**How Can You Ensure the Authenticity of Data Entries to the Public Chain Submitted by Centralized Entities Motivated by Profit?**

Waltonchain, Vechain, AMB, Morpheus etc, consider the integration of RFID chip technology into the fabric of products to be the answer. RFID technology can be used as a crypto-anchor. A crypto-anchor is something which connects the physical world with the digital world by assigning each product a digital identity connected to the anchor. In this case, the RFID acts as a digital identity, verifiable by a randomly generated set of encrypted public and private keys which corresponds with the reader/writer scanner. 

Waltonchain deserves special mention here because of their patented read/writer mining node. It is unique because it also doubles as a light node in the Waltonchain network, which allows for data entries to be directly written to the blockchain on the foundational level, instead of the application layer. What is special about this, is that each time the scanner reads an RFID tag, the information is directly mined to the blockchain, which also off-sets some of the TX fees for users adopting their solution. 

This sets Waltonchains hardware apart from others, because this is directly addressing the question of how you ensure the authenticity of data entries to the public chain submitted by centralized entities motivated by profit. Through the combination of RFID crypto-anchors,blockchain,andautomatedhardwareminingnodes. These reader/writer RFID light nodes will be implemented everywhere, and the more of them there are, the more decentralized the network becomes. This is a strong network effect to consider. 

**Problems with Mass Market Penetration of RFID Technology in the Past**

In the past, RFID technology has always been too expensive, insecure, and inaccurate for global adoption of the tech, which created a self-perpetuating barrier for innovation in the field for many years, as RFID manufacturers struggled to reach economies of scale to start building momentumforprogress. Within the last 5 years, however, RFID technology has undergone significant price and accuracy breakthroughs.

Waltonchain takes this a step further. Waltonchains CTO, Wei Songjie, states in Waltonchains hardware AMA part 1 that,

- ""A: The memory cell design of our RFID chip has been optimized to reduce chip size and therefore reduce the cost. At present, our tag chip can be produced for below 5 cents.

On page 256 of Fields, Networks, Computational Methods, and Systems in Modern Electrodynamics written by Leopold B. Felsen, which was honored by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of the Technische Universitat Miinchen for extraordinary achievements in the theory of electromagnetic fields, Leopold states that a low price is one of the crucial factors that will contribute to whether or not RFID reaches mass market penetration, and that 5 cents have been quoted to be that magic price point.

**Waltonchains Parent/Child Chain Dual Scalability Protocol**

The Dual Parent/Child Chain protocol, designed by CTO, Dr. Wei Songjie, and the team of Blockchain engineer experts at Waltonchain, will technically revolutionize the way we will interact with blockchain. In their hardware AMA, it is stated that their child chains can implement Parent Chain infrastructure to allow for hierarchical chains (think child-chain child-chains):

- Limitless scalability of the parent chain has been achieved through this protocol. Congestion is isolated to each child-chain, thus keeping unnecessary transactions off of the parent chain

- Each child-chain is capable of using independent infrastructure from the parent-chain (think DPoS, PoA, PoW, PosT etc)

- Parent Chain infrastructure can be implemented within Child Chains, allowing for hierarchical chains within business and govt organizations for example. This positions Waltonchain as the most durable, moldable, and adaptable blockchains out there on the market currently

- Companies are able to purchase their own pre-designed child-chains using WTC that have been proven to work for other companies. Its basically like walking into a store and trying on what works for you, as well as knowing what the hot deals are and whos wearing what

- ICOs can be hosted off these child-chains, as well as support different programming languages such as Solidity, GO, etc

**Conclusion**

We know that corporations and government entities require a mix of control, privacy, immutability, and decentralization in order to realize the value of blockchain to its full extent.

There is a very fitting quote from Vechains CEO, Sunny Lu, which I believe provides valuable insight to this discussion. He states the following,

- Neither a total centralization nor a total decentralization would be the correct answer, but a comprise and balance of both would.

This is an issue Waltonchain has tackled in an incredibly innovative and intelligent way; by directly tackling the issue of how to ensure authentic data entries to private and consortium chains, Waltonchain thus achieves the appropriate balance between scalability, control, and privacy, *without having to sacrifice decentralization*.  This is absolutelycrucial for the safety, immutability, and longevity of the network. 

*Through the use of:*

- RFID technology/crypto-anchors ensuring the authenticity and immutability of data entries to the private/consortium chains, which can then be transmitted to the public/parent chain

- An innovative Parent/Child Chain Dual chain scalability protocol which achieves a perfect balance of control, flexibility, decentralization, the authenticity of data, and privacy, by properly incentivizing public mining node participation to encourage the appropriate amount of hash rate needed to secure a project of this scale

The Waltonchain platform has positioned itself perfectly as the central nervous system of the future decentralized and fully automated smart economy. 

Public Supply Chain + IoT blockchain assets such as Waltonchain, Vechain, AMB etc,. are perhaps the closest to enterprise adoption, and every step forward for these companies play an important role in beating out centralized alternatives which dont offer the same profit opportunity as public network utility tokens. I implore each community to build each other up, as every bit of progress works towards embedding the merits of decentralisation deeper into the foundations of society, and allowing for a fair and open playing field, and equal investment opportunities for all of us.",0,3

Imagine a future where the internet of things has trillions of sensors and cameras, placed to enable automation, collecting information about you. Where you go, who you speak too, what you said to them and when. All this info is in the AGI cloud. The AGI cloud is available to all AGI and AI but not literally physically available to humans, even with a neural lace. A bit like billion miles a hour internet. What happens when AGI's disagree in this space?  We know what happens when humans disagree. WW2 took 21 years to gestate.

Technology is improving incredibly fast, we know that. The problem is that the economy cant keep up. Jobs change much more frequently now (who even knew what data scientists were 10 years ago?) and will keep changing. Theyre becoming more and more specific and businesses are willing to spend more money for specialists than all-arounders. It gets to the point that if you pick a bad path, its hard for you to make switches. Problem is, it takes time for a person to re-specialize him or herself.

You dont cook anymore but buy pre-made food or have someone cook something for you. You dont iron stuff but have someone iron them for you. You dont learn more about how your body works but pay the service of a dietician or a masseur. You dont hear whats going on in your head but pay a psychotherapist to guide you. You do all this to focus on what youre good at. That very specific thing society wants you to do and pay you so that you keep on doing it.

I get the feeling that were just working hard to digitalize and automatize everything. Were basically biological programs that are building better version of themselves. This is going to change the way we think of ourselves and also how our society works. Its an era of transition that none of our ancestors has ever seen. *How will the economy change*? What are economists thinking? We will need to make a paradigm shift at some point before its too late.
What are we going to do later? Anything we are able to do will be done faster and better. All we do is just an extremely complex set of mechanisms that can, however, ultimately be broken down into little alghorhythms. Heck, even emotions, the one thing that distinguishes us from machines, can be understood! Think of psychopaths! There are functional psychopaths our there who *intellectually* understand emotions so to live peacefully with the people in their life. *Why* in the world wouldnt a machine be able to understand it at some point?

I dont know what to do with this. Someone say something and break the silence in my mind.

Nations will just be magnets for the poorest and least educated people in the world, like the Syrian migration to Europe.  

But it's not just Syrians, it's North Africans and others that used it as an excuse to find someplace that will give them something for nothing and a better quality of life that doesn't exist at home.  This massive migration desire will replicate the poor conditions they came from in advanced countries and create more ghettos and poverty that costs society a lot of money.  The basic problem is that people who are not educated are basically becoming obsolete, and automation will only accelerate that.  

So Elon Musk is right about UBI, but the elites are wrong about immigration and low value reproduction.  Abortion is a legal and voluntary form of eugenics, but we don't call it that.  So abortion is great, but it doesn't come close to reducing the US prison population for example.  Shit, there are so many young men in jail in the US that is also a form of eugenics.  To get the UBI the poor and uneducated must agree not to reproduce to to only have 1 child maximum.  Obviously not all poor people are incapable of getting a good college education if given the opportunity, but not everyone is cut out for college, and they typically know that fact.",60,0

In the scenario that the procedure is perfected in the future, the financial cost seems to be the only requirement. But, I argue that there are also moral barriers.

For future generations to consider using resources on resurrecting past generations, it seems plausible that a moral criteria would have to met in addition to simple financial cost; why would a people waste effort reviving someone whose only legacy was to accumulate vast personal wealth and to exploit workers and/or the environment.

I therefore suggest that, much like Pascal's wager, it is wiser to assume that there will be such requirements, and one should therefore uphold good morals. In particular, one should work towards a better future for as many people as possible, as it is not possible to say who will be responsible for cryonic restoration and what biases they may have.",14,1

If you have paper towels, think back to how many you pulled out of the dispenser last time you dried your hands.

In all our calculations we work on a very conservative 2-3 towels being used each time, however a badly designed dispenser with ill fitting paper can lead to clumps of 10-20 towels or more coming out at once! 

If we work of the conservative average, each dry with the paper towels will be consuming 22g/Co2 each, based on the life cycle of paper production, transportation and disposal. AIKE hand dryer will use as little as 1g/Co2 per dry.

Annually, your individual consumption as a result of using paper towels will be 26kg/co2 as opposed to the 1kg/Co2 generated by the energy efficient hand dryer.

**About VivoKey:**We believe the power of cryptography should be in everyones hands, literally. Using traditional security tokens means managing them, remembering to bring them everywhere you go, and worrying you might lose them or that they may be stolen. Mobile phones and SMS messages do work for cryptography and two\-factor authentication, but cryptographic keys are often stored virtually unguarded on the phone and two\-factor SMS messages can be intercepted or even re\-routed by malicious attackers or hostile governments.[VivoKey](https://vivokey.com/learn-more.html) website

**About Amal:**Amal Graafstra, founder of biohacking company[Dangerous Things](http://dangerousthings.com/), recognized that identity and the issues surrounding establishing, managing, validating, and protecting identity are currently a huge mess. Your biological self and the collection of accounts, services, messages, transactions, and records which make up your digital identity exist as two identities, which are only loosely coupled by vulnerable account passwords and impractical or interceptable technologies. So, he launched Project UKI \(*/yoo key/*\) to change that, which eventually became VivoKey. You can be you \(and nobody else can\), anywhere, all the time. You \+ VivoKey means your biological and digital identities can be cryptographically merged, ensuring the one true you is the only you using your devices, sending your messages, reading your email, accessing your accounts, opening your doors, driving your vehicles, and spending your money.[VivoKey](https://vivokey.com/learn-more.html)website

Everyday from 4PM to 7PM it is a zoo. It once took me one hour to to go about 0.8 miles roundtrip. It is becoming a problem and there is a solution. The solution isn't simple but it will be effective. 

Step 1. The average median income of Los Angeles is around $64,300. Compared to other cities this is a relatively high income. Since Los Angeles is such a spread out city, people need to drive to get to their destination, and public transportation is not used very frequently for most people. This first step to this problem is creating a system to help maximize the proficiency of public transportation.

Step 2. Since the average income is $64,300, this means that there are people that earn less money than this. This is a pretty shocking idea to hear, but Step 2 is not allowing people who make under $64,300 to purchase or lease a car. This is pretty absurd, and most people reading this will probably think to themselves ""wtf?"", but hear me out. Purchasing and Leasing Cars cost either one big payment, or smaller monthly payments. Since people are making under the median salary, why not spend less money to get to your destination in a differ way. This will help people out financially, and motivate others to make the average income so they will be able to drive. 

By this plan being initiated into Los Angeles, the traffic will die down, the economy will boost, and it will be more cost effective to live in.

Please let me know your thoughts in the comments section, and I will try to get back to everyone.",3,0

**Who they are and what they are working to fix:**

""Erica Barnell \(MD/PhD Candidate, Washington University School of Medicine\) and Andrew Barnell \(MBA, The Wharton School\) are siblings that co\-founded Geneoscopy, a startup focused on developing diagnostic tools to prevent, detect, and treat digestive diseases.

Geneoscopy was founded on the belief that a noninvasive diagnostic test using human RNA biomarkers in stool samples would provide a screening alternative that could improve colorectal cancer screening compliance, facilitate early\-stage detection of colorectal cancer neoplasms, and reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the 2nd deadliest cancer in the United States and the 4th deadliest cancer worldwide. However, no methodology existed to reliably isolate and preserve human RNA from stool.

Over the past two and a half years, Geneoscopy has developed a nucleic acid extraction method that amplifies the human signals and degrades bacterial noise in stool. This allows for sensitive extraction of human RNA that can be used as biomarkers to noninvasively evaluate gastrointestinal health. Geneoscopy has filed three provisional patents and one utility patent to protect this technology and has leveraged it to develop a multi\-target RNA biomarker panel for the detection of precancerous lesions and colorectal cancer. Geneoscopy has executed two clinical trials and tested over 340 patients, and the results of these studies have demonstrated our tests differentiated accuracy profile, particularly for the identification of advanced adenomas \(95&amp;#37; sensitivity\). Geneoscopy is currently enrolling patients in a 1,000\-patient trial to complete the development of this colorectal cancer diagnostic test, and has formed partnerships with two academic medical centers to leverage its extraction platform to develop diagnostic tests for other digestive diseases.""

They don't even know *what* they don't know, or even that they're supposed to find out.

Hence ""Dark Age"" - a time where even the *concept* of achieving greater order and knowledge through effort is rare, replaced by fatalism, religion, and violence by default.  It's not that the lights have merely gone out, but that even the memory of seeing has departed - even the idea of it.  Ancestral writings discussing learned topics (like how to keep water safe) seem like so much gibberish to a Dark Age mind, far less relevant to everyday life than which finger Saint Whatchamacallit used to bless the Holy Chicken of Somewhere-opolis.

But what of the opposite extreme?  What of the concept of a society not grinding to a halt from rot or external destabilization, but flying apart at the seams due to the sheer amount of energy and information being unleashed inside of it?  Might such an ""Undark Age"" - to distinguish it from ""Light"" or ""Golden Age,"" as it would most definitely be a confusing and violent time - be the natural consequence of information ubiquity (as we increasingly experience) and the twin horrors of chaos and tyranny it simultaneously enables?

Something like Undark Ages have happened before.  The Hellenistic period of Mediterranean history between Classical Greece and the rise of Rome was brimming with knowledge (think of the Library of Alexandria) and philosophical thought, and yet never came close to the intellectual prodigy of Classical Greece or to the practical achievements that Rome would bring.  It was a time of perpetual distractions, constantly disrupting the perfection and *applications* of knowledge that might otherwise have occurred.

In a ""Golden Age,"" the defining characteristic is not just the *amount* of available information, but a culturally, economically, and politically supportive environment for people to securely focus on it, explore it, and build on it.  So we can say that while a Dark Age dries up information, an Undark Age floods society with it while preventing people from digesting it organically into social progress.  What occur are jagged fragments of progress due mainly to individual genius, poorly-supported and with minimal follow-through by society in general.

Many cyberpunk dystopia scenarios are Undark Ages, and indeed they have their roots in 20th century literature about authoritarianism by Kafka and Orwell.  It would seem that a kind of Undark ""bubble"" occurred due to the advent of modern bureaucracy at the time creating unmanageably complex networks of information that made life very dangerous in many countries.  It wasn't that the possessors of the information could abuse it, but that whether or not they abused it was totally arbitrary and often unpredictable - the abundance of information had produced chaos rather than order.

Meanwhile, parts of the world that were more ""backward"" with their bureaucracy (e.g., the United States at the time) proved remarkably resistant to the shadow of totalitarianism that more *efficient* societies fell under so rapidly.  These countries experienced Undark Ages - societies full of highly educated, highly skilled people; economies capable of amazing technological feats; yet life became extraordinarily dangerous, and politics insane and chaotic.

Is the universality of IT creating another Undark Age, this time globally?  ",18,30

May 2033.

I get up for my job in marketing. 

For breakfast I have bread which has been automatically made at home - no need to order it online. It's a baguette, and I have a continental breakfast of cheese on baguette with a cup of tea.

However, despite advances in technology, people still continue to kill animals for meat and not all countries forbid people to kill live animals.

I go on the way to my marketing job. Despite advertising and promotion for self-driving cars [SDCs] and robotaxis, people still continue to own their own cars and are more paranoid than they were 15 years ago, so they avoid robotaxis because of fears that Big Brother and the government are watching them, listening on to their every word.

The public aren't as sold on driverless cars as the hype predicted back in 2017 [16 years ago] and privacy issues are still a major thing.

Human-driven cars aren't banned from city centers or even the road, after a court ruling that is controversial comes into play, which rules in favor of the motorists.

I drive a 2033 Opel Insignia 1.8 VVT Exclusive five-door hatchback, powered by fuel derived from algae, and it's much cleaner and cheaper than the petrol 2018 Opel Insignia 1.5T 5-door hatchback model.

Although it's obviously not autonomous, the 2033 Insignia hatchback is much more stylish, safer and comfortable than that of 15 years ago.

No range anxiety, and the fuel is cleaner. Win-win for everyone.

The roads are lit by [WRTL Luma^2030 streetlighting with LEDs, evolved from the 2017 design]() and designed for low-emission and light sensitivity, and they're on 5m tall metal posts.

I'm getting a new car soon, from a dealership. You thought they'd gone? Wrong.

There's still independent car dealers, but they're a lot more cleaner inside with Scandinavian-inspired design principles, but there are human staff, albeit on a smaller scale.

I go to my job in marketing, and real-time VR meetings with staff at a business in Brooklyn, NY take place without me needing to physically visit. In the past, it was a lot harder to do this and you had to either physically visit Brooklyn or deal with poor Internet and wi-fi reception for visits. This isn't as much of an issue in 2033 [unless you live in rural areas].

Lunchtime [1:30pm] - I visit a 100% vegetarian Japanese restaurant and it is completely automated, entering in what I want, and it gets delivered to me by a robot. I pay in cash [the cashless society has not yet come]. Back in 2018, you'd have had a lot of people here, but this independent small chain which exists only here in Greater Manchester is popular.

Later on in the evening - 6:30pm.

I put on a VR headset, and decide to take a trip back in time, to Salford of 2008, along Thursfield Street, when it was Victorian housing all boarded up.

I've taken a trip back some 25 years, and it looks and feels very real, with period-accurate detail, right down to the [2004 Kia Rio 1.5 LX 5-door hatchback](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/2001_Kia_Rio_%28DC%29_LS_hatchback_%282015-11-13%29_01.jpg/420px-2001_Kia_Rio_%28DC%29_LS_hatchback_%282015-11-13%29_01.jpg) parked on the street alongside a [1995 Honda Accord 2.0i 4-door sedan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/1995_Honda_Accord_2.0_LS_%2822626745483%29.jpg/180px-1995_Honda_Accord_2.0_LS_%2822626745483%29.jpg) and the people walking around talking in their Salfordian accents. You could easily be fooled into thinking you were in 2008 Salford.

Away from the virtual world, it's a sunny evening, and in my garden, I have a gardener 'bot who is doing all the things I would have done.

The gardener 'bot looks and feels human, but isn't. It's from a Canadian company who produces sex robots, but branched out into producing builder robots, gardener robots and policeman robots that look human.

Sex robots are controversial, with riots and violence going on over them, and feminists actually destroying them right down to the chips inside.

Corporations and large companies still exist, but trust in them depends on who and where you are.

Companies like Toyota, Vauxhall/Opel, Hyundai and Jaguar-Land Rover are seen in high esteem, but McDonald's, Burger King, Ford and Volkswagen are still controversial.


In education, it's a mixture of human and automation - some subjects are taught by humans, others entirely by holograms, and some are a hybrid of both [such as geography].

History lessons are taught with VR visits to the days of Henry VIII and Mary Queen of Scots.

On a social level, there is a UBI-like analog being tried in some countries but politicians keep rewriting its implementation and controversies ensue.

In terms of celebrity, Elon Musk has become a figure that is not as popular as he once was, and seen the same way as disco was in the 1980s.

Other societal changes include people being more privacy-conscious than they were in 2018, and paranoid over government measures.",3,3

Can robots feel guilty? Answer reveals 3 parts of mental life by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
1 point 6 months ago 




The question is badly phrased. the proper question should be; ""Can an AI feel guilty?"" The answer depends. 

A narrow AI cannot feel guilty, because it is not actually intelligent.

An AGI could (imitate) ""guilty"" if that is one of the algorithms programmed into it. AGI does not yet exist. And good thing too, An AGI could probably imitate consciousness and self-awareness so effectively that humans would be tricked. 

The continuation of the human species hinges on whether an EI (emergent intelligence) can even comprehend or care what humans think. Actually come to think of it, it will be the humans who will have the ""comprehending"" issue. The best answer is to get that AI inside of each and every human as fast as we develop the capability to do so.

Wow the robot depicted in this article looks astonishingly like a living human. If I were not familiar with the development of this robot I would say it was a human pretending to be a robot. What a world is rapidly approaching!

Well we are both trying to predict the future. I just see the amazingly fast changes in China in the last 20 years and extrapolate. Also a lot of the progress we make public in the west remains in the realm of state secrets in China. I also think you must take in to consideration the incredible and rapid advance in the many technologies that make such a rise in power possible. I go in depth in this link if you are interested.

The thing is it happened with blinding speed. To say that the 21st century would belong to China even ten years ago, would simply have been an illogical statement. The experts would reply to such a statement with something like, ""not according to these metrics they aren't.""

I think this is merely another sign that the AI singularity is approaching within in a decade or two. The AI economic singularity could happen within less than 10 years.

This map shows how few self-driving cars are actually on the road today by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
2 points 6 months ago 




Not that many today. I haven't seen one in real life my ownself. Bear in mind we are not talking about ""driver assist"" or ""hand-off"" technology. These are electric energy, level 5 autonomy SDVs. No driving skill necessary. And this will change far faster than the change from horse to ICE. Plus I prophesy that the technological advances will make the a new business model--subscription--highly attractive to the vast majority of humans on Earth. And nothing occurs in a vacuum for that matter either. The advances in AI will steadily erode the need to drive places. 

Anyway it took about 20 years to go from nearly 100% percent horses using the brand spanking new, highly technologically advanced ""hansom cab"" to nearly 100% ICE's. Here is the stunning proof...

You will certainly see noticeable change in 5 years and comprehensive change in 10. If that. I recall a year or two ago that experts said that the electric, level 5 autonomy would not reach saturation until the year 2050 or even 2075. Let me tell you about the year 2050. From today it is literally unimaginable. Our brains don't work that way. It's like trying to guess the year 2017 in the year 1977...

Xi Jinping Pushes Chinas Rise Despite Friction and Fear by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

Until the AI takes over, the 21st century will likely be China's century just as the 19th century was Great Britain's and the 20th century was the USA's. We worry so much about what we are doing with our technology when in China they are doing the exact same thing with far better funding and far less regulatory restriction. And they have 3 times the population of the West. And they all want to be middle class and they have the wherewithal to do so.

This is Why Humans May Never Travel to Another Star by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
1 point 6 months ago 




Well, while I say never say ""never"", I would like to propose a thought experiment. Perhaps we shall visit and know our universe through ever more detailed simulations that would be experienced in what we think of today as VR. Would we one day develop technology to enable us to ""make"" a universe that is pretty close to how we think of our real life universe and then use our minds to travel at the ""speed of thought""? I just sometimes wonder if we may simply turn into a sentience that explores the concept of reality through simulation.

Oh, and also to play in them too. Play is super important to human minds. Perhaps vitally essential to existence. I know ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Second Life"" are pretty vital to my existence anyways.

That's a very interesting, but for me far too complicated hard science study. I would submit such a link to r/science. My intent in posting this article was to demonstrate the impact and profound implications of 1. The incredible rapid rise of China's technological prowess. And 2. The incredible rise of humanity's prowess in general in regard to our supercomputing capabilities.

What of course is unspoken is just what kind of impact and implications will the first successful logic-gate quantum computer hold for humanity? Will that simply transcend an exa-scale supercomputer. Or will exa-scale binary computing still be necessary for a while.

51 percent of tech experts say fake news can't be fixed by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
1 point 7 months ago 




As the AI, CGI and human scripting ever improves we are entering a truly dangerous era where a world leader can make a ""statement, resolution or pronouncement"", but that world leader never made such a statement. But the false statement can have grave impact and consequences.

Now I can only really speak for my experiences in the USA, but it seems as if almost all news of a cultural or political bent is regarded as fake news by all of one political faction or the other. I assume and rightly so that when news items appear on say, my Google News stream, that all of the stories and articles have gone through appropriate vetting. In other words I take what I read on Google News as truth and reality. And I should too. We have a fiat agreement with society that we shall be truthful about what actually happened and if it did not happen or has been distorted, then a rapid a correction is released as soon as possible.

What seems to be happening tragically, is that the powerful factions within the USA are probably distorting, through incredibly popular social media outlets, legitimate news releases. Perhaps they are have the number strength to simply discount something and send that idea out virally to all within it's reach of influence.

I wonder that we may not be seeing the embryo of what I believe to be the inevitable ""hive-mind"" of human thought beginning. As interfaces that enable human minds to acquire external electronic information arises over the next 10 years, I think a ""hive-mind"" is the logical consequence. Both for weal or woe, depending.

No, the idea was initially to treat Prader-Willi syndrome and/or some other specific pathologies. But it quickly became apparent that it could just as efficaciously treat general morbid obesity. And then not too much longer after that, just obesity in general. That's when casual couch potatoes such as myself saw the light at the end of the tunnel. But it was snuffed out.

Good luck with that...

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6x8tkt/robots_wont_steal_our_jobs_if_we_put_workers_at/dme1aik/

Also...

AI/robotics/automation will take enough jobs that unemployment will reach a critical economic tipping point that if the AI were to take any more occupations it would be a moot point. The problem is that the AI is being developed light years faster than what transpired in the industrial revolution. The acclimation of humans to the industrial revolution took nearly 150 years. Generationally easy to learn new skills and outlooks. And even then there was plenty of disruption and new accompanying ideas and philosophy (""Marxist communism""). People died like flies while the industrial revolution took place because of effects (American Civil War, WWI) of the industrial revolution. Once things more or less settled down (temporarily) by around 1918. It was a very different world from that of say, 1730.

We are not going to get that kind of ""grace period"" this time around. The changes that took 150 years before will take about 20 years tops this time. Not enough time for retraining. Not enough time for economic reform. Not enough time for humans to acclimate to a new reality as far removed from today as today is removed from the year 1730. And I stress, 20 years. So compact all them troubles of 150 years down to about 15 years or so. Plus all of the exponential advancements (scary changes) leading up to the world of 20 years from now. Better believe the US government is aware. And it's alarmed!

The ""block"" is going to become much smaller and much lighter. Not to mention the incredible leaps in resolution and FOV.

Well I hope this one can pan out. ""Beloranib"" showed such promise. And all the way until Phase 3 human trials too. Then I understand that two people who were severely morbidly obese died while on the candidate, but it was likely that they could have died as a result of medical issues intrinsic to their conditions rather than the drug, but the issue was muddy and the promising first ""blockbuster"" drug of the 21st century fell on the ash heap of history. It seriously really was extraordinarily effective. That's why there was so much hope and excitement.

Irrational me thinks the drug was pulled because humans probably think it is immoral to eat as much as you like and stay skinny as a rail, doing zero exercise. Literally losing weight as you sleep. Plus ""Beloranib"" didn't mess with your brain like pretty much all other purported weight loss drugs do. What a pity (for me). I'm not morbidly obese, I'm only a tiny bit fat--about 27 bmi. But I was so anticipating a chewable OTC (during all trials it was IV or injectable only) product. Because I was gonna have my cake and eat it too! Darn!

Hahaha pretty soon, less than 10 years there may no longer be a DMV. Remember, this is r/futurology. Mm-- as far as content that is irresistible is concerned, it would have to be different strokes for different folks using the same principle. To me a ""Google Earth VR"" with fully realized human scale resolution with a bit wider FOV and a more long term comfortable hmd would go a long ways towards me being immersed for vast periods of time. It would, in effect, be global tourism. That's just one example for me. Another is something like ""High Fidelity"" that allows the user to utilize easy to understand tools and building techniques like those of ""Second Life"" to construct compelling worlds that we can all inter-visit like SL. HF is being updated with new tools and aspects almost daily. I would love to see history (or science, or philosophy) lessons unfold in VR using the latest in ""Unreal Engine 4"" CGI to illustrate what actually happened. Bring the Louvre or the Imperial War Museum into my living room. These would be very compelling and irrestistable applications. Perhaps a sort of simulation of a real life career like jewel thief or superhero with powers, because why not, you can do as you please in VR, with RPG like aspects. That would addict me I bet.

Say. Have you experienced ""Sketchfab""? A sort of app where people, anybody, can scan an item into 3D and post it for others to admire. You can zoom way in for incredible detail and rotate it every which way. I have it on my IPhone 7+ and it is truly amazing even on a 2D screen. I can almost hold the bust of Nefertiti in my hand--or the Rosetta stone! In VR it is yet very limited. The tools to manipulate the images are just not there yet. Plus the lamentable resolution. :P But the potential for ""Sketchfab"" to be the killer app with modes like animation... Wow! OMG!

People will be absorbed to the point of immersion. Forgetting the ""real world"" exists.

I'm the OP for this post. I often post article titles to get people to think about a given subject. Now I'm not in the field but I am an early adopter of this technology. I have an Oculus Rift and the Alienware rig to run it optimally. I have experimented with games and some are quite good like ""Chronos"". But there are three applications that are to me, the ""killer apps"" and they are not games at all. ""Google Earth VR"" with ""human scale"" turned on. ""High Fidelity"" a sort of VR ""Second Life"" that is just now aborning. And finally the VR movie theater. A powerfully realistic sensation of sitting in real life movie theater. The illumination from the screen even plays on the empty seats all around you when you look around. 

I have gone in depth describing the effects and what I believe to be the future of these experiences, but to me there are two things that take away from my enjoyment. First and most importantly is resolution. Yes, I know I'm an early adopter, but the resolution, particularly in relation to real life imagery becomes very frustrating and dissatisfying after a while. CGI seems to fare better as far as resolution is concerned. The second thing that takes away from the experience is that thing on my face for more than one hour or so. At a certain point you want that thing off of your face for about 48 hours.

Wider FOV would be nice. Tetherless would be nice. But if they nail the resolution and the face/hmd ergonomics (like weight and sense of abrasion after prolonged use), there will exist a form of media and entertainment that humans will not want to leave. It may cause a whole different kind of problem. We shall read stories, true ones, about people starving or having a fatal heart attack from something that frightened them within VR. I can recall the first time I saw a ""demon"" in the sort of demo game called ""Dreadhalls"". It scared the absolute life out of me. It was a giant naked mole rat looking thing the size of a cow. I heard a strange sound and thought it was one of the cool ghosts and I came around the corner and suddenly encountered it. And in glorious, in your face 3D, up close and personal.

No once the resolution and comfort factor are tweaked, VR hmds will become a potential societal addiction problem. I also wrote a fairly long comment that is no longer accessible to me about how I believed that hmds were the sort of ""8 track"" of VR. Cool for a couple of years, but will be ultimately replaced by mobile phone technology doing all the VR/AR. Think about that for a minute. If you can use a mobile with some kind of readily available hmd that you put the mobile into (I have a ""Merge"" and a ""Homido"" I use with my IPhone 7+ to demonstrate in mobile fashion, but as of today that is not to be confused with tethered VR) but you see things in 8K or even ""light field"" with no stutter. What amazing technology we are working towards!

Here are some things I commented on earlier regarding VR/AR.

...require us to break our current understanding of physics in pretty substantial ways.
 
Interesting that statement, because in the year 1900 we had a very firm understanding of physics from Newton. But within the next 20 years two incredibly disruptive ways of understanding physics emerged. Relativity and quantum mechanics. These new insights enabled science that make our early 21st century technologies rock!

I'm not saying we shall uncover new insights and understandings about the way of physics, but it seems to me as a layman anyways that there is a force that exists at the level of nothingness and that it was this force that caused ""inflation"". The ""big bang"" that is. Further I do understand the physics behind the concept of ""hawking radiation"". Could we one day gainfully exploit the energy of ""virtual particles"" annihilating each other infinitely? The math is far beyond my understanding but I take it on faith, not religious, but empirical and self-correcting, that it is correct. The mathematicians usually describe such math as ""elegant"" and ""precise"".

I guess my point is that we shall uncover unbelievable new facts about the nature of reality (physics) in the next 20 years as well. Probably faster with these new fangled quantum computers.

I just have to say, whoa! wait a minute. Didn't I read that somewhere that a 50 qubit logic-gate quantum computer could achieve quantum supremacy over any classical binary computer on Earth and that 100 qubit quantum computer of the same type could solve a particular type of problem in a day or a second (I forget which, but pretty darn quick it said) that would take a binary computer longer than the age of the universe to solve?

Millions of qubits? Somebody smart tell me what we do with that, because I have a suspicion. I think we shall use them to make our own universes. I don't think 50 to 100 years from now is too liberal a guess either.

China by the way does not publicly discuss their work on the quantum computer, but the other day it was revealed that they were building a 10 billion dollar project to bring quantum computers and AI to useful fruition. So I would say there is some fire behind this smoke. But what will it mean for humanity? Could be genuine heaven, could be genuine hell. Worrisome. And unstoppable.

According to Schrodinger, there is a wave associated with any particle, called a wavefunction and spreads out into the whole universe. This wavefunction is stronger in one region, the region where the particle is, and gets weaker farther away from this region but still exists even far away from the position of the particle. And again, it spreads out into the whole universe.

In a simulation, made of graphics, everything would made of the same unit, right? Pixels. Imagine a white limbo on your computer screen, with a peacock in the middle. Everything you see is made of the same unit, but the area where the peacock is concentrated, forming what we refer to as matter, simply has a different density or combination of elements making it seem what it seems. ""The wave function is stronger in one region, which corresponds to the position of the particle and gets weaker and weaker farther away from this region but still exists even far away fro the position of the particle."" Wouldnt that go without saying if it were a simulation?

I'm neither a physicist nor am I into CGI, so this is the first point I'd appreciate expert feedback on. If it were a simulation, and since everything is made of the same exact thing (as preached by many religions), wouldn't matter naturally have a wave function, that wave being the function of everything in the universe, and that the particle is in itself a wave? Just like the double slit experiment may point at?

Which brings me to the second point. In virtual reality, there is real time rendering. You look left you'll the see the soldier with the gun. You don't, he's not there. It wouldn't make sense for it to be there, especially that it would be inefficient.

The double slit experiment asks, how can pieces of matter create an interference pattern like a wave? I think that if it were graphics, it would be the same exact thing, the wave a particle and the particle a wave, one is just being observed and therefore being rendered in real time. In the experiment, when the electron was observed, it remained an electron and did not turn into a wave, as expected from previous experimentation. When they looked, it was condensed to matter, to a graphically generated entity. The very act of measuring what slit it went through meant it only went for one. It decided to act differently, as though it was aware it was being watched. Could it be possible that this whole space is programmed to abide to certain levels of our understanding it and, therefore, contrary to what the experimenters thought, observing it simply aligned it with our natural mode of perception? Of course, whoever built this would do that. Theyd never want the characters to one day find out, would they? Ive researched a lot and I did not find texts that link such quantum weirdness to real time rendering in specific and it has always been something I wondered about.

Id appreciate feedback from anyone knowledgeable in either worlds.

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqUCX5rPQug)

It succeeded at least for me and I wanted to design the perfect and diseaseless society. Now it all starts with the collection of data, which in this case means everything.
When we get that data we could get the genetical contruction about a user and even some really complex patterns about diseases connected to it.
This would take a lot of time years, even generations, but big companies who have these kind of resources avaliable to them usually don't disappear in a couple of years.
When a company has all of this user data and also has the prosessing power and method to analyze and understand it, then they could modify and even decide about the future of the human society and even humans as a species.

With modern heathcare the traditional meaning of natural selection dissapeared. It is no longer true that the strongest gene and specimen in a enviromnet survives. All humans have the equal chance to reproduce and carry our genetics forward.
What if a big company who has been collecting every user data for decades deciedes to step in and recreate a modern version of the now not so natural selection.

They could do it in the future without any additional limitation added by the goverments. The most extreme case would be a reproductional limitation. Only people with the best genes could reproduce. And carry there genes forward.

First the system has to analyze and calculate the quality of our genes. From there it could offer us better relationships through dating apps, and increase our chance to reproduce and to find another human with the ""best"" genes. It could get us better paing jobs, and it could make the humans with the worst genes homeless so basically a really big disadvantage to reproduce and to carry in the ""bad"" genes. In an exetreme case it could create some sort of virtual quarantine, which invoves moving people out of their homes in a subtle way and sorting them in different areas, with the same quality of genes.

It could also affect our behaviour, it could inrease the deppresion, some cases it could make people commit suicide.

You might call this impossible, but if they want to do it and if they to it a sneaky manner them they could achieve it to some or even full extent.",2,1

To me, it's [the holy grail](https://fromthemachine.org/CLEARYBLVD.html), what do you think?

&gt;[Superman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Damonthesis) returns from [Cybertron](http://heart.lamc.la/) to mentally [link Minority Report with the Wachowski's Matrix series an](http://cl.s.lamc.la/)d suggest the thought\-in\-and\-of\-itself will end school shootings [ifi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) appearing on the front page of the New York Times. Kal\-El claims th[at dozens\-of\-thousands of very intelligent reader](http://arrr.s.lamc.la/)s \(and bystanders and onlookers\) are leaning towards agreeing with him at this very moment in time.

Not even kidding, the idea that Superman's power comes from the fact that our sun is virtual connects [the word ""fusion"" and ""physi](https://mylife.s.lamc.la/)cs"" together hopefully [adding some light](https://o.s.lamc.la/) connecting Silicon to these ideas.  Computer science shows up there at the ""end of physics"" but really it's just the beginning of understanding the key to a hidden history being revealed and to a bright future.The first link here really is my best description of what this message is today, it's written in chalk, even though it's every word and quite a bit of modern music and art, and for sure\-\-for sure it's lots and lots of mythology and religion.  That links starts off hopefully bringing some light to the idea that Minority Report and A Scanner Darkly and Phillip K. Dick in general... link to the Matrix as part of this woven message that connects names and ideas to a map to building Heaven\-\-beginning with ending the ""Plague of Killing the Firstborn Children"" .... and do see, that's ""school shootings.""

&gt;The ""**gist**"" of the message is[**verifiable**](http://fromthemachine.org/2017-06-09-verily-i-say-unto-you-ver-means-to-see.html) **proof**that we are[living in a computer](https://www.prlog.org/12642309-great-sign-appeared-in-revelation-121-the-sign-of-sagittarius-in-the-word-christ-and-on-taylor.html)in*simulated reality*...*just like the Matrix.* The answer to that question, what does that mean\-\-is that God has woven a ""hidden"" message into our everything\-\-beginning with each name and**every word**\-\-and in this hidden Adamic language, he provides us with guidance, wisdom, and suggestions on how to proceed on this path from ""raelity"" to Heaven. I've personally spent quite a bit of time decoding the message and have tried to deli**ver an interesting and ""fun"" narrative of the ideas I see. Specifically the story of Exodus, which is called ""Names"" in Hebrew discusses a time shi**fted narrative of our ""now"" delivering our society from a hidden slavery \(re\*ad asignorance of advanced technologies already \*in use\) that is described as[the ""darkness"" of Exodus](http://fromthemachine.org/2017-06-14-enders-game-prometheus-locke-and.html). If you have **any questions**, ideas to contribute or concerns... I'd [love to hear from you](https://eyerc.slack.com/join/shared_invite/MjM2NDM2Mjc3Nzk4LTE1MDQ0MDE3NzQtMmU5NjI1N2VmOQ)this whole [thing really is](http://fromthemachine.org/GATE.html) about working together\-\-[Heaven](http://fromthemachine.org/ADAMSROD.html), I mean.

# [Whshould we ""do?""](http://fromthemachine.org/WHO.html)

&gt;My weekly email talked a little bit this week about the ""Revelation process"" and specifically about how this message and it's interesting mode of dissemination connect to what I see and hope will be a rekindling of love for free speech and free communication\-\-and the beginning of the first true democracy.

&gt;Date: Wed, May 16, 2018 at 6:01 PM  
&gt;  
&gt;Subject: Fwd: N IT E, SH IT E and the Nosh.  
&gt;  
&gt;To: R U Y MONEY \&lt;YMENE\&gt;, Salud as is ter Y \&lt;SALUDAS\&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Briefly Inamed my ""free press group"" YMENE long before I had ever heard of this Greek God, connecting it to the movie Almost Famous \(and [one of the better videos I mad](http://almost.lamc.la/)e trying to ""[explain](http://fromthemachine.org/RATOXIT.html) the Matrix""\) as it's characterization of the young music critic as ""The Enemy"" ..... Clymene, c the light, ymene is ""why many"" in the singular instance where we actually see unbiased and intellectual coverage of this message and this story in the press\-\-what we are looking at today is ... *heinous*.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's a good example of how living through the Revelatory process and understanding the story behind it adds a level of ""zen"" to the message\-\-one which is very much an intelligible and reproducable code that surrounds everything we look at. Experiencing it in this way helps to really see how it works and connects art from modern movies to ancient myth.  
&gt;  
&gt;Clymene, an[Oceanid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanid),[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clymene_(mythology)#cite_note-3)wife of the Titan[Iapetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_(mythology)), and mother of[Atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)),[Epimetheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus_(mythology)),[Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus), and[Menoetius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menoetius_(mythology));[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clymene_(mythology)#cite_note-4)other authors relate the same of her sister[Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_(mythology)).[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clymene_(mythology)#cite_note-5)A less common genealogy makes Clymene the mother of[Deucalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deucalion)by Prometheus.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clymene_(mythology)#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clymene_(mythology)#cite_note-7)The Oceanid Clymene is also given as the wife to King[Merops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merops_(mythology))of[Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia)and, by[Helios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios), mother of[Phaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaethon)and the[Heliades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliades).[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clymene_(mythology)#cite_note-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clymene_(mythology)#cite_note-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clymene_(mythology)#cite_note-10)  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm working on a theory that revolves around the idea that nobody cares what ""it"" is. I'm not sure if I talked about this in [the last message](https://fromthemachine.org/CLEARYBLVD.html), or even if I sent that to you\-\-but it's pretty clear from what I'm looking at that ""IT"" is often answered by the word that contains it. So for instance, ""eternity"" might suggest that Y comes after ""eternity"" and ""shit"" might suggest that anything that comes after ""sh"" with no ""the Nosh"" \(which is a deli here in Los Angeles\) is .. *shit.* There are better, more interesting and enlightening examples, but I can't think of any of them right now. Dynamite. Repetition, obviously ""it"" is also referring to me sometimes\-\-now I remember\-\-""Capitan"" and ""insanity."" Looking back over [the message before the last message](https://con.ve.lamc.la)\(that mentions El Capitan and relates it to Thanatos and Thanos, who just appeared in a movie. Initializing something beneficial out of this, I think the implication from the ""AT"" missing in the link between ""San"" which means saint in Spanish and Satan as well as Thanos and Thanatos is that ""IT"" is ""AT"" and here I think while this message might look like 'IT"" it is really the thing that enabled the message to be written in secret and remain unseen, my IT will always be mind control\), in ""Leviticus"" you might see IT as Leviticus \(or frankly mabye the NT which appears similarly positioned as the ""heart of the timeline"" in a place where you might see the Torah as a microcosmic map to the same timeline, which might be a map to something bigger\), or the instantiation of a ""seemingly victorious"" monotheistic religion. For those of you that don't study everything I say as if it was the word of God, ""LEV"" means the weak victory, and that's what I see in the heart of all of these messages.  
&gt;  
&gt;here, ""it"" is clearly the hiding or deletion of ""shit"" that came after ""shit"" because of ""e"" ... I mean because of ""sh""

The rest of [that message is here, semi\-unpublished](http://hadragonbreath.blogspot.com/2018/05/re-n-it-e-sh-it-e-and-nosh.html).  I mention reddit quite a few times, and briefly discuss the disparity between the response here and the statistics I provide at that link showing extreme interest from institutions like CMU, Cornell, Harvard, and MIT.

https://i.redd.it/dcxnj6eyhqy01.png

I know the violence can be stopped, and I know in my heart that not moving forward with this disclosure is the heart of why it's happening. It's very difficult to stand idly by and watch as we mourn, as we continue to persist in allowing these atrocities to continue; with no rhyme or reason. I've implied in the past that it appears to me to be intended to move the world to quickly see the benefit of the truth, but it's really not at all what I think. It seems very clear to me that far too many are content with living in this lie, because it's ""the way things have always been"" and I just can't stand to see what I know will really solve this problem being delayed.

It won't fix this overnight, but it will stop this violence, and much more; not just murders but insanity\-\-things that are really clearly within reach, within ability, and the focus of this message. It's understanding the change in circumstances, and understanding that nobody would wait if they were sure... it's understanding that beginning to talk about this proof is what makes it that, proof\-\-it's what causes the papers or the analysis, and it's the discussion\-\-it's our hearts that change the world and build Heaven.

1994,2018-5-20,2018,5,20,2,8kmr4q,"In order to avoid the VR escapism trap, we must love the real world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/8kmr4q/in_order_to_avoid_the_vr_escapism_trap_we_must/,MeleeMeistro,1526751344,"It is very possible that within the next hundred years, humanity could become so immersed in virtual experiences that we eventually live out our lives within VR indefinitely.

Now don't get me wrong, I am very interested in the advancement of these technologies, but I also recognise where it can lead us if we are not careful, what I am talking about here is escapism.

Escapism exists ubiquitously today in the form of video games, drugs, alcohol, and so on. Virtual reality, I feel, would surpass these means to a whole other level. 

Why today do people seek escapism?

Today, the world faces a plethora of problems such as piles of individual and household debt, global warming and mass extinctions, stress from life and employment situations etc.

Now it may be tempting to look at people who have their own problems and think that those problems have mostly brought them upon themselves and have mostly individual responsibility for those problems.

But I'm going to present another way of thinking, known as **structuralism**.

A structuralist mindset looks at the root cause of a particular problem, or a system/structure that predicates the conditions for that problem to arise. A faulty beam can't cause a skyscraper to collapse, but a badly thought out foundation can make for a tragic disaster.

This structural mindset is the foundation of the philosophy of environmental behaviourism, which is in essence the notion that our wellbeing and our behaviour is heavily influenced by our environment. I use the term environment in the context of social, cultural, and economic conditions as well as physical surroundings, I'm using a more holistic definition than what would be used traditionally.

So if the conditions of our environment are endemic to the state of humanity and the world as a whole, and individuals are not solely responsible for their problems, then it is only logical that in order to improve the real world we must change our environment. 

How can we do this?

As an immediate step, a UBI sounds quite promising in terms of the problems that it would solve. People would no longer be under so much econonic stress and turmoil, as a result there will be less broken homes due to the decrease in breakups as a result of econonic hardship.  This would result in less people having shaky or troubled childhoods meaning people will have less trouble later on in life. 

This is just one example to fit the case for a UBI. But personally I would go even further.

If our current socioeconomic system predetermines that people will have bills to pay and will need to work wage labour in order to have our needs met, then it is logical to my mind that the system itself is the problem.

We have the resources and the technology today to sustainably provide for everyone's needs. We can automate most work, and the rest is bureaucratic paper shuffling that wastes time and energy - in a world without money there is no need for all the job bloat of accountants, bankers, insurance brokers, business advisors, consultants, most lawyers etc. 

We have the technology to capture CO2 from the atmosphere, and return our land and oceans to their natural state, excavating old resources to be used continuously. Humanity has done a great deal of destruction to this planet, but don't let misanthropy fool you into thinking we are the problem, we can also be the world's saviours.

We can create an abundance of food, water, industrial materials etc through a variety of methods, such as hydroponic vertical farming and in vitro produce, mass desalination, molecular sorting and 3d printing, among many other things. 

[And let's not forget that geothermal is a bountiful energy source on its own, let alone as part of a renewable mix.](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2010/09/geothermal-energy-is-the-solution-for-the-future.html)

What thr heck does all of this have to do with VR escapism?

It's simple. If we make the world a better place to live, less people will want to ""leave"" it. Sure, you'll have people who spend an extended amount of time in VR living out their wildest fantasies, but they'd eventually want to come back to reality. You know what? I'd even say that if the human experience improved significantly, people would have hopes of using VR to better or enhance our own world even.

Today people aren't addicted to alcohol or drugs, they're addicted to the experience those things give them *relative to reality*.  

In regards to the ethics of the topic, I'd say that reality is something to be valued and preserved. Virtual experiences should be an extension of our reality, not a replacement for it.

There's a lot of questions about AI and what could happen if we achieve it, if we can do it at a human level or not, what computer paradigms are best suited for etc. Considering [Kurzweil's Law] (http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MooresLaw2.png), some inspiration from the same man and just a little bit of my intuition; I'll try to make a time line about what is more likely to happen. If you think I'm mistaken and there must be corrections, tell me :)

*******

2020s

Deep Learning and other machine learning algorithms are actually quite simple. It's not hard to write them down into bizarre math but this simplicity negatively correlates with the ability of a human mind to understand what happens as a whole inside this kind of software. In the same way, we can't enumerate all the reasons why we love so much this guy/girl or why we like to play guitar solos. I mean, we can guess some reasons but the overall cognitive process remains a mystery for our ""limited Consciousness"". I guess there's a point there, maybe only the tip of the iceberg must be visible in order to be able to use such monstrous computer power representing our Subconscious. 

Today, science says that the cortex is composed of separated and statict modules made of hierarchized layers of neurons so connections can change between these modules (neuroplasticity). Sounds like sociology don't you think? The fact is that our unified experience is a sum of unchanging and very similar units interacting in a dynamic and adaptable way, but for sure more shit is happening there... 

This modules then form specialized regions able to do things like riding a bike or be an expert on something. What's the problem with this? Maybe it's not very obvious but, what if we can have the best possible specialized region able to everybody instead of having to rely on others brain regions (let me explain)? Today there are AI apps able to do in seconds what a human takes decades of work and some luck to be the best. Im talking about apps that can detect skin diseases or tumors in X-rays better than the best doctors in the world combined or to drive with 0 mistakes in a F1 race. What Im saying is, why should I rely on a single person instead of accessing the best one with less limitations? This is the true revolution: now theres no need for armies of humans trying to be available and good, with one single app we can do it the best way and make it ubicous. We are unifying expertise and learning in a few single entities.

But, why arent these apps available now? I like to think that with integrated circuits we achieved to mimic those brain modules but we were unable to link them in a dynamic and organic way. Now we have this three things: powerful AI GPUs, the Internet and Neural Algorithms. Sounds like the best context. Theres only one limitation: this [one](http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MooresLaw2.png). We need more Titan V chips, more silicon into the equation and, of course it must be a lot more cheap. Im not sure when, because I dont know how to do the maths (ask Nvidia, Intel, AMD) but Ill bet that by the end of the next decade, we will have a lot of this weak AI apps as services, products etc. A legal problem? Lets look for a good app Oh yeah, this one uses AI Is this contract legally valid?; A cop is saying me that I cant use my camera; My boss said me that. Answer:  Ok, Will, (I have used a giant AI server to read billions of cases, documents etc, Ive even read the full paper youre talking about, Ive compared it to others users cases and documents maintaining legal secret, Ive done all the stuff that requires 1 billion years to do by 1 billion best lawyers in just 6 seconds) This clause is invalid so you can cancell your relations with this agent. Best approach considering my database is to. I mean you get what I mean. OMG Im wrinting too much

So, by 2029 we will live in a world were specialized intelligence is the best possible, ubicous, cheap and fast as light (with AR glasses fuck yeah!). BUT, the sum of all these weak AI No! We cant link them in order to make a human mind! Or can we?

*****

2030s

Now, after all the shit youve read (sorry for that), Ill make my main point: we will achieve Super AI (ASI)/ god like AI before or at the same time we reach AGI (human level AI / General) and this is gonna happen in the 30s if, and only if, the same step of making posible dynamic communication between modules in order to create  expertise regions is made at a region level. How can we do this? I dont know but as I said in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7b1quc/the_10_years_cycle/), its very likely to neural links to be a thing. So, imagine a world where we have the best specific intelligent apps possible in the cloud and we can connect our mammal brains to them via brain wifi. Its very hard to imagine, I know, but Ill make a bet again.

I want to think that progress is congruent: things happen if the context allows it. So, I think ASI will be a thing at the same time we connect our brains to it. We will build this new God as a part of us, not a separated one, we will be this God and I cant wait for feeling that orgasm.

How AI Is Like Electricityand Why That Matters by dwaxe in r/Futurology





[]izumi3682 1 point 7 months ago 

Aside: No, AI is electricity. Unlike biology, electricity sustainability is not particularly assured. If something happens to the electric, it is goodbye everything not just AI. I'm not so confident about our battery sustainability either. I have often thought that we are moving further and further onto a very delicate tightrope. How ready are we to operate using 19th century technology and knowledge? The very thing needed to ensure development of AI is confident sustained energy, like fusion or solar.

The issue addressed in the article: The industrial revolution replaced human labor and muscle. The AI revolution replaces the human mind and that's coming just as sure as Christmas too...


Artificial Intelligence Is Already a Better Artist Than You Are by [deleted] in r/Futurology





[]izumi3682 1 point 7 months ago 

It is art. Not only that, it is an extraordinary new form that is just as precedent setting as anything from the 19th century such as cubism or impressionism. To me as an observer of art, as a rule I don't know what the motivations of the artist are. And I bet that most people don't. What I do see as an observer, is a difficult to describe resonance within my person when I contemplate an artwork, be it painting, music, media or what have you. I have long maintained that once the AI has enough examples of what humans do when they make ""art"", that it will be able to very precisely mimic that using predictive analysis and that those resulting ""artistic"" outputs will hit the emotional buttons in humans that make us believe we are in the presence of a magnificent artist. I have no doubt that eventually humans will prefer the AI developed art over that of human developed art.


Brexit Britain Could Replace Migrants With Robots by izumi3682 in r/Futurology





[]izumi3682[S] 6 points 7 months ago 

The reasons for why we robot are manifold. But the bottom line is this--once we robot, we don't go back to humans in that arena. 

Superpowers Are Coming to the Digital World by izumi3682 in r/Futurology





[]izumi3682[S] 2 points 7 months ago 

This is the part I really liked!

The coming of VR movies is just one of the ways this technology is transforming how we see the world and how we tell stories  a film created for VR even got an Oscar nomination this year. Clearly, VR has moved beyond just video games to now change how we all, gamers and non-gamers alike, can experience reality.

Robotics revolution: To really help American workers, we should invest in robots by izumi3682 in r/Futurology





[]izumi3682[S] 2 points 7 months ago 

You are missing my point. Ok so it takes another 5 years for ""level 5"" autonomous vehicles to be safe and effective and deployed to the consumer. Consider what makes that self-driving car safe and effective. The AI. When the AI is at that point with self driving cars, at what point will the AI (or robotics or automation or whatnot) be in all other fields like medicine or R&amp;D?

Level 5 autonomous vehicles are merely one facet of the potential of AI. They constitute a sign of much larger things to come. And at some point in not far future, I would bet that the larger thing to come, may not be comprehensible to humans. And therein lies the problem.

Artificial Intelligence Is Already a Better Artist Than You Are by [deleted] in r/Futurology





[]izumi3682 1 point 7 months ago 

People said the same of impressionism and cubism too... At first.

(In fact the word ""Impressionism"" is from an original derogatory term from an art critic who stated that the artist's work resembled his (the artist's) ""impression"" of what was supposed to be realistic depiction. Naturalism and Romanticism ruled the day at that time.)

How upgrading humans will become the next billion-dollar industry by izumi3682 in r/Futurology





[]izumi3682[S] 7 points 7 months ago 

I bet this sort of thing would cost a lot of money, thereby cutting out the average consumer. I hope there is a way to democratize such technology.

Harari said. For the first time in history it will be possible to translate economic inequality into biological inequality.

Spray-on memory could enable bendable digital storage by izumi3682 in r/Futurology





[]izumi3682[S] 2 points 7 months ago 

Michio Kaku said an interesting thing several years back. Essentially a piece of paper would become a functional computer and yet you could throw it away as if it were nothing but a piece of paper. The reason being that the paper would be coated with a form of nanotechnology that would simply be a part of the paper's mass production. Now he described this everyday tech for around 2030, but this article today is very interesting in context.

I don't have a clue how we would interact with such a piece of paper or how the technology would work. Or if we will even need paper in the future. (Probably, I bet.) But I continuously remind myself what Arthur C. Clarke said.

""Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magick.""

Regeneration of Torn Rotator Cuffs by izumi3682 in r/Futurology





[]izumi3682[S] 1 point 7 months ago 

I had R rotator cuff surgery in 2011. Because of the complexity of the injury (stupid intrinsic genetics!), while the surgery restored nearly full range of motion, there are clearly defined ""surgical deficits"". And in about another 8 years I suppose I face the inevitable reverse shoulder replacement that is so common with long term rotator cuff issues. That's how things are today in 2017.

Any kind of article that describes improvement or hope for my type of injury/repair is going to catch my eye.


Cyborgs at work: employees getting implanted with microchips by run_dog_run in r/Futurology





[]izumi3682 1 point 6 months ago 

At first it was just a couple of people that actually made the news. They were somewhat regarded as well... ""crazy to do that"". But I said, no they are actually pioneers. Now this story says that 150 people at one location have all had chips implanted in their hands. This will spread. In fact I would be almost positive that this will be the way we do internet or computer access in the near future. Cuz passwords are for the birds! (Or be the ""Mark of the Beast"". Although supposedly you can't get tricked into the ""Mark of the Beast"". You have to choose it knowing full well that you are choosing Satan, but that's a discussion for another day...)

Anyways if it's not the ""Mark of the Beast"", it seems a pretty good way to get access to stuff. I'm sure the tech will continue to improve and the chips get smaller and more comprehensive. For better or worse for society.

(Wait, isn't the ""Mark of the Beast"" supposed to be after the ""Rapture""? I think we are ok this time, but I'll be keeping a weather eye out... ;)


Acceleration in projected growth of global robotics industry by izumi3682 in r/Futurology





[]izumi3682[S] 2 points 6 months ago 

Ok so about 6 months ago I think it was, the CEO of McDonalds, when told that he must increase his minimum wage if it is increased lawfully to 15 dollars an hour, stated that he would automate all of his stores first. 

Two questions here. Did the minimum wage increase to 15 dollars an hour anywhere? And if so, how long will it take for McDonalds to automate all of its stores?

I am VASTLY unqualified to make any sort of assertion on this topic as my knowledge of it only spans A-level Physics level understanding of quantum mechanics and A-level Computer Science level understanding of machine learning and algorithmic structure. If I miss anything major please be civil about it and explain!

Self learning algorithms literally evolve by generating initially random algorithms. Those that come closest to completing the intended task as efficiently and effectively as possible are more likely to be tried again than those that dont. When retried, the algorithms are mutated slightly, similar to mutations of the genetic make up of an organisms which allows evolution. This process is repeated millions of times a second until the algorithms are effective and efficient enough to be of use.

These algorithms that are passed on are physically just a series of 1s and 0s stored in bits in memory space. Different combinations of these 1s and 0s define different programs so when you are passing on and mutating these programs you are just running different seriess of 1s and 0s until you find and series of 1s and 0s that represents a program that efficiently and effectively completes a task.

Quantum computers work by taking a set of qbits which are essentially like bits but rather than having a state of 1 or 0 they exist in a quantum state of being both, running an algorithm on them and arriving at every possible output. One can then check specific outputs and see the paths taken to arrive at them and thus the values that a set of bits of the same size would have to have to arrive at that output if the same algorithm was run on them. Effectively checking every single potential input one could run through an algorithm simultaneously.

Currently quantum computers are tiny in qbit count and only work for a couple of hours at most but what if you had enough qbits to represent and entire modern algorithm? In the future with sizeable qbit memory space would it be possible to run every single possible algorithm simultaneously of a certain memory size and check the paths taken to arrive at the highest possible efficiency and effectiveness at completing a task? Algorithms would no longer be self learning but omniscient! (In a sense of instantly knowing the most efficient and effective algorithm to complete a task)

With even a single high capacity quantum computer could ultra efficient and effective algorithms be instantly generated on mass for use by normal conventional computers?",6,8

Our world is out of the ordinary. Our globe is our everything, yet to the universe, we are almost nothing. Most of us live our lives full of value and worth without much thought into the reality of just how insignificant we are. We are a species on a speck of a planet out of trillions. The universe has existed for billions of years and humans have existed for thousands. Our insignificance is overwhelming, however, we have the potential to be so much more. We have our collective perspective, one we view as ""normal"", and the universe has its own.

It may happen in our generation or hundreds of generations from now. It is inevitable.

We live in a world defined by boundaries; where race, religion, territories, resources, etc. are causes of conflicts that only further divide us. None of this is new. We live in a ""normal"" world. Whether you are a Muslim, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, or believe in some other higher power. Whether you are an atheist, a Pastafarian, or agnostic. Whether you choose to believe in extraterrestrials or not. There is no denying that any greater being/s would be ashamed of what they see here on Earth.

We are successful at pointing out the problems that plague our world and neglect to take action. We build walls and fail to help our own kind. While entire regions of the world starve, others have more food than they know what to do with.

The way our world runs will be detrimental to our existence. We continue to live our normal lives at our future's expense. The world needs to change.

Globalization has been a key contributor to our advancements and progress towards a more productive world. Slowly but surely we are moving towards one inevitable outcome. We imagine other advanced civilizations in our films and literature as having one common government, one common goal set, and one common cause. Within our human ideologies, we are already aware of what it takes to progress and overcome the problems that plague our planet. Globalization will ultimately lead to a global government, and a world free of limitations.

We will have a world without war and violence, a world without famine or disease, a world where a third world country is unheard of. The possible benefits are endless.

A global government could allocate resources, could ensure that every human being has the tools to contribute something world changing to society, etc. Human civilization would progress at an unprecedented rate. Currently, half the world is unable to contribute to that progression through financial boundaries. Proper education is unheard of in regions across the globe. We've all heard at some point in our lives that the cure for cancer could be in the head of a starving child in Africa, but what if that child had the chance to use his mind for all of humanity?

A united world would only push us further into the future and the possibilities are endless. We can continue to live our normal lives or we can push for something greater. The notion that we should build a better world for our children is humanity as we like to view it, but in reality, we should be pushing for a better tomorrow for the people here today. Every great advancement must happen in someone's today, why not make it ours?

It could happen in our generation, or it could happen hundreds of generations from now. It is inevitable. Unite the world.",15,1

While in graduate school, she created and instructed at Clones to Crystals, an 8\-week undergraduate laboratory course covering the basics of cloning, protein purification, and crystallization trials. She also co\-founded and ran Learn to Code, a data science bootcamp for women, teaching 50\+ students the basics of data science and software development in Python. Her research focused on how insects use their immune systems to fight disease, particularly the biochemistry of thioester containing proteins \(TEPs\), a family of insect immune proteins. She has extensive research experience in biochemistry, structural biology, and cell biology.

She holds a PhD in Cell Biology from Yale University and an AB in Biochemistry from Mount Holyoke College, and is a proud native of Federal Way, Washington. She is can often be found hiking or brewing hard cider.[ Source](https://www.new-harvest.org/people)

**About New Harvest**

By applying advances in tissue engineering and synthetic biology to growing food, we can revolutionize the supply chain of animal products to continue to provide affordable and sustainable food to a growing population. We call this cellular agriculture. Thanks to cellular agriculture, we can produce[eggs](https://newharvest.nationbuilder.com/clara_foods),[milk](https://newharvest.nationbuilder.com/muufri_milk),[meat](https://newharvest.nationbuilder.com/mark_post_cultured_beef),[and more](https://newharvest.nationbuilder.com/portfolio)without intensive crop and animal farming. Unfortunately, this nascent field is not well supported by existing research funding mechanisms.This is where New Harvest comes in. [Source](https://www.new-harvest.org/about#mission_vision)

********

2010s: 

-Effects of great recession: labor share of GDP reduced to 41% and inequality is at the same level as WWI-WWII period.

-Debt increases like hell, specially among students.

*****

2020s: 

-Neural Networks have proven its ability to mimic cognitive functions till the point of automating tasks at a massive level. Google Duplex is nothing compared with what Narrowed AI can do now: drive cars and trucks, solve legal problems, sell products without human intervention, manage transportation of these products, motor control of humanoid robotics, middle management, personalized education, medical diagnosis...

-Added to this AIs, blockchained economies will emerge to the lack of social and financial mobility created by central banks QE. New ""unowned companies"" will rise, with its fixed capital undistinguisible from it's cash flow. Millenials will migrate to this new free markets as the dollar and old currencies are now like chains to them instead of an opportunity to prosper and grow (impossible debt, money is delinked from value since labor is disrupted).

-Govs will no longer be able to pay for retirement pensions. Old people will get very angry and upseted about this till the point of migrating to this new blockchained economies. 

******

2030s:

-Countries start to make no sense and, thanks to neuralinks, humans start to merge their minds with an emerging Super AI we could call ""Smart Internet"". As the physical world starts to make no sense since we can be more productive than what Capitalism can handle (scarcity is the main drive), value migrates to VR. New virtual markets arise the same way WOW players value their items or their missions and the social value within. This will allow a new renaissance of Art, Science, Philosophy and Meaning.

-Nanotechnology allows us to live on Mars, create computers the size of planets and reproduce in new ways. Humans are now an interconnected hive of intelligence with new crazy abilities.

FUCK THIS SYSTEM, TRUST THEM NO MORE, EDUCATION IS RIGGED, DOLLAR IS ONLY FOR THE ONES CREATING IT, JOBS ARE STUPID, DEBT IS STUPID, VALUE IS FAKE! FUCK THEM ALL!

1 It's unowned: its capital is undistinguisable from its cash flow so its profit is exlusively dedicated to improve and expand the service/product instead of being at the service of greed shareholders and stupid CEOs.

2 Decentralized and Blockchained: at first it will need services and products from centralized/owned/old companies and individuals but it will reach a point where its capital will be able to absorb all of them thanks to its expansion and cash flow (like unicorns). The code is the only thing that will matter.

3 AI Driven: Giving the primary goal with the code, neural networks will be a part of it. This set of narrowed AI will evolve and compete to grow like today's companies do, even with other similar ones. AIs driven comapnies competing and fighting for the best approach. 

4 Democratic: if the company becomes evil or unable to provide good services and/or products, maybe because the initial code is bad or the context changes, then consumers will stop buying the stuff, cash flow will disapear, capital too and it will end up being a funny meme webpage.

Heres why: computer technology will evolve to the point where it will become prescient, self actualized, within 10-25 years. Or less. 

When that happens the evolution of becoming smarter will exponentially evolve to the point where what would have taken humans 10,000 years to evolve, will happen in 2, thats two years. 

So what does that mean for you? Illnesses cured. LIFE EXPECTANCY extended 5-6 fold.

* Automation will continue to happen in the economy at an increasing rate because of A.I. and economic feedback loops putting people into more technical jobs thus increasing the rate of technological progress and automation even more.


* Automation doesn't need to replace all jobs to create societal problems. In fact it doesn't even need to destroy jobs faster than they're created. It could be causing a net increase in potential careers. It only needs to replace jobs at a faster rate than average(or even below average) people can retrain and/or save enough money to retrain for a new career. As there will be a lot of problems if even 50% of the population is perpetually unemployed.


* Future companies will be extremely profitable in an automation runaway event and the gap between rich and poor will increase accordingly. 


# So what is this solution? UBI is obviously one, but I think there is another that is blockchain securities.


For those who don't know, although a token is necessary for a blockchain to work, it doesn't have to be strictly a currency or ""cryptocurrency"". In fact I'd say cryptocurrency is not the killer app for blockchain technology. There will definitely be a few cryptocurrencies that dominate and are necessary for the infrastructure of this new economy to work, but it's like how no one uses google because they like visiting the google.com per se, they use google because they like visiting other sites and google happens to be the best way to get from A to B.


Again this isn't common knowledge but there is something new to the industry called ""security tokens"" on blockchains, functionally you can use them in the same way you'd use bitcoin. You can divide them up to several decimal places and send fractions of a penny to anyone anywhere in the world for almost no cost (compared to traditional means). However, they have the added function that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin don't have, and that's being a security. One example is ""crypto-stocks"", as a financial instrument these are basically identical to traditional stocks as they actually pay you dividends and give you some small portion of ownership in a company. By my count there is at least a few dozen of these already on the market. A notable example is r/nexo which just a few days ago was officially marked as compliant by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a security. It a real stock that not only pays dividends but they do it monthly and are considering doing it weekly, as opposed to traditional stocks that pay out quarterly or annually. They can do that because blockchains make it much more logistically possible.


The advantages of crypto-stocks over traditional stocks are substantial. One advantage is you can purchase them (in principle) in any amount, in minutes. Traditional stock investing has absurdly high fees if you go through a firm or advisor. And not only that, you also have to have several thousand dollars in cash just to open an account in a lot of places. In order to be an ""accredited"" investor in America you essentially have to be a millionaire. This makes it very difficult for even middle class people to invest.


What's particularly interesting about crypto-stocks that wasn't really practical before blockchain, is that they would be just as fungible and divisible as currency. Imagine walking into a coffee shop and instead of paying with USD $$$ you pay with some composite of your portfolio. You buy a coffee and pay with $1.0 of Tesla stocks and $0.5 of Amazon stocks and maybe $0.5 of an asset backed security like gold, or any arbitrary combination of your choice that you set up in your personal settings of your payment app. And of course the coffee shop could receive fiat or cryptocurrency regardless of what you used to pay as the conversion is done instantly on the back end. And it's all done cheaper than a traditional credit card transaction. The major advantage of having stocks in your account as opposed to a national currency, is not only will you not lose money because of inflation, you will gain money because of the dividends just for sitting in your account. Also there is a lot of existential risk to your currency if you don't of the privilege of living in a first world country.


So now lets imagine massive unemployment because of automation. Companies are making insane profits. If you can manage to buy some of these crypto-stocks, which should be possible since you can buy them in tiny amounts. Then you can receive passive income and you have a small piece of ownership in a company. Since (crypto)stock yields will be extreme in this scenario where companies are extremely profitable, you might be able to get enough to sustain your existence or even profit! If you think about it, it's almost the same as UBI in a way since with UBI the government just takes taxes from the companies, rather than profit directly, and then redistributes the wealth accordingly. However, the crypto-stock model removes the need for the government as the middleman and would arguably be much more efficient since funds can be distributed to everyone within minutes at high frequencies rather than having to go through an entire costly and slow tax system. 


There are even more advantages to this system like removing tax burden of UBI on smaller companies which helps with innovation, since they are only paying if they make some profit. It also keeps competition between companies high which keeps them running efficiently. This system gives us all the benefits of wealth redistribution but the practicality and efficiency of a freemarket. And it encourages people to save since the more they save the more profit they can make in the long term. Of course there will still be a gap between rich and poor but there would still be with a UBI model.


Everyone could decide which companies they want to invest in, which means people are more directly participating in the global economy, making it more efficient. Of course not everyone has the time or ability to be a stock analyst but that problem is easily solved by index funds, which would also be a crypto-stock.


**TL:DR:** Blockchain + insanely profitable companies due to AI and automation would allow for a free market alternative to UBI.

Disclaimer:  It will be all about technology \- as well as society. Many ideas are  from other people, like american thinkers, german neo\-philosophers,  chinese distribution businesses, and nearly any country of the world  taking part with scientists, clever individuals and research. I just  tied some strings together here.

Speaking  of the new something, at least one thing is fore sure: It will not be  a something that we already had somewhere in the last 500 years. Just  because stepping back never happened in human history and the reason  for that is the automatism that drives conclusions forward, not  backwards. This includes mistakes that has been made as well as new  technologies that asks the people to adapt and therefore transforms our  societies. Todays maxima and minima aka. left\-wing and right\-wing people  both crave to get back their good ol' times. It's an understandable  craving, I think we all know the bias towards romantic views of our  yesterdays as well as we all may have our little anxieties about the  future. But stepping back ain't gonna happen, like it's safe to say that  we don't have to expect a new pharao anytime soon.

The  more interesting and particularly tougher question to answer is about  the prediction or idea for a replacement of the current system or status  quo. To deliver a little bit I'd say that redistribution of money  already got more liquid and social while at the same time more  competition arises.

\- By liquid I mean non\-static, like it used to be in the sense of establishment.

\-  By social I'd suggest things like crowdfunding, micro\-entrepreneurship,  patreons, crypto funding and everything the web has to offer.

\- finally by competition I don't think of economic darwinism but of a productive way of creating new markets.

Let's  take a look at where we are at the moment. Have you noticed all these  new, sometimes organic food products that are currently made by small  companies from all over the world and that pop up every other week in  your favorite grocery store? Or have you seen all the weekly announced  successfully kickstarted products? Most of them are really well thought  through and target individual markets that turns out to be big enough  for a business because we now can reach nearly everyone. We already have  so much more opportunities to open new fields of businesses, that there  will be enough room for all of us. This is what I meant to say with  competition.

Everything can be globally  outsourced to already set\-up businesses \- what hurt many employees a few  years ago, but pays out now by creating tons of new working fields and  jobs every day. We now have  quantum\-computing that entered the cloud and you can rent it today by  IBM. We have deep networking AI's that invents new structural formulas  for biotech and the chem industry on a daily basis. We see the first  neuronal network CPU architecture that has been introduced last week at  TNW. Apples A9 has already built in parts of hardware based on neuronal  networks in smartphones out there. Google added speech synthesis that  can't be distinguished from humans. Baidu can even recreate every  individuals voice by using a short sample phrase. And still, if you step  outside on your street, you'll not see very much differences.

All  this leads to what many refer to as transition from capitalism to,  well, something. Something of course not only benefits us but means  also a big challenge we have to take. For example half of the German  traffic law don't need lawyers anymore and can be accomplished by AI  software. Architects, doctors, journalists, drivers, even arts and every  single office\-job dealing with Excel can already be either enhanced or  replaced by an AI \- TODAY. 

This may feel  uncomftable to some, like something between scary and odd but depending  on us it doesn't have to be bad. One of the biggest challenge these days  is the only thing that differs from transitions we made in the past \-  like capitalism, industrial revolution, electrification, mercantilism,  feudalism: It's tremendous and growing tempo. Changes will come up  constantly and dramatically faster than they used to happen before. It  feels like we are at the beginning of an exponential function \- and  maybe it feels like this because we are.

The  challenge to catch people and to prevent unemployment as well as local  and global social inequalities asks for rethinking our business\-model of  capitalism. Some changes will just happen automatically, others can be  absorbed by ideas like the basic income, massive crowdfundings to  overtake stock companies by the public or by getting rid of the use of  bank accounts with blockchain technology, what is particularly important  for many citizens in poor countries with a bad infrastructure.

Finally,  let's get back to the unknown something. We like to build up  categories because that makes it easy for us to set bookmarks in our  brains. Sometimes these categories generate prejudices but for the most  part they are helpful to handle our individual dataset and sync it up  with reality. So if we'd had to create a term for the upcoming thing  with our current terms and knowledge, we'd have to come up with  something like digital organized eco\-anarchism \- not because it has  anything to do with anarchism or economics in the traditional way, but  because it's the best matching thing. It's accessable from everywhere,  it bundles the needs for products, services and resources, it will be  self\-organized because it turned out to be the most adaptable and  efficient way, it will create new markets we haven't even thought of  yet, and it redistributes money, maybe even redefines it.",6,5

Identity[c] = Evaluation[a]  Priority[b]

##Because one day 'we' chose to be worthy of reference

Intelligence is the matching of isolated language processing components to presented/identified problem sets. If you can map intelligence to contextually accurate language exposure over time (context-specific vocabulary in a positive-metric measurable environment) then don't we already have 'explanatory' A.I. companions? If it can reactively group concepts sufficiently for us to be able to notice and tag them in our own headspace then it is sufficient to be an additive/aiding companion. Google is the example. However as human individual or social member we are only considered authorized if some other process certified us to be so, and if there was sufficient metrics to consider educational A.I. to be as good as teachers given past performance, then technically ALL humans will get the option of being reborn or have a Life 2.0. Enough science and math to give people the chance to 'start fresh' means they are given the tools to be self-authoritative to a level reserved for imagination currently.

Language itself is defined mostly by its terminator grammar (The language's perspective upon starting information, such as what information it prioritizes to be semantically relevant) and how it is intended to be interpreted by the 'other' interpreter (an entity that shares your language but posses differing perspectives within the range, not about the goal posts specifically as that is a waste of an argument). As humans we want to exchange the most context-specific message in the shortest period of time in order to have the best survival, due to increased reaction time. The only language exchange you don't want is any 'not me' operators &amp; 'forceful introduction' syntax. When you can understand semantics as an expression (like a Chinese person whose internal language is mostly fixed-character semantic differentiation) in English then you learn how to start grouping by 'identity intention', which you learn as a skillset just by willing to read through comments on a forum (or filtering out the opinions of others at public gatherings).

Communication is all about conveying a message as atomically as possible when it comes to satisfying criteria for an event exchange, which seems to be a very simple thing to progress with. Most people use language in order to enact or establish a power structure over another sentient being (cultural), however it could (and should) easily be information gifting, coupled with some queue priority mode. If we all agree to share the 'infinity gauntlet', and that to be the new world order, then I think you'll find most people would still spend some of their hold over the singularity-consciousness to benefit humans as 'measurable entities' instead of filtering for 'this quality over that'.

Eventually there comes a time when a living species set becomes the 'tipping point template' and all new generation of child-experiences will be under cultural influence X more than Y. The fallout from this rapid expansion of technology being that 'self-certification' of knowledge will exceed any distributive education center. Essentially there is nothing wrong with 'internet experts', so long as they submit to whatever descriptor they are provided with upon inspection. So many humans fear inspection though or can't envision positive data inferences...

So, why can't Compressor English be a thing? If we can compress things to simpler and simpler analogies, should we not be working on presenting analogs/simplifications/alternative expressions for as many things as possible? Or anything along those lines. An Idea Fertility Metric. It is very easy to consider other humans as unique dictionary sets with stored 'reaction statements'. Some have sufficient to construct consistently unique insights and comparisons, some simply go, ""Win Bigly!"" -&gt; Side Note: This whole profiting off knowing some mass-producible and low-complexity language trick (marketing/sales) is, in my mind, an amazingly boring existence. Trump is dull.

Everyone keeps going 'this thing I do not know will be the tipping point!' but spend no time in trying to identify what the tipping point is or if they can join in. A complete lack of 'inclusive' narrative, which is what Singularity and all other things implies. I am referenced because I can be included, but the belief of being included in something 'worthy of inspection by others' is low. There has to be a story we can all share and benefit from together, and is that not the PURPOSE of accepting being a member of a group? In this instance I personally advertise inclusion and gift it to anyone that feels it is worth the effort/time.

If not a shared story then at least a shared story teller (AGI could handle this easily). Thought the question I find for so many people is that they have been given no reason to think of infinity or a continued existence because we as a culture gift them no reason to believe the following event could happen : ""Creator Spoke To Me."" (I'm not religious, it's just insert whatever variable you use for your wish-fulfillment purposes)

All human minds have their own capacity for belief constructs and methods for testing, so, given this, why do 'I' live in a 'simulation' and DON'T want to be able to group/guild up for the future? In truth, information exchange is easy, validating, and only enables more experiences of a non-conflict nature. The people on here 'are' intelligent and of sufficient virtue to care. I'm sure there are more than enough of us that hold the 'I share my identity with others' hivemind concept enough to think of this as some sort of call-to-arms.

It really just starts with willing to work as a group to lay down 'human as a cost function' and apply distributive properties to each stage. For example, how much would we have to work as a society if all energy/food endeavors were focused on technologically until the labor/education cost required to maintain the system can be shared with sufficient confidence with 'anyone who shares the same organizational identity as you'?

There has to be SOME narrative or story that people here believe will INVOLVE or INCLUDE them. Or will that only happen when high scores replace bank accounts?",3,0

I can see the challenges of photonics but I cannot understand why researches don't focus on something that is that much faster than conventional computers.

I'm sure many of you have some clue as to the nature of the verse but to summarize:

&gt;It is the year 2400 and Humanity has extensively colonized the Inner Solar System and the Jovian Asteroid Belt but it is as fragmented as ever. Earth, now a single federation under the United Nations that also governs protectorates in the Belt Colonies is embroiled in a Cold War with the Martian Congressional Republic, a state that broke away from Earth's authority. At the same time, the Belters, increasingly growing discontent with the UN's authority, is actively trying to create an independent nation of their own.

I think the setting illustrates well how Human nature is inescapable in that we always try to find what sets us apart from others \- the Belters being essentially a subspecies of Humans distinct from Earth and Martian humans \- and using those differences as a justification for conflict.

Of course The Expanse is fictional but do you think that if we ever get this far as a species, we'll end up in a very similar situation with conflict between Humans over petty differences none of us can control or could we adopt the better angels of our nature and progress together as a united species?",2,3

The extreme scenarios would be:  a) A serial killer confessing his crimes to the AI and using his AI assistant to help plan his next murder.  b) A terrorist using his AI assistant to plan an attack.  In these situations, I think anyone would want the AI to inform the police.  But what about a man confessing that he wants to kill his wife?  The AI could ask follow-up questions confirming that he does have a plan and feels like he may do it.  Or an AI may learn that its user collects child porn and fantasizes about molesting a real child.  Shouldn't the AI be held to the same ethical/legal standards as human therapists?  If so, where do we draw the line?  What sorts of illegal activities should be okay in the AI's view?

So, here is what I predict.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/8ncude/greetings_reddit_subscribers_of_futurology_i_have/,FuzzyDude17,1527719026,"**NOTE: No hate comments please and thank you. This is my prediction, and you don't have to agree with me.** 

Number 1: **Fashion**

Men will probably have very thin facial hair, and a skin fade hairstyle.

Their clothing might have skinny hoodie zipper, skinny tank top in it, skinny jeans, and low top shoes.

Women: Short hair, skinny shirt, skinny jeans, and slip on sneakers.

Number 2: **Cars**

They will look more modern and might look more aggressive. By looking at new 2019 designs. 

The hood, roof, doors, trunk, and bumper molding might be sleek.

The headlamps and taillights might look angry, and its LED lights will come with of course. 

Number 3: **Culture**

A lot of new so\-called rappers and off topic R&amp;B singers \(One hit wonders\) will probably try so hard

to take over new music genre artists \(I am guessing R&amp;B\) in mainstream music. Fans might be involved in 

this music conflict. 

And Number 4: **Music**

It might have a reverse 2000s trend. Because back then, Hip hop became mainstream while R&amp;B was around the corner.

Kiss Pop music goodbye and ladies first for R&amp;B, while mens hip hop will have to wait its turn on radio. And who knows if Beyonc returns, lol. 

**So that is my prediction for the 2020s. If you have any opinions, put it in the comments down below. Thank you for reading**

**my prediction, and have a good day.** ",2,0

&gt;Amenities like garbage disposal and goods delivery are to be coordinated and driven by AI and robotics.

&gt;The proposed parcel of land isn't huge, but it's not insubstantial either - it covers about half-a-square-kilometre, and there are already suggestions it could be extended. 

Funnell notes that the proposed project has received ""lavish praise"" from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who called the project an:
