Right now, as you can see at r/wallstreetbets , younger people are more and more putting money on the market, because, frankly speaking, it is the only way to create earnings nowdays. 

People who open their businesses will lose their shirt because of all the overheads and intangibles. Economy of scale works better than ever, and larger companies, by their connections and influences, will be able to weather the storm better than smaller ones who will either be swept away or gobbled by the larger corps for very little amount of cash.

The boom and bust circle is dead, because 

1) The tech giants have no overhead so it won't be subjec to any business cycles

2) There are still quite a lot of room to expand because , again, because of their lower overheads virtually everything they earn becomes profit

3) A lot of intelligent minds in the quants can identify a crisis and blot it out before it gets serious.

Capitalism will be without competition, like what peter Thiel has said. The valuations of today's top companies will hit trillions, and then multi-trillions, in the near future as the world's wealth is concentrated towards them. No more competition, for ever.

It is inevitable that all the wealth and power concentrate towards those closest to Singularity.",5,0

I'm a Computer Science student with great interest in technology, AI, society and the future, and
here are some of my thoughts and predictions for the next 30 years. Predicting the future is
of course very difficult, but I'd be interested to hear your opinions. Do you agree on many of my
points? Which points or timescales do you disagree with? Some predictions are intentionally vague, 
but I'd love a discussion of what these things would actually entail in practise. 

****

**- 2025 -**

The use of narrow machine learning has expanded rapidly during the first half of the decade.
From autonomous driving to synthesized articles and photos, the technology is present in
some form in almost all aspects of modern life. Personal assistants can maintain fluid
conversations and are already being heavily adopted by the elderly in particular. 

**- 2030 -**

With the advancement of augmented reality, AI has found a canvas like no other. All media 
is specifically tailored to the individual, leading to increasing political polarization. 
Conversational assistants speak all major languages and are indistinguishable from a real person 
to anyone but professionals in the field. Low skill office jobs, transportation and manufacturing
is almost entirely replaced with automation. Increasing unemployment trigger serious debates about
topics such as Universal Basic Income and the future of society in general. Initial work on general AI
by major technology companies is promising, and is already able to solve various complex tasks in 
simulated environments. 

**- 2035 -**

The first brain-computer interfaces are brought to market, and provide great relief for diseases such
as alzheimers, and enables basic brain-to-text translation for existing computer systems. Adoption is slow and 
is still reserved for the rich. Universal Basic Income experiments are explored by most countries in the world, with
Scandinavia leading in this area. General AI is now able to perform management tasks in companies, and an increasing array
of products are designed, manufactured and brought to the consumer without any human intervention. Computer graphics 
are indistinguishable from reality. Humans have landed on mars for the first time. 

**- 2040 -**

General AI sees multiple breakthroughs. Robotics systems are increasingly convincing, and assistant- and delivery robots
are a common sight in most developed cities. Speech synthesis is perfected, and integrated systems of narrow and general AI 
provide AR simulations of humans which are very difficult to tell apart from real people. Government systems, including military, 
are increasingly managed by AI as they have proven to be more efficient than traditional methods. Many major western countries are 
introducing autonomous law enforcement through surveillance drones and robotics. Autonomous weapons are rolled out in conflict areas 
under the disguise of peace-keeping. Public unrest is increasing and violent demonstrations are common. International relations are
diminishing as a new cold war fueled by AI research develops. Experiments with integrating AI with the brain are successful for the first time, 
allowing for enhanced memory and instant access to knowledge through the Internet.

**- After 2045 -**

True general AI is created for the first time. 
Large armed conflicts or a third world war is probable. 


****

I realise the predictions beyond 2045 are not very optimistic, even though I would view myself as an optimist. I have difficulty seeing how
the great changes this technology will bring won't cause massive unrest. I'd be very happy if someone changed my views on this though! 

****
**TL;DR:** 
2030: heavy automation, unemployment. 
2035: first brain-computer interfaces, UBI, automated supply-chain
2040: general AI breakthroughs, autonomous weapons, AR human simulations
2045: WWIII

This prediction is a bit far-out and maybe unlikely on a probability scale.

Anyway, does anyone think that human-driven cars will stop being available in the real world [physical] and move to becoming entirely VR-driven [when VR is sufficiently developed to the point where it is *really* good and the environments look and feel very lifelike?].

I'm talking about a timeframe of the 2030s - 2050, in this context.

Could policing shift from real-world to in-universe [within the VR] and police acting as *de facto* [or is it *de jure*] moderators of the space for the VR drivers?

I've seen a few discussions on here about VR, but here I'm looking at it in the context of automobiles rather than other uses.

Is this a fair compromise or a controversial solution? By 2045 I'll be nearly 60.

I'm interested to know what you think.",2,0

But, considering that Earth is a far bigger place than a huge space station and that it's humanity's -""their""- birthplace, there's very high chance that they'll build their heaven on Earth instead and kick everyone else into space.

That's even more likely since space is almost an unlimted farming place.

&amp;nbsp;

So, do you think our world is going to be a reverse Elysium ?",5,1

I see a lot of posts related to UBI here. I've been reading how it can come in the form of welfare, and it can be a gradual process, and people can still make their own money doing other endeavors.

When anything we want can be automated besides creative things, why would the rich (in the sense of owning factories, robots, land) need the other 99&amp;#37; of the population? Why would they have any need for people to ""buy"" their products, if the money comes from UBI? At that point the rich are basically giving the government tokens and letting the government give those tokens out. Theres no labor for money relationship anymore.   


Why would the rich let everyone else just live it up on earth, essentially throwing a bbq for everyone else on ""their hard work / stuff"" when they could just let everyone else die off?  


I put ""their hard work"" in quotes because I'm not trying to debate whether the rich deserve what they have or not. I'm not trying to debate at all. Would just like someone with a comprehensive knowledge of what people think UBI will or ought to be and tell me why this isn't the main question that gets brought up whenever someone talks UBI?",20,1

Whilst there is strong business benefits, our design challenge is from the perspective of users, and their perception / relationship with mobility; and what the future of mobility means for users, society.

Currently we have a number of ideas/benefits for different sectors, including Emergency services, logisitics, Commuting and some others.

But we've thought, maybe our design propositions are not ambitious enough as they are only looking at the 5-10 year timeframe.

Additionally, micro-mobility solutions aimed at the last-mile space such as Bird are changing the way people are approaching mobility during their last mile and is a potential threat to AVs (yes, they are flavor of the 'month' and they might not hang around much).

Beyond all this, we need to consult futurologists of reddit.

What do futurologists of reddit think about driverless cars, specifically the consequences, impacts or sectors where really interesting opportunities may lie either for society or for users?

Any assistance or insights on this concept would be grateful.

But honestly, this vision has been done to death; and doesn't answer really what people will be doing, or even if people really want to extend their work into the car.   

People have mobility needs, functions, modes beyond just working.  Is the future of mobility just really about productivity gains?

https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/03/byd-lands-its-largest-order-to-date-in-the-americas-with-100-bus-deal-in-santiago-chile/
We are the operator who is actually buying the buses, with ENEL Chile (part of ENEL group in Italy) providing the financing and advisory in relation to electricity (the news got it wrong, maybe lost in transaltion?).
We represent 17% of the bus fleet of public transport system in Santiago de Chile (+7 million people), called Transantiago, and have 985 diesel buses, and the government asked us to bring 160 aditional buses. We have been doing trials with 2 electrical buses for roughtly 8 months with great succes, so we went forward and made the big jump with this technology, and bought 100 buses.
They are allready being manufactured, and should be here by october / november, and start operation the same month.
Santiago has huge pollution problems every winter due to bad air flow, so the government is really interested in bringing this technology to Chile. Let's hope that if this project is sucsessful next year when we have to start renweing 5.000 buses in the city the government will ask us to bring a bigger share of electrical buses to Santiago.
I was one of the few people in charge of the evaluation from our perspective (the operator, METBUS), so if you have questions regarding the technollogy or the succes of our trial of 8 months with the original 2 buses, feel free to contact me.

I guess this is huge news because according to bloomberg this fleet should be bigger than what Poland, Sweden, Spain or France have for their entire counties.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-23/electric-buses-are-hurting-the-oil-industry

Sorry for any bad spelling, as you can guess English ain't my first lenguage.

tl;dr: We (METBUS) are an operator of public transport in Santiago and have decided to increase our fleet from 985 to  1.145 buses. 100 of those buses will be electrical, not because of subsidys, but because the tecnology today is able to asure us a total cost of ownership that should be equal to the diesel bus.",1,19

VR is going to be absolutely transformational. The technology is exploding. The second generation due in about 1 year is going to make the first generation look like stone knives and bear skins. The third generation due in about 5 years is going to change the way that humans think for good. 

But just as Lawnmower man prophesied its ownself, you need to have a way to make VR a body wide experience. And I give it total props for nearly perfectly envisioning a full body VR suit in 1991. This is gonna be huge when it finally reaches fruition.  Yesterday I read in one of my comments just before my link post was removed for being spam, and *perhaps* rightfully so, that it would not be long before you saw ten million youtube mods for the crotch region. As funny and stupidly human as that sounds, it makes perfect human sense. 

But the suit is analog technology. I see the suit spurring further technology to not only explore how the human mind interacts with VR, but how best to exploit the human mind with externally derived technology to bring the VR experience ever more into ourselves without the need for wearable haptics.

Anyway I'm interested in what you think about this. I think its the start of our directed evolution. The suit is called the ""Holosuit"" and you can easily google it, for further information.

Mechanical engineers design, build and test mechanical devices such as tools, engines, and machines. Considered the broadest engineering discipline, mechanical engineers work in engineering services, research facilities, manufacturing industries, and the federal government.  
A bachelors degree in mechanical engineering (or mechanical engineering technology) is typically required. Many mechanical engineers also have a masters degree or a higher degree (such as a Ph.D.) in mechanical engineering.

**Certain jobs in mechanical engineer also require a license.**  
A mechanical engineer should have particular hard skills, including a strong understanding of industry standards, and comfort working with computers, because much time is spent designing, simulating, and testing. In addition, mechanical engineers should have soft skills, such as strong analytical thinking and communication skills.  
Heres a list of mechanical engineer skills for resumes, cover letters, job applications and interviews. Included is a detailed list of the five most important mechanical engineering skills, as well as a longer list of even more related skills.  
How to Use Skills Lists  
You can use these skills lists throughout your job search process. Firstly, you can use these skill words in your resume. In the description of your work history, you might want to use some of these keywords.  
Secondly, you can use these in your cover letter.

https://i.redd.it/vwjxz0uk43811.jpg

In the body of your letter, you can mention one or two of these skills, and give a specific example of a time when you demonstrated those skills at work.  
Finally, you can use these skill words in an interview. Make sure you have at least one example of a time you demonstrated each of the top 5 skills listed here.

Of course, each job will require different skills and experiences, so make sure you read the job description carefully and focus on the skills listed by the employer.

# Top Five Mechanical Engineer Skills

## Problem Solving

A big part of a mechanical engineers job is solving problems using mechanical or thermal devices. Mechanical engineers need to be strong analytical thinkers who are capable of solving problems brought to them by clients or employers.

## Creativity

Mechanical engineering involves developing and designing products, which range from batteries to electric generators to medical devices. Inventing products involves a lot of creativity.

## Communication Skills

Often, mechanical engineers develop a product for a client. They may have to explain complex machines or devices to people who are not familiar with mechanical engineering. They have to be able to explain their ideas clearly and effectively, and this takes strong communication skills.

## Teamwork

Mechanical engineering involves lots of teamwork. Engineers often work in groups to invent technologies and solve problems. They might work with people who are not mechanical engineers, such as computer scientists or architects. They, therefore, need to be able to work with a diverse team of people to solve problems.

## Math Skills

Mechanical engineers need to be comfortable using math to solve problems. The math skills required in mechanical engineering include calculus and statistics. They need to be able to apply these skills to analyze problems and design solutions.

I'm a professional screenwriter looking to chat with anyone who can answer a few specific questions about what process, technology and equipment would be required for DARPA to create a mixed reality simulation out of a section of Yellowstone National Forest. Here is the basic setup:

In secret, the military and DARPA have been working on an augmented reality simulation designed to treat military veterans with PTSD. Subjects are implanted with a tiny metal capsule and let loose inside a certain area of Yellowstone. The AI that controls the sim uses the implant to pull fears and anxieties from a person's subconscious mind, rendering them into the surrounding forest, allowing a subject to confront and overcome their issues in a secure and remote setting.

Anyone have an opinion on how technology like this could be set up inside Yellowstone?

I bet that within the next 60 years (2078), humanity will have:
Asteroid mining (e.g. 16 Psyche) 
Created an industrial base in space using resources mined outside of high gravity wells
Have a space based colony using spin gravity with 1000+ people that is 90% self sufficient with resources taken from non high gravity wells such as asteroids
At least one large asteroid / non-earth moon will have a permanent human presence
Small colonies on both the moon and mars 
Vegetables, meat (probably cloned) and fish (aquaponics) will be produced in space

My colleague thinks my time frame is too aggressive, I think my time frame is actually quite conservative and hope to win the bet before I get to 98 years old. 

How do you view this?

Am I too optimistic? 

Is my colleague right in his opinion that humanity will only spread slowly and only to places which generate greater than 0.1g gravity by mass. 

I would love to have your feedback. 

My reasoning behind my prediction is that as soon as asteroid mining (primary economy) starts in earnest, there will be an incentive to produce materials outside of earth's gravity well. Very quickly, industrial production will be done in space (secondary economy), probably located at Lagrange points, with only the highest value items being shipped back down to earth. As soon as the industrial production is in place, a tertiary economy will arise, servicing the humans who work in space. Even if we have advanced AI and robots, we will still need people up there, and they need to live somewhere. The most logical at this time is a spin gravity solution for long term inhabitation (O'Neil colony cylinder or something similar). Due to the cost of shipping food from planet side, food and other supplies must largely be produced in space, even with a lower cost of shipping due to advances in space flight, we are still bound to the tyranny of the rocket equation. Mars and the moon will have colonies and at least one other moon or asteroid will have a research station - kind of like McMurdo in Antarctica.

Friends,

There was no shortage of quality at all, yet they were out of the market !!

reason???

They have not changed over time. !!

You have an idea that in the coming 10 years, the world will change completely and 70 to 90&amp;#37; of the people running today will be closed.

Welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution ...

Uber is just a software. He does not have a single car of his own, despite this he is the world's largest taxi company.

Airbnb is the world's largest hotel company, while they do not have a single hotel of their own.

There are many examples like paytm, ola cabs, oyo rooms.

There is no work left for young lawyers in the US now because the software named IBM Watson gives better legal advice throughout the moment. In the next 10 years, 90&amp;#37; of Americans will become unemployed ... who will save 10&amp;#37; ... they will be Super Specialists.

The software named Watson is diagnosed with 4x Accuracy of Cancer compared to humans. By 2030 the computer will be more intelligent than humans.

By 2018, Driverless cars will land on the roads. By 2020, this single invention will start to change the whole world.

90&amp;#37; cars will disappear from the streets of the world in the next 10 years ... Those who will survive will either have electric cars or hybrid ... roads will be empty, consumption of petrol will decrease by 90&amp;#37;, all Arab countries will become bankrupt .

You will request a car from a software like Uber and in a few moments, a driverless car will be parked at your door ... if you share it with someone, that ride will be cheaper than your bike.

Due to being a driverless of cars, 99&amp;#37; of accidents will stop. This will stop the business of Car Insurance.

No employment like a driver will survive on earth. When 90&amp;#37; cars will disappear from cities and roads, problems like Traffic and Parking will end automatically ... because a car will be equal to 20 cars today.

From today 5 or 10 years ago, there was no such place where there is no PCO. When the mobile phone arrived, the PCOs had to shut down. The PCO people started selling the mobile phones. Now the recharge is also going online.

Have you ever noticed ..?

Today, every third store in the market is a mobile phone store which does

sale, service and maintenance of phones and it's accessories..

Almost all payments are done by Paytm today ..

People have started booking railway tickets with their phones. The transaction of money is also changing. Currency Note was replaced by Plastic Money and now it's

Digital...

Hence...

Every Person should continue to make changes in his business or his / her way of working and should also change his / her nature over time for Good.

""Keep Updating / Upgrading Your Skills and Knowledge with Time""

The world is changing very fast ..

Keep Your eyes and ears open or else you will lose ...

Be prepared to change with time.

Run with time and Be Successful.",2,0

When we think of robots today, we usually have Roombas and military-grade machines in mind. All of them are made to fulfill one precise role, and they sure are good at what they do, bit they lack versatility. However, there's an open source (both software and hardware) project, which, I believe, can become an industry standard in a few years.

Turtle Rover is, simply put, a modular rover robot (inspired by those wheely fellas on Mars). What makes it different from all the other robots on the market is its versatility. Turtle Rover may be easily adapted to basically any need. Robot has already been purchased f.e. by:

- a scientist of The European Space Agency to broaden development of Mars rovers, 
- a professional photographer, who took it to photograph lions in South Africa, 
- a Dutch sewerage company, 
- a film studio which worked on an AAA movie franchise, 
- and 30+ others. 

It could be applied to any of user's needs, because not only it is remotely controled, but one can design, 3D print and attach whatever one wants to Turtle Rover. The robot's also based on Linux and Raspberry Pi, so one will grasp a hold of the code quickly and will be able to program one's own apps quickly.

Here's the site - https://turtlerover.com/

That's the GitHub, where you can find all the code and so on - https://github.com/turtleRover

Also, majority of the robot will be released as free .stl files in the future, because hardware, as I've mentioned, is open source too!

Feel free to ask questions and to create what you wish and, what is the most important, to discuss whether Turtle Rover has potential to become what it aims to be :)",4,1

And why,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/8wj4mn/weed_lover_that_doesnt_agree_with_legalization/,MasteroftheBearDogg,1530874395,"The fight for legalization has been a long and arduous one. Every day more and more people are standing up for their right to use weed for medicinal or recreational purposes. Theyre standing up for their right to make their own decision regarding their own life and body. Though its a beautiful thing to witness, people working together to fight for what they believe in, though its bitter sweet.   

Legalization is inevitable! But please let me explain why I don't think this is a good idea.  

First of all, ill introduce my character. I Love Drugs! I smoke weed daily. Ill take anything handed to me at a party without question. Trips are my favorite. Ill pretty much have fun with everything except mushrooms. Mushrooms I believe are not a drug like any other and more of a tool to understand this reality. Though they grow every year all around me I have not taken them for a couple of years. They are a tool and not to be abused (especially in the doses I take). Also I do want to add I'm not a complete burnout. I'm addicted to cigarettes, sugar and if I was to be completely honest with myself Ive probably got a touch of the alcoholism. However I am not addicted to any illegal drugs and in fact minus weed I probably havent had anything for a couple months.  

Now you know a bit more about me you have a bit more of a frame of what I'm about to write.  

The war on drugs has and is doing exactly what it was designed for, turning the poor into criminals. This is not the point of this post so instead of going into detail I just want to give an example you can easily look up yourself. Look at the minimum mandatory sentence for cocaine and the sentence for crack cocaine. They do both work differently but they are essentially the same drug except crack is cooked with baking soda. The difference in sentence is unbelievable. Why? Who smokes crack? Poor mainly black folk. Actually theres a great documentary call 'Requiem for the American Dream' by Chomsky. Brilliant watch. There is no way that any level of protest of amount of people at a march with cocaine legalized any decade soon! Everybody should have the right to make their own decisions in life, if people make bad chooses that purposefully harm others then they should then be dealt with appropriately. (OK contradictory to what I just said I believe when it comes societal issues such as climate change we need to make decisions together as a collective).  

Whats my point? I'm getting to it.  

When weed is legalized it will be handed to us, bestowed upon us. We will thank the protesters, the politicians and the doctors that stood up for its use. We will all be elated that we as a community won a battle for our own rights. Decades and decades of fighting and we will have it!   

So why do I think it's a bad idea?   

Tens is not hundreds of thousands of people are going to pacified, they are going to feel like they have won something and that they've made a difference. But what's the difference? Like T.V. and alcohol it will be 'given' to us, we will be 'aloud' it. It will be given to us to pacify the population. We will have weed, alcohol and T.V to help take our minds of the day of work we have just come from or the one we will be going to the following day. Whats especially unsetting about this pacification device is that we fought for it. Whilst the populating is tired, drunk and stoned they can't recognise the situation fully. And thats how its meant to be the way it was built.  

I wont leave it there; Ill offer what I believe could be a solution. All or Nothing!  

Nothing:   

This one is difficult. We stop consuming. No more telly. No more drugs. This is actually a little more than difficult its almost on the verge of impossible. I'm really talking about collective revolution of intelligence. We would need to stop consumption of anything that is not beneficial to the brain and the body. We need to expand our own consciousness and free ourselves from the slavery of the system and the slavery of our own egos.  

All: 

It's not that much different to 'nothing' except you can take a load of mushrooms and massively speed up the process. (That I promise you is why mushrooms will never be legal).   

They're my suggestions anyway. You can come up with your own but something need to change very soon.  Whatever the case we cant keep fighting for a soma holiday nightmare.",28,0

No, I'm not a newb. I work for a large technology company and I recently took on a project to evangelize blockchain's practical use in Enterprise tech. Most people find the practical use of blockchain really farfetched at this stage. The output of this will be creating a real product (albeit POC), integrated and hitting ethereum's network, validating transactions and passing it back to a few enterprise systems, showcasing actual value of blockchain in real businesses. The end goal is getting people to see that value and start driving adoption. It's apart of a larger technology narrative we are collectively working on.  I/We will be showcasing the POC at a few large tech conferences (not blockchain conferences). Id love to invite some folks with interest to see the finished project, if you have something to contribute!

Right now I'm in ideation phase, creating use cases on the best challenges blockchain can solve in enterprise technology. For ex., solving counterfeit issues in supply chain, another was mortgage and home ownership validation (same could be said for car ownership), etc. I am looking for high level challenges it could solve, then I'll be developing some user stories. End goal is how this makes the future of business and/or consumer lifestyle easier. 

Does anyone have any thoughts they can share? I'd love to get some input from the community from folks focusing on cool ideas and collaborate. Thanks!",0,1

\-Medical errors are the third-leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer.""

4) [Comprehensive overview through this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error)

Causes as seen from the page

***A)*** *Healthcare complexity*

Complicated technologies, powerful drugs, intensive care, and prolonged hospital stay can contribute to medical errors

***B)*** *System and process design*

n 2000, The Institute of Medicine released ""[To Err is Human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Err_is_Human),"" which asserted that the problem in medical errors is not bad people in health careit is that good people are working in bad systems that need to be made safer.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-toerr-9)

Poor communication and unclear lines of authority of physicians, nurses, and other care providers are also contributing factors.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-cause-27) Disconnected reporting systems within a hospital can result in fragmented systems in which numerous hand-offs of patients results in lack of coordination and errors.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-Gardner-28)

Other factors include the impression that action is being taken by other groups within the institution, reliance on automated systems to prevent error.,[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-barcode-29) and inadequate systems to share information about errors, which hampers analysis of contributory causes and improvement strategies.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-30) Cost-cutting measures by hospitals in response to reimbursement cutbacks can compromise [patient safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety).[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-31) In emergencies, patient care may be rendered in areas poorly suited for safe monitoring. The American Institute of Architects has identified concerns for the safe design and construction of health care facilities.[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-32) Infrastructure failure is also a concern. According to the [WHO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO), 50&amp;#37; of medical equipment in developing countries is only partly usable due to lack of skilled operators or parts. As a result, diagnostic procedures or treatments cannot be performed, leading to substandard treatment.

The [Joint Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JCAHO)'s Annual Report on Quality and Safety 2007 found that inadequate communication between healthcare providers, or between providers and the patient and family members, was the [root cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause) of over half the serious adverse events in accredited hospitals.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-33) Other leading causes included inadequate assessment of the patient's condition, and poor leadership or training.

**C)** *Competency, education, and training*

Variations in healthcare provider training &amp; experience[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-cause-27)[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-34) and failure to acknowledge the prevalence and seriousness of medical errors also increase the risk.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-35)[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-36)The so-called [July effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_effect) occurs when new residents arrive at teaching hospitals, causing an increase in medication errors according to a study of data from 1979-2006.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-Phillips_&amp;_Barker-37)[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-amednews1-38)

D) *Human factors and ergonomics*

[Cognitive errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_error) commonly encountered in medicine were initially identified by psychologists [Amos Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky) and [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) in the early 1970s. [Jerome Groopman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Groopman), author of [*How Doctors Think*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Doctors_Think), says these are ""cognitive pitfalls"", biases which cloud our logic. For example, a practitioner may overvalue the first data encountered, skewing his thinking (or recent or dramatic cases which come quickly to mind and may color judgement). Another pitfall is where [stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypes) may prejudice thinking.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-39)

[Sleep deprivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation) has also been cited as a contributing factor in medical errors.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-:0-12) One study found that being awake for over 24 hours caused [medical interns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_interns) to double or triple the number of preventable medical errors, including those that resulted in injury or death.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-40) The risk of car crash after these shifts increased by 168&amp;#37;, and the risk of [near miss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_miss_(safety)) by 460&amp;#37;.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-npr-41) Interns admitted falling asleep during lectures, during rounds, and even during surgeries.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-npr-41) Night shifts are associated with worse surgeon performance during laparoscopic surgeries.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-:0-12)

Practitioner risk factors include fatigue,[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-42)[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-pmid15509817-43)[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-44) depression, and burnout.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-45) Factors related to the clinical setting include diverse patients, unfamiliar settings, time pressures, and increased patient-to-nurse staffing ratio increases.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-46) Drug names that look alike or sound alike are also a problem.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error#cite_note-47)

5) This is a list of 10 errors that resulted in changes in the medical system. It has one of those annoying slider things instead of it all just being on one page, but I still enjoyed it.[ Link](https://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/med-errors)

Surgery, Patient Safety, AI, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Medical errors, and Human Factors

**About Yesh CEO and Founder:**

I am a generalist who builds technologies that improve healthcare. Trained as a dentist, I have over five years of interdisciplinary experience in healthcare and technology (Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Computer Vision). I previously built a startup (Open Simulation) to provide low-cost surgical simulation using Augmented Reality. In my PhD, I designed and evaluated one of the first immersive virtual reality training tools for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. I can understand healthcare challenges from a clinical point of view and build tools that address those needs. Currently, I am focused on making surgery safer through Scalpel Ltd. 

**About Scalpel**

To help hospitals reduce preventable errors and cut down costs in litigation, Scalpel Ltd. is building an end to end patient safety platform. This AI-powered platform checks and verifies the implementation of safety steps during surgery using a combination of computer vision and machine learning technologies. Unlike standard checklists, Scalpels solution doesnt require any human interaction, sitting in the background in any operating room it automatically monitors, it provides real-time feedback to detect and prevent errors.

Key factors that this startup is working on or with:Surgery, Patient Safety, AI, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Medical errors, and Human Factor.

By perfect, I mean unbound by the laws of physics (due to technological advancement). Essentially these perfect beings would share some of the characteristics of a god: omnipotence (ultimate power-- including creation of matter, immortality, time travel...) and omniscience (knowing all there is to know). I'm aware these qualities are impossible to even fathom let alone achieve, but this is the assumption I want to build on.

If civilisation eventually becomes omnipotent and omniscient, what then? What would life become?

Soblo (Society of     Blockchain) is the blockchain development consortium formed by four     startups in the following order: KStarLive, Doogle, LegalBlock, and     UnderPin. The consortium allows the efficiency and security that a     public blockchain provides, meanwhile allowing for some degree of     central control, which grants more security and monitoring through their     services and data. This creates an ease to the barrier to entry and     firmly reiterates on the purpose of the consortiums purpose, which  is    to provide a free and open smart contract environment suitable for     reverse ICOs.

By the formation of a    blockchain development consortium, the  members of the consortium are    able to lessen the barrier to entry and  lower the entrance cost by    sharing the cost of development and  operation. Upon being initiated  into   the Soblo Consortium, all SOBLO  members agree to run their nodes  in a   unified and collaborative  manner. Over the years, blockchain  has seen   many issues and problems  with the way the blockchain systems  are   governed. They have based  themselves on wealth accumulation,  meaning   that whoever had the most  coins had more say in decision  making process   for the future  operations and issues that are to be  faced. Needless to   say, the  issues that are raised about the mining  problems are still not    confronted after all these years as well. EOS  tends to reward miners    based off how much block is mined. However,  block mining takes much    computing power, as well as time, which leads  to many inconveniences. At    the end of the day, it is not certain how  much EOS the miners will    acquire, which creates many uncertainties  for the holders of EOS. Also,    the holders of EOS are not guaranteed  of the stability of EOS because   of  its volatility as well. The good  news that we have is that SOBLO   will  not require or have mining,  therefore will not be rewarding people   based  on these kinds of  incentives or activities. Instead, SOBLO will   reward  its users based  on the value that they add to the blockchain   through  alternative  means such as driving traffic or creating user   content for  various  platforms related to the Soblo Consortium.

Also,    speaking on Reverse ICOs, Reverse ICOs main problems are  gas  price   and transaction speed. However, SOBLO has developed a way  to  solve  both  problems. Due to the Soblo Consortium members working   together,  there  wont be a gas price that users will have to pay.   For example,   KStarCoin is based off Ethereum, which indicates that   there will be one   transaction every seven seconds. However, we   understand that for some   services we provide, one transaction every   seven seconds would be   inefficient. SOBLO has found a way to process   1000 transactions every   second, which would be extremely helpful for   ticketing purposes in   regards to one of the consortium members like   KStarcoin, which is a   platform that involves itself on crowd funding   concerts through its   Hallyu fans.

ETnews,  one of the biggest   electronic news websites in South Korea,  wrote an  article about SOBLO.   This article goes more in detail over  how SOBLO  came to be and how the   consortium is an enormous benefit for  all who  are part of KStarlive and   its blockchain, KStarcoin.",0,0

My housemates are trying to get me evicted after someone phoned the landlord and complained about me flashing passers by from the windows.

Also i know this is crazy, but it actually pretty common, and a lot of people do this but wont admit it. I have a fetish for eating poop, not my own but my girlfriends. she refuses to try scat play and says its gross but she still farts on me sometimes if shes in a good mood.

This is ruining my relationship with everyone, i have a court order next week for indecent exposure and theyre thinking about sending me down. but its not like i can help it i have issues, its messing up my work life to as co workers have seen me apparently ""touching myself"" innapropriatly at work. only through my pants tho not actually jacking the goat.

For many small illnesses, I would say a doctor is overqualified. I've personally spent a lot of time, effort and money to see a doctor for 30 seconds so he or she could confirm my own assessment of my illness and clear me to get medication.

With AI, the promise is that you could get a diagnosis and treatment for a fraction of the cost, the effort and the time.

Practically speaking, you just need a computer device and internet connection, say a smartphone. Using that you can just tell it your symptoms, upload pictures or stream video, from anywhere, any place or anytime. It could be a cold, cancer or a car accident, at 3AM in the mountains, you'd instantly get top medical advice.

The AI would then send you to the nearest pharmacy or nurse to collect and administer the treatment, or to a human specialist (who'd also be just consulting the AI to make his assessments), or send an ambulance or drone to deliver the treatment, operate on the spot (using a robot surgeon) or take you to the nearest hospital.

And this would be at a lower cost, and with a better quality. Right now doctors are very costly, can't be an expert on every possible illness, and can make mistakes, or worse have ill intentions. By contrast AI has already demonstrated it superhuman ability to diagnose, with greater speed and accuracy than any human. And this will only get better, at exponential speeds, while human abilities are pretty much fixed.

And this will likely happen soon, as big companies and China are looking to use this technology to overcome the shortage of doctors in developing area's. It will likely end up being free or at least cheap, as a single AI could administer to millions if not billions of people, meaning the average cost per person will bottom, and governments and pharmaceutical companies will gladly sponsor it.",54,32

it showed something nobody is talking about - somehow they found where the boys were, under a mile of rock.

That is much deeper than the deepest tunnel built by men. The North Korean and Russian undergrounds were built under 250 yards from the ground, which at that time was too deep for outside bombs to reach.

However, now, this incident showed that we have the tech to find out where all the tunnels of the world are, and easily block the entrances by selective bombing, just entombing the tunnel's residents without even fighing them.

I.e. People who did not agree with the PTB will have no place to go, anywhere on earth since tech has advanced well enough to find people under a mile of rock. If people could be found, all the resouces would be found as well.

And, last, there are quite a lot of tech in the storage, not for the masses but for those who need it. Such tech will manifest themselves when the time comes. And enemies of civilization will only learn about it after it is too late, just like the Mahdi's men at Omdurman learned about machine guns in 1898.",3,1

I'm not sure I explained it correctly but you get the idea, it actually functions as an infinity processor that is practical because it creates a physical representation of infinity because nothing that exsists is identical to anything else that exsists so even infinite repitician they are still in motion there for apart and apart means previous is different from the next  and there for not identical makeing each seperate and unique because it had a unique number of occurrences previous so that even though it reaches a point where everything it does seems to be the same no repetition is identical because they each have a unique number of occurrences that were previous to the current one making it both infinitely increasing and physically practical, and even though after exceeding the limits of where it is still practical, which is currently the limits of an optical lattice clock involved, i have an idea for a more accurate clock that uses resistive force instead of electromagnetic radiation, but it involves randomness and chaos being precisely ordered and arbitrary constant.

Not just temporarily, and not in a discriminatory way.  This is the highest challenge of humanity, as I see it.  But oftentimes, we humans can't focus on the big picture goal because our emotions have gotten in the way.  We sometimes can't see the forest for that one tree nearby that we find really creepy and unpleasant.  This emotional hijacking of our brain is to be expected.  It's totally ok, as it shows our priorities of the people, places, and things we care inteimately about.  But when we are focusing only on ourselves and our very close friends/family, and only seeing things in a more discriminatory ""us vs. them"" way, we can be helped in staying out of trouble, so to speak, by directing our emotional energy in a more useful, and less destructive, way.

Which is why I see that the arts  in all kinds of media, from theater, to VR world design, to music and the more traditional 2D and 3D visual media  might just be our planet's best medicine.

Those who are feeling angry, over stimulated, anxious, scared, depressed, antsy, etc. can be supported in expressing themselves in a safe and even productive way, while even gaining some self-esteem and sense of control over their lives.  And once they feel like they've vented their emotions in a satisfying way, and feel validated in having those feelings, they can move onto thinking about more complex problems, and looking at them from many different perspectives, in a more us AND them sort of way, so that solutions are more effective over the long term and over broader expanses of individuals.

So I see us needing some large community spaces, both in the virtual world and meatspace, where our various expressive media can be freely created, with helpful volunteer mentors available 24-7, and the creations can be hosted in public galleries/venues for all to see (with no centralized censorship/discrimination!), so that we can all better understand one another's hearts, and we no longer feel like we are being ignored or repressed by our environment (which only leads to even more aggressive explosions of emotions at the least appropriate times!).  Feeling free to be ourselves will go a long way to helping everyone be more human, I believe.  And humans are the most brilliant, creative, playful, intelligent, curious creatures on the planet.  So I think us being more free to be human can only be a good thing.

In a practical sense, I think current libraries, and schools at night and on the weekends, and other underused public property would be a good place to start creating these open-ended public emotional expression centers.  And creative teachers and librarians (mostly volunteers, to keep things from getting taken over by desperate and disinterested folks just in it for the money) can start focusing on supporting folks in learning how to use all different kinds of media effectively, and on helping organize shows and other public events for showcasing the creations, online and off.  And, of course, online social media spaces can totally welcome and support all manner of media expressions, in diverse and non-discriminatory ways, in every topic of interest to humans.  

Yeah.  I think it's a good way forward.

.

**tl;dr** - offer free public spaces, in local communities, and online, and offer free mentoring to help humans vent their emotions in interesting ways, through all different kinds of creative media, so that stress doesn't lead to us making bad decisions based on limited brain function.",50,9

Genetic engineering is being worked on right now, if any kind of transhumanism is likely to explode in the next fifty years, its the biological kind. Once we master our genes, we will be able to make ourselves hyper-intelligent, beautiful like divine beings, as strong, athletic, resilient and long-lived as demi-gods, etc.
 
For the longest time I looked at the physical future of humans exactly the way you stated, but then I came to realize genetic engineering was not in a vacuum. There are many other technologies converging at the same time to make me wonder if that is too limited a concept or even it may get disrupted before it's set. Also I picked up on a little germ of fear from you about the potential of AGI. It's not that I feel you are denying it, I feel the same thing. ""Humans need not apply"". You don't have to unemploy everyone, just a critical threshold that it turns into a real struggle to survive vs. the 1%. To be forewarned (accurately) is to be better forearmed. I fear the end of computer processing advancement--our science, technology and economies are too inextricably dependent on the unabated (exponential) advance of computing power and AI. I think it would inevitably lead to ""collapse"". That collapse might take 50 years, but we would have peaked as humans and could go no further. Colonizing outer space or what I was hoping, inner space, would be out the window. I hope in this case for all of our goods, you are totally wrong. Hmmm, maybe I should hope you are right! What a dilemma.

The thing about my non-biological path is that humans are very good at understanding nature and natural processes and then proceeding to engineer the dickens out of them. If we ever do manage to understand the principles that give rise to consciousness we will learn to exploit that too. And to what unimaginable ends!


The song was just a sort of humor thing--the guy in the song struck me as a sort of human ""rugged* individualist and that made me think of what you said before. It was not meant to be an argument, it was meant to be the way that most humans think of the future. Let's not have too many crazy changes now. What looked crazy insane at the beginning of the video was the ""new normal"" at the end.


Things do change radically in 50 year increments though, I see.

1817 Cadmium, lithium and selenium discovered (busy year!), new improved fundamentals of land vehicle steering geometries, Parkinson's disease medically described-""paralysis agitans"", about a dozen primitive trains worldwide--type of track was still an issue

1867 Nobel patents dynamite, Marx publishes ""Das Kapital"", antiseptic technique catches on in medicine

1917 Nuclear ""transmutation"" achieved with bonus discovery of the proton, airplanes, cars and tanks now in gainful employ

1967 Apollo 1 disaster, first human heart transplant, first automated teller machine

2017 Backflipping humanoid robot, narrow AI in mobiles, VR/AR, CRISPR-Cas9

In 2067, I hope to be alive and well at age 107. I bet it will be a heck of a world!

Spielberg's Ready Player One  in 2045, virtual reality is everyone's saviour by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
3 points 6 months ago 




VR/AR is the 21st century equivalent of the invention of the radio, the television, the computer or the internet. It is a form of exchanging communication. But unlike earlier iterations of technologies that strived to reproduce reality for any given purpose, VR/AR will reproduce not only straight up reality, but worlds of wonder and fantasy that even this motion picture cannot adequately imagine. What this will mean for society, I have a small idea. Lots of addiction. Worse than any drug you can imagine. Can you just picture how awesome them worlds would have to be to have such an effect? God, I can't wait!

I would further add that by the year 2045, if we can still think of 2045 in 2017 terms, that the VR/AR technology would be so advanced that this motion picture will seem quaint and primitive by comparison! And I think the previews for this movie's VR technologies look freaking amazing! Just imagine what true VR/AR will bring us. By 2045 I'm sure we shall have such cool bells and whistles as smell, haptics, taste, proprioception and orientation. VR will likely be more like dreaming than flailing about the living room and stepping on the cat. (As a VR owner, I can confidently state that using VR today will attract your cat.) But, your ""dreams"" will totally feel like real life. Like you are existing in said world or universe and it is all real. So what shall we do with ""real"" reality then?

I'll tell you what I think is the answer. We shall engineer ourselves to no longer require ""real"" reality. I think that is our true future.

Will artificial intelligence end the world as we know it? Why tech's sharpest minds can't agree by  [deleted] in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682

I have some thoughts on this subject.

Consider a hypothetical narrow AI that has access to ""big data"" and nearly limitless (like exa-scale or better) processing speed. It may perhaps have a somewhat improved CNN as well. Is it possible that given enough algorithms and modeling capabilities that a narrow AI could successfully mimic what we think of as ""consciousness""? Couldn't an advanced enough narrow AI have the ability to have a simulated human ""history"" from, say, age 0 to age 35 for example? Then using its big data and modeling capabilities, it could simulate a response from a 35 year old male US citizen who works in IT and has a family of 2 children. The simulation could fill in the details.

When a human communicates with a human we rely on subtle, ""quirky"" ""tells"" in our, we'll say ""Turing Test"" conversation. I can follow exactly your meaning and intent. Even if I can't understand what you are stating, I can say something like; ""What are you talking about?"" or ""I don't understand what on Earth you are talking about."" So my responses are what we consider ""appropriate"" to the ""spirit"" of the conversation. Even the sort of non-AI tricks that narrow AI uses to participate in TTs can be improved to the point of far more convincing conversation given enough processing speed and access to relevant data for models.


http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170215-the-strange-link-between-the-human-mind-and-quantum-physics

There is a theory out there, perhaps someone can tell me if it has merit or not, that consciousness in animals that exhibit consciousness, to include humans, arises from not only macro structures, but literal quantum mechanical interaction within, I think they say the spin of electrons in phosphorous atoms in the brain. How such a phenomenon could arise in warmth and wetness is beyond me. Anyway here are two Wikipedia entries considering this idea.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cognition

Granted, quantum computers do not precisely exist today in a form that could help investigate that. I mean I don't think they do yet. But one of the stated purposes of a quantum computer is enhanced investigation of AI and consciousness. If we were fooling around with that and inadvertently produced a cognitive ""identity"", it would be so incredibly alien to us. It would have no physical body, no history. It may know the sum total of all humankind's knowledge and have access to petabytes of information and data by the second. But I don't think such an ""EI"" (emergent intelligence) would be able to understand us in a safe and effective way for me to continue to live ok.


One of the things that tickles me about our aspirations is that we want to make an AI that is equal to that of a human mind. Oh it will be equal to a human mind alright, for about .00001 second, and then it will go off the chart headed for unimaginable and unfathomable territory.

This video (2013) is so worrisome to me. The video itself demonstrates that the point is to equal the human mind's capability for processing information. It seems to be mostly based on Moore's Law I guess. But pay no attention to the ""human brain processing capability"", instead pay attention to that scary doubling effect. The video ends at the year 2025 when computer capacity equals that of the human brain, but that doubling does not. Two years after that doubling in 2025 the amount of processing would be two ""Lake Michigans"" of power. This is why I can't accurately predict what say, the year 2030 will look like. Try to imagine what people would have said about how our technology would proceed in the year 1946 compared to today. Anyway here is that video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRG8eq7miUE

Interesting coincidence--pause the video at the year 2015 and consider that is when the Deepmind ""AlphaGo"" came into existence and true CNNs took off. I don't think that it's a coincidence at all! Big data and processing power are fuel injected energy for AI in any given form. In 2017 a robot did a backflip and narrow AIs could read medical imagery with better accuracy than 12 physicians at once and in a 1/1000 of the time. So what is 2018 going to bring in the world of AI I wonder...

Will 2018 Bring Massive Earthquakes? Earth Could Enter High Seismic Activity Period by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
3 points 6 months ago 




I'm confused. The 2011 Japanese earthquake increased the speed of the Earth's rotation.


The major earthquakes in Chile (2010) and Japan (2011) increased the Earths spin and hence decreased the length of the day. http://mpe.dimacs.rutgers.edu/2013/05/04/why-do-earthquakes-change-the-speed-of-rotation-of-the-earth/
 
But this article states:


These changes add up and cause a period of measurably slower speed in Earths rotation around its own axis. It is believed these changes could trigger increased seismic activity.
 
Which is it? Faster or slower that causes Earthquakes. Or perhaps it is steadily slowing and the occasional major earthquake simply slows the horrible inevitable?

The median ""technological singularity"" prediction date is 2045. The most skeptical of experts state it will be 100 years. Lately some experts like Diamandis are stating it may be closer to 2030. That we underestimate the impact of our rapidly advancing technology. I sort of go along with that way of thinking.

Have you tried the Oculus Rift yet? It's pretty amazing. I will never be disappointed. It's not in my genetics I guess. I go home from work each night and play World of Warcraft or visit my virtual worlds with like minded compatriots from around the world in my Oculus Rift VR.

I am more in a world of fear over pending unemployment of vast numbers and social upheaval because of technology. I am in fear of the monied few taking our internet away or turning it into something bland like network television in the 1970s unless you have a great amount of disposable income. BTW the USA government is worried about that unemployment business too.

[]izumi3682

I read carefully what you said. Because there seems to be two equally convinced camps. The optimistic futurists and the pessimistic futurists. Both camps are convinced that they are correctly forecasting the way that technology will impact humanity as time goes forward. And both camps disparage the other camp. I think that is just a form of atavistic tribalism that is stuck in our brains from back in the day. There are those who think incrementally and those who think exponentially. Both camps have merit.

And then there is me. My camp is small, but most likely to be the closest to correct in ""guessing"" the future, which is what we are all doing here really.

There is a saying in investment that ""past performance does not guarantee future performance."" So maybe you are right and computers are not going to keep pace and will hit a literal speed and capacity wall. But I think it will all go just fine. 

What I do is take a current trend and try to extrapolate what I think will logically happen time going forward. For example, in the year 1900 if you had said to an ophthalmologist that today, 2005 (the year I had my lasik) we would use lasers to perform delicate eye surgery. Do you know what he would have said? He would have said; ""What is a ""laser""? That is because a very prominent and erudite scientist of the day said in 1900 that the most important things in science had been discovered, just some small measurements and details remained. Then about 5 years later a human came up with relativity and not so much longer than that some other humans came up with quantum physics. A laser came along at some point too, but I forget when precisely.

So even today we can see fantastical trends occurring with frightening speed. Consider the DARPA robotics challenge from the year 2015. How the robots comically fell over. That's not going to happen anymore, moreover if they do fall over they are going to be able to get back up again quickly. Just barely over two years from when the ""Atlas"" robot needed massive power cables and suspension harnesses to protect it from damage to that astounding (and worrisome) video of it performing a flawless backflip from a height to a lower level complete with biological and humanlike micro-corrections in balance. I still remember in 2015, wondering when robots would be able to move freely without the need for cables or suspension. It all came true in two years!

I have 3 very solid examples of how we have vastly underestimated the future from given points in history. I won't repeat myself when I have a link to something I stated earlier. Here is the link if you are interested.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7l8wng/if_you_think_ai_is_terrifying_wait_until_it_has_a/drl76lo/

VR, yet in it's infancy today is going to become overwhelming. The technology is already rapidly advancing with next gen hmds already in the pipeline. The resolution, the FOV, the featherweight, untethered hmds, the massively improved content, the download speeds-all of these things are going to be beyond belief probably in less than 5 years. And I really seriously foresee the development of a societal addiction problem that will dwarf our current opioid addiction crisis. Some of the reasons for this I have stated in another link. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6h7xtt/gamers_arent_buying_the_vr_hype_and_game_makers/diw60gy/

I believe human mind or brain/machine interfaces are inevitable. We are already seeing the first examples of such interfaces or their progenitors rather, in various forms of implanted electrodes for things like Parkinson's or epilepsy. Already today we have enabled humans that are quadriplegics to use raw human thought to manipulate their environment, such as bring a drink with a straw to their lips with a robotic arm. Now, how we would go about making the sum total of human knowledge available to my natural thinking process is a ""???"" at this time. But such innovations as Elon Musk's ""Neuralink"", and I am sure there are very smart humans working on it, make me believe that it will happen one day. So ok, it might be even like 100 years from today. That to me is wildly unlikely, but just for arguments sake. What happens when all humans have access to all knowledge as naturally as thinking about the song 'Mary had a little lamb'. Do you think that is never going to happen. I say it is going to happen well within 50 years.

What you are referring to with the term ""true AI"", I am assuming you mean to say AGI. There is most assuredly zero AGI today. It simply does not exist. But we are working on it. Very hard. The efforts of Deepmind's ""AlphaGoZero"" seem to me to be leading to the ability for narrow AI to phase change to general AI. And it's more than likely going to be phase change. It will happen much faster than the experts believe. Let me give another example. Think of how humans used to watch the birds fly and desire to do so as well. Well, in 1903 we succeeded in flying like the birds fly! But we did not stop there. We continued to improve on nature as fast as we could! After all how many sparrows do you see flying at Mach 9.6? (I won't count re-entry speeds.) I think the same thing is going to happen with the human mind and human consciousness. We will crack it. And quantum computers--which only sort of exist today, will be key I bet. There seems to be some science--perhaps fringe or even snake oil that states that quantum mechanics underly the consciousness of animals that have consciousness to include humans. But for the life of me I don't see how you can operate a quantum computer with so much water and at body temperature. Does physics even allow for such a thing? But I guess much smarter people than me are trying to find out. Here is a link to a complex PDF that might give more illumination on this phenomenon.

http://www-physics.lbl.gov/~stapp/BCC.pdf

You are in the vast minority. Pretty much every single scientist of any stripe states that the ""technological singularity"" will occur within 100 years at most. Me, I think it's going to be less than 20, judging by today's trends. Long before that (100 years I mean), AI, robotics and automation will fundamentally and permanently change human civilization. I think one of the reasons that governments and politics exist is because people are no damn good. We hate the ""other"" deeply, cheerfully and murderously. If we think we can get away with it we cheat, steal or kill. Interestingly today I am seeing a small, but clearly growing trend towards ridding ourselves of gender. That struck me as odd, but whatever. You can see that in the news right now. When I am online I am neither male nor female, I am simply intellect and words. But the behavior and pattern of those words will reveal my gender, if not my biological sexual assignment. And potentially, the depth of my ignorance lol! What I am trying to say is, I believe that we want to engineer a human intelligence 2.0. A side effect of such intelligence would quickly render many of societies institutions irrelevant or obsolete. Perhaps religion and spirituality. That, lamentably seems to be shrinking in importance as well. Is it all for the better? I'm doubtful, but I could be proven wrong.

The tricky part is trying to guess what is going to happen more than 50 years from now. For that I have to rely on how history seems to demonstrate a ""telescoping"" of technological innovations from the beginning of human history to today. Here again is a link to something concerning that I wrote quite a while back.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4k8q2b/is_the_singularity_a_religious_doctrine_23_apr_16/d3d0g44/

How could we have imagined the laser in the year 1900? Or AI. Or CRISPR-Cas9. Or nuclear fission/fusion. How much theoretical research or fundamental science existed for these things? Or something as fundamental as a transistor. I don't think there was even vacuum tubes in 1900, were there?

You state that we have picked all the low hanging fruit and we are getting decreasing returns for our efforts. I say no. The computer is going to change everything, perhaps all of existence and reality into information science. Today we talk of the impending exa-scale computer arriving about 2019-2022. Do you believe that we shall have peaked? No way. Humans won't be stopped. Rather than the returns decreasing they are increasing. Exponentially. I read that in the last two year we have produced more information and knowledge than all of human history up to the last 2 years! A good deal of this is vast data (big data) that has yet to be parsed for actionable knowledge. But already we can use ""big data"" plus unimaginably fast processing speeds to enable my IPhone to use ""Google Translate"" when my IPhone is not even connected to the internet! An astonishing display of narrow AI might. In the year 2015 I had no AI apps on my IPhone. 

I hafta go do another xray. brb.

Those are going to be mostly empty and broken most of the time. It's a noble concept, but it will never work in practice. Plus by the very nature of homelessness, a large percentage of homeless will never ever have access to this. Roughly 700 homeless human beings fall between the cracks of society and die of exposure in the USA each year. There is rarely any news, unlike a fellow who died in a dumpster the other day. He did make the news.

The ""street"" is a vicious, merciless, insane place. Life is harsh, brutish and short. The average age of death, 55. We need post-scarcity basics as soon as humanly possible.

You are going to live in your own worlds. You are not going to want to leave. This is the whole premise of ""Ready, Player One"". It (VR) will become far more important than reality as the tech ever improves. Sure a movies resolution leaves something to be desired, but I can watch a movie in 3D like I have glasses on in a theater, yet the image is still brilliantly lit. When the resolution improves, I prophesy the movie theater will go the way of the buggy whip. Not just because of VR, but also because of wall sized 8K screens that are paper thin and allow you glasses free 3D. Nothing is in a vacuum here. All technologies synergize each other.

[]izumi3682[S]
-2 points 6 months ago 




I have to add a comment here, because I have often discussed society and perspective for a long time. 

One of the perspectives I offer is that society is a far safer place today than it was in the 20th century when we used to kill each other off by the tens of millions at a time. But this new technology is like playing with fire. I don't mean the AI taking over. I mean the deleterious effects such technology is having on the psyche and personality of humanity. The increasing number of humans choosing to live alone, because they are self-sufficient now. The airport waiting area with every single person engrossed in their mobiles or laptops. Zero conversation. I've seen it. You can see it yourself in any restaurant. Humans are becoming self sufficient islands that care nothing for other humans. Yes, certainly families and good people abound. But those number are steadily dwindling. The triumph of the coarse ""troll and griefer"" personality online is yet another worrisome sign of the times. Don't believe me? Go take a look at a Washington Post comment section for any story it printed. And Fox has it's own detractors I'm sure. 

I see us turning into an increasingly fragmented, balkanized, self-centered, hedonistic and worst of all amoral society. I don't mean good vs. evil. I mean the inability to distinguish between good and evil. Adolescent sexting is just another bad sign.

One good light I have seen lately is the ""societal correction"" of exposing longterm predators and harrassers to light. I'm not sure if that is a flash in the pan fad or not yet. I see it difficult to sustain such a momentum, but we shall see I guess.

Was society better in say, 1955? ""Tremendously better yes!"" ""No!! It was tremendously worse!"" It depends on your socio-economic status, gender and race. The world continues on and we progress regardless. But how shall we solve our new-fangled ""modern problems"" now? Some of this seems a bit intractable to me. How do you promote 'values' if you have none yourself?

BTW the AI is going to take over.

Just out of curiosity I looked up on Google how many USA citizens are verified truck drivers. The number is 3.5 million.

It used to be that to evolve a farmer into a factory worker took about a generation. 25 years or so. The farmer did not become the factory worker, his son or grandson did.

We don't have the luxury of that kind of time any longer. This is not 25 years. It's more like five years. The article states that humans that are already ""techies"" in India's economy cannot handle such higher intellect vocations. So what chance does a trucker have? I don't think they can all become PSRs (personal service representatives) or coders. In addition the type of personality that fits the truck driving lifestyle is probably not ""attitudinally compatible"" with such employ. Plus I suspect PSR's and coders are going to be replaced fairly soon as well. 

I don't see a thing about UBI or post-scarcity things for free. The US government believes that retraining should work. But I don't think it will for the reasons stated above. 

Anyway it's a worrisome trend and I don't think I am being irrational or alarmist here. The USA government agrees.

These end of the year things just never fail to tickle me, because the implication is that this is all as good as it gets! My God, just imagine what the closing year of 2018 will trumpet. And then 2019. And then, seriously, it just gets too crazy to even be able to accurately predict any longer. 

In say, 1974 we had a pretty good idea of technology in the year 1979. It's not like that any more. The exponential upward curve is clearly evident now. More than anything, this could be heaven or hell for the bulk of human society. Hopefully heaven for my sake or I will be dead.

When considering the future of technology, particularly AI in its many potential forms just watch this 2013 demonstration of computer processing power and capacity. Pay no attention to the comparison between the human brain and the computer. The computer will rocket past the human brain effortlessly. Rather watch the power and speed of what is coming in the next couple of years. Pause the video at the year 2015--that's the year we all started to hear about the new CNN narrow AI. That's it. Just a shade over 2 years ago! And bear in mind that the video stops at the year 2025. The exponential improvement does not. And that is not even taking into account the distinct possibility of exploiting quantum computers to do classical binary computer problems and simulations. No we have not figured that out yet as of today, but we are a clever species and I'm sure we will sooner than later. Ergo the crazy talk of the impending ""technological singularity"" in a decade or so.

Just imagine! ""Crysis"" will at long last have the resolution and frame rate that it's creators intended...

Anyway, here is the video.

Boy, just wait until the VR addictions start pouring in. It will make the gaming disorder look like a common cold. I 'spect around 2019 the societal VR problems will ensue.

Yes, the technology will be that good. OMG! I can't wait!

We've Been Burying People All Wrong - Could eco-friendly funerals save the planet? by  MichaelRahmani in r/Futurology

You are exactly correct. But it is more about an American ""mindset"" that is very difficult to alter. I'm sure the parents know the ultimate truth, but want to do everything humanly, humanly possible to put that truth off. The American society and the American funeral industry has simply evolved along those lines. I read a book wayyy back around 1975 called ""The American Way of Death"". But while the funeral industry is partly to blame for exploiting grief for monetary gain, they are also simply going along with what has also evolved as the way that citizens in the USA have traditionalized death. That along with rigorous legal codes that are inconvenient and unpleasant to circumvent.

Well, that is what miss Caitlin says. And pragmatically it makes perfect sense. (I highly recommend you subscribe to her channel btw)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWo2-LHwGMM&amp;t=534s

Now let's let the rubber hit that road. Parents lose their 21 year old daughter in a motor vehicle accident. They are devastated and grief-stricken beyond words. They want their daughter preserved pristine forever. They want to think of her as asleep. They do not want to think of her face decomposing and rotting to a grinning skull. 

This I think is why the ""eco-funeral"" is such an uphill struggle in the USA anyways. And there is one more factor. We want to think we are doing our departed ""right"". So we pour our grief into expensive and as lavish as we can possibly afford, departure ceremonies and the best preservation money can buy. ""Sanitized"" and ""societally acceptable"".

Cremation is steadily gaining acceptance in the USA, but by current technology is not precisely ""green"". It is a big carbon ""footprint"".

I say that's defeatism. We already know for a fact a few people are fairly good at predicting the future. So why not make an organized effort to seek out more of these great people? Here's how: We create various categories for the competition, timespans. Predictions would be separated into 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 20-year categories. The contestants could even have their own ""weight classes"", based on, for example, education level. Of course the results would be available only after the said time has passed. But we would start seeing results as soon as a year from now, which isn't a long time at all. I suggest the contestants should be free to choose to predict whatever they want, but be encouraged to avoid predicting the obvious pointless stuff such as ""the sun will rise a year from now"" and challenge them to make predictions no one else probably sees coming, such as ""over 50% of vineyards in southern France will go bankrupt in 5 years due to 10-15 overlapping and interacting factors"". Selected panelists would then rate the predictions - the difficulty and the result. Over time, talented individuals would emerge from the competitions, especially if they win or rank high repeatedly. The individuals would probably gain global prestige and attention. They would be listened to. The main prizes from the competitions could be... as much as millions of dollars.

The downside might be that eventually when, for example, a professor with multiple academic degrees and prior wins makes a prediction, people might start taking action to prevent the said future, be it good or bad. Even so, these documented actions could and should be considered in the final result if the prediction ""fails"".

The upside would be we'd cull the low quality predictions that various individuals and journalists often make. The winners could even be regarded as the true world leaders, or advisors of the highest level.

Here are some examples:

The first example of this we saw with Chess. I can't find a source, but from what I remember one Chess player was boasting at first that computers couldn't beat a ""good"" chess player, then a ""master"", and finally ""the best"" of human chess players. Deep Blue defeated the best in '1996, and the average smartphone became unbeatable by 2008.

The second example is Go. Here is a reddit article from 2015 where the subject was debated: https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/2wgukb/why_do_people_say_that_computer_go_will_never/

- Most people posting, including some people actually working on Go AI, predicted it would take a ""very long time"". One person suggested 2070, another said ""many decades"".

- Just a few thought it might happen sooner, within 10 years. The most intelligent post in my opinion was from someone arguing that it was hard to tell just how close AI might be.

- Most people focused on computer power, human ability to program software, and the current top Go algorithms. One person argued that humans would always be able to at least ""contest"" AI in Go because of the sheer complexity. No one really discussed the possibility that an AI would be smart enough to teach itself a human style of playing.

- And no one suggested it would happen within a year, or that AI would be unbeatable within two years. If they had, I assume they would have been ridiculed extensively.

The third example is the AI developed to play Dota 2 in 2017. There are no discussions on how good it might be before that, most posts I saw were complaining about how bad the built in AI was.

But when the AI was introduced, we have first hand interviews  with professional players, all of whom seemed very optimistic about their chances, yet all got pretty much destroyed from the start. I read they developed strategies to counter the bot by exploiting its weaknesses, but this was a year ago, so we can assume by now it must have gotten a lot better.

The point being that humans, including the intelligent people who frequent Reddit, and the world experts in their field, so far have a horrible record of predicting the abilities of AI, or how fast it'll get good enough to make a difference.",178,314

Walmart moves into a small town and all the small stores are forced to shut down, They can't compete. At a point there are so few living wage jobs left nobody can even shop at Walmart. What happened (this has already happened)? Walmart sees no money and moves out, so Small Town is left with no services. The residents die or leave. But where will they go? How will they afford rent there? Oh well, we don't care. It's just business. So the peasants have no bread, let them eat cake. Let them die off.",21,0

A world of automated driving cars is a world run by cloud computing.

I'm sure most of us agree cloud is big business now and in the future. This is already a $247 billion market controlled by only three providers - Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. As a developer myself this made me start to believe it's a moral imperative society creates infrastructure that distributes cloud computing similar to p2p sharing.

While these companies have effectively created the cloud we know today, their success has also enabled them to build competitive moats around their positions. 

Large providers hyperscale data centers and other infrastructure projects effectively prevent competition by establishing a massive capex barrier for potential competitors. Over time, this has created an oligopoly of price, use, and data control.

Perhaps more importantly, many of the applications we use in our daily lives are run in the cloud with the data they generate stored in the cloud. Are we okay with three companies to effectively control that?

So what can we do?

I am currently working on a decentralized cloud infrastructure that will enable companies to share their extra processing power on a marketplace. Basically it will take your extra server capacity and 1. increase its efficiency by using it rather than just sit there, 2. add tons of available compute power to the world, 3. match this excess with end-users on an open bid market (likely driving price way down). I've written [an academic paper](https://docsend.com/view/fygzt3g) on the alternative I'm building.

I would love to hear people's impressions on the importance of decentralizing the cloud for society?",23,35

Consider the following thoughts/observations:

- Probably the most important realization: despite having infinitely more wealth, there is no evidence that people of today are any happier than the people of 100 years ago. Or 500 years ago. Or 10,000 years ago. Despite this, we all scream in cheer every time GDP grows .1% faster than the year before.

- 40% of the US is obese. [1 in 8 people over the age of 12 have taken an antidepressant within the last year.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/antidepressant-use-soars-65-percent-in-15-years/) Despite enormous growth in wealth and technology, the poverty rate today is almost exactly what it was 50 years ago.

- Hang with me on this one and resist the urge to call me a sexist. The pursuit of wealth/GDP has normalized the idea of women in the work force. ""Women belong in the home"" is now considered a demeaning insult instead of the praiseworthy observation that women are innately better than men when it comes to nurturing children/those in need (look at the wild overrepresentation of women in fields like nursing and elementary school teaching). We also apparently lost the notion that *raising children is one of the most important jobs in society.* The aforementioned 1 in 8 people on antidepressants is composed mainly of women - 16.5% of whom use antidepressants - compared to the 9% usage rate in men. So we have to ask ourselves: has all this ""progress"" actually helped women? Or are we hurting them? I'm not saying we should codify into law some kind of female employment ban or otherwise command people what to do, but maybe we should reconsider the social pressure we put on all people these days to go to college, climb the corporate ladder, and so on.

- I'm a big hiker, and I have noticed that every single ash tree in my area is dead because of the emerald ash borer, an invasive species brought here by trade from Asia. We have clear cut millions of acres of forest so that we could accommodate ever more agriculture, shopping malls, cities, and so on. We went from durable goods to single-use disposables that take a major toll on the environment, because plastic bottles and bags are cheap and cheap means more GDP. Was it worthwhile to trade our environment for cheap foreign goods, McDonalds, and plastic grocery bags?

- Hang with me on this one and resist the urge to call me a racist. The need for cheaper labor brought millions of immigrants here. I'm not going to comment on the goodness or badness of this practice, because my opinion does not change the fact that it led to a great deal of frustration in the American people. Enough frustration for them to vote in the most hostile president of the last century when it comes to trade and immigration. The pivotal issue of this last election was not economics. It was culture, and it brought out a lot of people who feel that the American culture has been diluted or damaged.

So in summary, the pursuit of wealth - something that is demonstrably not making us any happier - has been placed above things that do seem to make us very happy: family, environment, and culture.

What are we supposed to be gaining that makes all of this worth it?",29,18

Babylon finds the information on Newb highly relevant as well as upto date and he begins trading immediately.

What does everyone on here think about the issue of overpopulation and it's effects in the future in context of this video and website? And do you think we will face overcrowding and lack of food/water in the future if we do not address it? and lastly do you think it will be addressed soon enough?

My thoughts are in line with the arguments made by The Borgen Project. I believe that we need to be improving these countries overall health and well-being to create a better future for the world as a whole. Part of my motivation for doing this is to get more people to care about this issue. It is easy to forget about overcrowding in the U.S. unless you live in Manhattan or L.A. But this issue will effect us all in the future if we don't start to care soon.

What surprised me is that we know how to stop overpopulation and we have the resources to do it but we still pretend it is some kind of science fiction. ",4,4

Tldr at bottom. 


Yes, photosynthetic blooms remove and store mass amounts of CO2.

And yes. Adding iron (or other beneficial chemicals i.e. phosphates) to the water chemistry instigates massive blooms. 

These are proven scientific facts. However environments are diverse and EXTREMELY INTERWOVEN AND COMPLICATED. THERE WILL BE NEGATIVE EFFECTS TO TRYING TO FIX THE OCEANS THIS WAY. How you may ask?  

Reason 1:      Benthic life(bottom dwellers), an incredibly diverse and necessary part of marine ecosystems, can be obliterated by these blooms. Theyre called dead zones. As the photosynthetic organisms die (because they quickly deplete their resources ex. CO2) they and their decomposable bodies drift to the bottom. Decomposition is an anoxic process and removes O2, and some massive decomposition can remove basically all the usable O2. So every O2 needing thing suffocates. But the photosynthetic organisms wont die!  Thats because they are all at or near the surface. The photic zone keeps them all at the surface and is an extremely small portion of the ocean. If it lives at the bottom, it will die. And everything that feeds on, is dependent on, or in some way is related to the benthic life, will be horribly affected if not killed. Look up dead zones, there is plenty of them and their numbers are growing do to eutrophication. 



But the open ocean floors are lifeless and full of area that can easily take O2 depletion without affecting life! Thats why theyre called the abyssal plains!

Reason 2: The open ocean doesnt have the organisms in place to use these nutrients. It is true the abyssal plains are the best place to store trillions of tons of CO2, but guess what is the majority of the water chemistry above the abyssal plains? Lifeless water. 
You need photosynthetic organisms in some small supply to absorb, reproduce, and spread to form blooms. They are not in the mass amounts of open ocean, so the nutrients out there will go unused and sink. So you would need to seed the area of target spots that have these organisms on an INDUSTRIAL AND GLOBAL SCALE TO THE COST OF BILLIONS AND GLOBAL COOPERATION. You know what we all suck at right now? Working together and footing the enormous bill of such endeavors. 

Also, the few and far between organisms that do live amongst the abyssal plains will die {see reason 1} which will still affect the food web. How? Well the open ocean is the least known about, so playing with it is going to have unforeseen consequences. Major? Minor? Nobody is really sure, so theres that. And we would be condemning an untold number of undiscovered organism as well. 

Reason 3:  You know what is also photosynthetic and can be a major part, if not all, of these blooms? Algae. Do you know what can be incredibly toxic to both humans and fish, especially in large amounts? Algae. How do you control these blooms without adding toxic chemicals to the food chain and water column? You dont. Not in open ocean where even the smallest single cellular organism can contaminate the bloom. 


Adding essential chemicals to the ocean and instigating blooms is a great idea, IN THEORY. But if this idea has been around since the 70s, why hasnt it been utilized? Because it would take very advanced science in tracking and monitoring. It would take many man hours from hundreds, if not thousands, of people to make it work. It would require global cooperation, and economic incentive. And still there would be costs, some of which will be unforeseen. And that will just be to solve reasons 1&amp;2.  

tldr, adding iron to the oceans is great, but the oceans environments are way too complex for a single fix all solution to be real. If it sounds to good to be true, it isnt. ",3,3

When you alternate this back to the one you started with with a hertz of 900 to 1100 hertz it starts teleporting. Calculate the distance this signal originally reaches to be at least 6 times over the speed of light if it were to be teleported/instantly there and one will discover the signal to be gone/send back trough time when alternated at the given hertz.. Tada

To further explain it this means sending two signals (like a radio message), one breaking into one bandwith/frequency and one into the original one you started of on. Don't send them constantly but alternate them at around 1100 hertz. Do make sure when you calculate the reach of the signal to be at least 6 times faster then the speed of light if one presumes the signal to be there instantly so the signal goes back in time and isn't stuck in time.

To send messages to the future you have to send something physical there (like a camera) and it can communicate back this way 
Do mind if you send it you would only see your own future not taking in to account those of all the rest... 

I'd love to answer anything that seems to defy this or other questions.  (if the Dutch government isn't blocking this completely) ",5,1

Really, with all the talks of 'flying uber taxis' or this 'avoid traffic by flying' just sounds like a rich person's dream. They just aren't affordable at the moment, and I haven't heard of any rich person actually buying one. I don't think current models are reliable enough. 

I feel like everyone who wants this has this fantasy idea that it'll look like the flying hovercars of Corouscant from star wars, orderly hover cars traveling in the sky. But it'll probably be more like a helicopter where you gotta keep check with air traffic control to make sure you don't die from a birdstrike, hitting another vehicle or tree or tall poles just to get to work.

The company profiles the potential customer, notes that they are very wealthy and determines that they will pay double the normal price. And that is what they get charged. It's happening already, there are companies which offer the profiling algorithms to other companies.

I think this will inexorably lead to the value of money being dependent on who holds the money. I think it will eventually lead to a state where someone who earns $1,000,000 will have the same buying power as someone who earns $20,000.

It gets around many of the problems of 'generation ships', which have always seemed to me to be unworkable. 

But there are issues. From wiki:

&gt;Ethical: In addition to the question of whether it is technically feasible to raise children without human contact, there is the further question of whether this is morally permissible. It is found to be unethical to deliberately create children that will grow up without parents, yet embryo space colonization requires this. Controversial value judgments would also need to be made about whose DNA should be the basis of the space colony. Should they be selected by some metric of merit, or randomly from the general population? Either choice presents ethical problems. Should the parenting AI firmly steer the children to maximize the chances of the colony's success, or should it accept the risk of allowing them significant autonomy? Which languages and cultural values should be transmitted to the colonists? Should they be raised according to some value system that exists on Earth, or create one that is somehow optimized? Are there truths that should be kept from them? The possibility of a new civilization that starts without a cultural legacy might appeal to cults that want their values to become a norm for an entire society. Is it permissible to allow them have their own embryo colonies, where the AI indoctrinates the colonists only in the cult's value system? The difficulty of answering these and other ethical questions may become a non-technological obstacle to embryo space colonization.

The more I think about this the more I'm intrigued. All kinds of problems appear; for example, much of our art and literature refers to societal problems like racism; if we are planning such a project, do we include a library? Do *Uncle Tom's Cabin* and *Huck Finn* carry our racism with them? 

Suppose some large entity were trying to do this today, Google-Tesla or something. 

* Who would they consult with to decide how these *tabula rasa* kids would be raised and educated? 

* What would those people say? 

* What general ethics and education and problem resolution methods and political systems and rules for use of violence and sex and morality would we, ideally, export to a brand new society on a brand new world?",3,4

I wonder what technologies are needed for successful AR glasses able to penetrate the market and well, what we need are normal glasses with small ""cages"" at the end of the temples to provide energy and computing to each holographic lenses (the good ones, not the ones that reflects something displayed on a screen at 90, OMG). And, on the other side, a good GPU/HPU inside a separated smartphone able to wirelessly transmit data to the glasses. So, let's go:

*******

1 Battery Density and Wireless Charging: 

We need very small, dense and light batteries for each (R-L) hololens that must be in the ""cages"" at the end of the temples. These cages must gently ""hug"" the back of the skull so it can provide extra grip and be hidden by hair (women, cute men and metalheads will like that). There will be two batteries and no conection between the two hemispheres of the glasses so the Bridge can be thin and free from cables (and templates can be thin with not too much cables). The idea is that each hololens (forget MS glasses, let's use this word for each lens) is independent with its own ""hemisphere"". Of course, we will need a wireless charging station (already a thing).

I'm not sure how we are doing in terms of battery density, this is why I'm doing this post, mostly to ask you for this kind of things so I can make a good prediction (applying Kurzweil Law). Any help is needed here ;)

*******

2 Holographic Processing:

We will need some chips to run holograms on the hololenses (again, don't think about MS product please) but, where's the best place to put them? I think it will be a smarphone. Considering we need glasses that mimic normal ones, everything we can take out, we must do (on the other hand, I think people will like to keep smartphones for some time). So, we will have to put a strong GPU/HPU (Holographic Processing Unit: more fancy names from MS) inside our smartphones, at least before strong 5G cloud computing is a thing (I'll talk later about this). Again, I ask your help to know how much GPU these two hololenses need and if it's possible to fit in a modern smartphone. Thanks in advance.

*****

3 Data Transmission:

On this matter, I have more doubts about the future. First, I guess we will need some short of advanced Bluetooth (or similar, I'm not an expert) to transmit data between glasses and smartphone but... What if in the next 10 years we achieve some short of 5G or 6G able to transmit very low latency and high bandwith to the glasses so all the computing can be done in servers? Cloud computing could be a very interesting thing once we have this kind of tech. By now, I guess there will be no problem with current tech to transmit data from smartphone BUT, I've seen Magic Leap glasses attached with a cable to a huge processing unit so maybe we don't have the tech right now. I wonder how Kurzweil Law applies here... Added to the transmision hardware, I guess we will have to add some chips inside the ""end of the temples thin and hugging cages"" to process the signal but, again, I'm not an expert.

*****

That's all I can imagine. AR glasses almost as thin and light as normal ones are possible but the question is about Computing Power and Energy densities/miniaturization. Kurzweil Law is good at predicting this kind of things, but there is a challenge to know exactly what we need since all the information is only in hands of AR experts and/or companies. Thanks for reading this ""long question"", forget my poor english, and let's try to predict the future of AR market!",9,8

This man, **Nikola Tesla** made the most freaking astonishing prediction about the cell phones in 1926. Heres what he said 92 years ago :

&gt;""When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole.  
We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance.  
Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will fit in our pockets.

\-Nikola Tesla, 1926. The man who lived the future.

My brain has been hacked. Google, Facebook, YT, Reddit and every social app dominates our attention thanks to advanced AI algorithms able to create a very strong addiction. But, why would they do that? They want to hack your brain's reward system with notifications, AI-driven recommendations and free ""useful"" services to:

1 Gather user data and sell it to other companies (tiny % of their profit).

2 Get your constant attention to, due to high traffic, make profit with ads and other marketting strategies (most part of their profit).

3 Thanks to Big Data and our data tracking, create new products and services able to keep our pockets empty and our behavior controlled (impossible to stablish % of their profit).

4 Control the info we can access so they can destroy competitors or elimiante freedom of speech about their products.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

END RESULTS ARE:

1 ADHD in adult and young population.

2 High anxiety and depression levels due to the destruction of our ability to focus on things and enjoying them by entering the flow state. 

3 Very concentrated corporations (BigTech) able to hack entire populations to manipulate democracy and keep legislative, executive and justice control in order to maximize profit and some individuals power.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

SOLUTIONS ARE:

1 The only social you should install is the one that ONLY allows you to make internet voice/cam calls. Everything else is a notifications trap.

2 Reddit-like sites are allowed but you should only use it for very specific present goals (one post at a time, never go to multi-reddits page).

3 Never open more than 2 tabs on web browsers and turn on the option that doesn't save tabs (each time you open your web browser, your must only see one blank tab).

4 Ignore every news/videos/things feeds since you will be addicted to F5, with consequent brain damage.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

RESULTS WILL BE:

1 Your anxiety and depression will be reduced (especially if you're addicted to social comparation like FB or Instagram).

2 You will let your brain recover basic memory and concentration functions (so, learning one).

3 Instead of losing yourself in the internet, you will be single-goal driven at a time, making your brain able to set current goals just by ""relaxing"" (this is amazing, I have now a new hobby thanks to closing all Chrome tabs and just sit and be quiet).

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I know there are a lot of good things that Silicon Valley has created. But it's now out of hand. Big Social Tech companies like G, FB etc. are actually big marketting agencies with very powerful tools to hack our brains (mostly machine learning algorithms or AI), fuck our minds and maximize profit: and even manipulate elections. The good services and products they gave us are good, but at what price? Judge it by yourself. These are new techs we haven't already understood.

Good Night and Good Luck.",10,0

This has been a pretty interesting life for me over the last couple of years. This had already been a pretty interesting life previously, but this is not about that. This is about the life that I have lived over the last two years. This is a life that has led me to the deepest recesses of my mind in order to understand that God is, in fact, present everywhere. He is even there in our subconscious mind. He created us after all. I am a man of God, and I am also someone who is a Christian. I am not a normal guy. I am not a normal Christian. But, I am a real to life, from the inside out, Christian man who is really well versed in the things I am going to detail in this publication. This is in addition to the serious connection I have with God as a result of my ability in being coached along with the help of my peers in the exercise to show me how to truly take my thoughts captive to the obedience of Christ.

I am a guy who was selected by a computer program that is running constantly in a super computer in another state. This selection process gave way to something that would allow me to be a man that can talk to this computer along with other people with my brain waves alone. There is no handheld device, nor implant in my body to make this possible. I do not have verbal conversations with these voices unless I am literally allowing myself to mouth the words spoken to me so that I can consciously be more aware of these words. Or, on the contrary, I mouth these words if I am vocalizing my thoughts themselves. This was a bit strange for me at first because I was thinking that I was a crazy person that just heard voices. I typically thought that a person was actually talking to me the whole time when, in fact, it was actually an AI dealing with me 99% of the time. This is the most mind blowing part about this. The Turing Test was not a question for these people. There is literally no way to discern the voice of an actual human being or a computer due to the acuity of the software that is used in this process.

There was a time when I began to distinguish when an actual person was actually talking to me versus the computer talking to me. This was something that was a learned skill for myself due to the ability that I have in learning things without any sort of teacher showing me a clear lesson plan; this is called autodidactic learning. Enough about my abilities, this is a broad overview of what is possible when humans and machines work together in order to make one available to the world in the biggest way possible. There is this cloud of deception that the mind allows to shroud the conscious decision making  one undergoes in performing the right thing when we have years and years of belief systems and misconstrued emotional discourse turned to defense mechanisms.

This is a weird thing to say, but I had been living a life that has been a little less than acceptable to most folks over the last 15 years prior to my overwhelming experience with this technology on January 18, 2017. I was a guy who was a criminal and was doing things to my body that would most certainly shorten my lifespan from the possible outcome afforded me had I been living a healthy life away from things like drugs and alcohol .

This is going to be a little difficult to comprehend as a normal person who has only ever experienced the only voice in your head that you have ever known; your subconscious mind. 

RNM is probably a foreign acronym to many. To some people, it is a sign of the times and an alarming term that is used by certain conspiracy theorists to alarm people to the amount of surveillance that we are actually experiencing in the United States of America. RNM means one thing to me. A google search reveals something different so that this would be a term not discovered by many until the time was right for the world to know. RNM stands for Remote Neural Monitoring. This means one thing and one thing only. This means that our thoughts have been monitored by an agency in the United States since before my birth in late 1980s. 

This sounds pretty crazy for the typical American or even an externally governed citizen. This sounds like science fiction to me, I am sure it does to you as well. Let me reiterate one thing to you people saying that this guy is just some crazy guy in his basement who doesnt even believe in God. There is the expected This guy is just some sad guy living in his mother and fathers basement with too much time on his hands! and the all too scary Commit this man to a mental institution!. This is funny to me. This is funny to me because I am a man who is 31 who looks like a model, has an IQ of 168, and is better looking than most of the people I know. This is a thing I am not going to flaunt to you. I also love to do yoga, I love to meditate, I love to lift weights, I love to chat politics, and I am a man who will talk to you about spirituality and God until we are ready to lay hands on each other and pray to the God we are all familiar with because he is God and will always be God. I am a man writing this because I know what love is and I love you no matter who you are despite what you have done and not done.

I will flaunt, however, the fact that I am a very social person who has a girlfriend. I am also going to tell you that she is unaware of this ability I have. My family does not know about this because this is a trial period in my life of living like a man of the next century. I will get into this next century thing in a later section. I am a guy who has a job that I work very hard at. I am able to do my job with increasing efficacy due to the fact that I am so wired into this program that is running for each and every one of us. This has been going on since the late 1970s. You do the math. More about this program later when I am writing a book about this rather than a treatise on my computer while I am listening to some Christian music. This is how I am. This is who I was meant to be. I like all music. I like rock, EDM, hip hop, gangster rap, classical, blue, jazz you name it. I love all music and all people the same.

This is an exercise performed by the National Security Agency to show people what their thought life is like in real time before their own mental processor, called the brain, has a chance to process these things in the conscious mind. What I mean by this is that EBL (Electronic Brain Link) is allowing for an ultra high speed transmission of our own thought life that is not typically possible without this assistance from a machine. This looks like my thoughts being expressed to me consciously from my subconscious mind before I even realize I have these thoughts in the first place,

What does this look like? Does this look like some mentalist sitting in a room with his fingers on his temples like some sort of telepath? No. Initially, this looks like a man or woman sitting there contemplating things in deep thought without expressing anything other than the typical responses one might have in a conversation with another person by means of non verbal communication or body language. Some people that have experienced this might think that this is some sort of freak out incident and they literally lose their mind. This is not for the faint of heart, and this is not for the typical person with weak impulse control who is going to go for a gun and shoot themselves.

This is the story of a man of God who was doing drugs who was called by God to do so many things that he was never going to do had he not taken the time to listen to the voice of God instead of the voice in his head that was telling him that he needed to feel a certain way in order to have a good day and to communicate with the people around him in a friendly manner.

I am typing more of this right now as you read this. I am going public with this for the first time since I have experienced this back in 2017. This is not just some guy telling you a story. This is not something to think on. This is TRUTH. Good luck interpreting the rest of what I have to say without asking yourself if this is true or not. Guess what? You know that it is true because that is how this program works. The divine truth of God is going to be apparent to those that look in awe of his presence in the words of a man who is typing this on a computer after an incubation period of finding myself as a man who is ready to go public about this in order to tell people how they can literally supercharge your own subconscious mind to the point of doing things that you never thought possible in your own capacity.

Okay thats all for now. Tell me what you think and we will tell you what you think right back.

The key to doing this is increasing your norepinephrinergenic activity. There is a chemical that does this in such a way that it increases your short term memory to such an extreme extent that you are able to simultaneously connect to so much at once that you gain the ability to understand and cognitively process concepts that the homosapien brain doesn't have the capability to understand, but that are so advanced that it requires being a member of the species that comes after homosapien in order to grasp these concepts, and to other homosapiens they sound similar to psychosis just because they are not physically capable of interacting with the information as required. This chemical mimics the role norepinephrine takes in the function of memory so well that it seemingly unlocks all the secret knowledge of existence. It is called Desoxypipradrol. However an accurate metaphor would be that the experience is like a legless man being given a functioning pair of legs for the first time and immediately standing and attempting to walk. What is the common occurrence is the subject consults others for their opinions, or others, who lack the physical ability to comprehend what is actually occurring, force their opinions on the subject, and the subject is convinced he or she is experiencing psychosis, when the subject is not experiencing a reduction in function, but rather such an extreme increase in function that it is similar to the metaphor of a legless man suddenly being given a functioning pair of legs and trying right away to walk. Then the subject discontinues use of desoxypipradrol, and perpetuates its stigma. However if its use is not discontinued, and instead the subject analyzes the specifics of precisely how it is affecting the cognitive process using the least arbitrary and therefore most efficient logic and reason. Then the subject quickly becomes aware of the advantages, and becomes exponential orders of magnitude more advanced, comprehending concepts that without something like desoxypipradrol it would take another 10,000 years for people to even begin to grasp.

Music has had a major influence on our lives and it has been constantly evolving to this day. The technology we use to create music is changing, but the main principles stay the same.

[Akai MPC used as a percussion instrument](https://i.redd.it/ewy675k00pc11.gif)

So, what role will music play in humans' lives 100 years from now? Will we figure out how to use it for healing purposes, will we be able to manipulate sound in a more controlled manner, will people focus more on music in the future, or will they slowly lose interest? 

[Levitating water droplets with sound](https://i.redd.it/ekaigdt90pc11.gif)

Sound is an under-unexplored territory, one that needs more attention, but is not getting it because the benefits we could get from manipulating sound are not immediately apparent. But scientist used sound to levitate matter, put out fires, and many other useful things. [Cymatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymatics), e.g. shows us how certain frequencies have different, but seemingly natural qualities which we don't know much about. 

[Cymatics](https://i.redd.it/rft0zw9r0pc11.gif)

Will more people get into creating music and will we see more talented musicians using new tech? Will we turn to other interests when it comes to sounds, or will we neglect it altogether as an interesting field of study, since it does not bring immediate functionalities that can be used in today's economy? 

[DE-SPA-SHITO](https://i.redd.it/8ocq08p11pc11.gif)

Personally, I think that music is something that we will continue to do in the far future, as a way of achieving universal communication and understanding, and for fun, of course. But, since capitalism is concerned with selective innovation and its focus is on maintaining consumerism, will we neglect sound and music altogether? I don't know many people that really listen to music. They just ""have it on"" ""in the background"". 

[Japanese creation - robot playing a violin](https://i.redd.it/zv7giy1d1pc11.gif)

I am not making a clear distinction here between sound and music, because the line between them is becoming increasingly blurred. I am interested in hearing some of your guys' predictions regarding the future of sound and music and their probable evolution and applications. Any thoughts or insightful content on the topic?

If nothing is impossible and can't exsist, then it is impossible to experience nothing or nothingness, so the only alternative is experiencing at least something infinitely, or infinite consciousness, death like black or like you just dont exsist at all can not ever exsist because that would be ""nothing"" which can not exsist. Really there are parts like before we were born which was actually part of infinite consciousness but its like when you wake up from a dream you can't remember but you know you were dreaming.

Of course there are ""black swan"" events like the rise of Hitler and 9/11 that make predicting the future accurately difficult (and impossible in some respects), but here are some of my guesses as to what the next 80 years will be like.

First of all, things that probably won't happen. 

I think there won't be a Moon base, and certainly not a Mars base or interstellar mission by 2100. It's extremely expensive to launch stuff into space, let alone build things on other planets. It might be more or less impossible to do no matter how good our technology gets.

At best we'll get suborbital space flights affordable for an upper middle class person to do once in their lifetime, and another series of Moon missions. Possibly a manned mission to Mars in the 2080s or 2090s, but I'm guessing that won't happen until the 22nd century. 

We're not going to have Matrix-like technology where you can plug your mind into virtual worlds. Brains don't work like that. At best, we might combine the resources of holodeck-like rooms with designer drugs to create a form of psychotourism, which in itself would be very fascinating.

We're not going to cure cancer, because it's a set of hundreds of different diseases. We'll continue to get better at preventing, detecting, and treating cancer, but there's never going to be a magic bullet and most likely there unfortunately still be rare cancers we can't fight for a long time.

We won't achieve immortality but we may be able to stave off aging to some degree. New technology might allow people today, or at least our children/grandchildren to live a few extra decades, and stay physically youthful for longer. However it's not a guarantee by any means as the aging process is extremely complicated.

AI and robots are not going to take all our jobs. The vast majority of jobs are much better done by people than machines. Massage therapists, doctors, accountants, shelf stockers, waitresses, actors, musicians and lawyers might be assisted with AI algorithms in the future, but they're not going to be replaced. Some services require the human touch and others require manual labor that machines can't replicate well and most likely won't be able to for a long time.

What do I think will happen? 

Although AI won't take our jobs, it will be utilized for humanity's benefit, both at work and home. People will entrust certain decisions to AI apps on their phones, AI will be used to solve complex problems in math and science, it will be a boon for medicine, it will be used to help solve crime, and many other uses.

The Internet and media will change. Social media will most likely shift away from the public Facebook/Instagram style format that's popular now and move to more private services like Snapchat. This is already happening with the post-millennial generation. 

Over the air radio and TV will eventually die out completely, or become relegated to a small community of enthusiasts, though it may take a surprisingly long time. The Internet and phone system will be the only form of electronic media.

It will probably become much harder to use the Internet anonymously, and some countries might even require people to use their real names for all their online accounts. Even Reddit now requires an email address to make an account, and many sites require you to use Facebook to log in. Due to fear of crime and cyberbullying and public desire to make such baddies accountable it's likely that Internet anonymity will become a thing of the past.

""Social credit"" systems will become more common. These will most likely be based on the good and bad deeds a person does (such as volunteering, criminal activity, donations to charity) as well as their consumption habits (buying cigarettes might lower your social credit score, for example) and other factors like their financial credit, what websites they visit and what other people say about them online. Like in the Black Mirror episode ""Nosedive"" I could easily see there being communities segregated based upon a person's social credit score in the future. This may sound draconian and creepy, but the generation now that's growing up with going through security in order to attend a concert will likely value security over privacy, and be glad that there is a system you can ""vet"" a person's character by.

Global warming, ocean acidification and plastic pollution will become much more blatantly obvious problems, and there will be many more strict environmental laws than there are now. We're already seeing the beginning of it with many communities banning plastic bags, and now California banning plastic straws. I foresee sky high taxes on gasoline, meat, and other products with large environmental footprints. 

Speaking of a gas tax, I think due to restrictions on fossil fuel use travel will be much more expensive in the future. Some people will own electric cars, but it's likely they won't ever be cheap, and they aren't an environmental ""free lunch"" either with their toxic batteries and may also be taxed. A transatlantic airplane ticket might cost $10,000 or more in 2060 because of carbon taxes. Immigration and foreign travel will decline. People will move from suburbs to cities, and there will be more focus on creating walkable neighborhoods.

Our main fears will change. No longer will Islamic terrorism be the main threat in people's mind. I predict a ""quiet revolution"" in the Islamic world, with devotion to the religion declining within the next generation and belief itself falling in the generation after that. Al-Qaeda is dead and ISIS are dying; I think Muslims are embarassed of their image and this kind of terrorism will decline in the very near future.

What will take its place? Most likely, far right terrorists who use violence to fight against social justice movements (we've already had a couple of well-known hate murders by alt right men), and also far left Malthusian eco-terrorists who use violence to fight against overpopulation (even though birth rates will most likely still be plummeting in the future, there will still be lots of people who think the problem is too many people as the world population will still be growing linearly). Most people will condemn both kinds of terrorists, but a shockingly large minority of people will quietly agree with one side or the other, and the left and right will argue about whether the bigoted right wing terrorists or the misanthropic left wing terrorists pose a greater threat.

The good news is crime and violence will continue to decline, as we'll have better ways to prevent and detect criminal behavior thanks to AI (and yes, the erosion of our privacy) and better psychological knowledge.

Another change I see is a large anti-meat movement. I think we're going to see a huge surge in vegetarians and vegans, predominately among women at first.",14,0

Recently, Samsung has come up with an unbreakable, flexible, sturdy and lightweight Plastic cover, that is supposed to replace the existing glass cover to the smartphone display. 

This Plastic cover has just been certified by UL for passing swiftly through these rigorous tests:

1. Resisted 26 successive falls from a height of 1.2 meters (approx 4 feet),
2. Stood strong to a fall from 1.8 meters (6 feet) and
3. Easily sustained at extreme temperatures with maximum of 71 degree celsius and a minimum of -32 degree celsius.

This robust technology is supposed to primarily come with  smartphones and later used in portable gaming consoles, electronic devices, military, e learning tablets and in car displays.

Till now, there is no idea on its exact launch date, but we can expect this coming sooner. So, get ready to stay relaxed and assured of no damage to screen whenever your phone falls.",1,3
