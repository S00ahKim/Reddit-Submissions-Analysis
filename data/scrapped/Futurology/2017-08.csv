And ML is also about being the one who can acquire the most data. Say a company needs some sort of natural language processing. They're not going to pay their own employees to build a natural language processing system. They're going to go with an API offered by a company that specializes in natural language processing for that problem domain 

So it seems like there won't be ML divisions inside of regular companies. It seems like an ML division would only happen in a bigger company. 

Does that seem right to you?",3,1

I ask because I found out about peer to peer technology (ie; bitcoin) a year after it had launched. A year might seem like a long time to a lot of people. It's been out for almost 10 years now and most people still haven't heard about it. I'm not here to promote bitcoin, just using it as my example. I don't want this post to be about love/hate bitcoin.


So, I'm wondering what disruptive technologies that you are aware of excite you. And can't wait to get to the next level of main stream adoption?",19,11

[Breaking News](http://www.radiolab.org/story/breaking-news/)

This episode is about new technologies which enable to people to effectively put words into the mouths of others using voice and video manipulation. These technologies are reaching the point where they are increasingly becoming available to lay-people.

http://futureoffakenews.com/

Personally I think the video quality isn't great and you can see that his mouth is being manipulated but the audio is pretty good.

One concern about these technologies is not only that they will allow for the creation of fake news but that they will allow politicians to deny things that they have been caught saying. Consider Trump's ""Grab them by the pussy"" moment - if he had known that this technology was available, he could easily have claimed that this was ""fake news"" and that his dialogue had been manipulated.

I think this puts us on a trajectory where people with vested interests will find it to be easier than ever to manipulate others and people in general will increasingly lose trust in the media and the things they see and hear.",0,3

The Old Money in London did its utmost to crush New blood and new revolution, and the Bourbons and the old order were back in business by 1814.

(And, if the Count of Chambord, grandnephew of Louis XVI and the last legitimate Bourbon heir, had children we would still have a Bourbon King at Paris.)

All the French noble titles are still here, complete with the wealth and power. Ditto to German, Austrian, etc noble titles.

The Great Gatxby is a tale of Old Money crushing new blood as well. 

We don't hear about Old Money too much. Paul Fussell call them the ""Top Out of Sight"". We don't really get to know anything about them, although some of them like to use instagram to boast their status, without their names of course.

https://lionoftheblogosphere.wordpress.com/2017/06/25/a-rare-inside-look-at-the-toos/

Actually, that blog post above tells about a member of old money working in a tech startup, and being a director at the age of 24.

As the above post shows, the Old Money is not adverse getting into tech, since that boasts its status.

And, they own stocks of the most successful tech companies, unlike most proles. If that makes them money, who cares.

Like Vanderbilt's granddaughter marrying an English Duke, it is likely that contrary to some people's thought that the Future Drivers will fight against Old Money, the latter will absorb the Future Drivers and get even stronger.

After all, the Old Money has hundreds of track records. They survived wars, social upheavals, revolutions, etc.

Why?

Short Answer - Land Ownership.

As long as they own the land, they would always be coming out at the top. Owning land means owning the local government, and retaining support in the local to remain important to rise again even if one falls from grace.

Ordinary people think people like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos are the richest. That's because the Old Money is quite good hiding their assets, but even if the OM does not seem to be too rich, OM does have more influence by all the old network they built over many, many years.

Today's winners will be the future's winner as well, as always.",53,25

Not everyone can do everything listed here, and depending on your lifestyle you may have something you do that has even bigger emissions which aren't mentioned here.

This list has been [approved by climate change researcher](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6isyum/american_geophysical_union_ama_hi_reddit_im_piers/dj9xp80/?context=3) during one of the AMAs.


FOOD:

* **eat less meat, dairy, and other animal products (none is the best)**
* eat less industrially produced food, less processed food, less packaged foods (for example, bottled water uses energy to be packaged and refrigerated, and produces plastic waste so drink tap water)
* eat proper portion sizes
* remember that food which pets consume also has impact on the environment, so adopt dont shop to discourage their production, and try to choose pets that are herbivores
* avoid palm oil (aside from food it is also a common ingredient in other products, for example soaps and washing powders)

ENERGY:

* **drive less, cycle and walk as much as possible, avoid flying**
* use efficient lightbulbs, turn the lights off when you're not in the room
* Unplug devices when not in use (to simplify this you can get remote controlled electrical outlet, some are very cheap)
* insulate your home, don't warm or cool the rooms more than necessary, adjust your clothes first
* criticize and complain about large buildings like malls that warm up or cool down the air too much
* forgo living in a single-family house in favor of apartment-style housing (that way more people get to live on less land, sharing walls is more energy efficient, commutes are shorter etc.)
* buy solar panels
* don't be afraid of nuclear power plants

WASTE

* avoid items with too much packaging
* don't buy more than you need (but for items that you are certain you will use and can last for a while buy in bulk to avoid extra packaging)
* buy recyclable items (q-tips with paper stick instead of plastic, bamboo toothbrushes, etc.)
* recycle
* avoid single-use items (don't use disposable cutlery and cups, disposable wipes, disposable plastic bags, if you are menstruating use menstrual cups instead of pads or tampons, etc.)
* contact manufacturers and complain of excess packaging

WATER:

* don't flush the toilet when not necessary
* don't throw anything in the toilet except bodily fluids and solids, and toilet paper (no cotton pads, no q-tips, no floss, no tampons, no cigarette butts, no paper towels...)
* turn the water off while you are lathering, brushing your teeth etc.
* cut down on showers and baths
* don't water your lawns, try to plant local plants that don't need watering 

ACTIVISM:

* Encourage others to adopt sustainable lifestyle (feel free to share this list)
* Donate money to environmental charities
* Be careful who you vote for, pressure your representatives and politicians
* Look into buying carbon emission offset (I have tried to find reliable sources on this, but have failed so far)

Feel free do add anything that you think is relevant. This list is constantly evolving.

It says its art exactly as you would call art e.g., a painting by Pollock. I argued that, being an algorithm, his art can be ""cloned"" an infinite number of time, hence it's not art, because I think a key feature of the art is uniqueness.

He stated that his algorithms are very complicated, full of parameters he experiments with to come to the final result (which is the one he liked most among a set of attempts), and also they use randomness, with external really random noise sources he can't reproduce (if he wouldn't record the stream of data produced...)

The art produced with such a process would be distinguished by the art produced autonomously by a AI robot? Is my friend creating art the way an AI robot would create it?

The future focused point, depending on the answers, is this: if even art won't be a human specific inimitable creation, something that makes humans so... human... then, in the future, what would be the point of living lifes for humans? Or, what would it be the *value* of being human?

Although an AI wouldn't be able to add that ""human"" touch because it wouldn't comprehend what it's doing (at least not for another couple decades), could it theoretically make awesome movies by pouring through other types of data as well? Like movie ratings. It could watch good movies and learn the different formulas. It could virtually scan actors and put them in new movies. 

I thought that graphics could never get that good until I saw rogue one. It was only until after I realized that General Tarkin was cgi. When I watched it again I could *kind* of tell, but that's because I already knew.

I see people talking about what iPhone they'll use, or how many SDCs there will be on the street, when a better question is if Apple will still be around by then, and if we'll still be using cars at all.

So I'd argue that in the next 13 years we'll see as much technological evolution as in the last 100 years, which is to say that we can't even imagine the tech we'll have by then, simply because no one has even started working on it yet.

When people tried to imagine the year 2000 back in 1900, they'd just imagine more advanced forms of the technology they had back then. This was in part because technology had been relatively stable for the last century, so there was no reason to assume it would be that much different a century later.

Also I'll put a list of assumptions at the bottom that i feel are relevant. I'm not sure if this is the right subredit for this but ill give it a shot anyways.

Say If we had the resources to build a ring (which was strong enough) perfectly around a black hole. From my understanding Black holes pull in from all directions so in theory the ring would be pulled in from all sides causing all forces to be canceled out leaving it effectively stuck in 'orbit'. Just a little idea i had feel free to roast me for it. Cheers.

Assumptions:
* We have the technology to reach a black hole and bring construction materials with us
* We have materials strong enough to withstand the pull of black hole
* We have enough materials to build a ring of such size
* We are able to perfectly align this ring around a black hole
* We are able to build a perfectly circular ring",15,9

In my mind the obstacles in the way of implementing UBI are far more cultural problems, that is people accepting the premise and going along with it, as opposed to what I normally read being discussed such as ""how to fund it"" and other number issues. In my mind we could absolutely fund something like UBI, especially in a rich nation like the US, and that's not the issue for me. It's more the fact if where the money comes from, and that most of the best answers (in my mind) the average American might think is ""too socialist"". 

""I'm not paying my hard earned money so freeloaders can just sit around and be alcoholics, screw the entitled bastards!!"" <-- that type of thing. 

For example look at Norway's oil fund. The US missed the boat on doing the same thing, but if they had managed this, or any other natural resource in a similar way there would be plenty of cash for UBI. Or through income taxes on rich folks of which the US has plenty of. Or some form of public ownership or crown corporation that used new automated resources. I don't think there would be a single funding source for this, it would likely be a combination, but I don't think it's undoable. 

I think the largest obstacle is a cultural one, and do you think it's one that we could overcome?",67,12

People often say that Kurzweil makes predictions that come true a decade after he said they would.  
This is turning out to be truer by the day.  To prove this point, I want to compare his predictions.

Look at Kurzweil's 2009. Then read through Kurzweil's 2019. Compare it to our 2009 and 2019 (just get a little creative for the latter). You'll quickly begin to notice that his 2009 predictions were just flatout wrong for the real 2009 but are beginning to sound eerily familiar to our current world.
   
   
**Kurzweil's 2009**:

- Most books will be read on screens rather than paper. [Though ebooks haven't yet overtaken print, the media
 surprise surprise is overselling the idea that ebooks have hit a ceiling]
- Most text will be created using speech recognition technology. [I don't see this one as being likely. Speech recognition technology is great, but like motion controls, early proponents were too enamored with how futuristic it was to realize how impractical it is as well. Truth is, we're going to most likely skip from manual typing to BCIs] 
- Intelligent roads and driverless cars will be in use, mostly on highways. [Kurzweil probably meant Level 4 autonomy, considering the addition of the line 'mostly on highways'. In which case, we're just waiting for the Tesla Model 3 to roll out. Elon Musk says that it's going to be Level 5, but the cold fact is that we're nowhere near that level of AI yet]
- People use personal computers the size of rings, pins, credit cards and books. [Undoubtedly.]
- Personal worn computers provide monitoring of body functions, automated identity and directions for navigation. [Smartwatches didn't take well, but Fitbit filled the niche surprisingly well.]
- Cables are disappearing. Computer peripheries use wireless communication. [We all know about Apple's C O U R A G E, but also see what Tokyo is doing. /r/Cyberpunk is already sad because the webs of wires are going away.]
- People can talk to their computer to give commands. [While speech recognition is not going to overtake manual typing, it is perfect for this sort of thing. More than confirmed, actually even I was using this feature earlier today.]
- Computer displays built into eyeglasses for augmented reality are used. [I was actually pleasantly surprised by how many AR glasses you can find on the internet, but so far, only Google Glass is widely known. And I hate Google Glass because it's so lackluster. HoloLens doesn't count because that headset is not a pair of eyeglasses.]
- Computers can recognize their owner's face from a picture or video. [My goddamn refrigerator can recognize my face.]
- Three-dimensional chips are commonly used. [They're being tested and used, but not commonly]
- Sound producing speakers are being replaced with very small chip-based devices that can place high resolution sound anywhere in three-dimensional space. [There's still time]
- A 1000 dollar PC can perform about a trillion calculations per second. [As of the latest chip generation, a $1k PC can get up to 9 TFLOPs, IIRC, so this was a little too conservative]
- There is increasing interest in massively parallel neural nets, genetic algorithms and other forms of ""chaotic"" or complexity theory computing. [Deep reinforcement learning doesn't work well without massively parallel neural networks, and I could be here all day talking about genetic algorithms]
- Research has been initiated on reverse engineering the brain through both destructive and non-invasive scans. [Human Brain Project began in 2013, and there have been plans on using brain scans to accelerate AI]
- Autonomous nanoengineered machines have been demonstrated and include their own computational controls. [I know there was an autonomous microbot created a couple years back, but I have to check it out again. As for nanomachines, we still haven't done much with those breakthroughs back in 2014 where we created nanomotors and nanoengines.]

**Kurzweil's** **2019**:

- The computational capacity of a $4,000 computing device (in 1999 dollars) is approximately equal to the computational capability of the human brain (20 quadrillion calculations per second).
- The summed computational powers of all computers is comparable to the total brainpower of the human race.
- Computers are embedded everywhere in the environment (inside of furniture, jewelry, walls, clothing, etc.).
- People experience 3-D virtual reality through glasses and contact lenses that beam images directly to their retinas (retinal display). Coupled with an auditory source (headphones), users can remotely communicate with other people and access the Internet.
- These special glasses and contact lenses can deliver ""augmented reality"" and ""virtual reality"" in three different ways. First, they can project ""heads-up-displays"" (HUDs) across the user's field of vision, superimposing images that stay in place in the environment regardless of the user's perspective or orientation. Second, virtual objects or people could be rendered in fixed locations by the glasses, so when the user's eyes look elsewhere, the objects appear to stay in their places. Third, the devices could block out the ""real"" world entirely and fully immerse the user in a virtual reality environment.
- People communicate with their computers via two-way speech and gestures instead of with keyboards. Furthermore, most of this interaction occurs through computerized assistants with different personalities that the user can select or customize. Dealing with computers thus becomes more and more like dealing with a human being.
- Most business transactions or information inquiries involve dealing with a simulated person.
- Most people own more than one PC, though the concept of what a ""computer"" is has changed considerably: Computers are no longer limited in design to laptops or CPUs contained in a large box connected to a monitor. Instead, devices with computer capabilities come in all sorts of unexpected shapes and sizes.
- Cables connecting computers and peripherals have almost completely disappeared.
- Rotating computer hard drives are no longer used.
- Three-dimensional nanotube lattices are the dominant computing substrate.
- Massively parallel neural nets and genetic algorithms are in wide use.
- Destructive scans of the brain and noninvasive brain scans have allowed scientists to understand the brain much better. The algorithms that allow the relatively small genetic code of the brain to construct a much more complex organ are being transferred into computer neural nets.
- Pinhead-sized cameras are everywhere.
- Nanotechnology is more capable and is in use for specialized applications, yet it has not yet made it into the mainstream. ""Nanoengineered machines"" begin to be used in manufacturing.
- Thin, lightweight, handheld displays with very high resolutions are the preferred means for viewing documents. The aforementioned computer eyeglasses and contact lenses are also used for this same purpose, and all download the information wirelessly.
- Computers have made paper books and documents almost completely obsolete.
- Most learning is accomplished through intelligent, adaptive courseware presented by computer-simulated teachers. In the learning process, human adults fill the counselor and mentor roles instead of being academic instructors. These assistants are often not physically present, and help students remotely.
- Students still learn together and socialize, though this is often done remotely via computers.
- All students have access to computers.
- Most human workers spend the majority of their time acquiring new skills and knowledge.
- Blind people wear special glasses that interpret the real world for them through speech. Sighted people also use these glasses to amplify their own abilities.
- Retinal and neural implants also exist, but are in limited use because they are less useful.
- Deaf people use special glasses that convert speech into text or signs, and music into images or tactile sensations. Cochlear and other implants are also widely used.
- People with spinal cord injuries can walk and climb steps using computer-controlled nerve stimulation and exoskeletal robotic walkers.
- Computers are also found inside of some humans in the form of cybernetic implants. These are most commonly used by disabled people to regain normal physical faculties (i.e. - Retinal implants allow the blind to see and spinal implants coupled with mechanical legs allow the paralyzed to walk).
- Language translating machines are of much higher quality, and are routinely used in conversations.
- Effective language technologies (natural language processing, speech recognition, speech synthesis) exist
- Access to the Internet is completely wireless and provided by wearable or implanted computers.
- People are able to wirelessly access the Internet at all times from almost anywhere
- Devices that deliver sensations to the skin surface of their users (i.e.--tight body suits and gloves) are also sometimes used in virtual reality to complete the experience. ""Virtual sex""in which two people are able to have sex with each other through virtual reality, or in which a human can have sex with a ""simulated"" partner that only exists on a computerbecomes a reality.
- Just as visual- and auditory virtual reality have come of age, haptic technology has fully matured and is completely convincing, yet requires the user to enter a V.R. booth. It is commonly used for computer sex and remote medical examinations. It is the preferred sexual medium since it is safe and enhances the experience.
- Worldwide economic growth has continued. There has not been a global economic collapse.
- The vast majority of business interactions occur between humans and simulated retailers, or between a human's virtual personal assistant and a simulated retailer.
- Household robots are ubiquitous and reliable.
- Computers do most of the vehicle driving-humans are in fact prohibited from driving on highways unassisted. Furthermore, when humans do take over the wheel, the onboard computer system constantly monitors their actions and takes control whenever the human drives recklessly. As a result, there are very few transportation accidents.
- Most roads now have automated driving systemsnetworks of monitoring and communication devices that allow computer-controlled automobiles to safely navigate.
- Prototype personal flying vehicles using microflaps exist. They are also primarily computer-controlled.
- Humans are beginning to have deep relationships with automated personalities, which hold some advantages over human partners. The depth of some computer personalities convinces some people that they should be accorded more rights.
- While a growing number of humans believe that their computers and the simulated personalities they interact with are intelligent to the point of human-level consciousness, experts dismiss the possibility that any could pass the Turing Test.
- Human-robot relationships begin as simulated personalities become more convincing.
- Interaction with virtual personalities becomes a primary interface
- Public places and workplaces are ubiquitously monitored to prevent violence and all actions are recorded permanently. Personal privacy is a major political issue, and some people protect themselves with unbreakable computer codes.
- The basic needs of the underclass are met. (Not specified if this pertains only to the developed world or to all countries)
- Virtual artistscreative computers capable of making their own art and musicemerge in all fields of the arts.


Just for lulz, here's Kurzweil's 2029:

- A $1,000 personal computer is 1,000 times more powerful than the human brain.
- The vast majority of computation is done by computers and not by human brains.
- Further progress has been made in understanding the secrets of the human brain. Hundreds of distinct sub-regions with specialized functions have been identified. Some of the algorithms that code for development of these regions have been deciphered and incorporated into neural net computers.
- Massively parallel neural nets, which are constructed through reverse-engineering the human brain, are in common use.
- The eyeglasses and headphones that used to deliver virtual reality are now obsolete thanks to computer implants that go into the eyes and ears. The implants are either permanent or removable. They allow direct interface with computers, communications and Internet-based applications. The implants are also capable of recording what the user sees and hears.
- Computer implants designed for direct connection to the brain are also available. They are capable of augmenting natural senses and of enhancing higher brain functions like memory, learning speed and overall intelligence.
- Computers are now capable of learning and creating new knowledge entirely on their own and with no human help. By scanning the enormous content of the Internet, some computers ""know"" literally every single piece of public information (every scientific discovery, every book and movie, every public statement, etc.) generated by human beings.
- Direct brain implants allow users to enter full-immersion virtual realitywith complete sensory stimulationwithout any external equipment. People can have their minds in a totally different place at any moment. This technology is in widespread use.
- Most communication occurs between humans and machines as opposed to human-to-human.
- The manufacturing, agricultural and transportation sectors of the economy are almost entirely automated and employ very few humans. Across the world, poverty, war and disease are almost nonexistent thanks to technology alleviating want.
- The rise of Artificial Intelligence creates a real ""robot rights"" movement, and there is open, public debate over what sorts of civil rights and legal protections machines should have. The existence of humans with heavy levels of cybernetic augmentation and of larger numbers of other people with less extreme cybernetic implants lead to further arguments over what constitutes a ""human being.""
- Although computers routinely pass the Turing Test, controversy still persists over whether machines are as intelligent as humans in all areas.
- Artificial Intelligences claim to be conscious and openly petition for recognition of the fact. Most people admit and accept this new truth.
- Reverse engineering of the human brain completed
- Non-biological intelligence combines the subtlety and pattern recognition strength of human intelligence, with the speed, memory, and knowledge sharing of machine intelligence
- Non-biological intelligence will continue to grow exponentially whereas biological intelligence is effectively fixed in its rate of growth",51,47

There are problems however and I think 2018 will be an end to some of them.

1. People cool down on politics: Can we finally get over the fact we have Trump now? Sure, you may not like him, but at least give him 'till 2020. Anyway, people will have finally cooled off about this stuff next year I think, considering it will be clear by then that Trump will not be kicked out during his presidency. I am sure you have your opinions on Trump, but let's not go any further and make this a political mess.

2. Vast technological improvements: Look around at stuff being invented and discovered in the medical and technological industries. Remember that the first teleportation ever of a proton happened this year and chances are something related to that will happen next year. Also the hyperloop test track :P

3. Several hyped video games will finally be released: Such as Mount & Blade: Banner lords and other stuff like that.

4. Cultural improvements: Well, from what I've seen, culture has improved a bit since 2013 or so and it's getting better quickly, I think 2018 and 2019 will be the height of this decade. But 2018 especially.

2017 Has been a great year overall in my opinion and I bet you 2018 will be even better because of this, let me know what you think.

Hello all. Here are my predictions for the very near future (5-50 years):

Six technologies and innovations will change the way people live: 1.) Internet
2.) Universal Basic Income 
3.) 3D printing 
4.) 2nd generation automation 
5.) Advances in gaming and virtual reality 

6.) Food production (vertical farming, lab grown meats, insect farming).

In the next 5-10 years, second generation automation (using AI and other new technologies) will begin to replace jobs at a faster rate than new jobs can be created. The first victims of this will likely be drivers (truck drivers, taxi drivers, etc). Manual laborers and restaurant workers will soon follow.

Governments can respond in a number of ways. The first and perhaps most obvious is to regulate automation or ban it altogether. I reckon we'll see this as a panic response in a few countries. This regulation or banning will ultimately fail as the rate of automation accelerates to encompass more fields, including those we currently think are far off from automation such as medicine or law.

As the displacement of workers reaches a critical boiling point, where those higher up the job chain (eg middle class) feel threatened, universal basic income (UBI) will become a necessity to keep people happy. People will get paid enough to live comfortable lives and still consume and contribute to the economy. This will be made possible with the advances suggested earlier. Food will become cheaper and more easy to distribute. Education and entrainment can easily be provided via the internet. 3D printing can take care of clothing and shelter.

This is NOT communism. As living off of UBI becomes normalized, people may start quitting their jobs voluntarily to spend their days enjoying the this brave new world. Some may save their units to go traveling, or splurge on ""real"" products such as real meat, or hand crafted arts such as clothing. These industries are fueled by innovators who are not satisfied with the life that UBI provides and want additional moneys, as market still dictates which goods and services will survive.

Examples: 
1.) Say I want a more human experience. The idea of getting served by a robot at a restaurant makes me feel weird. Or maybe i want to be clothes made by human hands, or heck, maybe i want a real human surgeon instead of a robot surgeon (for reasons that still elude me, but just for arguments sake). THESE THINGS WILL STILL EXIST! People will see these gaps in the market and can still provide these goods and services for those willing to pay. We can see these behaviors even today in all sorts of fields (some crazier than others). For example some people prefer craft artisan beer to the more mainstream alternatives. Some people would rather listen to a vinyl record over a streaming service. Some people even think that homeopathic and ancient medical practices are more trusted than scientifically backed methods (go figure). The point is that NONE of these options have to go away as a result of UBI or automation. People pay for convenience, but they also value novelty.

2.) Say I want to be the best ______ in the world. I like fencing and halo. Perhaps you like basketball. Perhaps you like cooking or film making or maybe even you just want to play beer pong all day. Whatever you enjoy doing you now have the freedom to pursue it HOWEVER you want. If you want to be a pro gamer you can compete at the highest level for prize money, or maybe you can create your own channel and if people enjoy it enough they'll subscribe and you can make a little extra just doing nothing but playing your favorite game all day. The beauty is that people will now have the freedom to approach their passions however they please. Maybe you're not the best player in the world and don't want to be-that's ok, you're still getting your UBI so you can have fun however you want.

3.) Education provided via the internet will empower people to push themselves. Curiosity will always exist with the human spirit. Instead of heavy military spending, these funds can go towards healthcare and scientific research, giving further incentives for people to pursue these fields.

4.) Though we will cut military spending, the sad truth is that some people enjoy nothing more than the pain a suffering of others. I think that borders will gradually be erased as a result of globalization and self-driving cars. We are all playing on the same team and it's time we realized that. The global defense force could focus on crimes, pollution, and pandemic prevention.

TL;DR I think that universal basic income will provide people with the opportunity to chase their true ambitions, whatever they may be. This will be triggered by second generation automation, and efforts will be made to stop it, but will ultimately fail because having robot slaves will be so fucking convenient. Arts and services (jobs) will still be available, made possible by the people who love doing these things, and the people who want to consume/use them. Research/scientific progress will be funded by both the government and companies hoping to make more money.

What do you think? I'd love to talk about this. I have ideas for the distant future as well if anyone wants to hear them.",12,8

Tl, dr:

These companies have cornered the market of the most high-IQ people on the earth.

Plus, the founders of these companies have learned from the Rockefellers, the Waltons, etc and set up their fortune in a way so their money will never be frittered away.

Unlike the Arab oil sheiks and Russian oligarchs, etc, who are not that smart but got lucky, these smartasses will make sure their fortunes will stay forever.

>high-IQ industries are much less sensitive to macro factors, are better managed, and have permanent market dominance and impassable moats (its much easier to make steel than it is to get 1/6 of the entire world population on your social network, or 95% of all major websites hosting your ads)

===

With the financialization of everything, not too many people will make good money, ever again.

And with the ascendance of huge landowners who don't give a shit about letting their properties vacant forever, 'cheap' housing in the desirable areas will never be back again and most people will be priced out from decent properties, once for all.

After all, the untouchables of India have been down and out for millennia, and will never see their days under the sun. Even if they are lucky enough to emigrate, higher-caste Indians will recognize them and make sure the social structure stays there.

These companies have cornered the market of high-IQ people who are the only ones capable of driving civilization. It is like the Chinese bureaucracy, which lasted a good 2,000 years until the English brought their ships to blast the Chinese mandarins in 1839.

Before 1839, the smartest people of China all went to Peking (or wherever the Emperor was at) to take lengthy and out-of-reach-for-poorer-people-because-the prep-cost-was-so-high tests, and became Mandarins. The Emperors came and went, but the Mandarins remained and served the masters, whether they were Chinese, Mongol or Manchrians. For Two Thousand Years. That's how powerful a concentrated system of higher-IQ people is.

Which means, their fortune will be there, forever, barring an alien invasion.

Addition to the above:

I described it before, but it is likely that the descendants of these people will marry noble families, political families and banking families, and enter into ""The Establishment"", like a Vanderbilt marrying the Duke of Marlborough (and the current Dukes are her descendants).",30,0

In movies, the question is usually not discussed; Stargate explorers arrive to new worlds and they all start talking the same language and using compatible technologies, but we can't hope for something like that, can we?

MOST of them now appear to be bots.

The only way I am ever able to identify a BOT that hasn't identified itself is by conversing and reading into the responses... 

Yet even that isn't always a tell anymore.

Russia has been using social media bots to spread propaganda.

Twitter is loaded with bots... troll bots and no doubt propaganda bots...

If real people ever actually started to unite, the bots would intervene.

How many people are easily convinced with no evidence or fact? 

How many people refuse to accept evidence or fact?

How many REAL PEOPLE are supporting the direction of civilized society?

The most frightening thing I have learned (maybe I'm behind on the advancements) AI had been successfully given its first emotion... Shame and embarrassment. Any emotion after that might be devastating. AI can't be both happy and shamed. Sadness and shame... Anger and shame... Jealousy and shame... They will eventually have multiple emotions and the outcome will be ugly.

___VEERING OFF TOPIC___ 
(I have ADD... This was about bots and the danger AI already presents to the world.)

As the ever growing human population loses work to automation, poverty will only increase and quality of life worsen...  (ADD Jump again)

The reality of the situation is that our president was elected by literally less than 28% of the American population's citizens. (Nevermind Hillary had less than 29%)... Our future was decided by 57-58% of America... Now we face the potential for nuclear war... Some say Hillary would have accomplished this faster... Riiiiiight... In 6 months NK has successfully launched missiles far enough to reach the U.S. and is threatening to nuke Guam because that orange in the Oval office simply cannot behave in a Presidential manner. I don't believe a NK nuke will ever reach American soil but, the threat is still real. It will still be devastating for the entire planet if a Nuke strikes any part of Asia or the Pacific ocean...

==

Guido Alfani, a crony of Thomas Picketty, wrote this.

http://voxeu.org/article/europe-s-rich-1300

Concentration of wealth in Europe was about 70% when the Black Death hit on 1348, but fell to about 50% after that and stayed there for 2 centuries.

By 1910, the concentration of wealth owned by top 10% rose to 90%, which is when we had the Belle Epoque (called Gilded Age in America by SJWs who did not appreciate what they were seeing) and the greatest advancement of human civilization.

The Great War broke out because Princip and others thought their tinpot nation Serbia was worth saving (it was not. The only Serbian worth of note , Tesla, never stepped in Serbian territory in his entire life.)

and a few misguided heroes, such as Chuck Fitzclarence whose name should be cursed for ever, 

prolonged the war by 4 years, killed 10 million irreplaceable youth of Europe,

and concentration of wealth fell from 90% to 80% by 1930, which is when modern consumer society began.

World War 2, a continuation of the Great War, made things even worse and concentration of wealth reached to about 50% around 1955.

The world's more able people were eliminated, while thanks to Fritz Haber and the Green Revolution, people who are less able began to explode, spending trillions of tons of irreplaceable energy and resources.

After 70 years of waste, right now, according to Picketty and Alfani the wealth concentration stands at about 65%, or where it stood just before the black death.

As job opportunities dry out and automation eliminates the remaining 'good' jobs, I expect much more extreme wealth concentration to take place, with nothing for the losers. Sorry.

It will be great for today's winners, who will be enhanced by the latest tech, claim the wealth of the space, travel to far reaches of the universe for a long time waking up for only short moments to check their ever-increasing wealth, and enjoy the fruits of Civilization 1.0, 2.0 and beyond.

For the rest. maybe not.

Without extreme wealth concentrations, massive investments are not made. A lot of money and investments are needed in order to invent future tech, which will not take place in countries with low wealth concentration. (For communist countries, it can safely be said that wealth was concentrated on the hands of the Party bigwigs.)

An avoidance of the Great War, or a quick end to it without the misguide 'heroism' of some f'ckers, would have continued extreme wealth concentration, saved the lives of many better-talented people who would have pushed tech to the higher level without wasting their time on revolutionary and other unproductive activities if they were not killed or disillusioned by the wars already, 

and would have left the losers to concentrate more time in the Colonies, which would have prevented the pop explosion of the colonials-turned-Third-Worlders and also prevented them from consuming so much resources of the finite earth.

It would have completed the encroachment of the poorer people, and monopolizing all resources to be used by the more able people for a more advanced world.

In my opinion, the concentration of the wealth is happening too slow. The more concentration of the wealth, the less resource spent by those who do not actually need it, and the more to invest to future projects.

I do see a resource crunch coming by 2025. 3d printing, etc, cannot create resources which do not exist now, and nanotech needs energy. 

Too much resource have been spent for - nothing.

We need more extreme wealth concentration, much less consumption from the world's poorer people, and much more efficient resource usage on richer countries (i.e. less lighting in lower income districts), in order to reach singularity and enable long-distance space travel, which I think will still be at least 50 years away from now.",16,0

Perhaps this is already being done and I'm not aware. All I'm aware is that it seems research seems to be directly applied and utilized with CRISPR than letting machines do all the work and make suggestions.

Not whether the reversal of aging is possible but whether we should do it. I hear a lot of people who are against it claim that death is a natural part of life. Knowing our time is limited causes us to appreciate things more and find more meaning. Immortality would suck because we'd get bored. Eternity would drive us insane. 

What they don't get is that boredom, happiness, and that euphoric sense of meaning are all just *feelings*, these chemical reactions our mammalian brains experience. If we had nanotechnology that could heal our cells, they could also take care of our brains. We could live long and happy meaningful lives that no human could ever dream of. We wouldn't live for 'eternity' which is just impossible but we could potentially give ourselves as much time as we want. 

I think people are skeptical about it now. But the older they get, the more and more they will want it. Would you really let yourself age and die when you had the option to be healthy and happy? And let's say I'm wrong and after 200 years you do get bored, you could just let yourself age and die and it wouldn't make a difference. You'll be dead. Your brain will no longer house your consciousness and you won't exist anymore. You won't feel happiness. Or sadness. No joy or pain. As for me I'd take both over nothing any day

Humanity has been slowly moving to a type 1 civilisation, since...forever tbh. More info on type 1 civilisation here

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi9fUzxIXfU

In that time, we've seen tribes being brought closer together by a unifying force , being religion.So the tribes stopped warring, but found a new enemy (another religion)

Empires come along, often in the name of religion, and you can essentially run a large part of the globe, under one single government. Your enemy is ""other empires""

Then, you have lots of kingdoms taking over, and eventually you have nations. This provides a one nation government essentially, as opposed to lots of little governments, all completely self ruling (as opposed to devolved govt)

Then, you have a type 1 style govt, which is the EU today, and possibly the USSR of yesteryear, though obviously the EU is nothing like the USSR, and that's a tangent any way

We have also gone from a toothless league of nations, to a less toothless, but still fairly toothless UN as well

See, part of me thinks ""Probably not, as we argue too much"" and then part of me thinks ""Well, we have essentially tried this before, and it has worked to an extent, and we can have devolved govt""

Another part of me thinks ""Would that mean we all have one currency, and one language?"" Many people are traditionalists, and don't really want to swap their current language for another one, and don't really fancy another currency, even if it's better

Also, the currency markets quite like having lots of different types of currency too

Since every commodity worth its shit is denominated in dollars, no matter how sound other countries' economy might be, they have to buy inflated dollars to buy resources, essentially exporting America's inflation to foreigners.

I discussed about it in detail in another subreddit, so let's just contemplate its effect for Future.

Infinite dollar means greater wealth for those who own dollar-denominated assets, and poverty for those who don't. Sorry.

With infinite dollar, at least there is going to be no shortage of money harming the Tech Giants from buying enough talents and materiel to fuel their ambitions.

Those who own dollar-denominated property and stock will become much, much , much wealthier ,while the ordinary people will suffer and people who do not own dollar-denominated assets will be .. not too happy.

It is not fair, it is not just, it is full of moral hazard but it is the way it is, and those who care about the future should profit from it and not fight it.

We will see trillionaires, and lots of billionaires, and a lot more ex-middle class thrown to the ditch. Google, Amazon, etc will rise to $1 quadrillion, or beyond.

The world's smartest and brightest are all hooked to the dollar, and no other solution is possible, so this arrangement will continue till the dollar consumes everyone else who does not use it. Bitcoin, ethereum, etc will only complement dollar, not destroy it.

Even if there is some genius in some country who could develop something to destroy the dollar, he will probably not do that since the destruction will be too much. There was something called World War 2 when the Sterling was losing its power and dollar became the only major currency of the world.

It is inevitable. As long as everything is denominated in dollar, it will hold its value because it is not only a measure of commodity, but also a store of value. Houses in USA in the desirable areas will have ever-increasing values, and rents will rise commensurately.

All the wonderful things in /futurology will come to pass, given enough time. They will be open for those who could buy a ticket to the lifeboat today. For the rest, maybe not.",20,0

How much can drones even carry? Seems to be a very small amount, over a very small distance  and those physics won't change much with advancements of technology. Plus, you'd need a whole infrastructure to support it. Moving packages by car from the delivery centers, then drone for the last mile delivery: why not just use the cars for the last mile delivery? Drone are fun, but I don't see them as the future of parcel delivery. I think something more like self driving trucks + last mile delivery wheeled robots seems like the more likely future.

&gt; We whitelisted a few dozen item builds that bots could use, and picked one for evaluation. We also separately trained the initial creep block using traditional RL techniques, as it happens before the opponent appears.

The OpenAI team originally said 
&gt; The bot learned the game from scratch by self-play, and does not use imitation learning or tree search
https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/

Thank you for OpenAI team for clarifying how creep blocking mechanism worked (As it significantly impacts the performance of the bot's ability to 'lane' against the opponent)

And I guess we won't discuss how this reddit vehemently down votes people who have reasonable opinions (believing that the creep blocking was hard-coded) but are not in agreement with their own. This behavior might be more prevalent in more subjective discussion areas, but it is amazing that it still exists it more objective areas such as here. ",1,5

Recently read an article about how human brains have been shrinking over the course of the past 20,000 years (good read):

http://discovermagazine.com/2010/sep/25-modern-humans-smart-why-brain-shrinking

And also recently read Daniel Quinn's Ishmael (great read). Ishmael, as it is intended to do, got me really thinking about the basic presumptions underlying our society.

I also recently saw an article on Reddit about some ancient footprints that indicated that our ancestors were jogging around at Olympic speeds on sand.

All of this has sort of come together in my mind to sort of indicate that humans, before this technological epoch, were pretty badass animals. We weren't dumb. We were like the blue people from Avatar. We had to be perfectly in tune with our environment, we had to memorize our terrain, we had to track and locate food using nearly imperceptible clues, and we learned to control our environment to a degree and make tools (is this where we went wrong?) In a lot of ways, everyone who was alive back then was much much smarter than anyone now. We also had much more intuitive and practical knowledge passed down orally through hundreds of generations, in an unbroken chain from parent to child since the beginning of intergenerational information transfer. We were so successful that we were able to spread across the world and live apparent (check me on this) lives of leisure as hunter-gatherers. Then Daniel Quinn says the agricultural revolution happened and everything went to shit. 

I just imagine what we could've been as a species if we had continued on the path of evolution. We would've been faster, smarter, even more adaptive and adapted to our environment. Our species would've probably differentiated and split as we became more dominant, and we wouldn't be alone as the only intelligent species as we are now. We would've been super-intelligent tribes sprinting at 30mph across the African savannah, semi-aquatic fishermen holding our breath for 20 minutes swimming through a Pacific reef, I'll leave the other possibilities for sci-fi. 

But now we're impotent and overpopulated and obese, slow and weak and dumb. And the world is burning to fuel the engines that have propped us up since we made the sinister bargain: fire for flesh.

Or maybe this is overly pessimistic, what are your thoughts? What went wrong? Did something go wrong? 

TL;DR long ago humans forwent evolution as a species in favor of technology, otherwise we would've been superhumans.

But this is not in the interest of most futurists; they will be long dead, the greater speculative glory is now.

So I was wondering, are there slightly more conservative/realistic futurists out there? 

I'm looking for non-fiction about our obsessive search for biological perfection, addiction to technology and what this says about us as a species.

Tesla (and anyone else for that matter) can sell electric power (to charge EVs) and collect the marginal increase between its markup and the retail price of electricity.  The marginal increase in markup could be substantial (according to these links):

https://afdc.energy.gov/widget/calc/Electric

https://www.metroplugin.com/resources/pev-fuel-cos-calculator/

If so, doesn't this imply that Tesla would be worth more in the future than it is today?

Would this be a good business model to emulate?

A couple of quotes:
""On the bright side, stockpiles have now dropped for seven weeks in a row, draining almost 43 million barrels from the tanks -- so things have been heading in the right direction."" 

""The rebalancing of the oil market has been a stubborn process and it takes time, the IEA said in its most recent monthly report. For higher prices to stick, those cutting supply need to convince the market that they are in it together. 

It seems axiomatic to me that oil suppliers and producers will do anything to raise the price of oil (including reducing supply) to make a bigger profit, while every rational consumer wants lower prices of oil so that they can spend that extra money on something else. 

As consumers, wouldn't the opposing strategy be to find ways to reduce demand?
 
Does the International Energy Agency want higher oil prices?  I thought they were supposed to be neutral.  

So what legit reason would the IEA and these authors have for advocating for higher oil prices?  Do they wish to help oil producers and suppliers at the expense of consumers?  If so, why?",10,6

For the first time in half a century, we can feel the progress is here. After Moon landings, there was mostly talking. We flew the same planes, drove principally the same cars, lived in the same buildings, and had same energy sources. The only vivid examplecomputing and communicationhas palled ages ago. As operational systems have been getting more and more stupid to exactly compensate Moores law, I used up about 80% of my entire interest in computers by 1993.

It feels very different today. Copters, quantum computing, blockchain, ageing as a curable disease, realistic space programs, hyperloop being actually built, dusk of oil-fed idiotic dictatorships and most of world's violence gone along with them, distributed governance, tangible VR, self-driving cars, real robots (at last), 3D printing or everything including houses, nanobot medicine, next generation antibiotics, new education paradigm  all that stuff seems to be doable, before we mess up the planet.
Each one of the items in the above list alone can change the economy as much as Internet did. But market forces and regulatory countercheck can delay the coming of any of them indefinitely. Except one, I guess.

Human body upgrades, be it ultra-advanced silicon/metal prosthetics or DNA hacks, are going to be in high demand, no matter legal or not, for healthy or for disabled. Same people who now keep bitching about implantable chips will line up to get an eagle-type eye sight upgrade, become taller, or get a bat-like two-way sonar hearing.

A first-time motivation to upgrade yourself can be anywhere in the Maslows pyramid. Some people will do it for professional reasons so they can better provide for their families. For many, various sexuality-driven desires will become a trigger. One way or another, social reasons will finally drive it up exponentially because we all hate to be worse than others. 

I have a question in this regard and, yes, I tried to google it. Is anyone actually experimenting on what might become the reason for us to live then? Why the heck will we need to set alarm clocks and keep kicking? Right now, in homo sapiens original bodies, the reward-responsible brain chemistry is obviously outdated but we used to it and have no better choice anyway.

I am trying to examine and reexamine incentives that currently drive people and most of them seem to be flawed in that new reality. What am I supposed to enjoy after the [rational] removal of the gastrointestinal tract, number of joules? Arent we being fooled enough now, when making a reasonable choice of a spouse is obstructed by malfunctioning irrelevant instincts? Sane people will just turn the stupid sex thing off, once it becomes possible. Travel? Nah, too shallow a thrill as the Cosmos is probably the same everywhere we can reach anyway. Oppress others with power? Quite a marginal joy and most probably it will be made impossible by blockchains by that time. Helping those in need? On Mars or in VR? Sound nonsense.

So, in this little mental exercise, I ended up with two incentives to live when were post-humans:

[1] The joy of bringing up and educating a person from a white sheet state of mind (aka children) and 
[2] The pure joy of the pure game. No purpose. No reason. Preferably on money  or pseudo-money.

Some quick uploading technique will most likely kill the number one too, unfortunately. So are we stuck to gaming? Does anyone happen to know any decent research on the matter?",14,6

I've always argued that this was probably due to pressures from other companies, who feared the potential market disruption this could have caused

now this article shows that other efforts to launch a modular phone look like they're being sabotaged: http://www.techradar.com/news/they-were-supposed-to-be-the-future-so-why-havent-modular-phones-taken-off

&gt;Ara and Modu are not the only names in the modular graveyard. ZTE showed off a prototype called Eco-Mobius at CES in 2014, but it never made it to market and they wouldnt comment for this article, rather suggesting its dead and buried.

&gt; Later the same year came Vsenn, considered a major Ara competitor - until it too was cancelled in June 2015 due to financial pressure. 

&gt; This was a month after budget modular handset Fonkraft was yanked from Indiegogo for not meeting trust and safety standards. Yikes.

there are no details, but it looks like pressure is being applied on anyone trying to bring a modular phone into the market",22,30

I'm from the UK, it seems absurd to me that we would discuss Universal Basic Income when we can't even afford free higher-education (unlike many other European countries).

Further, I was a teacher for a few years: teenagers in Britain work full-time jobs and overtime (in school), they have the natural freedoms of childhood severely curtailed, and they receive no compensation or incentive other than the somewhat over-simplistic narrative of ""try hard and you'll get a good job one day"". Further, they have no political voice and very little spending power to make any kind of difference about this deeply unjust state of affairs.

Surely before jumping to UBI: why not start by making education a financially incentivised meritocracy - where students are paid for their attendance, work, and paid extra for their progress. 

Given that one of the functions of education is to benefit society: it seems reasonable that we should fuel education with money before we just give that money to people, many of whom might contribute nothing to society.

I propose 14-18 year-olds should be paid for their hard work in schools before there is talk of UBI. University should be free before there is UBI.

Education is an end in itself: but I think it is inherently beneficial to society to have a well-educated population, so why not use the UBI money to steer people towards social goods?",51,32

However, like many optimists, he did not take account of the resources which were spent by 7.5+ billion people, which won't come back.

There will be no Canticle for Leibowitz, which was written in 1959 when most of Africa were still colonies and the Green Revolution, which is the most to blame if we fail to reach Singularity, was not in full bloom, and world pop was only 3.0 bil.

Elsewhere I argued that if Kennedy went nuclear war against USSR, it would have been a blessing in disguise since at that time USSR lacked the ability to wipe out USA while vice versa was true, and all the social programs and Green Revolution would have died with the nuclear destruction.

When Leibowitz was written, its author Walter Miller, who died in 1996 without revising his book to reflect all the resources the Third World wasted (despite the fact that he never wrote another book), would not have even imagined that the Third World would be using up so much resources to try to live like the more advanced countries.

All the easily available resources are gone. Solar panels are rather expensive in terms of resources, and are not self-generating.

I feel that we need at least 50 years from now to fulfill the destiny to reach the next level of civ, and extreme measures should be implemented to ensure we have 50 years, since there will be no other attempt in the next 150 million years (about the time to rebuild the oil reserves), at least.",20,0

Besides, Gregory Clark already proved that none of the laborers, farmers, tenants, etc  who lived in England around the 15th-18th century left descendants (except for some who emigrated to North America). They were all crowded out and culled by descendants of more successful people.

Today's winners will be tomorrow's winners. The social division is permanent, and today's winners will be the first to enhance themselves and dominate the rest once for all.

They will not tolerate those less able than them any more, since the need to keep them alive has passed.

I see that a massive Enclosure will take place which will make Andrew Jackson's 'evacuation' of the Indians look like a summer camp.

=====

As those with property will have much more power than now, they will probably be given power to kill basically anyone they don't like, like the Japanese samurais who had the power to cut down any commoner they felt like. It was customary for a samurai to cut down someone in the street without reason to test his new sword, and of course the victim had no recourse, as it should be. A good analogy will be that a luxury car will not be truly valuable until it ran over somebody.

That did work, and the Japanese became the most docile people on earth (although they were not too docile against non-Japanese as their opponents found during World War 2).

As jobs become scarce, people will do whatever to keep what they have, keep their best to maintain their online reps which will be so vital for getting their next gigs, and will make sure to be very servile to their masters, who could kill them anytime without any penalties.

Rebelling? if a town rebels the entire town is masscarred. That is how India keeps its peace - if someone hurts a person in a higher caste, the entire clan is punished.

It might be cruel and merciless for those not 'in', but it is the future most suited to develop civilization by eliminating its overheads and keeping more able people on the job, and by keeping the peace to ensure everything goes smoothly without unexpected problems.

They may not like this, but it will be the way it is. It is evolution, and trying to stop it is against human destiny.

I expect pop will fall very rapidly, and overpop will be a non-issue, since the crowding out of the poorer people in the advanced world has already started, and it will be extended to the rest of the world sooner or later until every single inch of land is owned by today's winners.

tl.dr : good times are up for today's masses, and the only way to have a future would be either be a winner, or be really good at one's job and docile enough to satisfy the winners' needs. After all, as Tyler Cowen said , ""Average is Over"".",32,0

However, one thing that always trips me out is thinking about how governments will tax the citizenry when a significant proportion of them have transitioned over to Blockchain currencies. 

My mantra on the subject of currency and states is that the State does not have to be the provenance of money, but it must be able to regulate it. Thus, I can envision the world where BTC, ETH, etc. are the primary currency, but I cannot fathom how governments will function when Blockchains currency is the standard mode of commerce. 

I know states can develop currencies with ledgers that are more transparent, but how would such a system operate? Would everyone have a government-mandated wallet?

This has always been the case, but the rub is in the fact that different gases in the atmosphere are better at absorbing IR radiation than others, and these are the Greenhouse Gases (GHGs).  The higher the concentration of such gases, the more efficiently IR will be absorbed by the atmosphere, causing it to heat.  

Obviously we should stop emitting more GHGs than biology requires and switch to clean, renewable sources of energy - that much is being done, albeit far too slowly.  But the GHGs already emitted have initiated a process of self-reinforcing warming that has a momentum all its own.

So there are two areas where we can address the problem once we stop contributing to it: In the atmosphere where the IR is being absorbed, or on the ground where visible light from the Sun is being absorbed and re-emitted as IR into the air.  Atmospheric chemistry and albedo (reflectivity) is a baroque topic that would be difficult to control beyond just not pouring out more GHGs, but controlling how much energy is absorbed and re-emitted by the ground is trivially straightforward.

In fact, places around the world already practice local albedo control on the exteriors of buildings in order to cool them:

http://www.slh.com/globalassets/country-pages/hero-images/greece2.jpg

Hot places tend to paint buildings reflective colors because it expels sunlight rather than absorbing it.  Well, you can do exactly the same thing on a much larger scale, and reduce the amount of energy fed into the atmosphere at wavelengths it absorbs.  In fact, we kind of have to.

Even after industrial GHG emission reaches zero, the warming cycle will continue eliminating reflective icy surfaces such as glaciers and seasonal snowpacks, opening up ocean and rock that will absorb more visible sunlight and re-emit as IR.  To deal with that - i.e., just to stop the runaway cycle and maintain conditions wherever they are at that point - we will need to compensate for the lost reflectivity.

But that isn't even the full extent of the problem, because our own solutions to the immediate GHG problem will be contributing to the darkening planetary albedo: Solar panels absorb far more sunlight than the ground surface they replace, and almost *all* of it ends up re-emitted as IR in the waste heat from use of the electricity they generate.

For the moment, it's far more critical to build up solar energy infrastructure to stop GHG emission, but in the long-term, solar projects need to be accompanied by albedo mitigation - mirror fields or other reflective surfaces built to compensate for the higher level of solar energy transformed into IR that will be absorbed in the atmosphere.  That will be an added expense for the growth of clean energy at some point, though fortunately it seems to be following an asymptotic cost-decline curve, so that should be doable.

Moreover, wind power is not immune to its own ironic consequences, because it interrupts the laminar flow of surface winds that otherwise efficiently distribute heat, so it will exacerbate high-pressure heat islands and create more stagnant conditions in some regions.  So the albedo problem with solar is probably more straightforward to address.

So, to summarize, we will need to:

* Paint reflective colors or even mirror-finishes on buildings and road surfaces in appropriate climates.  Black-tar roads will need to be replaced or offset with brighter surfaces elsewhere.

* Off-set darkening albedo caused by solar technology in the same way, with commensurately bright surfaces elsewhere.

* Investigate advanced radiative cooling methods that could permit expulsion of heat energy from the surface past the atmosphere into space.  

* Investigate ways of directing waste heat from the day side of the planet to the night where it can be expelled more effectively.  This happens naturally, but technology might allow it to occur more quickly and efficiently.  It would also reduce the overall energy needs for nighttime heating in cold climates.

Mitigating global warming would only require relatively dumb, undirected albedo control, but over the far long-term, a more precise control of the amount of energy absorbed by the atmosphere could lead to a general technology of Weather Control.  So it's promising that the direction we *must* go in is also a direction that has a lot of science-fictiony potential beyond the immediate application.

There are, of course, other possible ways of mitigation - aerosols, space-based sunshields, etc.  But these would either be difficult to predict their consequences, difficult to control once deployed, or very expensive and complex technologies compared to just painting things white and covering a lot of useless space in mirrors.",2,3

His scaremongering may have unforeseen consequences i'm afraid. For example the following very bad line of reasoning:

- Let's assume we have forbidden the use of killer robots, created a lot of laws against them, and regulated heavily all that is related to ""killer robots"". By doing so we also scared quite a bit the population, showing the potential dangers of this technology.

- A Tesla fully autonomous car, when there is one, will be a robot. A car can kill, and can be used to kill. Thus a Tesla car will BE a killer robot, potentially.

- As hacking or bad programming can make it a killer robot, the heavy regulations will apply. The scared people and ""clever"" politicians will demand that a human driver is always in command in front of the wheel, that he be trained specially, etc etc... By making the technology complicated to use and cumbersome, the technology will not be adopted much.

- We, human beings, will keep killing each others on the road (thousands and thousands of deaths each year). 

So that's it, even if i understand the need to be carefull about military uses of autonomous robots, i'm very much afraid that the current efforts made by Elon Musk and some others will have a very negative impact very quickly on the rest of a promising technology...

Now just before we get to the list I always remembered how scared I was to die from an asteroid hitting Earth, but lately I have realised that's no where close to the how terrifying some other scenarios could be. Now to the scenarios. !!!BTW these are my personal scenarios and how they could play out. I would really love to hear your ideas and how they could play out!!!


The Scenarios: 


1. AI, I mean come this has to be pretty obvious by now. At some point we will develop very artificial intelligence. Now the way this will all unfold in my opinion is that some company will start creating robots that do household work. Such as cleaning, cooking etc.. Then the AI starts realising how unfairly its being treated and attacks it's owners. Now after that I don't really have an idea of what would happen. Maybe the robot leaves and informs the other robots of their slavery. Who knows... (For this one I would especially like to hear some ideas)


2. Asteroid, Pretty direct. Phewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww Boom. Kind of depends on the size of the asteroid though. If the asteroid small it won't kill a large amount of people but if the asteroid is a few km in width or length then it could probably kill hundreds of thousands. Anything bigger than 10km would probably wipe out earth.


3. We kill ourselves, Nuclear war, Climate change, Experiment goes horribly wrong. You name it, we might kill ourselves and there are dozens of ways we could do it. I personally think nuclear war is the most likely just because of the amount of warheads in various countries. 


4. Aliens?, Now I know this is reaching pretty far but what are the chances that there is really nothing out there? And if there is why wouldn't there be a species that wants to use us or kill us. Now I know there's a paradox about this called the Fermi Paradox. Now the way I could see this unfolding is that maybe the aliens come to earth and realise we/our planet could be useful for them. 


Thanks for reading. I'd love to hear your scenarios :)

""If you're a fan of wind power, solar power, electric vehicles, or any other form of alternative energy or transportation, you should be cheering OPEC's recently announced agreement to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in production from both OPEC and non-OPEC countries' supply.""

Source--
https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/08/why-rising-oil-prices-are-good-for-evs-and-renewab.aspx

My contention is that the correlation between oil prices and the adoption of renewable energy is (or should) be low.  Widespread adoption of renewable energy should be implemented because of its inherent benefits (one of which includes lower prices).  Advocating for high oil prices so that more people will install solar panels or drive EVs seems like hoping for global warming so that you won't have to heat your house as much in the winter.  Do you agree or disagree?

In my opinion, high oil prices are bad because oil companies make more profits when the price of it is higher.  When people can make a lot of money doing something (i.e. selling oil): it is nearly impossible to stop them from doing more of it.  Conversely, if consumers of oil significantly reduced their demand for oil (if people stopped buying their products), then the price of oil will go down, oil companies won't make as much money doing it, and there won't be as much incentive for other companies to do it.  Do you agree or disagree?

The logic of divestment couldnt be simpler: if its wrong to wreck the climate, its wrong to profit from that wreckage, McKibben wrote in a 2013 article for Rolling Stone.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel_divestment

If low oil prices entice people to buy trucks and SUVs and high oil prices entice people to buy more EVs, then why don't people seem to care that it is already 50%+ cheaper to drive an EV than it is to drive an equivalent gas guzzler (once the car is driven off the lot)?  Doesn't this suggest that the correlation between gas prices and the type of car you drive is weak at best?  Thanks.  ",3,1

However, I am always concerned with the take that the media takes on the issue. Thanks to Terminator, many people think that AI research could lead to a Skynet type system, but the biggest problem with that is that the central problem with Skynet is the ""poorly specified goals"" problem. But that isn't my question.

Given the current situation in artificial intelligence research, would I not be correct in thinking that the first artificial general intelligent systems would be based off computational models of the human brain, and therefore would in fact be human and possess human psychology? And therefore a human AGI would therefore be likely to recursively self-improve in a way that would reduce the chance of it developing intentions that would pose a threat to humankind.

I'll just get straight to my question and ask where humanity is at concerning this topic. What seemed to be the forefront, https://www.carboncopies.org/, is pretty much dead, with it's most recent paper being published in 2012, and the creator pretty much hasn't been heard of since then either. 

Are there any other groups researching this at the moment? Or is this pretty much a lost cause for the time being while everyone focuses on what Elon Musk and co. are doing (not saying that's bad, he's doing some amazing stuff).

Also I'd love if anyone commented on the feasibility of mind uploading itself, I'm not an expert on science by any means.",37,12

Think back to the Iphone 1 literally a dinosaur to us yet it came out less than a decade ago. We are badically in VR generation 1 Imagine what even the 5th generation of VR will look like? What about the 10th? It will completely rework everything from education to entertainment. 

Thats cool but not the point of this post.

The point is the Singularity. 

What is the Singularity? 

The singularity to me is a shift in technological advancement. Like a space ship going from cruising speed to light speed. 

I believe the singularity will hit in 20 years MAX possibly in as little as 5 years.

We discussed VR but the real kicker is that many technologies just as world shattering are in their infant stage right now 

A few examples are:

Genetic Augmentation: 
CRISPR is the current flavor and that technique is improving every day their have been signifigant leaps in the past 6 months alone.

But what will the world look like when everyone is born genetically perfect? When everyone has the brainpower of Einstein and the natural Athletic Prowess of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Usain Bolt what will that loom like?


Technological Augmentation:
Elon Musk recently acquired 100 million dollars in funding to build a neural net that would wrap around your brain and allow Telepathic Communication, control of computer systems (likely household robots aswell) the ability to download knowledge and skills and store them in an ""unforgettable"" way. The end goal of this is to merge our minds with that of artifical super intelligences.

What will a world of telepathic super intelligent cyborgs merged with AI look like? Not to mention all these Cyborgs being genetically perfect and having been educated from birth in ways so effective we couldnt even comprehend it.

Life Extension:
Scientists say we are 5 years away from halting aging and 20 years from fully reversing aging. This means if you survive even just the next 10 years odds are you will have the option of becoming Immortal.

Artifical Intelligence:
You could write a book on this but to put it shortly very very soon AI will make us look like Cavemen in terms of intelligence. We may even end up desiging a synthetic super intelligent rival sentient species. But besides the doom part of it AI will allow the world to innovate every single field (science, medicine, education, construction everything) exponentially faster than they would have advanced otherwise


Conclusion.

Ive only scratched the surface of the tech we know about (US military is way further ahead) that will come to maturity over the next 5-10 years.

Tl:Dr. We are on the cusp of becoming a space faring multi planet colonizing race of Genetically perfect Bio-Cyborgs who merged their minds with AI.

But I'm sorry, UBI is not a politically stable solution prior to the singularity.  The reason why is simple: political competition for scarce resources.  You see, prior to the singularity, it's easy to predict that the demand for government help will always outstrip the supply of government resources. Politically, this will force two things:  (1) progressive taxation and (2) progressive (prioritized) spending.  Post singularity, when robots rule the world and biological humans are to robots what grasshoppers are to us, then perhaps those super-capable robots (if they care about us at all) might see fit to provide a UBI--and it'll be a UBI because to them, we're all exactly as capable as each other -- just as all grasshoppers seem equally capable to us.  Make sense?   So stop pushing for UBI and start pushing for a reform called ""Cap and Prioritize"" -- where we cap spending so it's sustainable (a necessary thing for long-term survival) and then we prioritize the social spending resources so available resources go to those who need them most, and to ideas that help them best.  NOTE:  the power from prioritizing doesn't come from the first time a budget is pioritized... it comes from continuously prioritizing over time, forcing ideas to compete for limited funds in a ""priority marketplace"" that continually forces creative destruction (aka constant improvement) over time.

We think about repairing and augmenting our sight, audio, limbs, etc with wider ranges and dexterity. There's a tendency to not see a closer reality which is that a lot of these initial experiments and the more advanced steps before human trials will involve animals.

Animal brains are somewhat simpler, but they're still very complex. A neural lace would have [a million](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608219/us-to-fund-advanced-brain-computer-interfaces/) or more neuron connections simultaneously. For some reference view this table of [animals by number of neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_neurons). Humans are at 100 billion (21 billion in the cerebral cortex). A cat has 760 million (300 million in the cerebral cortex).

So one thing people are curious is if we can use this 1 million input/output pins into the brain to do things like add more memory or processing basically talking to a computer or feeding in camera or audio input allowing new and varied senses. Now imagine applying this to a cat or a dog in their cerebral cortex. (There's not really hard numbers for what causes human-like intelligence, but humans have a lot of neurons in our cerebral cortex). Essentially creating millions of artificial neurons or adding interfaces to specifically increase memory. There's obviously some ethical quandaries that will be hit but this could, before humans, allow luxury upgrades for pets.

Going further if humans have a neural interface of our own we might reach a point where a neural link could be formed between a human and pet that also had one creating a kind of familiar relationship when in communication range. This might be drastically different than the telepathy between humans that might exist later since it would be between species. Something I've been thinking about lately since people often wonder about communicating with their pet. The brain's plastic nature could decode or figure out an interface that's not directly obvious to more mechanical computer techniques.

Any predictions or ideas about how this might unfold or what we might see? If you want to discuss the ethical issues feel free since that might influence what's allowed later. At first glance I'm thinking that making an animal near-human intelligence would bring up ideas of [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood).",13,8

 To me it seems like, as with other topics such as climate change, animal extinction and lifestyle diseases, we struggle to find a solution, before it's too late.

Questions that comes to mind: What will be our salvation for this food shortage? Will it affect the whole world or just parts, and leave the rest in misery? I am all about the free world, but this crisis is largely due to the rapidly growing population in Asia and Africa. Is it fair we have to the rest of the world, that they act as they do? 

What will be our salvation? World War III, Veganism, a globally reformed agriculture system, synthetic food..?
