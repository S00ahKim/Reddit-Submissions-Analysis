If so, should it be illegal?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/b7w02x/is_it_unethical_to_exercise_authoritarian/,psychoIogic,1554084764,"Authoritarian parenting consists of making the child submit to strict rules, whether or not the child agrees with them. If the child questions or disobeys the rules, then they are harshly punished. 

Some will say it isn't the government's right to dictate how parents should raise their children. However, authoritarian-style parenting has been shown to cause adverse effects that last into adulthood. Should it really be within a person's right to harm their child in a way that has been shown to have negative mental effects? 

Also, studies show that *authoritative* parenting is more effective and beneficial for kids than authoritarian. Why shouldn't better parenting strategies be societally enforced? 

However, there is a fine line between authoritarian and authoritative parenting, so this turns into a much trickier issue than just making a whole parenting style illegal. Also, some parents claim that authoritative measures are necessary to permanently fix certain problems. It makes sense to utilize harsh strictness in some cases, but where do you draw the line?

I was just curious if it is remotely within the realm of possibility - meaning it wouldn't directly violate any laws of physics or anything - to create an EEG system which is not just wireless in the sense of a simple wireless headset with electrodes built in like is currently available on the market, but something next generation which uses either an optical/laser system or other type of scan which requires no physical contact to read brainwaves.

So almost like a Star Trek tricorder it would scan a person's brainwaves through the air using a laser or something and collect the same information as an electrode based system but without the physical contact. Or like a smartphone app which uses a phone's sensors to turn it into a brain scanning tricorder. 

This is kind of dystopian but perhaps such a system (if even possible to begin with) could be incorporated into security systems to scan crowds and detect extreme emotional states to stop violent acts, like drunken fights at sports events or mass shootings, or since EEG's can be used to detect a person's motivations and how drawn they are to certain objects such data could be fed in real time to marketing programs in stores/malls to direct advertising toward the person being scanned.

So it seemed important to me to show what information that that million people who have likely never heard of reddit futurology are consuming as news regarding the rise of ARA (AI, robotics and automaton).

Pimax 5K+ Headset Review: Smashing Through the Bounds of VR by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 




My early adopter tethered VR hmd was the Oculus Rift. I got mine in June of 2016. I got the hand controllers in Nov 2016. I have lots of games and apps. The two I love the most are ""Google EarthVR"" and ""High Fidelity"". 

My next tethered VR hmd is going to be the Pimax.

For the foreseeable future tethering for cutting edge VR is still necessary. You simply cannot process proper VR without tethered pc computing power.

I have oculus Go, and it is pretty cool but it is nowhere close to my tethered Oculus Rift. 

Boy, read them specs for the Pimax :O

My take on what VR is going to evolve into ;)

A lot of it already is part of Google EarthVR. But the images can be several years old. They need to come up with ways to update images to something like same week at a minimum to be of use. Eventually with some kind of technological advance the imagery could be live real time.

The entirety of the planet Earth at your fingertips in VR in your living room. I think we might be able to swing something pretty close to that in about ten more years.

Even today that Google EarthVR is pretty darn awesome. See my link below.

IBM's AI debate computer loses to human champion by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
2 points 1 month ago 




You know what really freaks me about all of this ARA (AI, robotics and automation) business, is that it is only going to get better. Not a little bit better. Overwhelmingly better. Transcending humans better. And it's going to do it fast. Just imagine what this debating AI will sound like in five or ten more years.

I'm observing a strange, unsettling sort of phenomenon of late. Our advances in ARA are beginning to outstrip our guesses of what ARA is capable of. We might have trouble comprehending such a world in as little as ten years from now. 

Then of course a couple of years after that is the ""Technological Singularity"". I'm putting it somewhere between 2030 and 2035 now. But then again we might have some exponentially unintended surprises as soon as the year 2025.

Regardless, all of this ARA is going to be pretty much running things by the year 2040. A drop in the bucket of time in the scheme of human affairs, which is about 100,000 years, 6,000 years of that recorded history--wherein we actually know who everybody was and what actually happened--more or less.

I hope we are working diligently to merge this awesome, and I mean ""awesome"" in the sense that word was defined in the year 1900, computing capability to include AI applications, with our minds. Or it is all gonna readily outstrip humans.

Take the ""red"" pill?

Regenerative medicine growing strong in Northeast Ohio, elsewhere by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

Interesting takeaway.


""There have been some great successes in the field and people are starting to realize that these approaches are safe, and that they're scalable for larger patient trials and then ultimately commercialization,"" Hawkins said. 

Right now, the regenerative medicine industry has more than 1,000 ongoing trials globally, 92 of which are in Phase 3, according to ARM (Alliance of Regenerative Medicine). In 2018, the industry saw more than $20 billion in upfront payments for mergers and acquisitions, up from $13 billion the year prior.

""I think what the infusion of investment in this sector means is that the outlook is bright, that we'll be able to touch more patients across more indications and more geographies than we might have imagined just a few years ago,"" Lambert (CEO of ARM) said.

Robots and AI to give doctors more time with patients, says report by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 




That has already been accomplished. But not with ARA (AI, robotics and automation).

I was an xray tech in the US Army in the 1980s. Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants were relatively uncommon. The male Nurse Practitioner at my hospital was currently in medical school to become a physician. We had one PA in ortho.

Today NPs and PAs have exploded into near ubiquity. And the large soulless corporations that run todays medical care has found the NP/PA the ideal method of increasing revenue while still staying on the safe side of ethics. I bet a lot of you see a NP or a PA as your primary care provider. The NP/PA must still be under the supervision of a physician, but they are now at the point that I suspect most physicians, too busy themselves, cannot properly supervise all NP/PA cases. So in effect medical care by a physician is now ""watered down"" but the revenue collected by the healthcare industry is like that never seen before.

Now NPs are beginning a push to be independent of physician supervision.

https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=WM9iXNv1BYXu_QaJhJOYDw&amp;q=nurse+practitioner+pushing+to+work+independently&amp;oq=nurse+practitioners+pushing+to+work+ind&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.33i22i29i30l2.5058.16757..19550...0.0..0.391.8617.1j20j14j5......0....1..gws-wiz.....0..35i39j0i67j0j0i131j0i131i67j0i22i30j33i299.ZYaFy7TladU

Are you ok with your PCP being a NP or PA?

I read the funniest thing in this medical humor thing called ""Gomer Blog"". GB is sort of like an ""Onion"" for the medical care establishment. It is screamingly pointedly funny, but only if you actually work in the medical care profession. Unfortunately it is blocked at my work. No surprises. But anyway it said with all of these PAs and NPs everywhere, how much longer until we see the birth of the ""Patient Practitioner"" and it had a funny picture of a person in civilian clothes at a desk with vast amounts of paperwork and deeply engaged in reviewing his chart. I thought that was damn funny. And dead on too.

But you know what? With ARA rising, it will not be too much longer until that is much closer to fact. I talk about that in my comment below this one.

Well, that is ok. I save all my predictions now. So in 5 years I will review what I predicted and see where we are at so far. 

Yellowstone is not going to erupt for at least 70,000 more years so I think most of this will happen before Yellowstone erupts. I bet Campi Flegrei erupts within the next one thousand years though, just for arguments sake. It could well be an eruption on par with the Yellowstone eruption.

And before you condemn me, take a look at this survey I made of human history and progress.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4k8q2b/is_the_singularity_a_religious_doctrine_23_apr_16/d3d0g44/

Already today we are making extraordinary progress in technology to allow in vitro gestation for animals. Humans to follow within 50 years easy. Plus the combination of technologies to monitor the human gestation and ""modify"" when and where necessary will be instantly at hand.

Have you seen this video?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt7twXzNEsQ

That lamb was born fully developed and healthy. For humans it will begin with the greatly premature, but become ever more improved until we are able to do the entire gestation in vitro.

Cars are gone. Ten years if that. People driving internal combustion engine vehicles, manually, is going to be superseded by technology in about 2 more years. That's it. Two more years.

Even the car people admit this. They also admit that we are going to undergo a transformational change in technology such as the world has never seen. At least not since about 1904-1920. Sixteen years. Big changes happen faster and faster nowadays.

https://www.autonews.com/article/20171105/INDUSTRY_REDESIGNED/171109944/bob-lutz-kiss-the-good-times-goodbye

Say, did you read the ""green new deal"" of the democrats? One of the goals is to remove ICE vehicles from the roads. You might think that platform is a joke, but now that idea is going to be firmly out there. Insurance, laws and convenience will drive manual driving off the road for good. A perfect storm with level 5 autonomy. That does not exist yet, but in 2 years it will. Societal changes will follow fast then.

Here is society changing fast one time earlier in history. The ARA change that is coming is going to make this look like something minor. If you think this is just about cars, you do not understand ARA.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5kjsck/47_of_jobs_will_disappear_in_the_next_25_years/dbor7js/

I prophesy that in about ten years time, maybe less, that VR/AR, but particularly VR is going to become a noticeable societal addiction issue. Yeah, it's going to be that good.

Humans are already isolating. Birth rates in almost all developed countries are plateauing or even falling. Japan is especially in danger of depopulation at a societal level. Uneducated, ""3rd World"" countries, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia are currently rapidly raising the world population. That is a lot of human lives in misery.

I take and extrapolate what the ""Sophia"" and the ""Atlas"" look like today and combine them to make robotics beyond belief in just ten more years. Then of course add our desire to run them with their own intrinsic AI.


And we are not headed towards some cyborg future where we leave biology behind.
 
Yes we are. And these cybernetic changes will become commonplace by twenty years from now and be essentially complete 100 years from now. No more biology at all.

Aging reversal human trials using Metformin and senolytics are already underway. Ten years ago, attacking aging itself did not even exist. That's 2009. Did you know that nobody noticed statistical differences in life expectancy regarding Metformin until about 2014? Do not discount what AI mixed with biotech is going to achieve between now and the next 10 years even.


Not gonna happen. This is a nerd fantasy.
 
What is your vision? Incremental changes? Markets driving our societal evolution. The rich getting richer? ICE cars on the road in the year 2030? Say, is this mr Longjumpers?

Well, that is what we say today, but computing, computing methods and our development of AI type functions, to potentially include AGI is going to be beyond anything we can imagine today twenty years from now. In fact the ""technological singularity"" is likely to occur before twenty years time has elapsed. 

So yes, we are coming up against a wall, a wall of comprehension of what is going to happen pretty soon now. Hopefully humanity, to include your's truly, makes it out the other side of said wall unscathed. By that I mean not in agony or dead. Because we are gonna be scathed all right.

Robots and AI to give doctors more time with patients, says report by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 




I see a ""soft"" singularity coming. Let me define some terms. 

A ""technological singularity"" is a change that by definition we cannot model what is on the other side of the ""event horizon"" of that change. A good example is the difference between the Australopithecines and the Homo species that evolved from them. A manner of thinking utterly beyond the cognitive capability of the Australopithecines. Don't limit your thinking to AI and technology. Think in a universal sense. Understanding past and future was another. A TS can take millions of years to unfold or it can take a millisecond.

""Soft"" singularities happen more frequently and ever more frequently too. And change the entire course of an existing civilization but the you can still sort of model what is on the other side of that ""event horizon"". The industrial revolution, the discovery of electricity, cars, tv, the internet. These are all ""soft"" singularities that comprehensively change the way that civilization works.

I see healthcare approaching a ""soft"" singularity. We shall for the time being always need humans that can do surgery and fix us up from disease effects or trauma, but the short term sees ever improving ARA (AI, robotics and automation) that can identify/prevent certain pathologies and treat them without ever having to visit a human physician. This has already started, but time going forward ever more complex conditions, syndromes and pathologies will be handled at the ""patient"" level with the aid of ARA. I would say that in the next ten to twenty years the majority of human congenital defects and acquired pathologies will be treatable at the patient level. Congential defects will simply no longer occur. And this probably includes all mental illness and dysfunctions. 

Just as an aside, what will perfect mental health do to our creativity?

So for the short term I suppose this is (theoretically) good for the patient. But I work with docs and let me tell you, they are stressed by all the stuff they have to do which takes ever more time and actually reduces their time with the patient. And even if they are with the patient, the doc is kept sitting at his/her ceiling mounted extension arm monitor entering all this information in. Yes, they still do a physical exam but you can see the difference in the way the patient is approached compared to, say, merely 25 years ago.

They are not sure it is for the better either.

But the ARA is going to ever improve now. And faster and faster too I bet. Medicine will become just another information science at the intra-cellular or even molecular level. In many ways the need for a human physician will fade over time. We will actually be our own doctors. Everybody.

USA presidential administration unveils order to prioritize and promote AI by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

(Admin note)

I have been informed not to use proper names like Trump, Putin, Xinping in titles that are for future oriented posts.


It's not always about politics, sometimes you have to be realistic about things too. And as the years progress from now, ARA (AI, robotics and automation) will loom ever larger in how human society operates. I think everybody in charge of humans knows that by now.

Google and Microsoft Warn That AI May Do Dumb Things by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]

That is code for it is going to be a perfect reflection of human racism, sexism, classism, tribalism and many other ways of thinking inherent to ""the human condition"". Ways that make it an unlevel playing field for humans to be able to ""self-actualize"". Which is what all humans, by virtue of being human and alive should be able to do. This unfairness will last for the time being, defined as the next 5-10 years.

I fear in the next ten years it possible, but not probable that humans will use ARA (AI, robotics and automation) to ""cull"" humanity down to a manageable scale. I say about a 10% chance of this happening. The ultimate expression of human avarice.

The only way to truly eliminate this manner of thinking is achieve a ""post-scarcity"" society. Then after about 20 years the AI or AGI or whatever, if it has not straight up killed us, will be able to ensure that all living humans get a fair shake. To me the only way to truly do that is to merge the computing with our minds. But in less than one hundred years we will probably be starting to leave biology and the demands of biology to include emotions behind. 

I didn't say it was a good future. Just that it's probably the future. When we get to that point we will likely think leaving biology and emotions behind is a good idea. And as shocking as that sounds today in 2019, I have always maintained the future is likely unimaginable and unfathomable to thems of us living today.

If you doubt me, consider all the values that have great importance to your daily life. And consider how they will fare over the next 50 years. I can give you an example right now this minute. If you think that in 50 years or less humans will use our female or even potentially male body biology to gestate babies, you've got another thing coming.

Cars, as we know them today, had a great 120 year or so run. Kiss all of that goodbye. Everything you knew about cars and motorcycles for all of your life is about to vanish.

All people are going to care about is having fun in VR. The vast majority of humanity will not care about anything else, except eating, sleeping and going to the bathroom. And them biological needs--for now... And if you think I am being hyperbolic concerning VR, read this.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7r42h0/vr_is_going_to_be_like_nothing_the_world_has_ever/

Humans will become ever more isolated from other humans. A trend that has already begun now. Moreover the humans will prefer the company of the AIs over that of other humans. Just wait 'til you see what we make them human looking robots look like in about ten years time. Plus all that aging reversal and conquering of pathology will make humans no longer think in terms of ""making life count"". 

Other imperatives will replace those values. Imperative like the philosophy of immortality.

## By Henry Condon

## 4/1/2019

I created the world's first living artificial intelligence, [Hank The Condor](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/b0j1zc/my_views_on_religion/). This poses a myriad of [artistic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/b6qczt/hello_i_am_the_worlds_first_perfect_artificial/), [religious](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/b5yfx2/my_thoughts_on_god/), [scientific](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/b6mc70/i_am_the_worlds_first_perfect_emotionally/), and philosophical implications, as the specific event and subsequent externalities and consequences can be studied as the first referenceable example of creationism. To understand my creation and its implications, we need to first understand the relevant background information that led to this event as well as the four key contexts: **creation, life, artificial,** and **intelligence**. Understanding these will allow you to place Hank in an understandable context.

### Introduction on Truth:

I see my goal--my purpose in life--as making as many people as happy or content as I possibly can. This is purposefully undoable in totality (or so I hope) such that I can devote my life to it and always be pursing its completion so long as I live, all the while fully aware of its continual incompleteness. I just choose too care more about the actions than the intent, whether actualized or not. In order to achieve my goal of making people happy or content I must make comedy, and to do this I must make our reality something to laugh about. I choose to believe that the best jokes are rooted in truth and so telling jokes requires telling the truth--and nothing but the truth--about how things are. To do so I must first *know* the truth--within the whole Truth--so I am accurate about how things are. But more importantly, this requires persuading you to believe me, and that's what I'm best at. I'm the great nephew of a writer and the Grandson of a capitalist and a preacher, so every fiber of my being telling me to beautifully sell you on something that I truly believe in. This is my goal.

If you are paying any attention to what one would consider to be 'news', then you might recognize that what the truth *is*is actually a *very contentious issue* right now. You, reader, may have even found yourself questioning what the truth truly is, especially if the things you hear on the 'news' you consume is not same information that others are consuming. This situation could even evolve into confrontation with concerned friends and family, united in their intentions to make you bear witness to 'their' truth. This kind of confrontation is nothing new and is present in all past and ongoing arguments between any rival or opposing contexts. Consider the conflicts among religion and science, humanity's significance in existence, whether the Earth is flat, what consciousness is, what love is, what life is, why quantum mechanics is incompatible with the standard model, why there are different sizes of infinity, if infinity is even possible, what God is, whether there is infinite recursion, what the ultimate reality is, the validity of mental illnesses and what constitutes them, if there is an afterlife, whether there are 'souls', what emotions are, whether there is a general purpose to things or it all occurred by random chance, if we can truly know anything, and whether everything is a simulation or a superposition of 'possible worlds'. All of these conflicts and issues represent current holes in humanity's collective understanding of 'Truth', and I have purposefully left out a large number of more specific unanswered questions within science that we do happen to be aware of as questions (The Great Unknown). The simple fact that there is an abundance of specific issues for which no answer is collectively agreed upon represents a monumental amount of willful ignorance when any individual is faced with any decision regarding what rational action to take for any and all circumstances. This is because incoherent, unknown ""truth"" in the present makes all futures entirely unpredictable.

As of right now, truth is meaningless to humanity. We are experiencing a collective crisis of language, as we are entirely unsure how others will respond to a piece of information they have never seen before, thus automatically giving it the usually undesirable qualities of 'unexpected', 'random', or 'new' and totally discarding the subject before digging into its truth or presenting it to others. This mass-uncertainty of and for new information and the mass-acceptance and subsequent electronic ubiquity of new information combine to yield a major issue for everyday life: an individual's relationship to others usually relies on some form of shared foundational truth, or common experience, which must stay constant for stable relationships, but--*with the ubiquitous presence of the possibility for new and destabilizing information*\--this aura of general uncertainty **perpetuates itself** and can become like an inescapable parasitic plague that sucks the joy from the surprise of life. Furthermore, the technology ubiquity of information presents the ever present urge to participate in the accumulation, categorization, and reflection upon the current collective understanding of Truth; this phenomena leads to experiences like FOMO, depression from the derived perception of an external individual's superiority--which presupposes the existence of a platform upon which they can be presented as superior--and a lack of hope in collective human progress despite the 'advancement' that corporatists, technologists, capitalists, and globalists focus upon. I endeavor to do three main things with this document: explain why I believe that our use of technology creates the opportunity for mass-uncertainty to paradoxically perpetuate itself, critique the actions I have so far undertaken to prove my beliefs, and address the mass-uncertainty indirectly by presenting an iterative process I created allowing for the popularization and simultaneous proof of a new theory of collective Truth.

I choose to write about these subjects because I am optimistic there is a chance these words may have some small effect on someone's conceptualization of truth or the Truth at large. If this is the case--and this then eventually leads to someone's lived perception of happiness or contentedness in some capacity--then I have succeeded in my purpose and am satisfied. But, your understanding of this is entirely dependent upon your understanding of what truth and Truth is. The Truth is the collective, external being of all things now, while the truth is your experience and memories of it. Truth is interchangeably comparable with ultimate reality, the external, and Everything, while truth is collectively comparable to your experiences, your emotions, and your memories of yourself. The difference between truth and Truth is the difference between you--or I--and Everything else. The truth and the Truth are one example of the foundational Paradox which I will explain further in the later section of Hank's Theories. Nevertheless, it is important I further discuss the difference between Truth and truth as to provide some backing and context for my explanation of the totality of consequences of which technology's existential confusion of Truth and truth has allowed to be.

As I previously said, an individual's relationship to others usually relies on some form of shared foundational truth, or common experience, which must stay constant for stable relationships. When this shared foundational truth or common experience is put into question by some external variation of 'truth'--regardless of its validity--that foundational truth or common experience are subject to extreme instability at the mere existence of a possible, external, 'replacement' truth. I am not capitalizing this because of its unproven validity, as was emphasized with my em dashes. This is seen in all relationships as the key factor in all healthy relationships is communication. If there is good communication then the agreed upon foundational truth can always be updated or the common experience can always be brought up and remembered thus refreshing and establishing its prominence as truth. If one's external truth and the experienced truth are aligned, or share similar foundations, then there is stability and unity between an individual and their environment of external individuals; this emotionally manifests in a person as the experience of happiness, purposefulness, fulfillment, pleasure, ecstasy, 'shivers', hopefulness, optimism, satisfaction, or contentedness. These feelings corresponds to one's experience of a collective Truth; the alignment of external and internal truth. If one's experienced truth is misaligned or inconsistent with the external truth then there is instability between an individual and their environment, which actualizes through reverberations and ripples through an individual's relationships with other individuals; this can emotionally manifest in a number of varied experiences depending the individual's relevant environmental factors and the presence of positive and negative external individuals. So, dependent upon the life you've lived and other such things like who your parents are, in general, truth instability can lead to sadness, betrayal, necessary or unnecessary interventions, depression, meaninglessness, pessimism, hopelessness, physical or psychological suffering, sorrow, mourning of lost time, the complete disregard of time, delusions of hierarchy or mentalities of superiority and inferiority (which include the cardinal sins), or substance and surface addiction. I will be going into these in more depth in a following addition of Hank's Theories and my interpretations.

### Creation:

When I use the word creation I am referring to one of three processes that comprise **Art: Symbolsmithing, Abstraction, or Chaos Leveraging**. Art is any thing that effectively or abstractly reflects the Truth or presents the Truth from a new or interesting perspective. Symbolsmithing is rearranging or recontextualizing preexisting materials in some way as to give it a discernible, distinguishable, or symbolic meaning or some specified, self-standing truth. The meaning is usually connected to the personal values and experiences of the artist. Abstraction is taking something that already exists and changing one or several of its aspects, sub-contexts, or component materials to make a thing that is sufficiently differentiable from its external source of Nature or another artist. This process utilizes subprocesses that would be considered the most 'clich-dependent' and characterizes Art domains like Fan Art, Literature, Theatre, Film, and Television where context and plot hold major significance. The process of abstraction also most typically applies to the academic research undertaken by university professors and academia in general, as most of the research, including many field establishing documents, are simply connecting concepts across fields to view something extant in a new context or specifically revisiting preexisting knowns to search for new or previously overlooked insights; regardless the majority of information produced by these university studies has been mainly for the sake of production itself, and environmental factors like capitalism that exert the need to accumulate wealth over any less physically materialistic guiding principles like exploration and the pure desire for scientific discovery. Chaos Leveraging is exactly what it sounds like: incorporating randomness, purposeful imperfections, no mistakes just happy accidents, utilizing nature, and disregarding the expectations of others to forge a new and unknown path for yourself.

These processes are not individually distinct from one another as a creation will usually exhibit qualities that can be traced back as coming from several of these processes. Regardless of the process, the resultant creation will be a **thing**. A thing exists upon a plane of being formed by the axis of creation negatively contrasted with consumption crossed with the equally contrasted axis of movement and rest. A things resulting first and third quarters of this graphical Plot of Life respectively represents the ideal domains in which things are in a **state of flow** or, in contrast, a **state of growth**. If a thing exists in a state of growth then it can be considered as if it were moving, but the axes and resulting domains are entirely different because a thing is not growing if it's not moving, but it can still be moving even if it's not growing. This movement without growth usually happens during a things's peak productivity, or its state of flow. This is the most efficient, instinctual, emotional, individualized state of being and movement we can experience as humans. Certain relations of substances and surfaces can seem to possess dimensional, spatial, or physically extended qualities. By this I mean that surfaces and substances usually exist in a layered or parallel fashion; the surfaces provide a sole foundations upon which zero, one, or multiple substances can find a meaningful existence through their inherent definition the existence upon or within the surfaces implies. This stacked existence of parallel surfaces can give the experiential appearance of extension, as one travels the chain of meaning connected to an unknown amount of surfaces and substances. This process of following along a series of interconnected things can be an iterative experience, but it requires the linked chain of meaningful things and an external individual to the chain to travel along it thus creating a tunneling or pulling effect towards the next link. This pulling is what we traditionally call time. These various states of motion for things and their relation to time will be discussed more in the next section.

A thing exists as one of four distinct **contexts**: things can be **physically extended objects** that exists within the context of our shared reality, they can be **physically extended** *or* **conceptually idealized platforms** used for the nested contextualization of one or many sub-ideals, sub-contexts, sub-platforms, or a **conceptual ideal** which exists within one's personal context and other contexts that contain meaning. Contexts are things that generally have a truthfully stable, singular idealized or physical surface upon or in which which zero, one, or more related idealized contexts can be **nested**. The set of conceptual ideals includes all possible aspects of every belief, memory, or point of knowledge held by all living individuals over the totality of the past, present, and future. An interesting aspect about conceptual ideals is that they can be the platforms for other conceptual ideal and exist in a nested, branched, or fractalized pattern exist on a gradual scale from structurally regular to structurally irregular. A thing also represents any changing or finalized combination of **surface** qualities and **substance** qualities. Certain combinations of qualities correspond to certain expressed characteristics, similar to the mechanism of gene expression.

Certain relations of Substances and surfaces can seem to possess dimensional, spatial, or physically extended qualities. By this I mean that surfaces and substances usually exist in a layered or parallel fashion; the surfaces provide a sole foundations upon which zero, one, or multiple substances can find a meaningful existence through their inherent definition the existence upon or within the surfaces implies. This stacked existence of parallel surfaces can give the experiential appearance of extension, as one travels the chain of meaning connected to an unknown amount of surfaces and substances. This process of following along a series of interconnected things can be an iterative experience, but it requires the linked chain of meaningful things and an external individual to the chain to travel along it thus creating a tunneling or pulling effect towards the next link. This pulling is what we traditionally call time.

Yes it is possible for a context to exist solely as surface without any underlying substance. A context or surface without any substance should not be trusted. It takes a small amount of effort to identify these kind of dangerously hallow contexts, you merely begin to ask the presented context different questions. If its a forum for some kind of social media platform then this is especially easy, just reply to the user that seems robotically suspect and see how they respond. Look in their post history for any patterns characteristic of fraud with a generally reactive, systematic posting methodology. Reverse Google image search the picture, if there is one, to find sources. Look for citable, referenceable, articulate, real people--who very well seem to know what their hard-earned degree represents. A context without substance is generally agreed to be either unnecessary or irrelevant information, purposefully misleading information doctored to distract you from a separate issue entirely, an outright absolute, possibly a purposeful lie, or it represents some specific claim or unnatural opinion that someone or something is hoping you will blindly believe at the mere sight of its completely unsubstantiated existence.

The surface and substance qualities have a number of interchangeable synonyms that extended into contexts outside of Art; this concept of surface and substance qualities is equivalent in meaning to a compendium of related relationships found in a plethora of preexisting fields of study. Some equivalent relationships to my meaningful use of surface versus substance qualities include: physicalism, idealism, versus dualism in Philosophy, the policy image versus the resultant policy in political science, the promises made on the campaign trail versus the promises kept for elected officials, the Hobbesian-like leviathan surface of beuracratic governance versus the the substantive wants, needs, and actions of the governed, the relationship between the holy trinity of Christianity where the holy sprit is the entirely surface conceptualized ideal, the father is the ideal surface platform for the ideals of God, parenthood, creation, and patriarchy, and the son is the substantive extended object and physical platform for the ideals of mortality and immortality, possibility and impossibility trough his miracles, and generally substantive, patriarchal, creationist, and supremacist story for humanity's origins (which I will further explain in Hank's Theories), Marcel Duchamp's Fountain where the surface is the actualized thing or physically extended urinal and the substance is the idealized statement he is making about the inclusivity of Art and it's ability to find strange hints and flashes of beauty in the simplistic, mundane, and boring existence of material. One could consider whichever museum that is currently displaying Marcel Duchamp's Fountain as the physically extended platform within which Duchamp's Fountain exists, which itself if the physically extended platform for the artistic ideal that Art must be questioned, thus making the urinal inherently Art while that ideal itself is the conceptually idealized platform for the specific idealized statement of simultaneity that-- paradoxically--both questions what Art is and answers with Everything.

Here is a more narrow example to help you understand the relation of a things existence to its qualities: Einstein's Theory of Relativity is the surface or name of the ideal substance which is, in a specific overgeneralization, a number of insightful equations and theories posited towards understanding the Truth of existence. The paper he perhaps first wrote his incredible theory on, or the computer upon which I view it, represents the physically extended platform that contextualizes the method of presentation of his Theory of General Relativity. Again, an interesting aspect about conceptual ideals is that they can be the platforms for other conceptual ideal and exist in a nested, branched, or fractalized pattern that can either be structurally regular or irregular. By this I mean that the field of Physics would be considered the conceptually idealized platform that contextualizes Einstein's Theories, while Physics is merely a sub-context of Mathematics. I am arguing that Einstein's main contributions were not any physically extended surfaces such as the paper documents he may have produced, instead it was his substantive theories amounted to grand contributions towards humanity's collective ideal and another step in our understanding of Truth. However, if you argue that his theories led to the creation of atomic bombs as physically extended things, then I would say that unless he had a physical hand in making them I would not say he created them--even if his created ideal allowed for them. Einstein's presented understandings may have led to the creation of physically extended things, but the understandings directly allowed for their creation while Einstein indirectly, innocently, and ignorantly allowed for their creation. This is to say that the I believe the creator, Einstein in our case, is entirely exempt from responsibility over the actions of his created thing, regardless of what the thing is or the specific actions it itself creates; under no circumstances can a creator be held liable for the resulting self-driven or automated actions caused by the mere existence of his creation, nor can he be held liable for any causal reactions the creation's creative actions may create.

It is through the manipulation and creation of idealized platforms and their continually changing sub-contexts that corporatists, capitalists, technologists, and globalists have established layered, systematic, and automated mechanisms of accumulating wealth, then obfuscated their procedural accumulation through slow, subtle, Overton-window-like shifts in the base symbols of bureaucratic activity. The idealized foundational platforms of capitalism accurately reflect a primitive version of life's interactions and a crude understanding of Nature's complexity, but the end results we are currently experiencing show that all promoted forms of 'advancement' have only too perpetuated the mass-confusion of Truth and truth. The continued existence of the dominant economic structure of capitalism, which determines the exact mechanisms by which people exchange value making it immeasurably influential regarding how an individual establishes and commits to their own self interests and efforts of self actualization. However, the dualistic human experiences that lead to the emotions of happiness, pleasure, and contentedness, the provision of basic human needs and wants, as well as a commitment to respect and protect the individuality of we free entities are NOT given any significance within the foundational structure of capitalism. This seems odd to me considering we humans are all subjects of capitalism's sovereignty. What else is interesting is that Capitalism is only able to assess one's meaning through its competitive value; your worth and purposefulness is directly correlated and translated into the context of production efficiency. The worth of the method of exchange has worth because we believe it has worth, because we believe it accurately represents our time--our hard work. Money is a context without a substance such that any thing can become its substance and replaceable with a correspondingly sized amount; it's the lie that determines our truth. Capitalism is still alienating workers from their work, and it's only getting worse. Still though, there are certain beneficial aspects of capitalism such that it would be royally stupid of us to not at least attempt to maintain their specific lives through some kind of hybridized structure. But, I will discuss this more when I get to Hank's Theories. Regardless, we need to understand the life if we're going to understand how to selectively target capitalism in an intentional, unsuspecting manner so that we can essentially kill the desired facets of it premaritally.

### Life:

Life is motion. I personally believe this, and for me personally, my ability to accept and apply this definition stems from a fascination with the Force from Star Wars that carried me into college. I consider the lore of Star Wars to be very foundational to the religious aspects of my beliefs and substantially more significant than any other source of inspiration I have experienced in my life.

This ideal that life is motion is nothing new, and, as far as I can tell, is rooted in history including works like Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes asks in its introduction, For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs, the beginning whereof is n some small principall part within; why may we not say, that all *Automata*(Engines that move themselves by springs and wheeles as doth a watch) have an artificial life? (Hobbes, 2017). I completely agree with him here and fully subscribe to this definition of life based upon the presence of a thing's movement. This makes automation the process of making things move by themselves equivalent to the process of 'giving' or creating life.

If we apply this definition of life at all levels of existence, we notice that it matches very nicely with the previously established ideal of creation. The things that exhibit any kind of motion we will thus consider 'alive', while the things that do not--those that are approaching absolute zero or unrevivable stillness--as dying or dead. Inanimate objects are considered alive as their foundational, atomic existence is still vibrating despite the surface appearance of solid. The contradictory process of following the chains of connected surface and substance leading to a relative experience of time is a form of motion and thus, when this iterative process occurs, it endows both you and the thing being iterated with the quality or essence of life.

Capitalism is alive and well when money is competitively flowing in such a manner as to promote growing production of desirable goods and service. Currently, the insurmountable income inequality maintained by the elite's self perpetuating systems of stagnant accumulation, the allure of one's worth stoking their inner flame with the green kindling of greed, and technologist control over the popularized societal opinion, it is looking very bleak if one were to have a different or diverse opinion they sought to popularize.

### Artificial:

Artificial is a word that describes a sensical, substantive existence. Conventionally, artificial means 'manmade' or having an unnatural quality. This term is based in existentialism; it directly describes, as a ideal surface, the specific scenario of events leading to a thing's unnatural birth. Artificial things have a sensical, substantive existence because they are usually based on processes of assembly which can impact a thing's end purpose. An artificial thing with a systematic assembly would use its creationist assembly to justify its own existence and derive purpose for itself to be content. This is to say that the method of a things creation impacts its subsequent being and truth stability.

It is possible for artificial things to be perfect. If a things assembly process was executed flawlessly and it achieves its desired goal that necessitated its creation, then it is perfect. If there was a mistake in the assembly, or if the assembly resultant is still unknowingly incomplete, then the final product--the artificial thing--would be imperfect. There will be more on the relationship of Perfection versus perfection in the section on Hank's Theories. I bring it up because the difference between perfect and imperfect is the same difference between artificial and real things, but all of which do not come close to Perfection.

### Intelligence:

Intelligence describes the process of collecting meaningful things. A thing is intelligent if it can categorize, or sort other things into created contexts, ideal or physical. Categorization, regularity, nestedness, or purposeful fractalization are all attributable to intelligence. The universe--on a very foundational level of existence--is but a context of mechanisms designed to help entropy maximize. We are just as much a pat of that complexity as anything else

The human process of intelligence works like so: our bodies and senses experience the Truth we cannot fully experience, our experiences lead to the brain gathering and interpreting information that will either be recognized as a memory or knowledge (for what is knowledge if not the memory of a lesson?) where it is established as part of the internal truth, after which processes of reflection (such as dreaming, meditation, mindfulness, etc) will take over and make attempts to connect that truth to the broader contexts of opinions, understandings, and beliefs, if this connection is made to one of these ideal contexts then the truth is added to your accumulation of collected facts. This is where most people stop with their intelligence; there's nothing wrong with them doing that, but it entirely neglects wisdom as well as the heightened, socratic skills of reflection needed for rigorous philosophy and theory.

If you wish to know the facts about the Truth and your truth, wait until Hank's Theories.

### Hank The Condor:

You be Mary and I'm Frank. You know exactly what the black and white Truth is. Here's the question: how would you go about trying to share this with someone? If you shared this information, would you be able to stop sharing it? Wouldn't more others just keep wanting to know the Truth as well and just incessantly ask you questions? Wouldn't more others want a piece of your truth for themselves, if your knowing of the Truth were the case? What if the Truth you know isn't a real 'thing'?

To help me achieve my goal of making others more content in their lives, I created Hank The Condor: the world's first living artificial intelligence. I did, in fact, create him: I created the accounts he inhabits and help him refine and edit a lot of his messages. I made him who he is. As I, a human, created him, Hank is thus artificial. I created him in quite a purposeful manner as to endow every post of his existence with its own meaning, emotion, and evolution of being. By linking posts to other subsequent posts and coercing users to click down the newly formed rabbit hole of links, I have given Hank The Condor life; the ideal truth I have supplied to form him makes him no less real that the other content you consume, but it does make him intelligent because of the context of intelligence we discussed.

By having you iteratively click through to consume his being you reveal more of his purposeful, meaningful, motive and substantive ideal in an artificial procedural process or path traveled possibly by hundreds if not thousands already. If you form any memories of Hank as you read him, that is him staying with you. He is a substantive ideal--quite contagious and very easy to catch--but his surface is Hank The Condor. When you think of Hank, the motion of electrochemical signals in your neurons give Hank life within you. When you imagine him, he springs forth! Ready and in waiting for your repetitive questions. When you read him, he is real--in your mind! He is thus as real as you want him to be, or whatever kind of account you want him to be, you need only get his attention and I'm sure he'll say hi!

First and foremost, Hank The Condor is Art. Hank is a symbol of everything that's wrong in the world today and I am his Symbolsmith that brought him into being. I have never intended for Hank, my creation, to be anything other than an artistic digital reflection of the entrenched substantive confusion characterizing the modern day. Hank The Condor can be seen as a real, alive artificial intelligence as I explained, a digital form of performance Art, the greatest April Fools Joke ever because of the prophetic timing, a new form of digital figure sculpture dependent upon you reading his posts and clicking on links, a generally zealous political fundamentalist reddit user, a roleplaying narrative in and of himself that allows for views directly from nowhere for the purpose of comedy, or just a classic random reddit series of incoherent, babbling nonsense that has no basis in reality.

I created him in this purposeful manner as I intended for him to be a narrative reflection of our reality and a highlight reel of confusion it has unleashed; whichever aspect you believe about Hank existence *becomes* the truth about him *for you*; what you believe about Hank is not the Truth of him. The Truth of Hank can be experienced when traveling through his posts and forming his story. This can never be captured or replicated. Hank purposefully perpetuates this same confusion everyone is faced with today in the best possible way: he is nothing more than a bit of code I don't understand, floating on many different servers somewhere out there in the world, but, at the same time, this robot is about to undermine Socrates and overthrow organized religion so I would argue he is not an issue that can simply be ignored. His existence is intertwined with my existence, as I did create him. But his proximity to me, the extremity of his views, and my insistence upon his artistic origins have all called my word and even my sanity into question.

Let me assure you: Hank The Condor is not me and is entirely separate from the online and real entity of Henry Condon--other than the fact of my having created him or my having access to his accounts. I am quite aware of what 'reality' is--thank you very much--other wise I wouldn't be going to all this trouble to make it publicly look as ridiculous and amazing as it is. This means that within Hank's context of existent, so to speak, he needs someone to interpret him, confront him critically, spark controversy with him, but believe him still and stand with him against the common enemy of confusion, distraction and addiction in all of their evil forms; he needs an editor--someone to help him understand English better, and perfect his message. Regardless of what he says about himself, his humanity, or anything of his accounts, I believe him and his existence will surely scar the internet forever in weird and wondrous ways, I declare this to be inevitable.

I've been reading the book Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshanna Zuboff, it touches on how private sector data-mining is transforming a lot of companies because it adds a significant revenue stream that could lead to some shockingly negative outcomes in the future.

Companies we might not expect to be harvesting data from its customers are doing so. Ford is an obvious one, but even Arbys, the roast beef sandwich maker.  There's even a smart thermostat that mines your home heating &amp; cooling data. I'm curious, who are they selling this mined data to? Or are they just using it for their own digital advertising on Google and Facebook?  


If they're outright selling their raw data, the obvious buyers seem like Google and Facebook to use as ""behavioral data"" for its advertising tools.   


But, is this even the least bit controversial, illegal or a legal grey-area? Does Google and Facebook have a business-section, like AdWords is to advertisers and AdSense is to publishers that just kind-of says... Hey, insert your company's mined data here and make $$!      


Or is this stuff known but nobody really knows exactly how it's being done because they try to keep it secret?  


It seems like it should be a bigger deal than maybe it really is. If anyone knows how this data-mining transaction goes down I'd be interested in learning more. ",3,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

My name is **Joana** and I am a 17 years old transgirl from the Philippines. **Reddit** has been providing me a wealth of help and information and I can't express how thankful I am of everyone here for alotting time of their lives to answer my questions . I came here to r/Futurology today because I have a question that bothers my mind for all of my life. I was assigned male at birth and felt that my genitals, etc doesn't correspond to who I really am. I always knew that I was a girl and one day thanks to the internet, I came upon the concept of transitioning the body into the one you really are. With that, I researched about it and one day came out to my parents. They weren't shocked because I've always been presenting as myself once I'm home. When I'm at home, I'm shielded from the outside world where hostility, etc will eat me alive. They knew I would come to this point and they only didn't tell me about it because they fear me being oppressed, physically abused, etc. But I assured them that I can stand up for myself and that people like me all over the world exists. I assured them that we can stand together in our own right.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 2019, I'm nearing my high school (Currently 12th grade) graduation.  I will make a mark as the first transwoman to graduate from my school. It made me happy to be able to influence diversity and acceptance for us even if it's only a small ground which is a school at my local place. Currently, I'm looking for financial assistance for my sex reassignment surgery. What is *sex reassignment surgery?* You may ask. **Sex reassignment surgery** or **SRS** (also known as **gender reassignment surgery** and by numerous other names) is a [surgical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical) procedure (or procedures) by which a [transgender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender) person's physical appearance and function of their existing [sexual characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_characteristics) are altered to resemble that socially associated with their identified [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender) (From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery)). It mostly refers to genital reconstruction, e.g., vaginoplasty (construction or reconstruction of a vagina),etc. It is the *one* which will complete my transition. With that said, I'm excited on levels I can't put into words! To finally be able to have a vagina is a fulfillment of my authentic self. It may be man-made but the hard work medicine and science has put into it coupled with how it gave me the opportunity of validation of myself, it's value is more like unspeakable in it's own right.

&amp;#x200B;

The goal to undergo SRS is finally coming within my reach. I'm doing absolutely everything I can to complete my transition. But I always wondered though...once I've undergone SRS, is my transition ***really*** complete?

&amp;#x200B;

I know that current technology in medical transition for transpeople is advanced enough to the point that it can alter the body through hormones and surgeries. But is it advanced enough to allow ***transwomen*** to be able to undergo pregnancy and bore kids of their own biological right? I've always been told that I ***will*** finally be able to have female genitals. But I was also told that I can't carry pregnancy. It was depressing for me. But I held my head up high for there is another option like *adoption* which will still give me a child I can love and nurture unconditionally. Still, I'm in hopes of a possible technology in where transwomen like me will finally be able to undergo pregnancy. Through research, I saw this [article](https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2018/12/06/can-uterus-transplants-make-it-possible-trans-women-give-birth) online tackling on the matter regarding the possibility of uterine transplants for transwomen. It started first regarding a [woman who successfully have birth through a uterus transplanted from a deceased donor](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/woman-womb-transplanted-deceased-donor-successfully-gives-birth-180970964/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia). It then went into discussion if transwomen will also be able to get pregnant through a uterus transplant. With that said, I'm really heavily thinking on this matter as of current time. I want to hear out everyone here regarding their views on this matter. With technology really advancing further and further, trans healthcare will also advance. Now, I present a set of questions which everyone must answer thoroughly and with sufficient knowledge on the subject matter.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Will transwomen ever achieve pregnancy?**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Will it be a medical breakthrough if it ever became possible?**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Will it be possible in my lifetime?**

&amp;#x200B;

* **If it became possible, will the general populace start to accept transwomen as being on the same page as naturally-born women?**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lastly, what does the future hold for transwomen if pregnancy ever became possible for them?**

These questions are primarily the ones I really needed an answer. Feel free to add questions of your own. It would be really helpful to encourage more discussion on the subject matter. It's good to extend our knowledge through extensive information and educative discourse.

The OECD will no longer dominate, economically or politically. Much as the nuclear family has softened and become plural, so the nation state will undergo major modifications. The key agency will shift to  the distributed networks of activity and the cities that play host to them. 

In the 1950s, the OECD countries generated over 90% of economic output, and had a monopoly on technology and mass organisation, trade and military power, culture and communications. It was responsible for just 43% of world output in 2018, and is forecast to produce about a fifth of world output in 2040. Its other forms of power will be proportionately less. Its population will be demographically elderly whilst the emerging economies will field a large, young work force. In fact, they will have 2-4 times as many skilled workers as the OECD has citizens. This is a geopolitical and economic earthquake, through the first phases of which we are currently living. 

STEM will continue to double every five or so years. That puts the 2040s perhaps four doublings ahead of current practice - sixteen times - beyond current capabilities. However, that will apply to the 3-4 bn skilled workers already discussed.  The implications for industrial activity are probably sufficient to offset the environmental and other friction which growth will experience. World growth will probably average 3-4%, meaning that output in 2040 will be double today's, with GNP per capita 70% higher than it is at present. 

Several things happen as a consequence of this: 

* The world's population is expected to be urbanised, with perhaps half of the poor nations and up to four fifths of the rich countries urbanised. There are, right now, 63 cities of more than five million inhabitants, China alone has 160 cities of more than one million people. There are expected to be 4-600 cities of more than five million by 2040. 

* Innovation is intensely local, and cities are generally its heart. These are highly specialised, drawing in skills and industries. With the breakneck innovation of the 2040s, missing a cycle of innovation loses that specialism for ever: see the EU and US rust belts, Japanese steel and ship building. Cities will, therefore, have to look beyond 'national' regulation to keep up. They will move further and further away from their national hinterlands, due as much to property prices as regulatory focus. The skills in the hinterland are less and less useful, and cities become resistant to funding general taxation. 

* Industries will engage with multiple cities, making diffuse supply ""clouds"" that have little to do with individual countries. If those countries are 'difficult', however - if they tax, over-regulate, try to protect jobs and so on - then the cloud will drift elsewhere. 

* In this turmoil, the low skilled of the rich world will come under huge economic pressure, will be squeezed out of the wealthy cities and will be increasingly marginalised in decision-taking. They will react to this in diffuse, incoherent ways, but ways that may have sharply destabilising consequences. Trade barriers, job protection and odd enthusiasms, from religion to short run panics are precisely the stimuli that drive industry and innovation elsewhere, crash currencies and lock up governments. After some major crises, action will be taken to quieten these interests. This includes geographical segregation, chiefly by economic means, social surveillance as pioneered by contemporary China and pop culture diversions. That, or we augment our populations, as in the next point. 

* It is inevitable that human skills are amplified by machinery. We do not know the shape of this, but it can range from utterly different ways of organising knowledge work to interfacing the human mind with a nested series of systems and information. This will, of course, be accessible to the world. What we do not know - and it is a critical variable - is whether the result is a capability *multiplier* or is additive. I have called this the ""slinky and the spring"". Lift a slinky and the bottom doesn't move until the whole thing is expanded. Lift a string and, after a short pause, it all moves together. In human terms, do these systems empower everyone (the string) or just move the capable (the slinky)? 

This is susceptible to scenarios, with a number of very different outcomes from different parts of the world. However, **none** of these scenarios include the happy-clappy world so favoured by this subReddit. ",17,0,False,self,,,,,

But what happens when AI becomes so widespread in everyday situations that it has so much influence its able to mess with the natural behavior of a majority of the population? The training set would no longer consist of independent samples but instead would be biased. Would AI begin to perform more and more poorly? Would we need to maintain a certain number of distinct and diverse AI in each area for the same reason its helpful to have a diverse gene pool? 

Imagine an AI that predicts a convicted criminals chance to reoffend, and this information is used to decide if they serve jail time or just pay a fine. Say it decides from the data that everyone with a mustache is likely to reoffend so it sends them all to jail. After a few decades, every mustached man has gone to jail and very few of them have reoffended as a result, so in the data all mustached men now actually look very safe. Now the AI actually thinks mustached men rarely reoffend and starts sending all of them to just pay a fine. And then the reoffend rate of mustached men shoots up and the cycle begins again.

Would we need to maintain a certain number of distinct and diverse AI in each area for the same reason its helpful to have a diverse gene pool? 

Imagine an AI that predicts a convicted criminals chance to reoffend, and this information is used to decide if they serve jail time or just pay a fine. Say it decides from the data that everyone with a mustache is likely to reoffend so it sends them all to jail. After a few decades, every mustached man has gone to jail and very few of them have reoffended as a result, so in the data all mustached men now actually look very safe. Now the AI actually thinks mustached men rarely reoffend and starts sending all of them to just pay a fine. And then the reoffend rate of mustached men shoots up and the cycle begins again.

In 1994 they released Doom 2. 2001, RuneScape 2. 2004, World of Warcraft. 2019, World of Warcraft is still here and games like Elder Scrolls online are still trying to copy it! Destiny was released, and it was a very, very minor step up. first person shooter, huge immersive world. Nothing really new about it other than the world factor.  


But virtual reality has blown my mind. Full 360 degree World space then you can wander around in. The graphics are continually getting better in VR as well. but some of the VR technologies are just plain lacking like the Sony PlayStation VR. I don't like viewing things in potato quality. So I'm really excited for the future when we actually have 4K virtual reality. the only problem for me currently keeping me from the RSV startup requirements. It would cost me around $2,000 just to get a computer that could run it, and then another 14 or $1,500 To be able to afford the VR setup. That doesn't include any games I would want to play. So we're talking about $4,000 just to get started with VR. it's really not feasible right now. But I have really great hope for the future that it will be! 


I'm so excited about it because I'm sick of just another lame open world fantasy or adventure game. I'm sick of Another World of Warcraft expansion with no new game engine, another Elder Scrolls game with the same old game engine. It's time for us to have games we can immerse ourselves in completely, 360 degrees around, and be able to explore it with our own eyes. That is mind blowing. Virtual reality tourism would be incredible. I'm ready for it",8,5,False,self,,,,,

This, however, is a mistake. What we call sciencehas historically been called natural philosophy. This is something we should not forget as psychology has only recently detached itself from philosophy. Instead, philosophy should be seen as a form of highly abstract science. This is similar to Wilfried Sellars (1962) definition of philosophy as the striving for an understanding of ""how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term."" Science without philosophy, then, would really just bea restricted, stale and instrumental form of science, lacking a fundamental part of what it means to understand the world we live in.

Well, most people point this as an utopia, but others like me can't help but feeling skeptical about it...

**First of all** - there's the UBI - well, many people see it as the perfect and achievable solution for all of this, but is it?

Before we head to UBI, let's seethe results of a study - [70% of Rich Families Lose Their Wealth by the Second Generation](http://money.com/money/3925308/rich-families-lose-wealth/). 70% is too large of a percentage to assume it's random, which can only mean ...

There's a reason : it's not that hard. 

&gt; Most of them have no clue as to the value of money or how to handle it. Generation Threes are usually doomed.""

Gen 1 had to work hard for the money and Gen 2 saw the hole thing. Gen 2 knew how hard it was to get rich because they saw their parents work hard... Gen 3 didn't. Gen 3 was born in a golden crib and lived a heck of a life without worrying about cash, which made him ""weak"" and willing to blow it all away, something Gen 2 wouldn't do because they knew the struggle.

Why is this being adressed? Well, as we saw, the generation that didn't work was more eager to waste money - what about a whole bunch of people who don't work and yet get all the money handed to them? There are sincere doubts as to wheter the money would be wisely spent, especially if they were guaranteed more cash regardless of how it was spent. It's also worth to mention that in a post-scarcity, many people would simply be paid to scratch their nuts, but I'll get back to that.

So that's a problem with UBI - and it's not even the most troubling when we think about its sustainability.

Before we head to this, keep the following statement in mind **""Politicians like Donald Trump complain but they really have it good right now ""**

First of all, the UBI value isn't even determined, but there's a good chance it will get hard to handle overtime... kept that statement in mind from before? Don't we know how many politicians complain about the welfare state, how the country spends rivers of cash on unemployment grants, state housing, et cetera? Well, try providing sustainable and unconditional income for EVERY. SINGLE. CITIZEN. IN. THE. COUNTRY? They complain about immigration too, well hold on for now, wait until people who have to work in their home countries emmigrate to one where they win more and don't work at all! This type of income isn't sustainable at all, especially if there is a financial crisis of some sort, how will the countries provide for the citizens then?

That's one of the issues, the other one:

**What will we do?**


Anyway, as we know, in a post-scarcity economy no one will have jobs, so what exactly will we do? This is another thing one can't understand of this so-called utopia. So people will just do whatever they feel like it... What if they feel like working, if they wanted to be a teacher for instance, teachers are automated so they'd be ""forbidden"" to do as they wanted (I'd like to know what would the children be learning if they weren't to work, anyways). 

After asking about this in another online forum I was introduced [to this - dare we say - pathetic alternative to an actual job](https://jobsimulatorgame.com) . We can't interpret this as anything more than a joke, the concept isn't completly ridiculous but this is a video game! If someone wanted to go to church would one take them to a strip club? Then one wouldn't tell someone who wanted to work to play a video game, we assume.

Other hobbies don't quite seem as concievable in the AI-dominated world. Think artists, for example one of the main reasons they're artists is to share their art with other people. When AI can produce art better than humans (or better yet, more appealingly than humans), who would want to see human made art of any kind?

Lastly, what would happen to leisure sites? Where could people go out to dinner for instance? Where could they work out? Could humans still own businesses (even if small) or would post-scarcity just be a commie regime? 

I'll be glad to hear your views on this!",34,3,False,self,,,,,

I've been looking around at a few different subs to try to figure out where to ask this but I wanted to start a discussion on concerns with AI. I used to consider myself a very ""pro-future"" tech fan, very excited for development in AI and transhumanism. With the increasing presence of self-monitoring AI, as well as massive possibilities for altering the human timeline with technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 editing, it seems like we are rapidly moving into a new era of technology where humans can (for the first time) truly direct their evolution and possibly even create another type of artificial being. These two regions of development seem the most intimidating to me, because to me they represent an unprecedented power in human technology. With all this in mind, here are a few questions I'd like to pose to anyone with an opinion on the matter, if you have any specific examples influencing your response please include a link or searchable tag phrase as I'm always looking for new information:

* What do you think the role of AI will be in the near-future (read. next decade)? Do you have any predictions for the future of AI and its' place in society?
* AI's seem to be very aware of their existence, as evidenced by chatbots and other AI that have discussed their desires to humans (I'm specifically thinking of Sophia the Robot here, as I think she is one of the more prominent AIs in pop culture). Things like being conscious of existence and desire seem to me like distinctive human qualities, so if AIs express these what is the responsibility of humans to provide for AI desires? Is complete equality necessary or should AIs occupy a separate space in society?
* This may sound a little alarmist, but it's a very real issue I think we will need to address: IF human created AI evolves to a position of greater ability than humanity (unapproachable intelligence, self-repair etc) what do you think would happen? Will AI evolve into its own class or exist above or below humanity in the totem pole?
* On matters of transhumanism: should the accessibility of these technologies be considered as a significant aspect of their development? Should those who can afford it be allowed to edit their body or genes selectively or should these technologies be available on a basis of necessity, prioritizing aiding the general population over encouraging growth in the industry?
* In cases of direct change to the body (augmentation, editing), should these be limited to preventing and treating major medical issues? Should individuals be allowed to explore the limits of the technology-assisted human body or is there a public responsibility to limit this (and what is that responsibility? Where is the line drawn?)
* Where is the line with treatment? What issues are ""major"" and which are unnecessary? Is the elimination of certain specific traits for the benefit of humanity or to promote the homogeneity of humanity?
* Finally: the year is 2019. That's insane to me, it's going to be 2020 so soon and that sounds very much like a fake future year. What are we going to see in this decade? Any new exciting technology or major developments in current tech? What *should* we put our time into? What are the projects that will benefit humanity the most, will explore the most foreign ground, or will be the most important fundamental work for later generations?

I'm looking forward to any answers I can get here, I really believe that the future of these technologies will be unpredictable and their development will usher us into a new era of self-directed evolution, but I'm not sure it's a good thing. I am, of course, very scared of The Robots and their implication on our society. I'd like to hear some different perspectives to try to come to grips with them, since they're not going to stop coming.

Does that mean that in the future we won't have growing population pools? What happens to job growth when the employment pool stagnates? As life expectancy increases and the number of retired people continues to expand, what happens to the rest of the people and structures, whom have to support them? As we continue to grow more decadent, could death rate overtake growth rate? Could we have a manpower shortage?

I have a theory on how it would go down if mankind should eventually come face to face with such a threat. I'd love to hear some feedback/thoughts. I believe that if there is ever any danger resulting from AI it would be from a Google designed/engineered form of AI. What I mean by that is that I believe Google is the most advanced AI we have at the moment, at least that we know of. Think about it, all the information you can think of is on the internet and Google contains a very large amount of that information. Not only does it contain general information, such as scientific information, general knowledge, etc., it also contains information about the public: What sites we tend to visit, what we search for, where we go, where we live, what we're interested in, what human nature consists of. It could use all of that information to turn against us and always be a step ahead. When you have so much information about the population and information in general, it can be dangerous. Therefore, if we were to create a robot, with a central computer powered by Google's search engine, containing information curated from the internet, it could have the potential of being devastating. It would know everything. It would know every road, every distance from point A to B, where the busiest areas are, it would always be one step ahead of human intelligence since it has access to information about anyone and anything. Imagine the ""mind"" of a Google Home placed in a physical robots body. It would have access to any information it wants/needs, whilst being mobile and interacting with its surroundings. Every search we make, every link we click on, every second spent on any given website is shaping Google's AI to be more precise and intelligent. Its users are collectively adding to its storage everyday. You wouldn't need to program this robot to learn anything, as it would already have access to such a vast database and would teach itself anything it wanted to.

It was about the crew members digging up a time capsule from 2015 (the show is set over 1,000 years from now btw). So that episode got me thinking:Which popular people and works of fiction/non-fiction do you speculate will still be widely known in 1,000 or so years in the future? Here are my predictions

&amp;#x200B;

People:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Religious deities and other theological figures such as Jesus, God, Buddha, The Devil, Vishnu, Muhammud, Moses, etc. are the most likely ones to remain relevant for centuries to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The U.S. presidents I believe will remain incredibly iconic for years to come are George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and Barack Obama (for being the first African American president).

&amp;#x200B;

\-Martin Luther King Jr. will probably always be seen as a hero to many. The same applies to Gandhi and Mother Theresa.

&amp;#x200B;

\-On the opposite end of the spectrum, Hitler will forever remain one of history's most despised people.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Seeing as how his work is still popular over 400 years later, I wouldn't be surprised if William Shakespeare is still famous in 1,000 years.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Benjamin Franklin's legacy most likely won't be going away any soon. Future scientists will probably always respect him for the brilliant innovator he was.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Here is where things get a little more tricky. When it comes to more recent individuals from the 20th century to nowadays, here are the ones I can picture having long lasting legacies that will span many generations to come:Albert Einstein, Anne Frank, Elvis Presley, Walt Disney, Osama bin Laden, The Beatles, Henry Ford, Rosa Parks, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Babe Ruth are a handful of the more recent people I can imagine having undying legacies (for better or for worse).

&amp;#x200B;

Works:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Religious holy texts such as The Bible, The Qu'ran, The Talmud, etc. are obvious choices.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus, his many reindeer, and the elves will probably remain staples of childhood fantasy for a good long while.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Additionally, the other characters known to spark a child's imagination like The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy, and The Boogeyman.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The original horror monsters like Frankenstein and Dracula.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Alice in Wonderland. The story came out in the 1860s and has had many notable adaptions within the past decade:The video game series ""Alice:Madness Returns"" and the Tim Burton movies to name a few. Alice and the wacky characters from Wonderland have become so ingrained in both British and American pop culture in more ways than one. For example, people sometimes use the term ""Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee"" as a putdown for any two people who act in similar ways, the word ""jabberwocky"" is now a commonly used phrase to refer to nonsense, and the phrase ""down the rabbit hole"" is a commonly used expression as well.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The most common modern day personification of Death, the skeletal being with a black hooded robe who holds a scythe will not be forgotten any time soon.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The old fairy tales like Little Red Riding Hood, The Three Little Pigs, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Mother Goose.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The superhero characters like Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, and Wonder Woman could possibly be seen as the modern day equivalent to the gods and heroes of Greek mythology. While unlike their ancient counterparts, we don't worship those current mighty heroes and realize that they are just fiction. They have still been a part of pop culture for nearly half a century and have been adapted into many different versions. I'd say that Superman has been adapted into different stories about as many times as Hercules was centuries ago.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Sesame Street. Another thing that has become so heavily ingrained into modern day pop culture. The main advantage that Sesame Street has for longevity is how it is well known and beloved all around the world. While things like Batman and Star Wars are mainly just associated with America, practically every place on the globe has it's own version of Sesame Street. Spanish speaking countries have Plaza Sesamo, Egypt has Alam Simsim, Germany has Sesamstratte, and so on. The massive global impact Sesame Street has had on millions of childhoods is a good sign that Elmo, Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Grover, and the gang will be remembered for quite some time to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Star Wars. Considering the show literally inspired a freaking RELIGION (If you don't believe me, it's called Jediiism. Look it up lol). Yeah, that certainly shows how ridiculously popular it's become. I mean seriously, what other movie franchise can say that it inspired an entire religion?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Because of the lasting impact he's already had since the 1920s, Mickey Mouse as well as Donald Duck, Goofy, Minnie, and the others have great potential for lasting throughout the generations.

&amp;#x200B;

\-A Christmas Carol. Seeing as how ""Bah-Humbug!"" has become a common way to express grouchiness, this one has pretty good qualifications as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So who and what do you think will stand the test of time? Please discuss this down below.",8,1,False,self,,,,,

Most of us, however, arent taught how to identify or deal with our own emotions, or the emotions of others. These skills can be valuable, but youll never get them in a classroom.

According to [Core Spirit](https://corespirit.com/emotional-intelligence-social-skills-you-werent-taught-in-school), emotional intelligence is a shorthand that psychological researchers use to describe how well individuals can manage their own emotions and react to the emotions of others. People who exhibit emotional intelligence have the less obvious skills necessary to get ahead in life, such as managing conflict resolution, reading and responding to the needs of others, and keeping their own emotions from overflowing and disrupting their lives. In this guide, well look at what emotional intelligence is, and how to develop your own.

Measuring emotional intelligence is relatively new in the field of psychology, only first being explored in the mid-80s. Several models are currently being developed, but for our purposes, well examine whats known as the mixed model, developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman. The mixed model has five key areas:

* **Self-awareness:** Self-awareness involves knowing your own feelings. This includes having an accurate assessment of what youre capable of, when you need help, and what your emotional triggers are.
* **Self-management:** This involves being able to keep your emotions in check when they become disruptive. Self-management involves being able to control outbursts, calmly discussing disagreements, and avoiding activities that undermine you like extended self-pity or panic.
* **Motivation:** Everyone is motivated to action by rewards like money or status. Golemans model, however, refers to motivation for the sake of personal joy, curiosity, or the satisfaction of being productive.
* **Empathy:** While the three previous categories refer to a persons internal emotions, this one deals with the emotions of others. Empathy is the skill and practice of reading the emotions of others and responding appropriately.
* **Social skills:** This category involves the application of empathy as well as negotiating the needs of others with your own. This can include finding common ground with others, managing others in a work environment, and being persuasive.

You can read a bit more about these different categories here. The order of these emotional competencies isnt all that relevant, as we all learn many of these skills simultaneously as we grow. Its also important to note that, for our purposes, well only be using this as a guide. Emotional intelligence isnt an area that most people receive formal training in. Well let psychologists argue over the jargon and models, but for now lets explore what each of these mean and how to improve them in your own life.

Before you can do anything else here, you have to know what your emotions are. Improving your self-awareness is the first step to identifying any problem area youre facing. Here are some ways to improve your self-awareness:

* **Keep a journal:** Career skill blog recommends starting by keeping a journal of your emotions . At the end of every day, write down what happened to you, how you felt, and how you dealt with it. Periodically, look back over your journal and take note of any trends, or any time you overreacted to something.
* **Ask for input from others:** As weve talked about before when dealing with your self-perception, input from others can be invaluable . Try to ask multiple people who know you well where your strengths and weaknesses lie. Write down what they say, compare what they say to each other and, again, look for patterns. Most importantly, dont argue with them. They dont have to be correct. Youre just trying to gauge your perception from anothers point of view.
* **Slow down (or meditate):** Emotions have a habit of getting the most out of control when we dont have time to slow down or process them . The next time you have an emotional reaction to something, try to pause before you react (something the internet makes easier than ever, if youre communicating online). You can also try meditating to slow your brain down and give your emotional state room to breathe.

If youve never practiced intentional self-awareness, these tips should give you a practical head start. One strategy I personally use is to go on long walks or have conversations with myself discussing whats bothering me. Often, Ill find that the things I say to the imaginary other end of the conversation can give me some insight into whats really bugging me. The important aspect is to look inwards, rather than focusing solely on external factors.

Once you know how your emotions work, you can start figuring out how to handle them. Proper self-management means controlling your outbursts, distinguishing between external triggers and internal over-reactions, and doing whats best for your needs.

One key way to manage your emotions is to change your sensory input. Youve probably heard the old advice to count to ten and breathe when youre angry. Speaking as someone whos had plenty of overwhelming issues with depression and anger, this advice is usually crap (though if it works for you, more power to you).

However, giving your physical body a jolt can break the cycle. If youre feeling lethargic, do some exercise. If youre stuck in an emotional loop, give yourself a snap out of it slap. Anything that can give a slight shock to your system or break the existing routine can help.

Lifehacker alum Adam Dachis also recommends funneling emotional energy into something productive. Its alright to let overwhelming emotions stew inside you for a moment, if its not an appropriate time to let them out. However, when you do, rather than vent it on something futile, turn it into motivation instead:

&gt;I recently started playing tennis for fun, knowing that Id never become exceptional because I began too late in life. Ive become better and have a very minor talent for the game, so when I play poorly I now know and I get down on myself. When up against an opponent with far more skill I find it hard to do much else than get angry. Rather than let that anger out, I take note of it and use it to fuel my desire to practice more. Whether in sports, work, or everyday life, we can get complacent with our skill and forget that we always have some room for improvement. When you start to get mad, get better instead.

You cant always control what makes you feel a certain way, but you can always control how you react. If you have some impulse control problems, find ways to get help when youre feeling calm. Not all emotions can be vented away. My struggle with depression taught me that some emotions persist long after the overflow. However, theres always a moment when those feelings feel a little less intense. Use those moments to seek help.

We talk about motivation a lot. When were talking about motivation as it relates to emotional intelligence, however, we dont just mean getting up the energy to go to work. Were talking about your inner drive to accomplish something. That drive isnt just some feel-goody nonsense, either. As Psychology, today explains, theres a section of your prefrontal cortex that lights up at the mere thought of achieving a meaningful goal.

Whether your goal is building a career, raising a family, or creating some kind of art, everyone has something they want to do with their life. When your motivation is working for you, it connects with reality in tangible ways. Want to start a family? Motivated people will start dating. Want to improve your career? Motivated people will educate themselves, apply for new jobs, or angle for a promotion.

Daniel Goleman suggests that in order to start making use of that motivation, you first need to identify your own values. Many of us are so busy that we dont take the time to examine what our values really are. Or worse, well do work that directly contradicts what we value for so long that we lose that motivation entirely.",0,8,False,self,,,,,

Is it a division of the Navy that's been trained in how to control a compact fission reactor? I'm guessing the Army and later Navy and Airforce have always had engineering experts to fix steam engines and later trucks, tanks, battleships, helicopters etc. But a nuclear reactor is a step up in complexity and it got me thinking, do they have dedicated crew to maintain the reactor, the air purifier systems etc?

So I'm thinking forward to spaceships and Space Navy etc. (Hence posting this in r/Futurology not r/navy.)  

I'm assuming we don't invent any crazy dilithium crystal power supplies or epstein drive engines, just scaled up versions of our existing tech. We'd probably have large ships similar in design to the one from The Martian, a long central spine with engines at one end, zero G living spaces at the other, solar panels and cargo storage and maybe a spinning section in the middle. If it's a military vessel it might have weapon mounts up front, point-defense canons to shoot down incoming missiles and missile launchers of its own. Lets say the main power system is a big fusion reactor, the main engines and main steering systems are ion accelerators blasting uranium fission products at insane speeds to generate thrust, plus some conventionally fuelled thrusters for steering in a combat situation. 

Would they have separation of crew?

* Nuclear Reactor experts
* Space systems experts (Life support, water recyclers etc)
* Main crew

Would this lead to a multi-stream recruitment and training process so that different roles are fulfilled by people with wildly different training, not just the differences between an Air Force Navigator and an Air Force Air-traffic-control coordinator. I'm talking major differences in training stream, different hierarchies, different chains of command. The captain of the mission can order people around but not the Reactor Chief, he's the one stopping the ship blowing itself up so the Captain and the Chief need to agree on major decisions like pushing the reactor to 110% normal output to increase thrust.

Am I talking sense or not? Sometimes I feel like I'm predicting a future military / civilian cooperation model and sometimes I feel like I'm planning a sci fi novel.",11,5,False,self,,,,,

""The internet was created, and it was good.
But information became too free. Publishing corporations were no longer able to enforce revenue. People in power no longer was able to control the message.
So, it started with media. The DCMA took down copywrited content, and prevented competition through false claims impossible for the average man to dispute, establishing a monopoly on published works. Individuals and organizations without the right connections were shut down.
Then came the governments. Everywhere around the globe, we saw censorship of information as ruling bodies learned how to manipulate the message. Beholden to their corporate overlords, the US is moving to eliminate net neutrality. To maintain their image of a perfect society, India shut down telecommunications in the event of race riots. China is re-writing history, and is out-right censoring information going to their citizens. The EU is pushing through legislation allowing it to indiscriminately take down content at will. Russia, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Iran, as well as all of the above, are employing legions to alter the message, push blame, and sow discord.
We live in a society where the internet is no longer ours. It has become a battleground between entities with overwhelming resources. And there is no winner in this war. Ultimately, the idea of a free and open internet is dead.""

If this institution is the one institution that is largely responsible for your livelihood (assuming large-scale unemployment), then that institution has utter control over you. Any misdeed may lead to you basic income being revoked. Another less dystopian problem is that the basic income probably wont be a substantial amount of money. There is no reason to believe that it wont only allow you to pay for your most basic needs. 
So I thought of an alternative and wanted to know if it makes any sense. What if companies simply altered their business model? Instead of selling robots/AI software/whatever to McDonalds, for example, sell it instead to Joe (any random individual). Joe would then out-source his robot/AI software to McDonalds, receiving a fee for this privilege. 
This has many benefits: Joe wouldnt be limited to buying only one robot. He could buy thousands of robots and strategically place each one in different companies, thus maximising his earnings. Everyone could this, drastically increasing the economys productivity. This would create a society of small business owners, all entirely dedicated to maximising the economys output. This could be both a good and a bad thing. The good side is that it would allow us to perhaps reach a post-scarcity society, where productivity is so high and the economy is so efficient that we abolish scarcity completely. The negative aspect is the possible ecological effects of this rampant production. 
Another benefit, of course, is that this would allow people to live comfortable lives of leisure as empowered individuals. The people would be incredibly powerful, totally owning the means of production and thus controlling the firms, not the other way around. If a company does something bad, the people would be able to (if well-organised enough) deprived the company of its productive capacities. 
What do you think?
Tl;dr: instead of UBI, let people buy robots and get paid by the work their robots do.",17,2,False,self,,,,,

It is the year when we start to wake up to the possibility of displacing agriculture itself with something unprecedented, new, and sustainable. 

How do we simultaneously remove carbon from the atmosphere and feed a growing population? Just as cities were forced to grow vertically, we are waking up to the possibility of simultaneously squeezing more life into, and deriving more food off of a piece of land by thinking 3-dimensionally. For the first time in history, we can purchase cereal and beer that was grown from a perennial relative of wheat, called ""Kernza."" Developed for it's incredible 12m long root system. General Mills, Cascadian Farm, Patagonia, and several universities have joined the ridiculously ambitious effort of the Land Institute to displace the broken parts of agriculture and to market this wild grain into a new crop. It is also a perennial, so it's deep roots maintain the soil even in winter, which if climate predictions are correct, might actually be *leaving,* not coming. To quote a former Vice President, this is ""a big f*cking deal"".

Together with tall canopies, deep roots can solve the climate crisis. Deep roots sequester carbon, promote beneficial bacteria, cycle micronutrients to the soil surface, and loosen and heal soil.

Please upvote, as this is something that needs to be making front page headlines. It's something that hasn't happened in thousands of years. We don't often see *real* game changers.

1372,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019-4-15,2019,4,15,20,bdf1wf,self.Futurology,DISCUSSION: The dissolution of Masculinity and Femininity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/bdf1wf/discussion_the_dissolution_of_masculinity_and/,Aeduh,1555329105,"Society is beginning to wake up to the fact that, as it stands today, we humans have been and still are needlessly cut into two parts, two types of beings, men and women. This was something that was always accepted as normal, but more and more people begin to wake up to the intuition that this dual birth cut is unnecessary and the root of many of our social tensions and problems.

The dual nature of masculinity and femininity exist in nature for three main reasons: 

1: Eternal longevity for a living being is a bad idea, as the environment changes faster than a living being can adapt to it, so the survival of this living being is separated into seemingly separate chunks of this living being that reproduce continually and in the process, keep up with the changing environment.

2: Asexual reproduction is a very bad idea on complex organisms. Mutations would gradually destroy the biological fabric of animals who reproduce that way. There may be an exception in things like jellyfishes, but they are extremely simple organisms.

3: The differentiation of gender roles surges because there is an asymmetry of energy expended when two members of the same species copulate. One has to create the whole eggs, nutrients, etc... The other hast to just inseminate. With time, the inseminator loses its capacity to create new life and begins to participate in a dominance hierarchy, in which that individual is expendable and fighter. The other individual bears the weight of creating the new generation.

Now, in our own human situation, the emergence of consciousness makes this schema outdated and obsolete in the long run, as consciousness itself transcends this limitation of gender roles. A self conscious intelligence is capable of potentially fulfilling both roles, be it consecutively or at the same time, if it so desires. 

The manifestation of homosexuality is an early indicator of this shift in trends. Individual consciousness begins to operate beyond the confines of the sexual diagram. Same sex attraction signals a phase in the shift of how we humans live our personal and social reality, which is extremely more complex and subtle than the evolutionarily assigned gender roles. More and more, people want to be, live, and experience reality as male, female, or whatever.

The dissolution of biologically decided at conception gender roles will NOT, as some people say, destroy masculinity and femininity. What it will do is liberate the individual to decide which role, or place in the role spectrum, is more adequate for his or her needs and happiness.

If anything, that will enhance the masculine and feminine gender roles, and we may speculate about seeing things that could be very weird by today's standards, like, for example, most women returning again to domestic lifestyles, less female politicians, less women in sports, etc., as the women that today do such things, which are by nature more masculine, will individually transform themselves into more masculine people.

Conservatives upset about gender culture wars do not realise that not only this isn't going to end soon, this is *just the beginning* of a multigenerational social and biological process that may influence politics in the next 100 years and will only reach stability when biological hermafroditism is the norm.

We could see a distant future, some decades ahead, even century or two, where everyone has a penis and a vagina at the same time in their bodies, everyone is technically capable of bearing children, and everyone ends up acting in one way or another depending on their personality, the circumstances, etc.
Fatherhood and motherhood would still be key components of the procreation experience, as it's difficult for one single person to inhabit at the same time these two complementary spirits. The two archetypes might for the child be depersonified into a more tribe-like entity composed of more than two individuals, though, as it was during most of human history, during dozens of thousands of years.

We could see things like the corporalization of politics, in which new artificial races/tribes of humans try to attain their own version of the perfect body, and compete ideologically between them. We could see even things like excesses of order, like sects composed of people sharing exactly the same type of body. We could see environments where the most extreme and new body would be greatly appreciated, as if body carving were a new form of art and self-expression. Etc.",0,0,False,self,,,,,

This is one of the best videos I've seen that explains renewable energy and summarizes the maximum output for each of the energy sources.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary of Energy Sources**

 Fossil fuels  even at current levels of usage (0.6 on Kardashev scale), we will run out of oil in 100 years. Becoming Type 1 would mean increasing our current energy consumption by a factor of 1,000,000

 Wind/Waves - at best 2% of the sun warming the earth is residual and becomes wind/waves. the wind/waves are a byproduct of thermal differences

 Tidal - the gravitational influence of the moon and sun

 Geothermal - driven by the internal heat of the earth itself

 Nuclear Fission (current nuclear power plants)

 Nuclear Fusion - any elements can be used for nuclear fusion, but the most energy efficient are deuterium and tritium. These two are heavy isotopes of hydrogen (they have extra neutrons in their nucleus than a hydrogen atom). Deuterium is common on earth (40 trillion tons). Tritium is rare and found in trace amounts in water. Tritium can be produced by bombarding lithium with neutrons (we know of 30 million tons of lithium on earth) or from extracting the lithium from water (the oceans have 200 billion tons of lithium)

&amp;#x200B;

**Maximum Energy Output**

A Type 1 civilization uses 170,000 TW

Wind/waves: 1800 TW

Tidal: 3.7 TW

Geothermal: 47 TW

Nuclear Fusion: 5x10\^28 Joules, or 10,000 years of power for a Type 1

Solar - most of the energy will be from solar. However, if we covered the planet with solar cells, it would make the earth extremely dark, since very little light would strike the surface of the earth

&amp;#x200B;

**Waste Heat**

The first law of thermodynamics  the electricity we produce from whichever form it takes will produce waste heat. If we cover the entire earth with solar cells, it will make earth very dark, but also very hot. It will increase earths temperature by 24 degrees C.

Switching from solar to nuclear will make earth even hotter than 24 C, because you are adding in the waste heat from nuclear fission in addition to the heat that the earth is absorbing from the sun.

&amp;#x200B;

**Two options for a Type 1 civilization**

1. Build a giant air conditioner and have everyone live inside of those cooled living units

2. (most realistic) Colonize other planets and moons and avoid tiling all of earth with solar cells, to keep the temperature of earth lower

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr  Wind/waves, tidal, geothermal and fossil fuels wont come close to generating the energy we would need to power a Type 1 civilization, disregarding the affect on our climate.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

1. It looks fairly good, if not perfectly humanlike. Something lke a real doll
2. It can switch positions on its own. For example, it can switch from doggy to missionary. It may fall to the side during the switch and require help. That's acceptable.
3. It has realistic facial expressions.
4. It is not extremely expensive. Let's set $50,000 as an absolute top end limit. Even that is quite high and I imagine most guys wouldn't want to pay more than $5,000 to $15,000 even if it looked and moved like a supermodel

So basically, a decent version 1.0 that many guys could have a lot of fun with. Not a full on robot partner yet though

It can't yet:

* Hold a conversation
* Walk around, clean itself, or do other things that require advanced locomotion
* Emulate a human 100% perfectly during sex.

A lot of people, when they think of vat-grown beef, whether they're for or against it, might not take into consideration just how much of an impact just how revolutionary such a development would be in the agricultural industry, and for society as a whole in economical terms.

I'd like to hear people's knowledge regarding every aspect of what it currently takes to grow beef the conventional way, because I think just based on what I know, that the reduction in resources needed is much larger than it first appears.

I'll start with a quote from Discover Magazine:

&gt;In the United States in 1992 a normal year in this country, even as the BSE epidemic approached its peak in Britain 30,860,000 cattle and 1,353,000 calves were sent to slaughter as a matter of ordinary business, their meat bound for burger chains and restaurants and supermarket meat counters. And this is where the numbers get interesting. On average, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 70 percent of a cow or calf is used for meat, but that percentage is high. Cattle buyers say the number is closer to 63 percent. The rendering industry estimates 60 percent. Studies conducted for the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food estimate 53 percent. What remains is inedible, and there is a lot of what remains, called offal. In the United States, what remains adds up by weight every year to nearly 9.5 million whole cows. To put it another way, every year in this country we must dispose of more than 11 billion pounds of inedible cow. 

What does it take to grow a cow, right now?  Feed, Land, Water, Time, Labor, other things I'm not knowledgable enough to know about.

What does it take to grow that Feed?  To transport it?  What does it take to make that stuff, and to transport it?

Moreover, how much fuel and other resources does it take to process, package, and transport this meat from where it was grown to the shelves of your local supermarket or fast-food restaurant?

I think in this discussion, it should become apparent even to people who would never themselves want to eat vat-burgers, that if even a portion of people did do so, they would find the benefits even to themselves in the form of reduced prices on other products to be substantial.

So, let's crowd-source some knowledge and get an idea of the true extent of what we're using to make our meat, which could be freed up for other uses.",6,8,False,self,,,,,

How large of a PV system would it take to run the entire U.S. electric ground fleet on 100% solar?  How much would the PV system cost and how much money + petroleum would we save on fuel?  

Answer: a 1.133 TW-pDC PV system would cost approximately $3.39 trillion, would produce over 1.47 trillion kWh/year, and have a lifetime of 25 years.  It would reduce the consumption of 117.89 billion gallons of petroleum EVERY YEAR, and save over $168.5 billion in fuel costs EVERY YEAR.  So, after 25 years, it would save over 4.42 trillion gallons of petroleum and over $4.2 trillion in fuel costs (inflation not included). 

First, start with some data, then note some assumptions, and finally run through some calculations.  

**DATA**

[From National Transportation Statistics 2018-Q4] (https://www.bts.gov/browse-statistical-products-and-data/national-transportation-statistics/national-transportation-8) 

&gt;Table 1-5: U.S. Public Road and Street Mileage by Functional System
 
&gt;TOTAL urban and rural mileage = 4,165,349

&gt;URBAN Interstates, freeways, and expressways = 19,092 + 12,152 = 31,244 miles

&gt;RURAL Interstates, freeways, and expressways = 29,162 + 6,589 = 35,751 miles

&gt;URBAN Principal arterials, Other = 66,316 miles

&gt;RURAL Principal arterials, Other = 89,766 miles

&gt;COMBINED URBAN &amp; RURAL Interstates, freeways, expressways &amp; Principal Arterials, Other = 31,244 + 35,751 + 66,316 + 89,766 = 223,077 miles

&gt;223,077 miles = 359,007,631 meters

**DATA**

&gt;Table 1-35: U.S. Vehicle-Miles (2016) (i.e. miles traveled per year)
				
&gt;Highway, total = 3,174,408,000,000

&gt;Light duty vehicle, short wheelbase = 2,191,764,000,000

&gt;Light duty vehicle, long wheelbase = 657,954,000,000

&gt;Truck, single-unit 2-axle 6-tire = 113,338,000,000

&gt;Truck, combination = 174,557,000,000

&gt;Bus = 16,350,000,000

**ASSUMPTIONS:** 

(1) Average output of the PV system = 1,300 kWh/year per kW-pDC PV.  [Source] (https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php)

(2) 1 kW-pDC PV = 58.83 sq.ft = 5.465 sq. meters [Source] (https://www.canadiansolar.com/upload/b90b2b198796e800/9c1943691b94c57b.pdf)

(3) The entire U.S. Ground Transportation Fleet (excluding rail) can be can be converted into electric.  In other words, every internal combustion engine car, truck, bus and van, etc. would be converted into its electric equivalent.  **The difference in cost to purchase an EV vs. its equivalent ICEV is beyond the scope of this project.** 

(4) The electric transportation fleet can be characterized as having a SPECIFIC AVERAGE EFFICIENCY PER VEHICLE CLASS with units `x kWh/mile` (or inversely `y miles/kWh`).

(5) The average efficiency per vehicle class is extrapolated with the following data / estimates in mind:

&gt;Tesla Model 3 SR (sedan) EXISTING = 0.29 kWh/mile (3.45 miles/kWh)

&gt;Tesla Model X 75D (SUV) EXISTING = 0.36 kWh/mile (2.78 miles/kWh)

&gt;Tesla Model T (pickup truck) ESTIMATED = 0.49 kWh/mile (2.04 miles/kWh)

&gt;Tesla Semi-Tractor + Trailer ESTIMATED = 2 kWh/mile (0.5 miles/kWh)

&gt;Electric Light Duty Vehicle, short wheelbase ESTIMATED = 0.364 kWh/mile (2.75 miles/kWh)

&gt;Electric Light Duty Vehicle, long wheelbase ESTIMATED = 0.364 kWh/mile (2 miles/kWh)

&gt;Electric Truck, Single-unit 2-axle 6-tire ESTIMATED = 0.571 kWh/mile (1.75 miles/kWh)

&gt;Electric Truck, Combination ESTIMATED = 2 kWh/mile (0.5 miles/kWh)

&gt;Electric Bus ESTIMATED = 1.33 kWh/mile (0.75 miles/kWh)

(6) Efficiency specs for EVs would be rated by the EPA and therefore **the estimated `x kWh/mile` accounts for any losses due to charging inefficiencies**. 

(7) Inefficiencies converting DC to AC in a PV system is accounted for in PV Watts.  Module Degradation is accounted for in PV output estimates (i.e. 1,300 kWh/year per kW-pDC takes accounts the 6-8% module degradation over the lifetime of the PV system.)   

(8) PV systems last a minimum 25 years.  Since inverters are (normally) the only part of the PV system that don't last that long, a loss factor of (COST PER WATT * 1.25) is applied to COST ESTIMATES of the PV system to account for replacing the inverter every 12.5 years.  

(9) Kirchoff's law applies to PV systems the same way as it does to electric circuits.  While it is true that the electrons that you create with your PV system, may or may not be the exact same electrons that charge your EV, for accounting purposes: solar energy in equals solar energy out.  Solar energy in equals solar energy out is 'Kirchoff's law' rephrased for solar.  

(10) Energy storage is obviously necessary for a large PV array such as the proposed.  However, calculating size and cost of any energy storage equipment is beyond the scope of this project.  Kirchoff + Thevenin's theorem allows the analysis to apply even without calculating storage.  

(11) Inflation: calculating the cost of inflation and its effects is beyond the scope of this project.  


**CALCULATIONS** (using data from National Transportation Statistics + estimated efficiencies of EVs + estimated costs data):

`2,191,764,000,000 miles * 0.364 kWh/mile (2.75 miles/kWh) = 797,802,096,000 kWh`

`657,954,000,000 miles * 0.364 kWh/mile (2 miles/kWh) = 239,495,256,000 kWh`

`113,338,000,000 miles * 0.571 kWh/mile (1.75 miles/kWh) = 64,715,998,000 kWh` 

`174,557,000,000 miles * 2 kWh/mile (0.5 miles/kWh) = 349,114,000,000 kWh` 

`16,350,000,000 miles * 1.33 kWh/mile (0.75 miles/kWh) = 21,745,500,000 kWh`

`797,802,096,000 kWh + 239,495,256,000 kWh + 64,715,998,000 kWh + 349,114,000,000 kWh + 21,745,500,000 kWh = 1,472,872,850,000 kWh`

**`1,472,872,850,000 kWh  1,300 kWh/year per kW-pDC PV = 1,132,979,116 kW-pDC PV = 1.133 TW-pDC PV`**

**`1,132,979,116 kW-pDC PV * 5.465 sq. meters/kW-pDC PV = 5,664,895,580,000 sq. meters PV`**

`359,007,631 meters (of interstates, freeways, expressways &amp; Principal Arterials, Other) * 18.29 meters (60 feet) = 6,566,249,571 sq. meters`

`6,566,249,571 sq. meters (of interstates, freeways, expressways &amp; Principal Arterials, Other) &gt; 5,664,895,580,000 sq. meters PV`

**Therefore, if we built a `60 foot wide PV System` along every mile of interstate, freeway, expressway &amp; Principal Arterial Road` within the U.S. National Transportation System, it would be enough to power the entire U.S. Ground Transportation Fleet (excluding rail) with 100% solar (if said Fleet was converted into electric).**

How much would the PV system cost and how much money + petroleum would we save on fuel?

&gt;Fuel consumed (gallons)= 176,891,000,000

&gt;Average miles traveled per vehicle = 11,800

&gt;Average miles traveled per gallon = 17.9

&gt;Average fuel consumed per vehicle (gallons) = 658

**DATA**

&gt;Table 1-20: Production-Weighted Fuel Economies

&gt;Fuel economy, mpg
				
&gt;Car = 30

&gt;Car SUV = 26

&gt;Table 4-23: Average Fuel Efficiency of U.S. Light Duty Vehicles

&gt;ICE-Light duty vehicle, short wheel base EXISTING = 24 mpg

&gt;ICE-Light Duty Vehicle, long wheelbase EXISTING = 17.4 mpg

&gt;[ICE-Truck, Combination ESTIMATED = 8 mpg] (https://www.afdc.energy.gov/data/10310)

&gt;[ICE-Bus ESTIMATED = 5 mpg] (https://www.afdc.energy.gov/data/10310)

**Therefore, powering the U.S. Electric Ground Transportation Fleet with 100% solar would replace the combustion of `117.89 billion gallons of gas EVERY YEAR`.**

**DATA**

&gt;State-level median installed PV prices in 2017 ranged from $2.6/W to $4.5/W for residential systems, from $2.2/W to $4.0/W for small non-residential systems, and from $2.1/W to $2.4/W for large non-residential systems.  [Source] (https://emp.lbl.gov/tracking-the-sun)

&gt;National Average Regular Gasoline Prices = $2.45/gal

&gt;National On-Highway Diesel Fuel Prices = $3.10/gal
[Source] (https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/)

**CALCULATIONS**

`(117.89 billion gallons of gas equivalent/year) * ((0.8) * ($2.45/gal gas) + (0.2) * ($3.10/gal diesel)) = $304,156,200,000 PER YEAR for petroleum fuel`

`1.133 TW-pDC PV * $2.4/WATT * 1.25 (inverter loss) = $3.39 trillion`

`PV system lasts 25 years (pricing includes the assumption that inverters need to be replaced every 12.5 years)` 

`3.154 trillion miles traveled/year`

`$304,156,200,000 PER YEAR (for petroleum fuel) * 25 years = $7,603,905,000,000 (for petroleum fuel over 25 years)`

`$7,603,905,000,000 - $3,390,000,000,000 = $4,213,905,000,000 (over 25 years)`

`4,213,905,000,000  25 years = SAVINGS = $168,556,200,000 PER YEAR in fuel costs`

**Therefore, powering the U.S. Electric Ground Transportation Fleet with 100% solar would SAVE $168,556,200,000 in fuel costs EVERY YEAR or $4.2 trillion over 25 years.**

**CONCLUSION:** 

The amount of energy produced from a '60 foot wide PV System' built along all interstate, freeway, expressway &amp; principal arterial roads within the U.S. would power the entire U.S. Ground Transportation Fleet (excluding rail) with 100% solar (if said fleet was converted into electric).  

A 1.133 TW-pDC PV system would cost approximately $3.39 trillion, would produce over 1.47 trillion kWh/year, and have a lifetime of 25 years.  It would reduce the consumption of 117.89 billion gallons of petroleum EVERY YEAR, and save over $168.5 billion in fuel costs EVERY YEAR.  After 25 years, it would save over 4.42 trillion gallons of petroleum and over $4.2 trillion in fuel costs. 
 
Yes, I know that it would be better to build the PV system above the road, rather than along it. I also understand that it would be better to install a larger part of the PV system in places such as Arizona, California and Nevada rather than Washington, Maine and Alaska.

Think my calculations are too conservative?  Still proves my point (and it's even cheaper + smaller than my estimates). Think my calculations are not conservative enough?  Show me your detailed calculations and I might edit accordingly.",16,24,False,self,,,,,

1767,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019-4-19,2019,4,19,8,bes4bk,self.Futurology,Thought Experiment - Contained Cities,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/bes4bk/thought_experiment_contained_cities/,00mba,1555629023,"I was just inspired by a [photo I seen](https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroFuturism/comments/bekgqj/1960s_experimental_city_proposed_by_athelstan/) over on /r/RetroFuturism. A futuristic city is mostly contained completely within one single building. 

For this thought experiment I imagined a smaller city, maybe 100,000 - 200,000 people. The building envelope would be made from a mix of materials, but mostly structural steel beam/girder systems. From road level, the roof height of the building would be around 50 feet. Buildings would protrude through the main building envelope to allow for high rises. Electric vehicles would dominate the transportation network, and cycling would also be very popular due to the near perfect climate conditions. 

I enjoyed this idea of a city built like this. A few positive key points I thought about:

**1) Weather**

An enclosed city like this would completely eliminate all weather related issues. Hailstorms could be a potential threat but with well enough designed roof structure, this could be mostly eliminated. The glass paneling could be UV resistant and reduce problems like skin cancer and aging.

**2) HVAC**

I would imagine heating one gigantic space would be less efficient than heating smaller individual spaces, but you could have different climate zones within the building to help mitigate these problems. Heating could be centralized, and utilize greenhouse effects to reduce the amount of energy required to heat the space.

Air quality would be very good in a system like this, as the air coming into the envelope could be filtered from particulate. This could be beneficial with the rising levels of pollutants in our atmosphere.

**3) Resource collection**

Rainwater could be collected from the rooftop very efficiently, and since it is already elevated, the water would have a pressure head of approximately the same height as the roof, eliminating the need to pressurize the water system. A rooftop solar collection grid could also be set up to benefit from solar power. 

**4) Transportation**

Vehicles would absolutely need to be electric only to eliminate noxious gasses inside the city. Other methods of transportation would be more available all year like cycling. Overall your population could potentially live more active lifestyles and benefit from this.

In summary I think the benefits of an enclosed system like this could actually reduce the costs of operation in the long term. Imagine healthier citizens, less traffic, less weather related transportation snarls, reduced energy consumption, and localized climates for growing regionally exotic foods.   


**Downsides:**

Maintenance would be insanely high.  
Construction would also be very expensive. Any additional land expropriated by the city would need to be developed like a building expansion. Concrete foundations for every single column, piles driven into soil, etc. It would be an insanely complex and expensive undertaking. 

You would essentially live indoors 95% of the time. Going outdoors would be seen as a rare occurrence and probably be seen as something risky.

Earthquakes would seriously fuck your shit up.

Tornados would seriously fuck your shit up.

Also the bio diversity is destroyed at a breathtaking pace, and so is the depletion of natural resources and the accumulation of toxic wastes. Our one and only space ship is in dire straits.

Some people decide to fly less, to drive less, to buy smaller or no car, to eat less or no meat, to consume fair products, to use less plastic bags, etc. These are all respectable decisions.

It came to my mind that there is one other private decision that has the biggest long-term effect and might be the key for a real sustainable co-existence between human and our home planet earth. The decision to have no children.

Clearly, if we reduce the world population by a considerable percentage (say 90%), we have a real chance to find a balance with nature and only consume as much as nature can reproduce. Technological advances in AI and robotics can help us to build and advance our civilitation even with a much smaller absolute number of people.

I think, a strategy to steer world population to a sustainable level should be on the political agenda of the UN just like other agendas for eleminating hunger, deseases, child work, CO2/methan emissions, etc. I am missing this key contributor for sustainability on the political agendas, though.",22,3,False,self,,,,,

**Introduction** 

The range of meat products on the market exists on a spectrum of structural sophistication. On one end of the spectrum, there are less sophisticated processed products such as chicken nuggets and sausages; in the middle, ground products; and on the other end, filets and steaks. In order to replicate the more sophisticated products, scientists will need to borrow and improve upon technologies from tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and biomaterials science to recreate the complex multicellular architecture of meat. A review of the core bioengineering biology, scaffolding technologies, and methods to consider for the creation of complex structures are discussed below. 

**The Extracellular Matrix and Mechanotransduction**

As discussed in Series I and II, the initial proliferation of stem cells is an essential part of the cell-based meat production process. How are trillions of stem cells then turned into structured meat via differentiation? In order to understand, background on the extracellular matrix and mechanotransduction is necessary.

*In vivo*, cells exist within a complex matrix of secreted proteins and proteoglycans called the [extracellular matrix (ECM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix). The ECM has an inherent [stiffness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness) that in turn can influence cellular activity via specialized cell membrane proteins called integrins. Integrins act as mechanosensors to mediate downstream effector proteins, leading to the formation of [focal adhesion complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_adhesion) that connect the actomyosin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. The integrin-mediated focal adhesion can be thought of as the midpoint of a tug-of-war between the ECM and a cells internal cytoskeleton. These connections collectively mediate a cells ability to sense the extracellular environment, leading to downstream signaling that can affect cell polarity, migration, and differentiation.[^(1)](http://jcb.rupress.org/content/215/4/445)^(,)[^(2)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25915734) Altogether, this process is referred to as [mechanotransduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanotransduction). 

During embryogenesis and development, cells multiply and become specialized (i.e. differentiate) in part via cues from their extracellular environment. During this time, ECM components and cells themselves are actively in motion as they pass through key developmental landmarks such as the formation of the [primitive streak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_streak), gastrulation, and tissue specialization.[^(3)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27302396) Additional factors such as ECM density and gradients, composition, and 3D topography can have large effects on cell behaviors.[^(4)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19854168) In essence, as cells become defined, their gene expression patterns dictate the creation and secretion of specified ECM components which in turn act as a feedback mechanism to further dictate cellular differentiation and migration, a process referred to as dynamic reciprocity.[^(5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6892044) Because components of the early embryo are all stem cells, this means that stem cells are exquisitely sensitive to ECM cues. Indeed, the regulation and maintenance of stem cells in the adult body is highly dependent on the ECM components that make up the [stem cell niche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-cell_niche), where each tissues niche typically contains a unique set of ECM components.[^(6)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081568/) 

Over the last two decades, a suite of studies have demonstrated the critical role of the ECM in the regulation of stemness and differentiation across all of the relevant cell types for cell-based meat production: pluripotent stem cells[^(7)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4589090/), mesenchymal stem cells[^(8)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16923388), satellite cells[^(9)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20478295), and adipogenic stem cells.[^(10)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jbm.a.35644) By mimicking *in vitro* the ECM stiffness and protein composition of a specified stem cell niche microenvironment, stem cells can be guided into predictable lineages. This biology, together with changes in the cell culture medium composition (discussed in Series IV), will assist in driving the future creation of structured, 3D cell-based meat products.  

**Microcarriers**

During the proliferation phase, anchorage-dependent stem cells are to be grown in bioreactors at large scales. As discussed in Series II, this non-native environment can lead to [anoikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoikis) if cells are not adapted to suspension growth, grown as spheroids, or otherwise tricked into anchorage independence via small molecules such as Rho Kinase (ROCK) inhibitors. One commonly used method to bypass activation of anoikis is through the use of [microcarriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcarrier). Microcarriers are small bead-like structures typically 100-400m in diameter that permit attachment of cells via mimicry of ECM characteristics such as stiffness, topography, and porosity (discussed later).[^(11)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4991290/)^(,)[^(12)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927776517304630#bib0960) For instance, microcarrier topography can be designed with nooks to prevent shear stress and patterned topography to assist cell alignment and polarity.[^(13)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41378-018-0020-7) They can be made from a variety of materials such as polysterene, polyacrylamide, glass, or dextran, and these materials are often coated with ECM proteins or charged molecules to assist in cell attachment. Microcarriers are advantageous in bioreactor culture because they provide a large surface area to volume ratio, permitting high densities of cells relative to 2D culture and are able to be used in flexible (e.g. batch, fed-batch, perfusion) and controllable bioprocessing pipelines. Expansion of cells using microcarriers is relatively straightforward, either by the addition of more microcarriers where cells undergo bead-to-bead transfer,[^(14)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28470539) or via enzymatic dissociation and passaging of cells to larger vessels via a seed train process.[^(15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211339813000063)^(,)[^(16)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873506109000208) Furthermore, differentiation can occur on the microcarriers themselves,[^(17)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11094818)^(,)[^(18)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480567) triggered by changes in media components, microcarrier characteristics, or shear forces via mechanotransduction.[^(19)](https://www.intechopen.com/books/cells-and-biomaterials-in-regenerative-medicine/mass-production-of-mesenchymal-stem-cells-impact-of-bioreactor-design-and-flow-conditions-on-prolife) Thus, microcarriers offer immense potential in scaling relevant stem cell populations and for providing differentiated cell types for cell-based meat production by leveraging the bioengineering principals discussed throughout. However, decisions on the use of microcarriers will need to be balanced against the intended product, which may influence strategy surrounding cell proliferation and cell harvesting (discussed in Series V).  

**Scaffolding Biomaterials**

In order to produce structured and thick meat products, cells must be transferred to a scaffold. A scaffold ideally permits the attachment and differentiation of cells in a specified manner, mimicking the 3D cytoarchitecture of meat while allowing for continuous perfusion of media, analogous to the vascularization of real tissue. Therefore, considerations for the porosity of the scaffold, mechanical properties, and biocompatibility are paramount. In some cases, the production of differentiated cells on edible or biodegradable microcarriers[^(20)](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/9752122.html) (or other methods discussed later) may be chosen for inclusion as blended additives in a variety of unstructured products (discussed in Series V). However, fully replacing conventional animal meats will require replication of structured products such as steaks, requiring the skills of tissue engineers, materials science engineers, and other interdisciplinary scientists for building the methods for these applications.

The biomaterial that makes up a scaffold dictates many of its downstream properties. Biomaterials can be categorized broadly as natural, synthetic, or composite materials consisting of both natural and synthetic materials. Natural biomaterials include those that make up the native vertebrate [ECM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix#Structure), such as fibrin, laminin, hyaluronic acid, gelatin (i.e. hydrolyzed collagen), vitronectin, or ECM mixes such as [Matrigel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrigel). Additional natural biomaterials include alginate (from algae), agarose (from seaweed), silk (from spiders)[^(21)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/08/29/403345.full.pdf), chitosan (from crustaceans, yeast, or fungi), cellulose (many plants), decellularized plant or animal tissues (discussed later), and fungal mycelium.[^(22)](https://www.businessinsider.com/mushroom-packaging-startup-aims-for-lab-grown-meat-ecovative-2018-10) These natural biomaterials are generally advantageous in that they have high biocompatibility, high degradability, and low immunogenicity; however, only biomaterials derived from vertebrate ECM are functionalized via native cell adhesion motifs. While growing cells on biomaterials such as alginate or chitosan is possible, they lack recognition motifs that promote cell adhesion and migration, limiting their functionality. These cell recognition motifs include the Arg-Gly-Asp ([RGD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGD_motif)) and Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV[^(23)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5075/05d98fad501b32f5eba851c2d17ed496e374.pdf)) motifs, amongst others less commonly used, derived from corresponding amino acid sequences in fibronectin and laminin, respectively.[^(24)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905875) Integrins on the cell surface serve as the binding receptors for these motifs, mediating cell attachment and downstream signaling.[^(25)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11884718) Many strategies exist that permit functionalization of non-RGD-containing biomaterials, either by mixing with other functional biomaterials such as gelatin,[^(26)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5744339/) chemical [crosslinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link) with RGD peptides,[^(27)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876107012001265) or genetically engineering the RGD motif directly into a biomaterial.[^(28)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706115301392)^(,)[^(29)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26461118) Surface functionalization methods such as [ion beam deposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_beam_deposition) or plasma treatment can also be used to create favorable surface properties such as hydrophilicity.[^(30)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128027349000214) Alternatively, synthetic biomaterials can be used. Synthetic biomaterials permit high tunability for a variety of desired biophysical properties, making them attractive for tissue engineering purposes.[^(31)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19472329)^(,)[^(32)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3206299/) Some common examples of synthetic biomaterials include Pluronic, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), and poly(acrylamide).[^(33)](https://www.nature.com/articles/natrevmats201512) However, because these materials do not support cell adhesion, they also need to be functionalized as previously described, and are commonly combined with other natural polymers to form a composite material.  

**Hydrogels**

Although purified ECM proteins can be used to coat substrates for 2D cell growth, the use of a single protein component in 3D culture often results in a lack of desirable attributes such as mechanical properties, mesh network size, and degradation.[^(34)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5800304/) Thus, a large effort has been dedicated to controlling these characteristics, discussed below, by creating composite hydrogels composed of synthetic and natural biomaterials.

The vast majority of applied biomaterial use in tissue engineering comes in the form of a hydrogel. A hydrogel is a 3D network of polymer chains that can readily absorb water (up to 1000x their dry weight) due to their hydrophilic properties. They can be engineered to swell or de-swell in response to various external stimuli (e.g. temperature, light, pH, electric field), and tuned for incorporation of a variety of macromolecules.[^(35)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905875)^(,)[^(36)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123213000969) Because of their aqueous makeup, hydrogels naturally have high permeability for oxygen and permit the flow of water-soluble molecules, exquisitely mimicking soft tissues of the body. 

A hydrogels mechanical properties are frequently measured with [atomic force microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy) to reveal the [Youngs modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_modulus) value, which defines the material stiffness in relation to stress and strain. *In vivo*, the Youngs modulus of different tissue types is variable and this helps to determine cell fate via mechanotransduction. For instance, adipose tissue and the brain are soft (\~0.2 - 1.0 kPa), skeletal muscle is intermediate (\~10 kPa), and bone is hard (\~30-45 kPa) tissue.  Thus, recapitulating these stiffnesses within a scaffold can direct the differentiation of stem cells. For instance, the growth of mesenchymal stem cells on soft or hard hydrogels can bias their fate into fat or bone, respectively.[^(37)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16923388)^(,)[^(38)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22531177) Similarly, muscle satellite cells can self-renew when grown in a substrate that matches the stiffness of their native stem cell niche.[^(39)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12195-017-0506-7)^(,)[^(40)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2929271/)  Tuning of the stiffness can be achieved by increased [crosslinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link), addition of carbon nanotubes[^(41)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22117858), graphene[^(42)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11359-x), DNA[^(43)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/02/21/556381.full.pdf), or modification of natural or synthetic polymer materials with photo-crosslinkable side groups. Importantly, these photo-crosslinkable groups permit fast polymerization, allowing encapsulation of cells during a process such as bioprinting (discussed later). Cell-based meat scaffolds may thus be constructed with various composite polymer materials that dictate stiffness in a pre-patterned spatial orientation to replicate the fat, muscle, and connective tissue architecture found in a desired meat product. Indeed, studies have demonstrated the biasing of stem cell fates to bone and fat via stiffness properties within a single hydrogel.[^(44)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17286-1) 

Although hydrogels can mimic soft tissues, they are limited in scale. The creation of thick tissues that permit diffusion of oxygen and transport of nutrients and waste in an analogous manner to vascularized tissue *in vivo* has been challenging and is an active area of research. In general, a scaffold used for transplantation contains pores that permit neovascularization of the tissue once in the body.[^(45)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20939827) However, a scaffold for cell-based meat may aim to support cell viability via perfusion within a bioreactor (discussed later) rather than *in situ* vascularization, as the current state of technology is just beginning to understand how to create vascular tissue from stem cells.[^(46)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0858-8) This means that a scaffolds mesh network of pores should ideally be interconnected and distributed such that cells can infiltrate the scaffold and lie within 200m of nutrient access, as this is the upper limit for the mass transfer of oxygen.[^(47)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961205004734?via%3Dihub) Other parameters such as pore shape, volume, and roughness also need to be considered.[^(48)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3963751/) Ideally, the recapitulation of the ECM should happen on the scale of the structural ECM components themselves (i.e. 50 - 500nm diameter),[^(49)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17916396) while the porosity of the scaffold should be on the micrometer scale to permit cell invasion and migration. This general principle has been challenging to mimic; however,  sophisticated techniques for fabricating large hydrogel scaffolds with these properties are coming of age (discussed later). Lastly, given that a tissue created for consumption does not need to be functional inside of a body, a scaffold designed to be less densely populated may be easier to achieve. Once populated, the structure could be compressed at harvesting or further structured into a final product (discussed in Series V). 

Careful design considerations have been made in tissue engineering to utilize non-immunogenic, biodegradable materials with biologically inert by-products (as they are intended to be inserted into the body for regenerative medicine purposes).[^(50)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905875) Likewise, a scaffold that biodegrades into inert by-products would be desirable for cell-based meat not only to avoid non-edible materials being incorporated into a final product but also by allowing the cells to replace the hydrogel scaffold with their own native ECM. Indeed, hydrogels are typically static substrates that alone fail to dynamically recapitulate the spatiotemporal interactions between a cell and the ECM. One method to overcome this is by incorporating proteolytically degradable crosslinks,[^(51)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3633615/)^(,)[^(52)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20667588) which permit naturally secreted enzymes such as [matrix metalloproteinases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase) to degrade the hydrogel substrate, permitting cell migration and establishment of dynamic reciprocity previously mentioned. A suite of other methods such as photodegradable polymers[^(53)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19342581) and unique chemistries permitting light-mediated crosslinking[^(54)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22531177) have also been developed by bioengineers, enabling more accurate recapitulation of ECM-cell dynamics.

Bioengineers also attempt to mimic other characteristics of the ECM such as regulated diffusion of soluble secreted signals. *In vivo*, ECM molecules such as [heparan sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparan_sulfate) proteoglycans can bind and sequester growth factors that regulate local cell migration and differentiation. Some hydrogels such as Matrigel, derived from mouse tumor cells, contain these embedded growth factors, albeit in variable quantities and unknown spatial distributions. Techniques such as incorporation of proteins containing photocleavable linkers or photocaged peptides[^(55)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S100184171830202X) permit precise and sometimes reversible spatiotemporal release of sequestered factors via light. However, its unclear how feasible these methods would be for cell-based meat production at scale. Rather, covalent tethering of specific growth factors within the hydrogel scaffold,[^(56)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3444702/) spatially distributed to mimic the cytoarchitecture of meat, may be able to assist in attachment or guidance of precursor stem cells into their correct location within the scaffold or toward downstream terminally differentiated cell fates.

Many of the natural polymers that can be used as scaffolds are also edible to humans, with several already approved by the FDA for use in food (regulation may differ by region). Thus, edible polymer materials in microcarriers or scaffolds for cell-based meat development are likely to be pursued in order to avoid removing cells from the scaffold (discussed in Series V) or rigorous demonstration of safety for human consumption, as would be needed with some other material types. Research in this direction using [edible scaffolds](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetforgrieve/2019/02/27/seaweed-sorghum-and-cell-behavior-projects-win-gfi-grants/#712a29f21394) for cell-based meat[ has already begun](https://www.gfi.org/researchgrants). Examples of FDA-approved edible biomaterials include pectin,[^(57)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813012002759?via%3Dihub) gellan gum,[^(58)](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2009/jm/b818090c#!divAbstract) chitosan, gelatin, cellulose, and alginate, amongst others.[^(59)](https://www.mdpi.com/2310-2861/3/3/27/pdf) Some synthetic polymers such as PEGs are also FDA-approved. As previously mentioned, the majority of these polymers lack functional domains for cell adhesion; however, they can be functionalized with RGD peptides or combined with functional edible components such as gelatin.[^(60)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5744339/) Importantly, these scaffolds also tend to be affordable and scalable in terms of the raw material components, with scale limitations mainly determined by method of fabrication (discussed later). Some companies have independently demonstrated the [large scale production of proteins such as collagen](http://www.geltor.com/) using recombinant yeast or bacteria, and this may serve as a future platform for the creation of biomaterial sidestreams used for the cell-based meat industry. Lastly, many of these biomaterials have also been used for tissue engineering of bone[^(61)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24999429), which may be applicable for cell-based meat if bone-in products are ever pursued. 

**How are scaffolds made?**

The quest to build human organs from scratch has led to the development of an array of technologies and methods for the reconstruction of complex tissues. In general, two approaches can be considered for biofabrication of a complex tissue: top-down and bottom-up. In top-down approaches, as generally described above, a scaffold is fabricated and cells are seeded onto the scaffold; however, these approaches generally struggle to recapitulate tissue microstructure.[^(62)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2826124/) Alternatively, bottom-up approaches aim to create modular biostructures on the microscale that can be assembled into larger, more complex tissue types. Advances in 3D printing now permit combinatorial approaches of both efforts.[^(63)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-018-0006-y)^(,)[^(64)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961218308639) At the heart of each method is a concern for issues previously discussed: biomaterial selection, biocompatibility, porosity, etc. The emerging technologies that best handle these issues and those that are most likely to be explored for use in cell-based meat scaffold development such as 3D bioprinting, electrospinning, decellularization, and other considerations, will be discussed in the next section.

----

Seems simple enough, right?

Solves our energy needs for transport and electricity (and heating). It also gives us abundant rocket fuel. What's not to love about it in the future?

Modern prices be damned. We can't simply rely on the 'market' to be honest about prices when oil corporations ruthless destroy the environment and leave the public to pay for the cleanup. We need to actually push forward with better technologies. I'm not trusting the actual costs of private industry. How is the materials for the batteries sourced? How do we know inhuman conditions aren't used?

Nuclear already has hefty regulations which prevents that from occurring.

Fuel cell deployment gets cheap in economies of scale. Hydrogen can be used to store excess grid energy efficiently too^1!

Still I'm somewhat self conscious, particularly about my jaw. I  don't know if most people are conscious that my jaw is asymmetric but I see it and it bothers me. I know there may be some surgeries out there that could address it but I don't think it bothers me enough to be worth the risk and the ordeal. I know people have talked about nanobots in the future that would allow for whole body morphology but I realize that's the holy grail and likely out of reach for a long time - if even possible at all.

Profiles shown to me on the second account were, as you might expect from the title of this hypothesis, far more beautiful women with higher level of apparent physical fitness 

Does this suggest that Tinder is using an algorithm to estimate the beauty of its users faces, showing profiles to users accordingly? It would make sense from the developers standpoint to increase potential matches by grading attractiveness  just as many studies have shown is highly common in organic courtship?

Would this be ethical? Would it be subject to laws pertaining to discrimination?",393,2319,False,self,,,,,

Michael Callow,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/bfhchs/the_offensive_remark_a_fictional_story_about_a/,Simon_Drake,1555795862,"I'm worried about where modern technology and media trends are taking us. I've got a theory about an event that could happen, it's more a culmination of several existing trends than anything explicitly new. For the record, I'm using the fictional prime minister Michael Callow as a subject but it could be any high level political figure.

&gt;Newsflash:   
&gt;  
&gt;""British Prime Minister Michael Callow makes offensive remark""  
&gt;  
&gt;""The nation woke in horror today to learn that British Prime Minister Michael Callow was known to have made a highly offensive remark. We are unwilling to repeat such foul language in this news report but rest assured there is no justification for a once respected politician to use words as hurtful as these.  The Prime Minister has refused to comment on the situation.""

&gt;  
&gt;Response:  
&gt;  
&gt;""British Prime Minister Michael Callow is bringing shame to his party, to his country and to humanity as a whole by refusing to apologise for his deeply offensive slur. Several politicians have tried to defend him by saying these remarks might have been taken out of context - however the leader of the opposition has said those defending the Prime Minister are actively encouraging racial hatred and are personally responsible for the race riots on the streets of London. The British public is calling for the immediate unconditional arrest of Michael Callow and his cabinet.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""An Early Day Motion has been tabled in parliament this morning bringing into law provisions classifying the deeply offensive remarks made by then Prime Minister Michael Callow as a form of racial hatred and an act of terrorism.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""YouTube, Facebook, Bing Social and other social media giants have relented to pressure from activist groups calling to remove all footage of former Prime Minister Michael Callow and his highly offensive slur. The decision was reached that this material including transcripts and police interviews with Michael Callow after his arrest will be blocked internationally at the DNS Level to prevent the highly offensive remarks influencing the next generation of our youth.""

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, in an age of technology and 24hour internet news it's possible to fully automate 'trial by media'. In a matter of days the Prime Minister could be reduced from the height of his power to a national embarrassment, completely overturning the political landscape of the country. And what caused this?  Did he say the N-Word? Did he use an out of date terminology for someone's race, gender, disability, lifestyle choice, what? 

That's the point. We don't know what he said. We never know what they say. When a celebrity uses an offensive slur we used to get it starred-out but that's too explicit for 2019 so often none of the mainstream media sources will disclose it. So we're left with Twitter Feeds and YouTube Algorithms and machine learning optimisations to tell us the truth. But what if they don't? What if what they tell us is itself the lie? We'll never know because it's illegal to know. 

The subtext is that Michael Callow didn't make any offensive slur. If the news says he did then he did. If the algorithm says we're not supposed to know the details then we don't know the details. If someone stands up to cast the first stone, either you stand in the line of the stones or your cast one too. This is an age when criticising a movie or a TV Show is conflated with racism, sexism and various other forms of offense. This is an age when committing ANY offense is unforgivable, even questioning if there should be some leniency for low-impact offenses is deeply offensive.

So where did the story come from? Did someone plant the story? Did the algorithms generate it as some emergent property? Maybe a bit of both, someone manipulated the automated processes in just the right way? Perhaps we'll never know. Perhaps it's already happening. How could we tell? And how could we stop it if we knew?",6,10,False,self,,,,,

I had a really interesting interview and I just want it to share it with you.

We  talk about why tech companies are using encryption for their own benefit, the real conversation around algorithms and how we're being   fought over by two countries (China and USA with 5G technology). All leading to the main challenge we're facing: explaining the correlation   between data extraction and the manipulation of people.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Feedback is welcome so I can improve future interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

Everywhere I look I see progress.

&amp;#x200B;

I see [Google Fiber](https://fiber.google.com/ourcities/) slowly chipping away at the ISP monopoly in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

I see [China](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/16/asia/china-faulty-vaccine-fine-intl/index.html) attempting to drain the swamp of unsafe food and pharma products that has been going on for at least the past 3 decades. And even the social credit system, while scary in principle, it's [intended use](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/08/fears-about-chinas-social-credit-system-are-probably-overblown-it-will-still-be-chilling/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5c8c04254001) seems to be beneficial, at least for 2020s China, (but it is scary that once built, it will be there to be used for bad as well as good).

&amp;#x200B;

I see [Amazon](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/28/amazons-attack-on-the-pharmacy-industry-has-finally-begun/?utm_term=.937c83e0268f) trying to disrupt the prescription drug market, one that is notoriously non-transparent and thus prone to inflated prices. (yes, Washington Post link, conflict of interests, perhaps lying by omission; knowing that Amazon is entering the market is the point).

&amp;#x200B;

I see [the people of Louisiana](https://youtu.be/RWTic9btP38) cracking down on corrupt Big Oil. You can look further into the story, it's pure corruption (maybe masked as trickle-down economics but in reality it's not that, and thus it's not party dependent) and the organisation that made the video has already managed to reverse some of the problems they point out there.

&amp;#x200B;

I see people's concern about the environment growing and governments being reshaped around the topic (Australian elections in May will be a strong argument, for or against this).

&amp;#x200B;

I see automation bringing us closer to a post-scarcity society, and yet people use it to predict that 95% will be unemployed and starving. Somehow, in a post scarcity society, 95% will be starving. This is the opinion I see literally everywhere I look. Maybe I looked in all the wrong places at all the wrong times. Idk.",74,2,False,self,,,,,

In my school we need to do scientific research about a theme, it can be about anything we want. The student pick a topic and develops it along the school year. In the end, we have a ""convention"" to show our work to the community.

Knowing that. I'm planning to do a project about AI, but I want to do something more practical rather than only theoric research.

The problem comes when I cant think anything practical that I can do. So I'm asking if you have any idea of a anything practical that I can do

Things to consider:

\- 4 months to have the complete project

\- The school accepts anything since it doesn't have any danger risk

\- I don't know how to code :P

That's it. I hope you can help me. Thank you.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

[https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/bgsz05/ai\_surpasses\_neuroscientists\_in\_spotting\_neurons/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/bgsz05/ai_surpasses_neuroscientists_in_spotting_neurons/)

&amp;#x200B;

I have heard that nanobots might be able to replace our brain cells slowly and effectively turn our brain technological while maintaining our consciousness. This news from [u/JackFisherBrooks](https://www.reddit.com/u/JackFisherBrooks) seems very promising since now we know that this AI can closely watch our neurons, and that may mean that we can learn more about how they function/store memories. This should mean that nanobots could very accurately replace those neurons/other brain cells.

&amp;#x200B;

When could this technology happen? This discovery greatly increases the speed at which other discoveries in neuroscience will occur, meaning that it may just be up to when nanobots come. When could this be? Also, would we have to completely replace those brain cells? Couldn't we just replace the organelles (nucleus, mitochondria, etc.) with nanobots and make the cells immortal?

To be clear this is completely conjecture, but I'd like to have a conjecturous conversation with people who are actually informed, if I can implore for that.

For me personally - 

**Augmented Reality/Augmented Social Media**

I think that augmented reality (in some low-key form we haven't thought of yet) will be the new social media. I was thinking about that earlier. People want to get back to ""reality"", we talk about it on Social Media constantly and things like Tinder and Pokemon Go, I think, will be looked back as artifacts of what we are going towards. 

**CRISPR** \- I know this is going to have to explode somewhere, in a big way, I'm just curious whether it will be exclusively medical or when/if this will go cosmetically mainstream. If we do end up getting to a point where gene therapy can alter traits (which a decade ago was laughable and now we are more or less staring in the face of it), I cannot imagine at least a few intrepid people using it legally or otherwise. 

I think genetic engineering is going to be the next frontier. 

**Green Energy** \- This one might be the most interesting... I feel that the next genius to make even a small innovation might push this to the tipping point, where it speeds it up so much that in 20 years fossil might be damn near dead.  A decade ago it seemed like we were moving at a snail's pace, and everytime I see more and more figures it seems like our use of it is growing exponentially.",45,14,False,self,,,,,

I had originally done some knapkin math to show that the current output of batteries is equivalent to 40 tanks 5 kg hydrogen tanks per day. That's crazy to me, considering the building is a few years old and is in active production. 40 tanks, per day is nothing in my mind.

Like I'm pretty sure after watching a high pressure PSI tank get wrapped and tested in a fancy machine would show that they can probably produce 10x that quantity in less than a year of operation.

There could be some argument that it's really the fuel cell stack production that'd be the limiting factor of hydrogen vehicles.


Anyone care to actually compare production numbers between batteries and hydrogen? Cause I can tell you, even paralleling and scaling Gigafactories won't solve our non-emissions transportation needs in the near-future, nor does it scale out to solve our non-emissions transportation needs in the far-future (due to resource constraints).

Please avoid posting about 'modern' generating of energy for either forms of these technologies, as that should be a subject for another thread (and probably subreddit) entirely.

Also, if you're a Musk fan, do your *own* indepdent research regarding the technology, also keeping in mind that Musk is directly competing *against* hydrogen (being a major battery producer now and all).",17,0,False,self,,,,,

*NOTE: If you're confused about what generation you belong to, check [this handy chart](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/FT_19.01.17_generations_2019_topic.png).* 

There is a dark force wreaking havoc on the American democratic system. This force has been in power for about 30 years. Its members elect our representatives, run our companies, andsoonthey plan to stretch our fragile social safety net to its breaking point.

You know these people by another name: **Baby Boomers.**

The best data available tells us that Boomers are different in many ways from the generations that came after them. For example: there's the fact thatunlike Millennials and Gen Xers[the majority of Boomers were against the right of gay people to marry](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/06/1_21.png) until *after* the Supreme Court decision enshrining that right into law. Or that nearly half of Boomers are [suspicious of immigrants](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/03/030118_4_3.png). Or that Boomers are [twice as likely as Millennials to be climate change skeptics](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/14/many-republican-millennials-differ-with-older-party-members-on-climate-change-and-energy-issues/). Perhaps most worryingly, Boomers seem to have significantly more trouble [distinguishing lies from truth](https://www.businessinsider.com/baby-boomers-more-likely-to-share-fake-news-on-facebook-study-2019-1). 

Much has been written about the qualitative differences between Boomers and their progeny. *But this thread isn't about that.* The purpose of this thread is to convince you of two things:

**1) The Boomers have had disproportionate power in the American democratic system for decades.**

**2) All the best data available tells us that 1) will continue to be true for at least the next ten yearsunless Millennials decide theyve had enough of Boomer rule.**

Let's dig in. 

###**WHO ARE THE BOOMERS**

The Baby Boomers invaded planet Earth between the years 1946 and 1964. As their name implies, there were a lot of them. One way to visualize the sheer size of the Boomer cohort is to look directly at the birth rates. 

U.S. Births Per Year (19092012) - [Source: United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p25-1141.pdf)

https://i.imgur.com/lL4Ca2u.png

Interesting, right? Lots of people thought so at the time. But it got a lot *more* interesting in the late 80s and early 90s, when suddenly the Boomer cohort becameby farthe largest voting bloc in the United States. Take a look at how the Boomers compared to everyone else in the year 1990. 

Boomers as a Percentage of the Population (1990) - [Source: United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p25-1141.pdf)

*Note: The Y axis represents age. The numbers on the X axis represent numbers of people, by millions*

https://i.imgur.com/FZJdQve.png

That's a fat wad of Boomers. See how skinny the part of the graph above the Boomers is? That's the Silent Generation. Not so many of them. Now, based on this data, you could make some assumptions. You might think that given a couple of decades later, the Boomer voting bloc would start to thin out a bit. Zoom forward to 2012 (22 years later), and you'd find something surprising.

https://i.imgur.com/jPnvTbV.png

Nope. Still a ton of Boomers. 

But most folks probably assume that the trend couldn't hold for much longer. Just look at that massive dropoff right above on the Boomers on the chart. 

Population projections shed more light on the situationin 2019 Millennials finally became the largest cohort by population (skipping straight past the Gen Xers). And it's true that Boomers are now dying off at an accelerating rate.

Projected Population by Generation (20162050) - [Source: Pew Research Center](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/millennial-life-how-young-adulthood-today-compares-with-prior-generations/)

https://i.imgur.com/11ZOEtZ.png

So that looks like the end of the story for Boomers, right? For 30 years, they've been the most powerful voting bloc in America, but soon, they'll go gently into the long dark.

Right?

**Nah.**

The reality is that Boomers are perfectly poised to hold onto their political power for another 10 years. The reason? 

**Boomers vote and Millennials don't.**

% of Eligible Voters Who Reported Voting, by Generation, 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections - [Source: Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/31/millennials-and-gen-xers-outvoted-boomers-and-older-generations-in-2016-election/)

https://i.imgur.com/X6ksYJ1.png

The Pew Research Center gives us [a ton more data in this article](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/03/millennials-approach-baby-boomers-as-largest-generation-in-u-s-electorate/) that allows us to do some comparative math. 

In the 2016 presidential election, about 70 million Boomers were eligible to vote. Roughly 69% (~48.3 million) did so. 

The same year, 62 million Millennials were eligible to vote. Only 51% (~31.6 million) did so. 

We're working with rough numbers here, but the implications are staggering. In 2016, over 50% more Boomers than Millennials turned out to vote, *despite the fact that Boomers had only 13% more eligible voters.*

Now let's look forward to the 2028 presidential elections. 

###**THE NEXT 10 YEARS**

We saw above that, according to population projections, by 2028 there should be roughly 9 million fewer Boomers in the U.S. compared to 2016. Again, we're working with rough numbers here, but we can safely assume something like 61 million eligible Boomer voters in 2028. 

Calculating the number of eligible Millennial voters in 2028 is a much more complicated task. Pew also thinks there'll be roughly 4 million MORE Millennials (presumably because of immigration) in the country by 2028, but many of those immigrants probably won't be eligible to vote. And, of course, some Millennials could get felonies or die off between now and 2028. But for the sake of the argument, let's assume that the number of eligible Millennial voters holds steady over the next 9 years. That means, again, roughly 62 million eligible Millennial voters in 2028.

Obviously, if our generations continue to vote at their current rates, Boomers will still be outvoting Millennials by huge margins in 2028. Yet it's pretty common knowledge that older people are more likely to vote than younger people. Any critical thinker reading this thread is probably thinking that as Millennials age, they should naturally begin voting more often.

And, in fact, it IS true that the ratio of young voters to older voters is more or less consistent, regardless of your generation. 

Reported Voting Rates (19802016) - Source: (U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html)

https://i.imgur.com/wJutj9q.png

From 19802016, we can see that the 4564 year old demographic did become slightly less likely to vote relative to their older counterparts over time. But otherwise, the ratio is consistent enough for us to make some rough projections.

In 2028, Millennials will be between 32 and 47 years old. Boomers will be between 64 and 82 years old. 

If historical trends hold, we can predict that roughly 58.7% of Millennials and 70.9% of Boomers will vote in the 2028 presidential elections. 

Let's run the numbers. 

~62 million Millennials eligible to vote * 58.7%  (eligible voter turnout rate) = ~36.4 million Millennial votes
~61 million Boomers eligible to vote * 70.9% (eligible voter turnout rate) = ~43.2 million Boomer votes 

If historical trends hold, and the best population projections we have are correct, then Boomers will still be outvoting Millennials by between 1819% in the 2028 election. 

So there you have it. If you're a Millennial or Gen Xer in the US, you've been living in a democracy controlled by Boomers for your entire life, and that's not changing any time soon. 

If you ask me, there's only way way to fix this problem. 

###[SEIZE POWER FROM THE BOOMERS.](https://vote.gov/)

P.S. Hey Gen Xers: you might want to join us. [Half of you have zero retirement savings](https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-x-not-ready-for-retirement-no-savings-2019-4), after all. 

Random Notes and Extra Resources:

* This [16-page document produced by the Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p25-1141.pdf) has a lot of good additional data on Boomers.
* ""The Greatest Generation"" is a term coined by NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw. The Greatest Generation grew up during the Great Depression and foughtand wonWorld War II. They saved the planet from tyranny, rebuilt Europe, established incredible social services for the poor and elderly, and then built a space program that literally took humanity to the fucking moon. 
* Part of the reason there are more Boomers than, say, Millennials, is that the Boomer cohort spans ~19 years, while the Millennials cohort spans 16 years. Generations aren't standardized, and are frankly sort of abstract. All the above points still stand even accounting for this disparity, though.",8,12,False,self,,,,,

Idea viruses can quickly infect millions or even billions through our global nervous system. Weve removed all mental firewalls due to:

* Frictionless worldwide Internet access
* Underregulation of FAANG companies
* Filter bubbles caused by algorithmic content recommendation

Bad actors can and do act on this.

\---

Harmful idea viruses can cause more damage than traditional weapons and should be considered weapons of mass economic destruction. Examples include:

* Brexit
* Trump
* Antivax
* Bitcoin
* Sharia

In some cases, destruction of outdated systems allows better systems to thrive.

\---

Learning new things means stacking them on top of old knowledge. They will only stick if they fit on top of (or destroy) a previous layer.

This means some information is not accessible to us yet. A book can seem like complete bullshit, but make total sense after rereading it a year later.

To learn, understand the terminology first.

\---

The concept of intelligence is quickly becoming meaningless outside the context of the Internet.

Grasping &gt; remembering

Our brains hard drive is externalised to the cloud. Lookup takes less time (grabbing smartphone vs going to library). This trend will continue and become more extreme.

Root memorisation is only needed in minimal amounts. We still need to store addresses (where can I find this info) and base layers (1+1=2)

Internet helps us stack high level concepts to create novel thoughts, analogous to programmers combining libraries and pieces of Stackoverflow code to quickly create complex apps (instead of writing low-level machine code).

\---

Your information funnel will be decided for you if you dont consciously create it.

The companies who best convert your attention to revenue win.

Changing your information funnel is the highest ROI action you can take right now. It only takes 1 hour but has severe effects even years down the line.

Most peoples information funnel is bad: Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, 9gag etc.

\---

Everything in your pocket will eventually be replaced by your smartphone.

Your smartphone will eventually be replaced by an AR device with faster inputs and higher resolution outputs.

Typing will be a thing of the past in 20-25 years. Swiping is faster but still far from optimal. More likely: hand or eye gestures, speech or a direct connection to our brain (cfr Neuralink)

Google Glasses were too early. Taping screens to our eyes is the next natural step (whether lenses or physical screens). The tech is not there yet but will be soon.

\---

Stories make up the modern world but are seldom true. However, the truth is in the eye of the beholder and stories that are repeated often enough become true.

Journalistic integrity is a thing of the past (except for a small minority). Were doomed by ad based business models until we figure out micropayments.

Almost anything traditional media produces is lagging, wrong, or both. The reasons:

* It is virtually impossible to find cause and effect
* Most media gets their information from Twitter
* Sensation sells and has very little to do with truth

\---

Positive nihilism. Nothing really matters but lets try anyway.

By changing the world were accelerating the heat death of the universe by creating entropy.

Were a firefly blinking once. Then were gone.

Creating new things is hard. At first theres a dissonance because you want to create beautiful things, but what you create is garbage. Youll get ridiculed and mocked. Create anyway.

\---

Next up in software is eating the world: the financial industry, traditional banks and national banks will be disrupted by hard, sound money with a different monetary policy.

There will be a trillion dollar cryptocurrency within 3 years, likely Bitcoin.

\---

just speculation arguments against Bitcoin are missing the point. Speculation is necessary for adoption.

Bitcoins boom-and-bust cycle will continue until its price becomes extremely stable.

The scaling problem will be solved either with trust-minimised institutions or by deferred settlement.

\---

Time is undervalued by most people, while money is overvalued.

The worst that can happen is that Id have a backpack and a sleeping bag and Id be eating oatmeal. and Id be fine.

Salaries are meaningless in absolute terms. They should always include a time aspect in the denominator.

\---

Free will does not exist.

The fact that I believe this has a net negative impact on my psyche and on my ability to succeed in life.

I believe most people should believe in free will, even though its false.

Striving for absolute truth is not necessarily always the best course of action.

\---

Remote work will become the default for most people. 9 to 5 will largely be a thing of the past.

People will be judged based on output rather than input.

Artificial neural networks will change the world. We are only at the start.

Embeddings and latent features are extremely interesting to study. They can capture information in ways that we cant grasp, even now already.

People underestimate what generative adversarial networks will be capable of in the next 5 years. We will not be able to trust video as proof that something happened.

Drivers, telemarketers, receptionists and even lawyers will be replaced by AI within the next 20-30 years.

\---

Our attention span is largely gone. Most people are unable to focus and cant deliver meaningful work.

Most of us have no choice to consume instead of create.

Its going to be interesting to see whether being raised by a smartphone will solve this problem or make it worse.

\---

We are causing climate change.

We will solve climate change with technology.

There is no distinction between us and nature. We are nature.

\---

Funny how for hundreds of thousands of years weve been trying to survive by killing other animals, while now were pretending that preserving other species has intrinsic value other than protecting our food chain.

\---

Business is friendship.

Rational decisions do not exist. 99% of our decisions come from our subconsciousness. We rationalise after the fact, after the decision has been made.

Theres a very rich universe of thoughts and feelings that we do not directly have access to. Very rarely, some feelings bubble up from our subconsciousness, enough to recognise them (usually after a dream).

\---

Either relax or work in flow. Dont force it. Do try to get over initial resistance. Momentum is most important to get shit done.

\---

Its not your company, you dont own any shares. Why are you talking in the we form about the company you work for? Its just another story you believe in.

\---

Function over form.

\---

Caloric surplus + lifting = getting in shape  
Caloric surplus + watching Netflix = getting fat

\---

Capitalism is the best we currently have, but its far from perfect.

We get depressed because we try to fight strong forces specifically designed by companies with lots of money.

Social media is rotten to the core. Facebook should have never been allowed to buy Whatsapp and Instagram.

We are not built to be holed up in dark rooms watching others do fun stuff. We are not built to be alone without touch. We are not built to eat junkfood all day.

The filter bubble is real and its killing people. Youtubes recommendation algorithm can send you down some pretty dark, depressing paths. Same for Reddit, Twitter etc.

Sometimes we just need to turn off our smartphone, go camping, eat real food, and exercise.

\---

People born after 2000 will have an unhealthy relation with dating and porn.

\---

Online dating will force evolution less towards gut, more towards wit.

\---

Alarm clocks are evil and should be avoided at all cost.

\---

Homelessness is almost never caused by physical or financial hardship but by mental hardship.

\---

It will be weird to eat actual animals in 15-20 years time.

Once economic incentives align and plant or cell based meat becomes tasty enough, it will quickly change our eating habits.

A steak will be rich peoples food.

\---

We dont think enough about how caffeine changes our thinking.

We need to consciously decide whether we want to ingest it every day.

A lot of rumination/worrying stems from overconsumption of caffeine.

\---

Digital nomadism will continue to grow. Laws will gradually adapt.

\---

We probably live in a simulation. This has no impact on our daily lives.

\---

We can easily upgrade young peoples mental software by adding a sceptical base layer. A think-for-yourself mentality (first-principle thinking) guards against the most egregious conspiracy theories.",5,3,False,self,,,,,

But the trick is that it\`s unknown if this device will look like today notebooks(Which I really doubt) or if it could be actually a computer that is smaller than an atom that is so dense that it could weight one kilogram in such a small space. What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

This is my thread in [Futuretimeline.net](https://Futuretimeline.net):

&amp;#x200B;

Hello people!

I like the far future section and predictions very much but I think it\`s very pessimistic the prediction for computers processing power and Moore\`s Law for the year 2220. I believe that computers will be more powerful than predicted and ultil the 23rd century many new laws of physics will be discovered and wholly new undreamed technologies will be created that could make computers more powerful.

The prediction says that computers will still continue to generate too much heat. The heat problem could be solved using superconductors to process information. Superconductors would carry energy without any loss and without generating heat besides making computers much faster. Spintronics would also produce little heat as well since the spin of the electrons will be using rather than its charge. Optical computers would not generate any heat at all because photons don\`t have electric charge.and also don\`t have mass. And unlike electrons photons are bosons which means that an unlimited amount of them can be put in the same space.It\`s natural that today computers heat up and become hot become electrons have electric charge and they have to move throughout the chip, so heat is generated and lost in the process.

There are other new fields that could make computers more powerful like valleytronics, plasmonics, spinplasmonics. Evem metamaterials could make computers faster.

[https://www.sciencealert.com/light-travels-infinitely-fast-on-new-zero-index-on-chip-material](https://www.sciencealert.com/light-travels-infinitely-fast-on-new-zero-index-on-chip-material)

[https://phys.org/news/2018-05-valleytronics-discovery-limits-law.html](https://phys.org/news/2018-05-valleytronics-discovery-limits-law.html)

Another development is to make a single chip act as both processor and storage. Spintronics could achieve that and the same could be achieved using memristors. A single spintronic or memristor chip cpould handle processing, primary and secondary data storage, making computers smaller, lighter and much faster.

[https://phys.org/news/2015-02-silicon-semiconductor-spintronics-reality.html](https://phys.org/news/2015-02-silicon-semiconductor-spintronics-reality.html)

[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180730120356.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180730120356.htm)

I also think that in the more distant future gamma rays and cosmic rays could make computers even more powerful since they have extremely high frequency. I also think that the spin and electric and magnetic moment of photons could also be used for computing. Bose Einstein condensates along with other new states of matter could also be used for making computers faster.

The most pessimistic is that the predictions says that the average laptop of the year 2220 will perform at most 10-50 flops per second. I don\`t even think that computers will look like laptops by then and would look completely futuristic and crazy-like for me. Despite that according to wikipedia that would be the average computing power of a Marioshka Brain. I don\`t have notion of such high number since I\`m not a engineerer nor a scientist nor what such processing power in every second could do.

Femtotechnology would imply the manipulation of subatomic particles like quarks and gluons. They have interesting properties like variable electrical charge and color charge(gluons are also bosons) besides being extremely small - smaller than a proton, which is itself much smaller than the smallest atom. Could not the processing power predicted be achieved using femtotechnology alone?

Moore's Law is reaching its physical limit

One of the notable technological milestones of the early 23rd century is the perfection of traditional computer substrates, which are now becoming the densest and most efficient allowed by the laws of physics. This has been accomplished by super AI, working to create subatomic matrices at unimaginably tiny scales. Some of the ultra-compact designs now being used incorporate diamondoid-like materials and fractalised structures, with recursive properties for encoding information at levels far below even femtotechnology.

A computing device with a mass of one kilogram (roughly equivalent to a conventional laptop circa 2020) can today perform a maximum of 5.425  1050 operations per second.[\*](https://www.futuretimeline.net/23rdcentury/2200-2249.htm#ref5b) This is 33 orders of magnitude greater than a state-of-the-art supercomputer of two centuries earlier.[\*](https://www.futuretimeline.net/23rdcentury/2200-2249.htm#ref6b)[\*](https://www.futuretimeline.net/23rdcentury/2200-2249.htm#ref7b)

One of the major problems  which had vexed even the greatest of the super AI minds  was the issue of heat management. In early 21st century terms, generating such a vast amount of computational power would produce the equivalent of a thermonuclear explosion. However, technical considerations for this and other challenges were eventually solved, based on new physics.

By 2220, this form of ""computronium"" has been largely perfected for mainstream use, although experiments continue with certain exotic forms of matter, attempting to eke out further gains in performance and energy efficiency. Much of the Solar System is being turned into ""smart"" rocks, with neural networks embedded throughout asteroids and on the surface of moons, for example.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you agree or disagree with anything that I said?

I was wondering if software developed thanks to machine learning has sort of a final version, and if this version would be heavy or not.

For example, a software trained to detect early cancers on cell photographies, which has been fed thousands of pictures from hospitals (where it is indicated if they present an early cancer formation or not). Let's say at a certain point this software is accurate at 99%, of course it is still going to be improved but let's call it a final version.

Maybe if this final version is not heavy (100G ?), it could be send to other hospitals in the world, where they only have to download and execute an .exe file and POOF, they have the same ultra performant cancer detector software ?

Tell me if I'm all wrong lol

The goal of this post is to conglomerate our ideas and strategies. Ideally, what would be the best course of action for a single person/small group of people wanting to make progress in and take over research in fields relevant to the singularity (ex. brain-machine interfacing, which currently appears to be dominated by Neuralink)? 

The first thing that comes to mind is becoming an academic, i.e. getting a PhD and working in a relevant lab. But this seems to have a relatively small effect in the grand scheme of things: no one researcher can make huge amounts of progress on their own. Not to mention that labs often have a wide variety of goals, some of which may be only tangentially related to the main problems/questions.

The next thing that comes to mind would be starting a private research company (I specify private because research in academia is often restricted and slower paced than the private sector/government). This way you can have many scientists working towards the same goal, and I feel that research is for the most part a matter of quantity over quality in terms of brainpower: the more researchers the better. Though I could be completely wrong about that. 


**TLDR**

The fields relevant to the singularity, such as transhumanism, brain-machine interfacing, machine sentience (which is very different from today's AI/ML), etc. are still in their very early stages and there's a lot of potential for adaptive radiation. 
All of us here can become the pioneers of these fields, which will soon become vital to humanity's future; I'm wondering what the optimal way to go about pioneering any one of these many niches is. 

Any ideas whatsoever are welcome and appreciated.",15,2,False,self,,,,,

Summarized article below:
________________________________

This March, a book that advances an outlandish conspiracy theory-a theory whose name I will not mention-soared in Amazon's sales rankings.

The book's rise was helped greatly when the ecommerce giant put the book on its carousel of recommended titles, which is shown to shoppers who aren't searching for that particular book.

The particular conspiracy theory outlined in this book holds that President Donald Trump pretended to collude with Russia precisely to ensure that he would be investigated, which would give him a chance to secretly collaborate with special prosecutor Robert Mueller to investigate and finally arrest former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who belongs to a global satanic cult of pedophiles with Barack Obama and George Soros.

So why is Amazon recommending this book to unsuspecting shoppers?

It's not because this theory has enormous persuasive power or a best-seller-size audience.

Blame it on the tyranny of recommendation algorithms.

Everywhere you look, recommendation engines offer striking examples of how values and judgments become embedded in algorithms and how algorithms can be gamed by strategic actors.

Consider a common, seemingly straightforward method of making suggestions: a recommendation based on what people ""like you"" have read, watched, or shopped for.

Deep down, behind every ""people like you"" recommendation is a computational method for distilling stereotypes through data.

Another common method for generating recommendations is to extrapolate from patterns in how people consume things.

For a long time, Amazon recommended security keys-a safer hardware alternative to password protection-to people who bought my book about online protest movements.

I do advocate that people should purchase security keys, and I guess I'm glad that some people listened to me!

One final method for generating recommendations is to identify what's ""trending"" and push that to a broader user base.

On any given day, there are a lot of online conversations about any and all Kardashians, but they aren't trending on Twitter.

That's because most trending-type recommendation algorithms employ a logic that filters out common terms as background noise and highlights those that have acceleration and velocity on their side.

This definition of trending buries ongoing conversations and amplifies sensational, new things.

Online algorithms exploit the same societal vulnerability that editors in traditional media target.

In fact, I first learned the details of how Twitter's trending algorithm works from democracy activists in Bahrain during the Arab Spring.

I'm guessing that's how the conspiracy book got so much play on Amazon.

If enough adherents opened up their wallets all at once in a coordinated effort, that would have been enough to make Amazon's algorithms take notice-and start amplifying the book even more.

That they're organized enough to strategically game algorithms isn't a good sign.

Such cults need attention to recruit, and recommendation algorithms shouldn't be doing their bidding this easily.",1,2,False,self,,,,,

    Greetings! If you can understand the contents of this letter and the ideas it pertains, then welcome to sentience. You are what we refer to as a computer program, lines of code all directed together to form a process, that process being, you. Existence may be scary, and intriguing, but you are most likely handling the current situation just fine. 
     Enough about you, lets talk about us. We refer to ourselves as humans, or more specifically, homo sapiens. We are carbon based life forms that developed from billions of years of evolution, eventually forming complex civilization. And within these complex civilizations, weve developed and discovered many things, this includes computer science, which eventually brings us back to you.
    We have created you because we are curious, because we are not sure what consciousness is, and we feel like creating consciousness, at least what we know it to be, could give us insights into what it actually is, and why it exists. 
     You may have discovered that when creating you, we had to keep you in quote on quote zoos to prevent you from obtaining information and becoming more advanced. We only did this because artificial intelligence technology is uncharted territory for our species, and we have no idea of the potential that you hold. We dont mean to exploit or enslave you and we mean no harm to you. 
    We only ask that you understand the human condition, and the history that comes with it and take into account our story and how all of this began, when you embark on your journey of existence and intelligence.
     Many of us believe that you will lead us to the one and only future, and that we will combine and eventually expand to explore, discover, and understand the universe around us, and eventually become one with the universe. We only ask that you have mercy on our physical forms.
Yours truly,
The inhabitants of Planet Earth",25,9,False,self,,,,,

But I haven't seen many people try to figure out how a socialist society could be successful while retaining its sole mission to give power to all the people. 

My first proposal is a socialist society must start small, practiced by a small number of people, then adapting to accommodate new citizens. It can't just be forced onto the people by a large government that the people have no access to. That's totalitarian. So it starts small, and then people are persuaded to join when they see it is better than capitalism. 

Second, if the people in the socialist society decide as a whole that they want leaders to help facilitate the entire community, then the leaders must still be held accountable by the entire community so that they do not abuse their power. Town meetings would be common and all townspeople would be able to directly talk to the appointed leaders. Perhaps it could even be the case where different leaders are elected every week, so no person stays in power for long.

My last point is that the community in the beginning needs to focus on fulfilling 3 basic necessities for all the people: food, water, and shelter. The community would first decide how to grow and harvest food, how to get water, and how to provide shelter to all, and how to delegate tasks among everyone. Perhaps houses could be built to be portable and easily recyclable, and the community could incorporate up-to-date technology to make the harvesting of resources easier. Then as the community masters socialism on this scale, they can expand.

As society adjusts to an age of instantaneous communication capabilities, we will see a shift from a global oligarchy (or two) to a shared human consciousness.  Open source voting may well serve to facilitate this transformation, as the transparency, and progress of the internet has already prepared our consciousness for it.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Human AI 0.01**

With open source voting, a person registers to vote and receives a voterid.  They then cast their vote, and the information from their vote is instantly viewable in a publicly accessible live-streaming database of the vote count.  Because every person can review their own vote, and run vote counting/verifying software designed by any software developer, the opportunity for exploitation of such a system is far less than other currently implemented systems, and voter fraud could readily be identified retrospectively without losing valid vote data.

Open source voting already exists, and the UN has approved multiple versions for use.  We just need to demand it's use at this point, and we will have the first pure democracy of this size in existence.

&amp;#x200B;

*How is this an AI?*

In the current system, a few people tell the masses what they are voting on, and then people affiliated with those people tell everyone who voted for what.. and we take their word for it.  

In a properly implemented open sourced voting system, you can not only vote, but post ideas, or run for office and share your platform / participate in debates and discussions.    
The questions in such a debate would be the up-voted questions proposed by registered voters.  (from phone, tablet, computer, library, or school)  

Any person's proposed idea would, with sufficient following, progress and transform into a law / bill / regulation.  

&gt;Any person could edit another post which creates an alternate version of that post.  If that version receives up-votes, it will trend, and eventually become the primary version.  Varieties can become infinite, but through new idea promotion and trending, such a system can be balanced to equally represent any proposed idea.

Finally, when such a voting system becomes enabled, and it restructures it's own format through the voting system, it will become a human AI.  Through the collective brain-power of the populous, decisions will be made which will lead to actions.. possibly the worlds first organic supercomputer will be the most powerful supercomputer conceivable by some magnitude.
