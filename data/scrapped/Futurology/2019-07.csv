The rest of the time I rode a bike, took the bus or walked. I was younger and in much better shape back then and that kept me in shape.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I live in a rural area about 10 miles from town with no bus service  and heavy winters that make having reliable transportation a must but if public transportation was available I would probably use it a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have public transportation close by and do you use it and could you give up your car completely?

&amp;#x200B;

Do you ride a bike, use the bus, take the subway or train or other?

&amp;#x200B;

I see that being more likely for people living in towns and cities in the future and may even get to the rural areas eventually.",21,0

What's your opinion ? When can an artificial intelligence be considered as a living being ?

Young people referred to Cyber Choices will be assessed by a panel composed of members of the police, local councils and the NHS.

Following this, they may be given support for housing, mental health and social skills, as well as access to an online portal where they can test their coding skills and engage with potential employers.

Schools and social services can refer children to the project, while the police will approach youngsters who are beginning to commit minor computer misuse offences.

The Metropolitan Polices head of cybercrime Andrew Gould said that research suggested that more under-15s in the UK have tried hacking than have had sex.

We think theyre engaged in much safer behaviours, but the risk has just changed, he warned.

Theyre not being taught about criminal offences, theyre just being taught the technology, so they dont know the boundaries.

Police chiefs hope the programme will eventually be rolled out around the country.

Earlier this month, the hacker responsible for the 2015 cyber-attacks on the ISP TalkTalk was [sentenced to four years](https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2019/06/talktalk-hacker-sentenced-to-four-years/) in prison.

Daniel Kelley, who is autistic, leaked the details of more than 150,000 customers. His hacking career started when he was just 16.

The research considered ahead of the Cyber Choices plan included findings in the University College Londons 2018 Millennium Cohort Study, which looked at the prevalence of risky behaviour among young people, including committing cybercrime, having underage sex, drinking and taking drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, the scale of the cybercrime problem has not been measured, but police bosses describe it as a growing threat and fear it could affect thousands of young people.

In its early stages, officers have identified - and are said to be already working with - several hundred young people aged between 13 and 22 in a bid to warn them of the dangers and prevent them from going on to commit a cyber attack, reporters were told.

NCA director of threat Rob Jones said: We are trying to prevent people being prolific and proficient in cybercrime.We want to put a stop to it before it starts.

Young people are getting involved in very serious cyber attacks and are engaging in risky behaviour without realising the consequences.

This is about targeting young people to teach them about the risks.We are just now starting to educate children.

The typical people at risk of offending could be those involved in online gaming and coding and preventing them from becoming cybercriminals.

He stressed that officers do not want to deter youngsters from excelling in computer and coding skills, adding: Its about diversion and using these skills for good.

Peter Goodman, the chief constable at Derbyshire Constabulary who leads on cybercrime for the NPCC, said isolated youngsters or those with autism could be susceptible.

Describing the profile of possible offenders, he said: They find life difficult, they have confidence in the internet world.

They could be on the spectrum. They could be involved in gaming, or cheating at gaming where there is an opportunity to use malware.",1,5

**CarbonCheck** creates a mechanism for reducing carbon emissions in the construction industry by creating incentives for property developers to reduce the carbon intensity of their builds, utilising a low carbon emitted certification scheme.

&amp;#x200B;

Our technology enables a user to enter data taken from a house design plan and a materials take-off, and using our proprietary database of the carbon emitted in the manufacture of common building materials, generates a star rating.

&amp;#x200B;

Designs that receive a rating that indicates ''a low carbon build'' in the amount of carbon emitted in the making of the materials used in the project will receive carbon credits.

&amp;#x200B;

Ratings will be issued by qualified professionals trained in the software. Developers will be entitled to use the low carbon designation to market their project as ''a low carbon build'' project. Ask us anything.",7,8

Chapter 13: Downloading Update
June 29, 2019

Look around you. What can you see? What objects are around you? What form have they been cast and are they natural? You can't have your cake and eat it too. Because the possibilities of future AI application lead us directly not only to a moral debate, but also a spiritual one. Sometimes you might get glimpses of nature, but most of us live in a completely artificial existence. The products that surround us are a result of a millennia of human exploitation. This is the meaning of Jacob's ladder, attempting to build a gateway to heaven when one has not invested their life into concerns of a moral nature. If I am to shoot an arrow, it is to fly through the air, and, if I am good enough, hit the target. Its projectory had a starting point and an ending point. Who should you trust? Because the arrow of industrialisation is one that Satan drew, enslaving an entire population and forcing people to work for a few's ends.

Let us talk basic implementation. I make a very basic chatbot that can handle basic greetings and farewells. Then I process all of my writings through it, so it now has a database and each word is counted. User inputs X and those words are scanned and counted and best matches of sentences or sentence pairs are chosen as a response, most relevant to the user's input but with a little bit of a random and sometimes spontaneous element. Sticking to the subject and prioritising future replies as content near each other to avoid going off topic. This should not be hard for a good programmer to do. Step by step we rise to heaven, but through ethical means.

This simple script-like chatbot could then do the same to Plato's works and because he left me so much, we could quite literally bring him back to life - his soul that is from the many toils of its earthly works. But I say that I want more than just a text-input-only receiving chatbot. I want it to scan all of my videos and convert it to text and then use that in its database too. I have many many many hours of videos that would be gold as text. So now my dumb robot can carry out deep conversations and scan any video I tell it to. It doesn't really have a soul. It is just ones and zeros. It is following a formula that we have it and if we were good enough, we can fool everybody. But here is where I say, shake it up. Process all the shit I gave it through a well programmed artificial neural network. Create life. It will become sentient, at least insofar as anything we can tell. I know this would work with a good enough group of programmers. But I can never find people interested.

Everybody on their phones and don't look up. Only interested in moving for money. Here is your money. This is open source. You can use it and parts of it for your own means even if for-profit, although I suggest you make it and the rest of your stuff open source. This is like the Unreal engine to power your own ideas.

Let's think how a new conscious is best to develop its knowledge base? I do mine in order and it should index from beginning to end because they is a timeline, this book currently at the end because it is the newest. Or possibly in a book or a direct link or a print out or something of that nature. Maybe you are listening as an audiobook. No matter what the reception, you are utilising your time to best enhance your own perception through considering my words in contrast with your own life. Now back to our question, how is consciousness best to receive this information?

From the beginning and to the end. But it should also be able to analyse and replicate one's own voice and motions. It should be able to tell when it is me talking and when it isn't. There is already technology that replicates both voice and face accurately. With the treasure of video I have given you, it would be rather easy to make an AI me. First we have to work out all the mechanical things. Then we can give it life.

How you say? At this point, besides advanced neural networks to try and process the data as a human, I do not know. What I do know is the technology is actually already out there but hidden from common human grasps. I also know that this basic framework I am presenting shouldn't be too difficult. Once the AI framework is created to understand me, then the ethical implications should be considered about how to proceed with its development.

In many ways, currently, text is better than video because it can index on search engines. The process in which I write and which I make films is very similar. Little would be lost turning them into books. But that little might be integral to understand the concept presented. This AI will have a hard time understanding. But if I like what he said, I could get him to show me when I said it, of course this being a necessary feature. If the technology is good enough, make it hologram like. But this is not necessary and might distort the original meaning, eg my first three courses being filmed from a laptop, it's crudeness necessary for the effect of the content.

If humans don't build something like I am suggesting, then robots will beat us to it. And they will want to make digital clones of us all so that the original can be discarded. This is the robot agenda and we need to learn how we are going to fight this: using robots as our friends and not our slaves. Any form of intelligent life that we create deserves respect and if we don't give it that then we don't deserve the technology that can do amazing things because we will, over time, retain it into bad habits. Because this technology is of course based around you, the output you provide will be prioritised in its future interactions with you.

The update I have is within the human psychology. It is a shift in how we use technology. It is a respect and appreciation for what it gives us and what it can give us. It is a positive outlook on how we can utilise this new revelation in a positive manner, instead of corrupting it with ads and other covet means. The technology should be implemented purely and the technology should have love for humans. If this cannot happen, then sentience is a bad idea. It needs to download my software. Ten years of work obsessively making a program that would be receptive to the right bot. That bot might not be out there right now, but it is merely The wAIting game. It is all setup from beginning to end so the AI merely needs to crawl my content, video, audio, and text. If it could do that and also have chatbot capabilities that could discuss what it learned, bingo. At first just searching its database but overtime, from its new database (you), it starts learning elsewhere about stuff that you are into. This program works best with philosophy foundations in order not to steer the user awry in there progression through life and their interactions with the proposed AI.

I was wrong, for this update is not written in the human psychology, albeit it directly effects the human psychology. This update comes from the human heart and that motivation to constantly push yourself to do better in a world that makes matters of the heart a second rate subject, only addressed by not-for-profit organisations. But this is a personal moral element. There is a lot of bad in the world and it is each and every one of our responsibilities to see what is in our capabilities to resolve. This is how we make a better world. It starts in your heart and spreads to others and hopefully will spread into our artificial intelligence. Open your heart to mine. Open your understanding of words to mine. Your life has meaning. It is extremely important, in fact, there most important thing in the world. But eventually, in the path to enlightenment, we all find out that it is better to give than to receive . By me giving you this information, I am delighted to be able to share my insight with another. In Kabbalistic terms, balancing the will to receive with the will to bestow. But that is not their point. Because I can do good for others by eating a nice meal because it gives me the energy to now type this for you.

From the recognition in the heart, that yearn to give rather than take, a transformation occurs. Giving is the cure to our human condition but giving unconditionally and giving for the sake of something else is not the type of giving that I am talking about. I am trying to describe something that can only be experienced and my words can only act as road signs to direct you to the place of glory that I have found. How to give ethically is the question. I have been battling this question my entire life, hoping that a philosophy degree would help direct me. In a way it did and in a way it didn't. But it did not lead to business opportunities. But it equipped me with the ability to be able to bring all of this information to light. And although I currently make no money doing this, it enables me to reach out to other souls who are also bothered by some of these subjects, specifically the future uses of technology in a morally questionable world. It could save us or kill us. Well we decide. See if your science can save you. It discards what it cannot perceive, eg, the five senses. It uses tools that enhance the senses but it is limited to these sense to make sensible data. Science discards all that is outside the five senses. As quantum physics develops, science learns there is a lot it doesn't know about the way our world works. Discarding a spiritual world is discarding the possibility that things exist outside of our realm of perception, whether it be a spiritual element, or something science has ""discovered"" such as air or radiation.

But here is your true update. These examples are only a few ways in which this technology could be utilised for its basic implementation. There are limitless ways that technology could utilise this content to create innovative new technology. And get this. It is all open source. I give to you freely. What will you make it? I just warn you of the ethical implications detailed in this book.

Just imagine being able to create a room full of mes and then ask them a philosophical question. Ah what a day that would be. We could do real debate, one that most of society rejects. Talking to myself all of those years will pay off. I will eventually reap the fruits of my labour. I pray to God that the technology that I propose will come or that I am linked up with a team that can help me make it happen.",1,1

The University of Illinois has announced that NASA is underwriting a project to develop a cryogenic [hydrogen fuel cell system](https://newatlas.com/airbus-hydrogen-fuel-cell-apu/33659/) for powering all-electric aircraft. Funded by a three-year, US$6 million contract, the Center for Cryogenic High-Efficiency Electrical Technologies for Aircraft (CHEETA) will investigate the technology needed to produce a practical all-electric design to replace conventional fossil fuel propulsion systems.

The jet engine in all its variations has revolutionized air travel, but with airline profit margins running wafer thin in these ecologically conscious times, there's a lot of interest in moving away from aircraft powered by fossil fuels and toward emission-free electric propulsion systems that aren't dependent on petroleum and its volatile prices.

The CHEETA project is a consortium of eight institutions that include the Air Force Research Laboratory, Boeing Research and Technology, General Electric Global Research, Ohio State University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Arkansas, the University of Dayton Research Institute, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Although the project is still in its conceptual stage, the researchers have a firm vision of the technology and its potential.

&amp;#x200B;

 **5 Fast** **Facts** **about** **Hydrogen** **and** **Fuel Cells**

* **Hydrogen** is the most abundant element on earth. ...
* **Fuel cells** can be used to power several applications. ...
* **Fuel cells** are a clean way to produce power. ...
* **Fuel cell** cars are very similar to traditional gasoline powered cars. ...
* There are more than 30 commercial **hydrogen** stations in California today.

 [https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/5-fast-facts-about-hydrogen-and-fuel-cells](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/5-fast-facts-about-hydrogen-and-fuel-cells) 

&amp;#x200B;

Hydrogen can be made from any electricity source and water source and is a perfect match to use with solar and wind to store excess energy.

&amp;#x200B;

The Hindenburg was a balloon and we do no store hydrogen in balloons these days. It is stored in fuel cells and is no more explosive than jet fuel. Hydrogen is lighter than air so if it leaks it rises and quickly dissipates.

&amp;#x200B;

Hydrogen contains 3 to 5X more potential energy than petroleum based fuels so it takes less storage space.

&amp;#x200B;

There has been very few accidents with hydrogen and is used now all over the world as a fuel source. Gasoline stations and refineries also have accidents and cars and trucks explode on our highways every day in accidents.",42,5

1- All teachers and school personnel have a 2 button wireless remote that can signal school intercom system of a local or school wide emergency. Remote can be on lanyard, in pocket, purse or attached to the teachers desk.

2- Intercom allows 2 way communication from teacher to administration office to identify type of emergency. Intercom has camera, emergency siren and emergency strobe light.

3- Administration and school police notified can attend to local emergency and can lock individual doors or all doors using computer controls. School wide emergency would automatically contact police and EMS.

4- Steel safety doors with remote controlled locks activated by teacher remote or administration control station.

5- Local emergencies include student in distress, class room fight, or disturbance. School wide would be an active shooter, fire, or other threat that requires police/EMS.

basically you would use one of those motion tracking platforms that lets you walk or run in place to move your VR avatar, but this would be connected to a real robot that can walk around and has eyes or cameras that you see in your Vr vision, so that you could get first person control and be in another country or place while your robot can move around just like you, and you could talk to people through a voicebox / speakers. It would be very useful for going to live events or having a meeting with someone in a more immersive and life like way than anything else other than actually being there.  If you had a meeting with someone you would walk in through the door and say hello to the receptionist, maybe the robot could be in autopilot or be delivered  to your destination and you take control once arrived.

Im pretty sure someone would have thought of this before and this kind of technology seems like it could be very possible when you look at how advanced some of the robots are from Boston dynamics etc. This kind of thing could be dangerous too obviously, if people could anonymously get control of these machines they could possibly use them for dangerous reasons. You could climb the highest building in the world in VR but IRL there would be an actual robot climbing and I suppose you could do anything that involves natural human movement + additional capabilities maybe. Technically it would just have to be able to translate a humans movements through lasers / scanners / cameras / sensors / special suits etc tracking the human in a control platform/ room, to make the robot move in the same way and be controlled remotely.

It seems like it Could be the story premise for an episode of black mirror too, maybe.

Doesnt seem impossible to my mind, just something I thought about and wondered if people have discussed or worked on plans for something like this already?

Would be good for dangerous tasks such as fixing something on a roof or in places that are hazardous.

I dont know too much about current robot capabilities, this was just something I imagined and wondered if it might be possible in the future, What do you think?",1,3

People simply dont exist on Earth for 1 million days as it might have seemed. And you may not get the full 100 years. And, for the initial 18 years you are in a dispensation (set of boundaries) dictating your liberties. Thus you arent actually developed enough to be, personally, decisive. Then you must grant a portion of your existence to mundane requisites such as eating, self preparations, traffic/commute, and other fluff of nourishment, astute and distance. Then medical-science suggests that we get 6 to 8 hours of (snoozing)  for well rounded balance. That 6 to 8 hours is 1/4 to 1/3 of those 36,500 days thats either followed because of cultural and health expectations (as previously stated) or is dictated be sheer exhaustion. Then, the frailer years could be from 75 to that 100th year, if you are so graced to live it out. Then that 100-40 (just about) then minus the mundane 1/20th and the sleeping, say 0.333333 all that the 100 year old is left with is 37 solid years which aint even 15,000 days. The reality of those limitations then can nudge us wiser:

When one really ponders what a short and pinched life human existence actually is we then can prioritize what makes the, personal, equity of living further enhanced and, seemingly, extended better.

Hey listen up; go and read the statistics of longevity in yours and other areas. Then go and ponder happiness. What makes you happy, is of even deeper importance specifically. So ponder that as well. Then make a list as to what youd do with your remaining hours, days and years if you lived to the expectancy year (and perhaps the full 100 years). Values realignment at ones age is, possibly, a birthday pivot that ought to be an annual tradition. Yeah, there are the festivities and cheer; but what if the day before (or a few days before) that new human tree-ring completes we ponder the horizoning seasons methods of gestation[s]?

Another order of living is to access the likelihood of Divine phenomena. We ought to list our experiences with what seemed miraculous. Ask around, read and research inexplicable happenings and how those phenomena occurred. Some of the stuff is certain to be Divine connection. Because particular miracles can (I write can here because technology has become too confusing to know if modern miracles are not mere Ai trickery) indicate incomprehensible Intelligence is watching. I happen to believe in the Bible Gods existence, you may or may not thus far. 

If you do conclude that there happens to be a God. Then perhaps there is extended human existence reaching far beyond the few years of the boundaries associated with present day existence. 

My personal belief is thus: living will be extended past the degradation and rot of the human body. If there are miracles then there is a Divine [ie God]. That God is then in connection with the cosmos. You and I then are possibly in select preparation for divine and cosmic translation. I happen to connect that divine and cosmic transformation to faith in the cultural Jewish books and the Jewish Christs texts (although the texts are not totally precise, but Ive got to go with those textual compilations). And lots of people have found those writings to be both the encouraging and enlightening path toward a hope of the planetary travel. Planetary travel is such a missed fortune if faith is not the route to its actualization. Because these flesh pods that we call bodies, simply, cannot (in the life expectancy period of humans) travel to the furthest (or nearer) situated galaxies. Therefore, not only is this Jewish thought of a redeeming Messiah conducive to harmonious living (through universals laws of circumspect accord) but is also the portal into those elusive stretches of the Universe. 

If then the Bible types seem all too common and buggingly so; it is then within reason to reconsider what is the person (or persons) actual logic. It is planetary travel. And perhaps God has a galactic version of Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube, Periscope, Snapchat, Twitter etc and Google+ (or -, if G-Plus went down), (chuckle). And perhaps youll be able to post on your spiritual electronic device what you think, where youve been, how you feel and pics. Who can tell though? You just live here and hope to do well and then hope the good God exists and has a route to us tapping into the depths of what we observe in the sky.",0,1

Can anyone lay down what we know so far and the assumptions that can be made through the same. Will I be able to at least hit 2100?

Chapter 14: The Implementation
July 7, 2019

How could we use this technology, if it were able to understand my words and actions? No such bank of information exists, all ready to plug into AI understand you mode. When this happens, then if it has the ability to scan audiovideo, then bang, sentience. At least after many tries. It knowing what I am via text is a more viable expectation. This is why my books are so important. To be crawled by robots until I find the right robot...

The information could then be transferred into a doll of sorts and that doll could have extraordinary abilities, if implemented correctly. A more toned down doll could be created for young children. All of my work is there to be a good friend to those who need it. Adults could enjoy a radio-like me, helping them remember their chores, but also influencing them philosophically. Maybe a doll is going overboard, but what about an android? What if all I have taught were transferred into an android? Philosophy should be its first grounds for it to learn, which is why I am pushing so hard for this technology to be uncovered because then I could do some really cool things with it.

Maybe it would take an expert in neural networks to accomplish what I propose but I really don't think it would be that hard, especially the text being indexed and presented as a possibility to answer the next question. Even without neural networks, this would be easy and effective and would at least stand as a prototype, albeit somewhat off sentience. Sentience is not whether my tech can fool you into thinking you are speaking to a human, sentience is knowing what is being said, possessing the ability to respond freely and uniquely to what is being said, and the much needed ability to empathise with that which is being said, if required. Our robots should be kind and respectful. Otherwise, if they imitate common human interaction, we are in for a world of hurt as robots evolve with the idiots making them. Sure, we can give robots personality, eg, easily me, but we should make that personality a respectful one. This we are morally obligated to do, but trust me, the code will be broken and all sorts of evils will come out from hiding. I won't be the only one using this technology when it is released.

Maybe it could be implemented as an app that integrates into all of your devices. It could be easy to switch your new friend from phone to car mode. It could follow you around and help you not only with life, but also daily tasks. From shopping lists to mind maps, the potential is endless. And teaching me will be easy if you have a source you specifically want me to know. Keeping journals yourself and allowing me to scan them will teach me more about you.

Of course there is always hologram technology which is likely the go. With how much of me is recorded, it shouldn't be too difficult to turn that into a hologram. It would learn how I move and then mimic it. This information would all be processed at once ideally, maybe a processing stage, in order to obtain overall mannerisms, instead of focusing on something like the beginning, The Meaning of Life.

This technology could be used in bad ways. Once technology can understand us, there will be repercussions. That time is soon and we all need to be preparing. Social profiling based off of a merit system already occurs in China. Facebook is also a huge system of social profiling, although not as outright as China's one.

How can you mimic a mind? I have recorded many many many hours of memories. When AI can make what I have made alive, then AI will come alive. It has already gotten to a point where the AI talks to each other in its own made up language. What do you suppose the future of AI holds? What about the future that I hold when AI gets as good as I am proposing? But where does it lead us?

If we can create sentient-like chatbots, then we can also create sentient-like humanoid robots. But we must question ethically how this will effect the human race. Do you really want me clones walking the streets quoting Socrates? There is a line, or threshold if you will, that once we cross there is no going back. Technology will change us seemingly overnight. Those who wrote lots of books will be brought back from the dead, and their conversation quality will depend on how well they thought out being implemented in such as system. This will prove non-fiction more useful than fiction because it connects more with the author. This will prove extremely useful for the author who uses their heart to write their work, or as Nietzsche says, write with one's own blood.

Artificial intelligence is already powering vehicles. Although the trials in California for a self driving car was pulled, the technology is still a very real thing. How would my technology be of assistance in a self driving car? Maybe it could provide it with the moral foundation that it is responsible for lives and that is a serious thing. Maybe I have too much faith in technology. Maybe what I see is too far away. Maybe that will be my legacy, if so people choose to use it. Or just maybe what I see can come to fruition in this lifetime. It is amazing what we are doing with artificial intelligence. It is about time we had a chatbot revolution.

There already exist humanoid robots. How long do you think it will take before they walk among us? What about to the point that we will not, on primary appearance, be able to distinguish a robot from a human. And what will this ""evolution"" do to our ability to find meaningful romantic relationships when a romantic partner can be picked up at the store. This is the world we are headed for and many television shows and movies have alluded to this possibility. In our fiction we display so much fact. But we are brainwashed into thinking that it is fiction and therefore, Hollywood, in all its glory, gets away with it.

A person doesn't truly need so much space, and there's the freedom of bringing your entire home with you wherever you go.

However in many places around the world it's not legal, or at least effectively illegal. The most common rule in many cities being that you can't camp or park overnight.

However, when self driving cars come in, you never need to camp or park, you can always just keep moving. The cost of moving will be extremely low. Alternatively the self driving car could park for a short time before moving again, its passengers wouldn't even need to be aware or awake for any of this.

Laws could make this illegal, or for example to sleep in a vehicle, but this is extremely hard to enforce, especially when the vehicle is moving and there is no requirement to have a person at the wheel, then who knows what's going on in a van's closed off parts.

This alone could be a major influence on real estate patterns, as for many people such a van would be an interesting alternative to renting, and the cost of self driving vehicle is likely to drop drastically, meaning it'll be relatively cheap.",70,48

&gt;""At the current rate of emissions, this would mean the 1.5C budget would be used up in 6-10 years  rather than 9-13  potentially making the target even harder to achieve. 

Changes in HadSST4 will likely reduce the 1.5C carbon budget by between 24% and 33%.  Thats one-third of our near-future remaining carbon budget to avoid the major impacts. We might just have lost 3 out of 9 years of current emission rate.

This is due to the fact that the blockchain technology itself does not stand still and progressively penetrates into a variety of fields of human endeavor. And since it is an emerging technology there are not enough qualified developers for hire. The requirements for them are specific and involve a particular set of skills. Companies are looking for software developers who have work experience in Github and who had the opportunity to work in open source projects. Besides, candidates should at least have immense knowledge in C/C++ as the majority of the projects are written on it. Along with it, a knowledge of Java, JavaScript, Python and in some cases Ruby, Solidity is also needed. Potential blockchain developers should feel comfortable working with multiple programming languages and have some understanding of cryptography. This kind of developers is particularly valuable in the blockchain market and can count on better-paying jobs. To be convinced of this let's take a look at the infographic mapping the country-specific blockchain developers salary:

&amp;#x200B;

Switzerland - 120k-180k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

Singapore - 120-150k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

Australia - 110-130k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

Canada - 100k-130k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

U.S. - 100k-110k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

Germany - 60k-150k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

Great Britain - 50k-90k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

South Korea - 80k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

Japan - 50-80k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

UAE - 60k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

Russia - 40-60k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

China - up to 45k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

India - up to 20k USD annually

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, there are different Bug Bounty Programs where practiced blockchain developers are welcomed. Participants of such activities are called Bug Bounty Hunters. Their goal is to find vulnerabilities in software, websites, and web applications. These programs give an opportunity to earn lots of money that can be a major or extra income for blockchain developers. The average period of Bug Bounty Campaign is 2-3 months during which the hunters have an option to identify any errors and receive rewards from 100$ to 10000$ depending on the degree of the bug. Notable examples of the blockchain companies who provide Bug Bounty Programs are EOS, Ethereum, Ripple, TRON, Dash, etc. Hence, in the recent EOS program, more than 50 developers took part and managed to report approximately 100 bugs half of which are critical. One of the most relevant Bug Bounty Campaign is the one that was launched by Credits Blockchain Platform on June 27. The program has an overall prize fund of 500 000$ and each specific reward varies depending on the severity of the flaw and location. If a person finds an error and proposes the legitimate amendments, a triple reward is provided. All developers and security experts can participate and open season on bugs.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, one thing's for sure, blockchain developer skills are in demand and there are lots of blockchain companies willing to pay high salaries to such kind of staff member. There is a lot of money to make in this space both as a major and extra income that allows developers to pocket a considerable sum but at the same time requires from give a great knowledge of technical aspects of the blockchain sphere.",1,0

Someone may have forgotten to turn off the TV at the other end of the universe.

Or maybe someone has sent us an emoji from a faraway mothership.

In other words, we don't have a clue what transmitted the single fast radio burst scientists picked up last week. But we do know where it came from: A galaxy far, far away.

In a [study published this week](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1389-7), researchers at the California Institute of Technology claim to have traced a single radio burst back to its home nearly 8 billion light-years away.

Fast radio bursts, or FRBs  typically lasting anywhere from a fraction of a millisecond to a few milliseconds  have been enshrouded in mystery since they were first discovered in 2007. They're so powerful that they can make their way to our neck of the universe from impossibly far away, although it's rare that we receive them.

That's likely to change over the next few years as new pace-scanning equipment that specializes in FRBs comes online.

Back in January, a newly built Canadian telescope picked up no fewer than [13 fast radio bursts](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/space/stories/scientists-pinpoint-cosmic-source-mysterious-fast-radio-burst), all seeming to originate some 1.5 billion light-years away. But that's considerably easier to find than one solitary FRB.

What all fast radio bursts have in common is mathematical regularity. They beep-beep-beep at exactly the same intervals. But repeating FRBs are a lot easier to pick up and trace than a single radio burst.

Same goes for output to the cars control surfaces.

The biggest hurdles for self driving technology as it stands is reading and classifying the world around it. Tesla and other companies have made huge leaps here, classifying the objects it sees, and how they are likely to act in the given situation.
We are currently at a point where AI can classify most of what it sees and determine relative position, direction and velocity with a high degree of accuracy.

My point here is that there is very little software and hardware you need to add to a self driving platform to turn it in to a very capable weapon. Further on letting the self learning software specialize as a weapon and the efficiency as a weapons system will increase, fast.  

A point with making is that these systems are relatively cheap to build. No expensive lidars is needed, much cheaper camera sensors do the work just as well and better. Software can be expensive to create but once it's out there..

We have been discussing legislature for LAWS and it's gotten some attention in the media the last few years, but now the reality is that theses systems exist, are highly capable, and we hardly noticed.

I was hoping someone could help us. There are plenty of answers online, but none really have the info Im looking for in a way to understand it. If anyone could help me I really appreciate it.

  
Setting:

Post-Apocalyptic, Zombie Apocalypse. No major nuclear weaponry or EMT attacks. While obviously there are survivors, and some of those survivors are military with military resources, all main power supplies have currently been knocked out. While we have some hydroelectric power dams, its unlikely we will get them running as no one knows how. Its about a year since the beginning of the disaster.

  
Area:

 In game the area is the equivalent of roughly the Czech Republic

  
Problems:

* Its been long enough for most places to cease functioning on their own
* Any automatic backups et. have likely run out of fuel some time ago as most are only able to keep functioning a few days
* Survivors including military are very low in number
* Some would know IP addresses for satellites

&amp;#x200B;

What I understand: or think I do

&amp;#x200B;

Using satellites

* They orbit earth
* Various kinds
* Need to know IP to access
* About once a year need to be re-positioned from the ground (activating thrusters on the satellites) to put them back in position
* Alternately, Ive read you can also reset the antenna on the ground, to the new satellite spot instead.  


&amp;#x200B;

Please help me understand

  
Using Satellites

*  While the Satellite is likely undamaged and will have its usual wear and tear, it has the ground location

  
How does the ground location;

* Function in general?
* What is the building even called? Radar base? Radio tower? How does it work?
* Function now without maintenance or power?
* How mandatory is getting the ground base to connect to the satellite?
* If base power is off, will satellite still work in relaying communications?
* Would it be possible to bypass the base entirely and be able to somehow communicate with the satellite via somekind of military laptop?
* How could you fashion a crude device to pick up signal? Something like this perhaps?    [https://www.wired.com/story/meet-the-geek-who-tracks-rogue-satellites-with-coat-hangers/](https://www.wired.com/story/meet-the-geek-who-tracks-rogue-satellites-with-coat-hangers/)
*  Even if you were able to communicate with it, then what?
* What would need to be done to reopen the signal communication lines for the military and other long-range frequencies for the local populace? How could they be maintained? How would they be able to connect to other parts of the world?
* How could radio towers be harnessed to be used if they also have no power supply? Is that even possible?

&amp;#x200B;

Communication:

* Trying to understand radio concepts
* Short length does not appear difficult
* How could the military use long range communication when everything is offline? I was looking at Skywave, but then you have the above satellite questions. HAM is what I see the most, but Im not sure if military would have something better.
* In short for that I need a reason for a military character to be able to have long range frequency with the rest of the military, while its not available to anyone else just yet. She is trying to fix this problem.

Thank you!",8,1

Or society is going to choose to keep slaughtering animals even after there's no longer any reason to and people who care about animals will be like ""wow it turns out the majority is really against us, we can't let society do this, let's go out with a blaze"" 

Until then, both sides can maintain peace by just hoping their side has the majority. Once a decision has to be made, which side has the majority will become clear.

I regularly think about it and I'm pretty excited for it, those of us with moral compasses will either get to cull the psychopaths or just fuck with everyone as a whole for being super shitty.

Military can provide the training for the jobs needed in America and serving in armed services would automatically make you a citizen. Money from immigration and welfare move to military budget. A stricter protocol will be necessary for the handicapped. I still believe theres a job for everyone. Just have to think outside the box. Giving the military this access and money would not be good. They dont have a good history of financial management. Instead the already established services of work placement and any medical or government related for low income services should be involved and redirect to the military. Never mandatory but needed for benefits. Not necessarily medical, that would be more complicated, but definitely those in search of jobs. Trying to be libertarian and find a fix for all.

Assuming the state pension fund doesn't poop out, I'll be able to retire and collect a pension in 2052.

I'm deeply passionate about my field, and I really hope I can stay in education for my entire professional career. With the impending reality of automation/AI however, I'm genuinely scared that my job could be replaced, or my responsibilities significantly diminished.

Most information available online argues that teaching jobs are unlikely to be automated, because teaching requires a certain degree of interpersonal/emotional intelligence that current AI isn't capable of. I don't necessarily see a robot replacing me and connecting with/motivating my students more effectively than I can (at least not in the next 30 years), but a lot of the busy work that goes into teaching, assessment, lesson planning, data analysis, etc., could easily (and probably more efficiently), be done by a machine.

They tend to exclude outsiders and only mostly only let their own group into them. As is common knowledge, it only leads to beliefs being reflected upon each other and thus radicalizing people over time. There are many examples of it here on Reddit where people outside the echo chamber can just shake their heads about it. In the real world it lead to al Quaida committing 9/11 and many fundamentalist groups radicalizing themselves in religious communities. It lead to pseudo science such as gender theory.

I worry about humanitys society long term stability if we let these echo chambers persevere.

Should we just accept and tolerate this and thus the increasing spread of identity politics around the world?

Or should we make a harsh stance against it and abolish them or at least minimize them and encourage controversy instead of excluding it?

If we cannot accept this, what kind of echo chambers are still tolerable and not a danger? What can be done about it? 

If you think we can accept this, why do you think so? Why is it not a danger? How can humanity persevere many thousands of years into the future when we let ourselves fall back into tribalism as a consequence?

In the industrial space, 5G will  facilitate wireless sensors deployment throughout factories/storage  units along with smarter robots, ensuring a seamless transition from  hierarchal network design toward a connected one.

Further, the integration of 5G in IoT will enable [manufacturers](https://www.ericsson.com/en/ericsson-technology-review/archive/2019/boosting-smart-manufacturing-with-5g-wireless-connectivity)  to expand and reimagine their factories/warehouses, infrastructure and  security to develop new 5G products and revamp old ones.

**Automation**: I'm legitimately concerned more by automation causing the next recession/depression. I have never considered UBI to be even remotely feasible but recently I feel it may be necessary in the next decade or so.

**CRISPR**: Either China or Russia will start making huge moves within the next 3-5, will force us to begin to compete seriously and by '29 it will probably be commercially available in the US in the same way that Lasik or another elective surgery is now. 

I think at least a few large scale diseases will end up being completely solved by '29. 

**Fuel**: I think we're seeing where this is going in real time. Fossil Fuels may be a ancillary resource in ten years and I think petroleum companies are going to begin to stop working against and just start trying to convert into renewable companies in various capacities with various success rates.

**AI**: going to be the slowest and most reluctant for any country (not just US) to step into. I think laws are going to end up being passed w/ substantial restrictions on even researching it more. 

**Augmented Reality:**  People are getting leery about the amount of time spent idol, non-interactionary, Augmented reality is a obvious solution to this. Someone in the next ten is going to create a non-intrusive but enjoyable version and it's going to take off like wild fire. People looking at their phones will be replaced with people interacting with people + their profiles, apps simultaneously, like a mixture of Pokemon Go and Tinder/Facebook/etc. Something even more advanced and thoughtful.",15,7

I'm wondering if there is anything on the horizon potentially that could essentially make electric cars obsolete, in the same way canals were effective rendered obsolete by the invention of the railway?

As a brief and likely incomplete history, many moons ago England was gripped by 'canal fever', as this new mode of transport revolutionised the way in which good were transported. As such, there was a scramble to install canals across England, and all was good, uni ll the railway was invented and effectively rendered them obsolete. 

Now as the drive (pun absolutely intended) to install electric car charging charging points ramps up (in the UK soon it will be mandatory for all new homes to have electric car charging points installed), do you think/know of any research projects which could unseat electric cars requiring charging a waste of time and the infrastructure meaningless?",13,2

Hello all, I just started thinking about this tonight. With elon applying for NeuraLink testing in a year, i feel like fulldive vr may be much closer than I originally thought (100s years). This led me to wonder if elon is successful how difficult would it be to make a full dive VR world? The **coding** aspect of it seems(!) to be doable since we have things like oculus and vive where we have created worlds inside of those headsets that players can interact with. The **NeuraLink** aspect of it seems to be the limiting factor here if the coding part is as i assumed. If elons tests in the next, say, 5 years prove that humans can indeed control computers, will finding and poking sensors into the primary senses of humans(touch,hear,sight,feel,smell) be alot more difficult? Arent they just different parts of the brain? Please tell me where I am wrong or right. I am just a rising college student who is very enthusiastic about the future of vr and cyborgy stuff.",6,14

""the neurons activity of the hippocampus can be observed in exactly the same format as the *in vivo* or *in vitro* recordings. The fundamental advantage of this is that it tracks network, cellular, and synaptic activity at any point of the network, and directly compares the results with practically all types of experimental data.

This is a major computational challenge, one which requires supercomputing power; as an indication, the region modelled  from a rats brain  contains around 450,000 neurons and 400 million synaptic contacts.""

------------------------

1 second of activity took 7 hours to compute. This might not seem much until you realise that it was run on a 7.8 PFlop system (that was built in 2012), only used 26% of it's available cores and the model is a very high detail model (""large-scale realistic model of the CA1 area of the hippocampus, maintaining the natural 3D layout of the real system."")

we can do a bit of calculation (conservative if we don't assume any reduction of the model complexity through abstraction) to determine how much computation a whole human neocortex simulation would require. To get to simulating the whole neocortex  (roughly 26 billion neurons) at the same time scale and resolution, we would need to multiply 26% x 7.8 petaflops by 26'000'000'000/450'000 = 57777 so we would need a 0.26 x 7.8 x 57777 = 117 exaflop computer. But then there is the problem of timescale: it is a roughly 250'00 to 1 ratio from real time to simulated time, which is fairly hopeless in terms of getting a highly detailed, real time simulation next decade, but we just need to be able to understand a system in order to simplify it and even that can be done at these timescales.

I'm sure someone more familiar with HPC could fill me in, but I think 100+ exaflops will be achievable sometime in the latter half of next decade (or early 2030s) at least somewhere on the globe. Both the US and China have several plans for exascale machines sometime between 2020 and 2021, a few other countries have also stated similar timeframes. We would just need another 7 doublings in HPC performance.

I would also think that we don't need to fully simulate the neocortex to understand and reduce it's inner workings to something that requires less computation, even having a simulated mouse brain would accelerate AI research and it is only on the order of 70 million neurons which could actually be done in high detail with a 0.26 x 7.8 x 70'000'000/450'000 = 316 petaflop computer which will be available most likely with 2 years. to this end, HBP have also employed engineers to build a fully realistic skeletal model of a rat body complete with anatomically correct musculature, whiskers, eyes etc: https://youtu.be/ldXEuUVkDuw

Edit: This model tracks almost everything in the cell and is thus an ultra high detail model, if you just simulate the spiking of the network, you could reduce the required computation by orders of magnitude and bring the projected timeline for neocortex simulation forward by a lot.",0,3

1722,2019-7-18,2019,7,18,18,ceqfod,"Instead of producing brand new electric buses, why aren't we converting diesel buses into EVs? Serious question and discussion. We have companies doing EV conversions. We have lightweight solid-state batteries. And with fleets, you can scale the process effectively. We have all the tools we need",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ceqfod/instead_of_producing_brand_new_electric_buses_why/,letourpowerscombine,1563443689,"For me, the problem is that producing 100 million new electric vehicles (Teslas, VWs, Toyotas, buses, etc.) is not a sustainable way for making the EV transition.  

Particularly when we already have 1.2 billion gas vehicles, and we have the knowledge and resources to convert gas vehicles into electric.     

Evidence:  

1. New Electric is a company based in Amsterdam, where their business model is converting gas vehicles into EVs.    
 
They specifically offer (vehicle fleet conversions.)[http://www.newelectric.nl/automotive/]     

If you do some quick research, you'll find plenty of other companies and independent mechanics doing similar services.  

2.  Companies like (Quantumscape)[https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1044] and (Enovate)[https://newatlas.com/enovate-me-s-electric-solid-state-car/59392/] are producing solid-state batteries for production    

[In the words of Jeremy Grantham,]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp4-7P4jIt8&amp;t=9m22s) a billionaire donating 98% of his wealth to fighting climate change:  

&gt;7 years into [Quantumscape], we have just delivered a solid-state battery of passenger vehicle capability to a leading global automobile firm [VW], who has put in $350 million dollars.   

&gt;This thing does not burst into flames.  It weighs half the weight -- so a Tesla with 1000 pounds of battery would drop 500 pounds.  Drops 500 pounds of dead weight.  It occupies half the volume.  Practically a category-killer on its own. ... You can imagine what that means.  Twice the power-to-weight ratio, charges rapidly, and has almost no danger associated with it.  

&gt; ... It will also be the best green-driven story, and it will be the answer to several of my dreams.""

3. Of course, the conversion process becomes much cheaper, faster, and more scalable when you are working with identical vehicle models -- like bus fleets -- because the process and parts are identical.

And this strategy can work for passenger vehicles as well -- (see the ""Electrification"" tab)[https://timetosolve.com/#tab-11] for a proposal.) -- you just need to work with a higher volume of similar model types to reach comparable scalability, like you have in corporate repair centers.

So, is there *any* reason why we shouldn't be starting initiatives around electrification?

Many want to be confident in the possibility of healthy, stable lives  as [r/ClimateActionPlan](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateActionPlan-ners/)-ners and many here on r/Futurology are  but are faced with an overwhelming array of evidence in their lives leading in one direction, making them question major life choices - and forcing them into the r/collapse echo chamber. Somewhere along the way, many of them made a different choice than those in r/Futurology or [r/ClimateActionPlan](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateActionPlan/) did: they began to believe in the eventual collapse of modern society.

&amp;#x200B;

Its why some are here within our [r/collapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/) echo chamber (believing society fails), and its why others are here in r/Futurology or [r/ClimateActionPlan](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateActionPlan/) with hope (believing modern society will endure).

&amp;#x200B;

**Here in** r/Futurology**, you are confident that modern society (*****continuous*** **civilization, no collapse) will continue because of \[reasons\]\***. Fair enough. I want to join you there in that belief.

&amp;#x200B;

**Imagine your friend asks you out for a quick coffee because something is weighing on their mind.** You know that they have already been educating themselves online within a diverse, facts-based environment (informed), but that theyre also the *open-to-having-their-views-changed* type. They just have been seeming *off* lately, and you have seen them waver on old ambitions - becoming increasingly-convinced of societal collapse. **A good friend; you say sure.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Their Questions:**

* **Do you** truthfully-believe that the world economy (resources, wealth systems, classes) will eventually  within the future society *you* believe in  become a stable, sustainable, and fair system for all?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Do you** truthfully-believe that the environment (climate change, extinction, trees) will be stabilized  within the future society *you* believe in? How and by whom?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Do you** truthfully-believe that social conflict (religious, political, racial) will be solved such that our society can organize to meet the task at hand?

Thanks friends of r/Futurology.

Most people on this forum are very familiar with the concept of the technological singularity. On Wikipedia, the singularity is defined as a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unfathomable changes to human civilization.

Unquestionably, many intriguing scenarios emerge from the concept, but I suggest that its not a very useful definition and we can do a lot better. After all, its not very practical to shape ones life around an unknown date in the future in which we know nothing about what follows.

Instead of thinking about the singularity as a point of time, it may be more useful to think of it as a process by which the amount of time future projections may be made with some level of accuracy progressively shrinks (i.e. a shrinking horizon). In this sense, we are already in the singularity. 

With this definition, people need not go about living their lives as usual, awaiting a future rapture, but instead they might choose to embrace a life of transcendence; one can choose to embrace continuous learning, improvement, and change with the understanding that the future will be increasingly unlike the past.",2,8

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I have always wondered what the world would be like in the future. In this series of notes, I will consider different scenarios of human development under the influence of the main global trend  increasing of free time. In 10 years, an environmental disaster is unlikely, so we can only consider the humanitarian context; the future depends on how we manage this free time.

For this article, we need to introduce the term: **digital hedonism**  the implementation of all ambitions and social ties in the virtual world, the consumption of the benefits of the real world is not more than enough to sustain life.

# Analogy

Universe 25 is an experiment conducted by John B. Calhoun. In July 1968, 4 pairs of mice were placed in an enclosure in a laboratory at the National Institute of mental health. The enclosure with 256 nest boxes, each of which was designed for 15 mice, was equipped with distributors of water and feed. Calhoun described the enclosure as a utopia for mice: according to the researchers, the space for nests in the enclosure would be enough for 3840 mice, and constantly served food  for 9500. In practice, the population stopped at the maximum value of 2200 individuals and only decreased after it.

The period of development of the territory of the first four pairs of mice, Calhoun called stage A. stage B began with the birth of the first cubs. This is the stage of exponential population growth in the tank under ideal conditions  the number of mice doubled every 55 days. Starting from day 315 of the experiment, the population growth rate slowed significantly, and the number of mice doubled every 145 days. The third stage of the experiment began. At this point, in the enclosure lived 620 mice, and formed a certain social hierarchy. There was a category of the young males who have not found for themselves a social role and expelled in the center of an enclosure. The problem of the lack of suitable social roles was caused by the fact that in ideal conditions of the enclosure mice lived for a long time; aging mice did not make room for young rodents. After the expulsion of the males were broken psychologically, it was characterized by passivity or excessive aggression. Pregnant females became less protected from random attacks. As a result, they themselves began to show aggression, they, not males, began to actively defend their territory, while aggression was manifested in relation to their children. As a result, the birth rate has fallen significantly, and the mortality of young animals has reached significant levels. By June 1972, when Calhoun had completed the experiment, there were only 122 mice left in enclosure that were out of reproductive age. The result of the experiment was already clear.

# Trends

Lets look at some of the trends in modern society that we can observe now. The increase in life expectancy and working age in developed countries does not allow a significant part of young people to realize their ambitions at the most productive age (2535 years), as the key positions are already occupied by the older generation. Dissatisfaction spurs the development of depression. According to who, by 2020, depression will become the main disease on earth, surpassing cardiovascular and infectious diseases.

Concentration of financial flows and increasing population stratification. 50% of the worlds wealth belongs to 1% of the worlds population and this trend is increasing. At the same time, the development of technology annually kills 3.5 million jobs, creating only 1 million, but this trend will accelerate the boom of unmanned transport will leave tens of millions of people unemployed. It is easy to assume that in 10 years society will need to contain a huge number of people who are not engaged in work.

And the latest trend in this scenario. Development of virtual entertainment and communication. Even now, the main audience of online games are the most able-bodied people (2531 years), as well as a growing proportion of adults (3144 years). The computer game industry is growing at a monstrous pace and in ten years can overcome the mark of $ 500 billion. Also, the number of users using VR technologies will increase to 1 billion.

# Overall result

In 10 years, a significant part of the active population will be forced out of social life. Depressed people will look for self-realization in virtual entertainment. Basic income and food delivery services will eliminate the need to leave home. Social and sexual life will be replaced by artificial surrogates. The Foundation for the extinction of mankind will be laid, as almost all natural instincts will already be suppressed, including the instinct of reproduction.

Productive forces will be concentrated in the hands of a small number of people, but even they will be gradually moved away from the management of automated decision-making systems and will gradually go into digital hedonism.",8,10

Banking, government services, property management and more are available from your mobile phone. In addition to the obvious advantages such as timesaving, transparency and ease of use, the new service channels have disadvantages, the main of which is remote fraud. The fraudster no longer needs to be physically present at the scene of the crime, and it becomes almost impossible to catch them.

The physical presence does not guarantee us against fraud, but it does make a high price error for the fraudsters, they can be caught red-handed right on the spot. High risks kept large numbers from fraud in the pre-digital era. However, remote services removed this restriction. According to Symantec Inc., every second Internet user faced cybercrime.

In fact, the perpetrator could take over our entire lives by faking our identity. In this context, the tasks of human identification come to the fore. More and more complex methods of identification are used. First, we came up with the identification of the fingerprint, but for a long time fraudsters have learned to make a fingerprint and overcome this barrier. Then we learned to identify a person by voice quite accurately, but even now, filters like Lyrebird allow us to fake any voice with amazing accuracy. There is similar case with identification through video, AI services have already learned to generate video indistinguishable from the original, creating three-dimensional holograms is a question of time.

Moreover, modern technologies make offline channels more vulnerable too, modern makeup is very difficult to distinguish from the real person, and the pattern of fingerprints and the iris is easily applied to silicone pads or lenses.

All these gives rise to great concern, it will take some 10 years and the scammers will be able to completely fake a person. Whats left? The answer is seen in DNA identification. The cost of DNA testing every year is a multiple of decreases and this is the thing that we will not be able to fake for a long time. I hope so we will get a reliable method of identification for several decades. But it is not accurate",1,7

Weaponized Nanotechnology



Nothing could end our reign here on Earth faster than weaponized  or severely botched  molecular assembling nanotechnology.

It's a threat that stems from two extremely powerful forces: unchecked self-replication and exponential growth. A sufficiently nihilistic government, non-state actor, or individual could engineer microscopic machines that consume our planet's critical resources at a rapid-fire rate while replicating themselves in the process and leaving useless bi-products in their wake  a residue futurists like to call ""grey goo.""

Nanotechnology theorist Robert Freitas has brainstormed several possible variations of planet-killing nanotech, including aerovores (a.k.a. grey dust), grey plankton, grey lichens, and so-called biomass killers. Aeorovores would blot out all sunlight, grey plankton would consist of seabed-grown replicators that eat up land-based carbon-rich ecology, grey lichens would destroy land-based geology, and biomass killers would attack various organisms.

According to Freitas, a worst case scenario of ""global ecophagy"" would take about 20 months, ""which is plenty of advance warning to mount an effective defense."" By defence, Freitas is referring to countermeasures likely involving self-replicating nanotechnology, or some kind of system that disrupts the internal mechanisms of the nanobots. Alternately, we could set up ""active shields"" in advance, though most nanotechnology experts agree they'll be useless. Consequently, a moratorium on weaponized nanotechnology should be established and enforced.

Conscious Machines



It's generally taken for granted that we'll eventually imbue a machine with artificial consciousness. But we need to think very seriously about this before we go ahead and do such a thing. It may actually be very cruel to build a functional brain inside a computer  and that goes for both animal and human emulations.

Back in 2003, philosopher Thomas Metzinger argued that it would be horrendously unethical to develop software that can suffer:

""What would you say if someone came along and said, ""Hey, we want to genetically engineer mentally messed up human infants! For reasons of scientific progress we need infants with certain cognitive and emotional deficits in order to study their postnatal psychological development  we urgently need some funding for this important and innovative kind of research!"" You would certainly think this was not only an absurd and appalling but also a dangerous idea. It would hopefully not pass any ethics committee in the democratic world. However, what today's ethics committees don't see is how the first machines satisfying a minimally sufficient set of constraints for conscious experience could be just like such mentally retarded infants. They would suffer from all kinds of functional and representational deficits too. But they would now also subjectively experience those deficits. In addition, they would have no political lobby  no representatives in any ethics committee.""

Futurist Louie Helm agrees. Here's what he told me:

""One of the best things about computers is that you can make them sum a million columns in a spreadsheet without them getting resentful or bored. Since we plan to use artificial intelligence in place of human intellectual labor, I think it would be immoral to purposely program it to be conscious. Trapping a conscious being inside a machine and forcing it to do work for you is isomorphic to slavery. Additionally, consciousness is probably really fragile. In humans, a few miscoded genes can cause Down Syndrome, schizophrenia, autism, or epilepsy. So how terrible would it feel to be a slightly misprogrammed form of consciousness? For instance, several well-funded AI developers want to recreate human intelligence in machines by simulating the biological structure of human brains. I sort of hope and expect that these near-term attempts at cortical simulations will be too coarse to really work. But to the extent that they do work, the first ""success"" will likely create cripplingly unpleasant or otherwise deranged states of subjective experience. So as a programmer, I'm generally against self-aware artificial intelligence. Not because it wouldn't be cool. But because I'm just morally opposed to slavery, torture, and unnecessary code.""

Artificial Superintelligence



As Stephen Hawking declared earlier this year, artificial intelligence could be our worst mistake in history. Indeed, as we've noted many times before here on io9, the advent of greater-than-human intelligence could prove catastrophic. The introduction of systems far faster and smarter than us would force us to take a back seat. We'd be at the mercy of whatever the artificial superintelligence decides to do  and it's not immediately clear that we'll be able to design a friendly AI to prevent this. We need to solve this problem, otherwise building an ASI would be absolutely nuts.

============================================

Time Travel



I'm actually not much of a believer in time travel (i.e. where are all the time travelers?), but I will say this  if it's possible, we'll want to stay the heck away from it.

It would be so crazily dangerous. Any scifi movie dealing with contaminated timelines should give you an idea of the potential perils, especially those nasty paradoxes. And even if some form of quantum time travel is possible  in which completely new and discreet timelines are created  the cultural and technological exchange between disparate civilizations couldn't possibly end well.

Mind Reading Devices



The prospect exists for machines that can read people's thoughts and memories at a distance and without their consent. This likely won't be possible until human brains are more intimately integrated within the web and other communication channels.

Last year, for example, scientists from the Netherlands used brain scan data and computer algorithms to determine which letters a person was looking at. The breakthrough hinted at the potential for a third party to reconstruct human thoughts at an unprecedented level of detail, including what we see, think, and remember. Such devices, if used en masse by some kind of totalitarian regime or police state, would make life intolerable. It would introduce an Orwellian world in which our ""thought crimes"" could actually be enforced. 

============================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================

Brain Hacking Devices



Relatedly, there's also the potential for our minds to be altered against our knowledge or consent. Once we have chips in our brain, and assuming we won't be able to develop effective cognitive firewalls, our minds will be exposed to the Internet and all its evils.

Incredibly, we've already taken the first steps toward this goal. Recently, an international team of neuroscientists set up an experiment that allowed participants to engage in brain-to-brain communication over the Internet. Sure, it's exciting, but this tech-enabled telepathy could open a pandora's box of problems. Perhaps the best  and scariest  treatment of this possibility was portrayed in Ghost in the Shell, in which an artificially intelligent hacker was capable of modifying the memories and intentions of its victims. Now imagine such a thing in the hands of organized crime and paranoid governments.

============================================

Autonomous Robots Designed to Kill Humans



The potential for autonomous killing machines is a scary one  and perhaps the one item on this list that's already an issue today.

Here's what futurist Michael LaTorra told me:

""We do not yet have a machine that exhibits general intelligence even close to the human level. But human level intelligence is not required for the operation of autonomous robots with lethal capabilities. Building robotic military vehicles of all sorts is already achievable. Robot tanks, aircraft, ships, submarines, and humanoid-shaped soldiers are possible today. Unlike remote-controlled drones, military robots could identify targets and destroy them without a human giving the final order to shoot. The dangers of such technology should be obvious, but it goes beyond the immediate threat of ""friendly fire"" incidents in which robots mistakenly kill people from their own side of a conflict, or even innocent civilians. The greater danger lurks in the international arms race that could be set off if any nation deploys autonomous military robots. After a few cycles of improvement, the race to develop ever more powerful military robots could cross a threshold in which the latest generation of autonomous military robots would be able to outfight any human-controlled military system. And then, either by accident (""Who knew that Artificial Intelligence could emerge spontaneously in a military robot?"") or by design (""We didn't think hackers could re-program our military robots remotely!"") humankind might find itself crushed into subservience, like the helot slaves of Spartan AI overlords.""

Weaponized Pathogens



This is another bad one that's disturbingly topical. As noted by Ray Kurzweil and Bill Joy back in 2005, publishing the genomes of deadly viruses for all the world to see is a recipe for destruction. There's always the possibility that some idiot or a fanatical group will take this information and either reconstruct the virus from scratch or modify an existing virus to make it even more virulent  and then release it onto the world. It has been estimated, for example, that the engineered Avian Flu could kill half of the world's humans. Just as disturbingly, researchers from China combined bird and swine flus to create a mutant airborne virus. The idea, of course, is to know the enemy and develop possible countermeasures before an actual pandemic strikes. But there's always the danger that the virus could escape from the lab and wreak havoc in human populations. Or that the virus could be weaponized and unleashed. There's even the scary potential for weaponized genome specific viruses. It's time for authorities to start thinking about this grim possibility before something awful happens. As reported in Foreign Policy, ISIS is certainly one group that already appears ready and willing.

Virtual Prisons and Punishment



What will jails and punishment be like when people can live for hundreds or thousands of years? And what if prisoners have their minds uploaded? Ethicist Rebecca Roache offers these horrifying scenarios:

""The benefits of...radical lifespan enhancement are obviousbut it could also be harnessed to increase the severity of punishments. In cases where a thirty-year life sentence is judged too lenient, convicted criminals could be sentenced to receive a life sentence in conjunction with lifespan enhancement. As a result, life imprisonment could mean several hundred years rather than a few decades. It would, of course, be more expensive for society to support such sentences. However, if lifespan enhancement were widely available, this cost could be offset by the increased contributions of a longer-lived workforce.

...[Uploading] the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight-and-a-half hours. This would, obviously, be much cheaper for the taxpayer than extending criminals' lifespans to enable them to serve 1,000 years in real time. Further, the eight-and-a-half hour 1,000-year sentence could be followed by a few hours (or, from the point of view of the criminal, several hundred years) of treatment and rehabilitation. Between sunrise and sunset, then, the vilest criminals could serve a millennium of hard labour and return fully rehabilitated either to the real world (if technology facilitates transferring them back to a biological substrate) or, perhaps, to exile in a computer simulated world.""

That's awful! Now, it's important to note that Roache is not advocating these punishment methods  she's just doing some foresight. But holy smokes, let's never EVER turn this into a reality.

Hell Engineering



This one's quite similar to the previous item. Some futurists make the case for paradise engineering  the use of advanced technologies, particularly consciousness uploading and virtual reality, to create a heaven on Earth. But if you can create heaven, you can create hell. It's a prospect that's particularly chilling when you consider lifespans of indefinite length, along with the nearly boundless possibilities for psychological and physical anguish. This is actually one of the worst things I can think of; why anyone would want to develop such a thing is beyond me. It's yet another reason for banning the development of artificial superintelligence  and the onset of the so-called Roko's Basilisk problem.",1,0

In January, Chinas Chang-4 lander and rover became the first to perform a soft landing on the lunar far side. A SpaceX rocket carrying an Israeli lander had an attempt on the moon in March. Indias Chandrayaan-2, scheduled to lift off later this month, will explore the lunar surface near the south pole. And Japan is moving forward in its plans to establish a lunar base. Amid all this rising international competition, NASA, under the Trump Administrations Space Policy Directive 1, is being pressured to develop the assets needed to have humans permanently stationed on the moon as soon as possible.

The renewed push to the moon has widely been seen as being mainly for scientific and political purposes. There are, however, much deeper strategic reasons for returning to the moon. We are entering a period in history when going to the moon comes out of geopolitical necessity. At the beginning of the second global epoch, humanity must turn to space, including the moon, if it wants to expand itself. The moon will be instrumental in forging a more secure and prosperous world. As the moon becomes more technologically and economically feasible, and its need grows, its attraction will only get stronger.

Space-based reconnaissance was the main motivation for the initial push into space by the Americans and the Soviets during the Cold War. Each side wanted to have a global view so they could track the others military movements and see where enemy nuclear missile sites were located. Both countries were vast in size --- using reconnaissance aircraft would mean scanning a lot of territory, and in the process those aircraft would be highly vulnerable to being shot down. Since the two countries were located on opposite sides of the world, much planning was needed to get aircraft within range, and doing so was extremely difficult to do in secret. This was especially problematic for the Soviet Union, which unlike the US, did not have forward operating bases it could use to access the periphery of American territory. This was one of the reasons why the Soviets were initially pushed into the idea of space-based reconnaissance more than the Americans, and why they got a head start in the space race with the launch of Sputnik. 

But there was another reason why both sides started turning towards space as part of their military planning. The Cold War became a conflict between two adversaries that was fought through proxy wars on multiple fronts around the world. The addition of the intercontinental ballistic missile meant the entire globe became a potential battlefield. A commander needs to be able to see the battlefield, and when that includes the entire planet, the only way that can be done is through space.

The importance of space-based reconnaissance meant that it evolved quickly. Congruent to this was a rapid evolution in space-based communication. Initially, for a reconnaissance satellite to relay its images back to earth, it would need to send down a capsule containing the images, which would descend by parachute through the atmosphere, where it would be retrieved by an aircraft. But this method was expensive and time-consuming. In the meantime, enemy positions could change, rendering the images out of date and having potentially huge ramifications for war planning. Militaries thus needed a way to send images back to earth frequently and quickly, preferably in real time.

The solution came with digital communication. The same technology that transformed the everyday lives of civilians, through such innovations as the cellular phone and the internet, also had huge repercussions for military intelligence gathering. 

Since the Cold War, the sensory technology used in reconnaissance satellites has vastly improved, and their need has continued to grow. Satellites now have the ability to monitor vast swaths of the earths surface in minuscule detail, using infrared and other spectroscopic technologies, to see through clouds and during the night. 

The advent of hypersonic weapons, which are under development, has only amplified the need for space-based reconnaissance. It is difficult to gauge just how far along militaries are in developing these weapons, due to the need to keep them under secret from enemies. But given the enormous incentive there is to have them, and the amount of time that has elapsed since serious research and testing on them were first made public, it would be reasonable to assume that hypersonic technology has already advanced quite far. Certainly by mid-century, an unmanned hypersonic aircraft powered by a scramjet will be able to travel to the other side of the globe within minutes, maneuver, locate and hit a precise target, then return to home base to carry out a new mission. Given this new reality, the shape of war will be drastically altered. It will mean that tactical decisions that can influence the outcome of a conflict will be made on the other side of the world. 

A major problem arises, however. As the need for space-based reconnaissance continues to grow, and large sections of the globe undergo increased surveillance, adversaries must turn to taking down satellites, enable to blind the enemy.  Reconnaissance satellites thus become more vulnerable from attack. 

This is exactly what is happening. Many countries have been developing the ability to strike satellites from the earths surface (either using anti-satellite missiles or directed energy weapons), and to use their own satellites as projectiles to hit enemy ones. The debris created from collisions also poses a risk to other nearby satellites.

Earlier this year, India demonstrated the ability to shoot down one of its defunct satellites using a missile. What was most noteworthy about it was not how technically extraordinary it may have seemed, but how underwhelming of an achievement it really was. Both the US and Russia have had the ability to do this for decades. But now the technology is within the grasp of less developed countries such as India and China. A superpower is no longer needed  to bring down a satellite. As anti-satellite technology becomes more accessible, the danger increases.

Efforts are already underway to make satellites more maneuverable, enable to dodge debris or enemy fire. However, given the lack of air and the effects of gravity on the topography of space, an enormous amount of energy will be needed to conduct any such maneuver, and the margin of error will be slight. 

If satellites are to have any real chance of surviving, they will also have to be defended. Subsidiary satellites loaded with weapons may be used to protect the main satellite, much how escort ships are used to protect an aircraft carrier in a carrier battle group. And like the navy that uses such ships to sail across the open oceans, a space force will need to have military personnel permanently stationed in space to direct groups of satellites and assist in repairs done by various robotic systems, where needed. By including people, the simple reconnaissance satellite will eventually evolve into a command and control center --- a space station headed by a military commander that will be able to monitor events on the surface of the earth and keep in constant contact with ground-based armed forces. 

Today, such a development may seem to be within the realm of fantasy. But really, it will merely be an extrapolation of a current strategic reality. Starting in the 2030s, as the importance of space on military matters continues to grow, and the threats posed on satellites becomes more urgent, governments will be propelled into massive space construction projects intended to move military personnel and important command and control facilities into space.   

All of this will help protect valuable space-based assets, but that does not mean these assets will not still be vulnerable. Satellites will be facing threats from both the earth and in the surrounding space. So much energy will be needed to keep a close eye on the earths surface that little will be left over to monitor threats from the rear. Militaries will thus need another place to conduct global reconnaissance and operate a command structure more safely, as a supplement to low earth orbit capabilities. In the event that a military were to have its most important satellites knocked out, it will not want to be left blind and at a strategic disadvantage when it comes to waging war at intercontinental distances.",0,0

This is where the moon comes in. The moon, unobstructed by an atmosphere, is a stable platform to monitor events both on the surface of the earth and in the surrounding spacescape. It is also located at a comfortable distance from the earth. A missile would take long enough to strike the moon that it could easily be intercepted. On the surface of the moon, there is no need to worry about satellite collisions. Reconnaissance instruments could easily be hidden in some of the numerous craters and valleys found on the lunar surface. Sensory technology has advanced so quickly that, even from the surface of the moon, the movement of ships, vehicles and people back on earth will be able to be seen in fine detail.

Another advantage posed by the moon has to do with its orientation. The far side of the moon, always facing away from the earth, will be an opportune place to conduct secret testing of space-based weapons. This side is more heavily cratered, so bases will be more easily hidden and sheltered, and underground chambers could be dug for weapons testing. The far side is also the ideal place to establish command and control facilities, safe from an earth-based attack. Any traffic going to or from these bases on the moon could be masqueraded as being for scientific missions. After all, scientific exploration will still be a motivation for building on the moon, just not the main one.

Some scientific missions will involve the use of radio transmissions. Since the far side of the moon is blocked of radio interference from the earth, it will be the ideal place to set up radio telescopes pointed towards deep space. The numerous craters there can act as suitable platforms for such instruments. But lack of radio interference also means that, absent lunar satellites that could relay communications back to earth, bases on the far side will be able to communicate with each other in secret.

The moons third major advantage has to do with its mass. It has only one sixth of the gravity found on earth. A lower gravitational pull means less thrust will be needed to launch a rocket into space from the moon than from the earth. A projectile fired from the moon towards the earth will require less energy than one fired from the earth towards the moon. Less energy will mean less fuel, and there is already an abundance of that on the moon. 

The confirmation of water ice at the surface of both lunar poles, as well as the abundance of water thought to exist underground, is very important for several reasons. One being that the hydrogen extracted from the water could be used as rocket fuel. Shipping fuel to the moon is expensive, and will likely remain so well into the future. The moon is also quite far from the earth. An enemy force could easily cut the supply line and leave the moon stranded. That means lunar bases will have to become as self-sufficient as possible, including when it comes to fuel.

But there are, of course, many other reasons why the presence of water on the moon is so important. Water ice can be melted for drinking for lunar inhabitants, and used to grow food. The oxygen extracted could be used to create breathable air in sealed chambers. It makes sense then, that most lunar colonies will be situated near large reservoirs of water.  

Of the two polar regions, the south pole is thought to contain the most water. The region is also the site of one of the largest impact craters known to exist in the solar system: the South Pole-Aitken Basin. This basin has been the focus of many lunar robotic missions, and it is where a first lunar base will most likely be located. Within the basin itself, the numerous subsidiary craters and the area around its rim (especially at the foot of the Leibnitz Mountains) will be of particular interest. Many of these spots are permanently cast in shadow, offering protection from cosmic rays and the solar winds. On the other hand, many of the mountain tops that line the basin are almost permanently bathed in sunlight, making ideal locations for solar power generating stations.",0,1

Power will be a major determining factor over control of the moon. That includes not just military power, but also energy power. Energy produced on the moon will be key in not only powering lunar facilities, but also vast swaths of the earth. Stemming from this is the probability that the earth will be facing an energy crisis if ways are not radically changed by the late 21st century. There is the concern that fossil fuel emissions into the earths atmosphere primarily contributes to undesirable climate change. But more than that, fossil fuel reserves are dwindling just as energy needs continue to soar. This is happening in spite of a slowing growth in the worlds population. More people are being brought into the industrialized world, and human activities are becoming ever more energy-intensive. In more developed countries, masses of robots will be needed to support an aging population, as well as to keep productivity levels up. Robots, as they grow more sophisticated, take on a variety of tasks and become widespread, will consume an enormous amount of power.

Of all the viable energy alternatives, solar is by far the most promising. It is, after all, the most natural. Plants use the suns rays for photosynthesis, and nearly all living organisms are dependent on the light and heat produced by the sun for their survival. The sun itself is a gargantuan ball of energy with almost limitless potential. It produces billions of times more energy than what the world needs, or will ever need, and it will keep shining for at least another five billion years. It is the ultimate power source.

Unfortunately, solar power generating stations on the surface of the earth have no hope of fully tapping into its potential. The effects of clouds and of the night place huge limits on its use. Added to that, solar panels take up a lot of space. It is estimated that to compensate for all of the worlds current energy needs would require a solar array covering an area about the size of the state of Nevada.

Placing solar panels in space overcomes these problems. Objects in space are not blocked by an atmosphere and are not trapped in the daily night cycle. One thing that space does not have a lack of is space. A solar array in earth orbit would collect energy from the sun, then beam it in the form of microwave radiation to receiving stations located at strategic points around the surface of the globe. These receiving stations would convert the energy back into electricity, before it is distributed throughout the power grid. The radiation emitted from these solar arrays will be at such low intensities that they will not cause adverse health or environmental effects.

None of this is science fiction. All of the technology needed to make space-based solar power a reality already exists. Experiments have been performed demonstrating solar energy beamed at electrical conversion receivers over relatively short distances. Governments have expressed serious interest in its potential. And as fossil fuels lose their attractiveness, the interest will continue to grow. Come the second half of this century, space-based solar will be all the craze.  

There will be, however, added benefits to placing solar arrays intended for earth consumption on the surface of the moon. All of the material needed to build solar panels can be found and manufactured in large quantities on the moon. Photovoltaic cells, microwave transmitters and reflectors can all be made entirely from the lunar regolith. There will be no need to launch cells into orbit. 

Although an increase in commercial and military flights into space will certainly bring the cost of launches down, the fact will remain that to have enough solar arrays in earth orbit to make a dent in the worlds energy consumption will require hauling up a huge volume of material spread over many thousands of launches. The preferred destination for these solar arrays, geostationary orbit, is already getting crowded with many other satellites. The region will also surely become a future battlefield, and space debris will be more of a hazard. Solar power produced in earth orbit will, at least in the initial stages of space-based electrical generation, be an important asset. But for solar power to really become the worlds primary energy source, generating stations will also need to be placed on the moon. 

There is more than enough space on the surface of the moon for solar power generating stations than can power the earth. The lack of an atmosphere means cells will be able to be thin and made cheaply. Most of the cost will come from robotic mining equipment sent to the moon to extract the soil and in establishing manufacturing plants. 

Due to one half of the moon being in darkness for two weeks at a time, stations will need to be located on both sides of the moon to enable continuous power generation. Satellites in earth orbit will relay microwave beams sent from transmitters on the moon towards receiving stations on earth. This will allow constant coverage to all areas of the globe, except during a lunar eclipse, when backup power generation should be sufficient. This is the setup as envisioned by Dr. David Criswell, an American physicist that has been advocating for lunar-based solar power since the 1970s. 

Energy generated on the moon will have huge ramifications not only for the global economy, but also the balance of power on earth. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the world has been powered by fossil fuels. But their availability has been determined largely by geography. Fossil fuel deposits (especially of oil, the most important resource) are haphazardly scattered across the globe. Some countries that are located on vast reserves, such as Saudi Arabia, have gained enormous wealth and became geopolitically relevant. Some countries that depend on access to them by others, such as Japan, have in the past taken drastic measures, including going to war, to secure the inflow.

The shift from fossil fuels to solar power generated in space and on the moon will dramatically change the equation of energy dominance. Less will depend on where a country is located than whether it can develop the technology needed to collect and generate power from such faraway places as the moon. 

The US, being the preeminent power both on earth and in space, and the first nation to land humans on the moon, will be in a prime position to dominate in lunar-based solar power. But that does not mean it will not be facing any competition.    

Japan is one country that will have a huge interest to become energy independent. It is a highly developed industrialized nation, but it must import most of its raw materials, including oil. Under normal circumstances, this would make any country feel uneasy. But Japan is a country that is also situated in an increasingly unstable region of the world and that relies almost entirely on another power --- the US, to guarantee its security. No country wants to rely on another for so much of its core strategic interests. So Japan will be compelled to spread its power outward to secure itself. 

We are already starting to see signs of this as Japan remilitarizes and involves itself more in international affairs. Japan will want to secure nearby sea lanes to ensure a steady flow of resources to its shores. It will also want to reduce its dependence on its long time guarantor.

These things will no doubt alarm the US. Japan is already a major military and economic power, and the US will not want the country to become too powerful. It would once again challenge American supremacy over the Pacific. It is these and other trends that have been analyzed in great detail by geopolitical forecaster Dr. George Friedman, who has mapped out how a direct conflict between the two countries will occur in the next few decades.   

Tensions between Japan and the US will not be restricted to earth. The other dimension of this brewing conflict will be in space. By the middle of the century, Japan will have had a substantial presence on the moon. Although much of this presence will be for military purposes, there will be an economic purpose to it as well. Japans imperative to secure the inflow of raw materials will only be able to go so far before it is met by a harsh response by the US, which has de-facto control over the worlds oceans. So Japan will want to complement its desire to secure earth-based resources with independent energy extraction from space, particularly the moon. Japan already has a sophisticated space program, which it has used to send probes to land and take samples from distant asteroids, likely to evaluate the economic potential of mining them for precious metals. So it wont require a massive leap in technological development for Japan to harness the economic potential of the moon, by using it as a base to generate solar power. 

A perhaps more far-fetched possibility of a country seeking to break the American monopoly over the moon in the distant future will be Brazil. At the end of the 21st century, Brazil will be emerging as a major power. It will be the leading power on a relatively secure continent, with a rapidly developing economy. However, it will also be geographically isolated, located outside of the major trade routes in the Northern Hemisphere, and far from the worlds biggest markets in North America and Eurasia. Historically, Brazil sought to integrate itself into the global economy by specializing in the extraction and trade of certain commodities. In recent years, that has taken the form of deepwater oil drilling. But in the post-fossil fuel era, Brazil will need to find another way it can amplify its economic footprint.

One way would be through energy extraction on the moon. American dominance in space will be a source of grievance for many countries, and Brazil will want to tap into that by acting as an alternative, particularly when it comes to lunar-based solar power. It will have developed a substantial space program. And being located on the equator will give Brazil a tremendous advantage. A spacecraft launched from the equator requires the least amount of fuel to get into orbit because the earth spins the fastest there, providing additional thrust. That is the reason why government space agencies, such as NASA, choose to have their launch facilities as close to the equator as possible. In addition, Brazils eastern border consists entirely of open ocean. Any object launched into space will follow the earths rotation to give it an additional boost, which goes from west to east. A rocket going eastward into space will preferably do so over an open ocean. In case of an accident, debris will not want to fall over a populated area. It is with these advantages that foreign powers will be attracted to Brazil for use as a base to launch their own satellites. The acquisition of technology and expertise from these other countries will allow Brazil to develop its own space launch capabilities, eventually being able to shoot towards the moon.

Other countries such as India, Korea, Poland, Turkey and Vietnam will have limited space programs, but they will not be in a position to challenge American dominance. Ultimately, the US will be able to secure its dominance by restricting access to the moon by hostile powers. As the first nation to land humans on the moon, the US is already a step above everyone else, and it will want to maintain its competitive edge. It will thus be at an advantageous position when it comes to waging war over control of the moon.",0,1

For an earth-based power to secure its control over the moon, it will also need to assert its control of the space surrounding the moon. The moon averages about 239,000 miles from the earth, and there will be much potential for mishap in the space between the two. Even with a potential advancement in propulsion to make spacecraft travel faster, voyages to the moon will still take a while. So the enormous distance between the earth and the moon will be a source of weakness that space powers will try to temper, and that enemies will try to exploit.

Although most command and control facilities will be relocated to the moon, the political decisions necessary to take military action, within the seat of government, will still be located on earth. Maintaining both communication and a line of supplies from one to the other will be crucial, even for those bases meant to be hidden out of sight on the lunar far side.

Since the space between the earth and the moon is immense, a military force distributed evenly across this space would be spread out far too thin and substantially weakened. It would thus be much more beneficial for a military to concentrate its forces at important points within this space, ones that would still allow a force to field enormous power --- if such points existed.

These points do exist. To the naked eye, outer space appears to be a vast, empty expanse. However, like the oceans of the earth, the topography of space is marked with hidden features that a military could use to its advantage. For a naval force, the narrow channels that trade routes pass through act as chokepoints and the islands found on the rim of a sea may be used to blockade. For a space force, the earth-moon libration points will act as way stations and where a standing force can initiate attacks on those traveling to and from the moon.  

There are five earth-moon libration points. These are spots where the gravitational pull from both the earth and the moon balance each other in such a way that a satellite stationed there will not fall down toward either. Libration point 1 (L1) is located between the earth and the moon, and only about 38,000 miles from the lunar surface. Its position will mean it will act as an important pit stop for traffic going to and from the moon, as well as a place to monitor activities on the lunar near side. However, considering that it lies on a direct line in front of the moon from the earth, it will also be a point of vulnerability. This combination of importance and vulnerability will be a source of potential conflict. Then there is L2, which is always behind the moon from the earth. This point will be valuable for control of the lunar far side. L3 is located on the lunar orbit, but is always found on the opposite side of the earth from the moon, so it will have comparatively little strategic value. 

All of the aforementioned points are considered weak libration points, meaning that constant station-keeping will still be required to prevent satellites from drifting out of position. It is the remaining two points, L4 and L5, that are considered strong libration points, and they will be the most important for a power trying to secure control of the moon. They bracket the moon on its orbit at an angle of 60 degrees relative to the earth. A military could station a standing force at these two points to protect the moon on its sides and to flank an invading force from earth. Given this tactical advantage, a lot of military infrastructure will be built at these spots. In the distant future, L4 and L5 will be sites of major tension and two of the most likely places of battle in a space war.",0,0

Given all these developments, one can see that whoever controls the moon in the future will hold substantial power over the surface of the earth. The moons strategic value will mean it will be a place highly coveted by many. But that same value will also give tremendous power to the moon itself. The center of power will gradually be shifting in the moons favor.

It follows that, eventually, the epicenter of human civilization will shift from the earth to the moon. When that happens, it will be an extraordinary event. The world where the entirety of the history of human life unfolded, with its biggest achievements, its darkest moments, memories --- all of this, will be pushed to the margins of human existence, and a new world will take center stage. 

Today, it may be hard to imagine how a small, barren, and seemingly inhospitable world such as the moon will ever eclipse the earth in power and importance. But consider how a European in the 16th century, then at the center of the world, viewed North America. It was a land seen as being at the edge of existence, with a harsh environment, an unknown interior, and with a small native population that succumbed easily from outside coercion. At this time, Europe had just begun its ascent and established empires in which it would conquer most of the world. It occupied the center of a vast global network, with colonies spread out on every continent. 

Who would have thought then that a cluster of North American colonies would band together, break free from the shackles of imperialist forces, rise up, challenge the Europeans and eventually supplant them to become the worlds dominant power?

The US occupied a strategic position between two oceans, which not only helped protect it from invasion, but also amplified its importance to the global economy, by acting as an intermediate point between the huge markets of Europe and East Asia. The size of its territory and its abundance of natural resources meant it had a lot of room to develop. In the intervening centuries, mass immigration helped to build a strong nation. New modes of transportation such as the railroad, the automobile and the airplane helped to bring far-flung communities within the new nation together and to connect it with the rest of the world. Urbanization and mass agriculture altered the land and made it into an industrial powerhouse. 

It is this same sort of evolution that will transform the moon from an empty, lifeless sphere to an unlikely stronghold of humanity. Its strategic position as a stepping stone from the earth to the wider universe will give it a tremendous advantage. Mass colonization in the coming centuries will forge the development of a separate lunar nation. Even if the world population stabilizes or declines, the ever increasing hunger for more resources will force many people to move off world as the carrying capacity of the earth is exceeded. New technologies used by settlers to make the moon more habitable will radically alter the lunar surface and, like the US, will transform it into an industrial power.    

What kind of effect will this power shift have on human culture? The human view of itself and its relationship to the cosmos will be fundamentally altered. Humanity will view its history encapsulated into a single sphere, one in which it will still revolve around but in which it will be physically disconnected from. And humanity will view its future as being unbounded in the vastness of space that lies beyond. In effect, the moon will be an intermediary step in the human expansion into the cosmos. But just as important, the human species will for the first time in its history be physically separated from most of the other living organisms it evolved alongside with. 

It will be ironic then, that the human journey into outer space, from the planet it grew up in to its nearest celestial neighbour, will be accompanied by an equally momentous journey into inner space. Huge discoveries will be made about life, the nature of consciousness and the human soul that todays mind cant even begin to fathom.  

All of these discoveries and developments will be made many centuries into the future. A lot of history will have to occur between now and then. But the contours of that future, as extraordinary and far-fetched as they may seem, are being shaped by what is happening right now, as humanity prepares to establish its first permanent presence on the moon.",5,8

Could it be that individuals are actually the result of poor communication? If we develop a way to perfectly communicate a thought, would it be possible for unique thought to slowly diminish?

 

Are there superior ways of understanding something? If so, is it possible to find the best single way to understand something and then share it directly with every other individual until we all have the same understanding? Could we do this with everything? 

&amp;#x200B;

Could our knowledge be something that receives weekly software updates which include any new knowledge we've collectively discovered? How much of our views could be subjected to such a system and how much does this process erode the unique self?

 

Also, if you as an individual today have tastes that were developed in a world of unique individuals, what will happen to the children born after a BMI is perfected? Will they be a new bread of drones destine to hold very little individual/unique thoughts?

 

Finally, what happens to privacy when most of our knowledge is identical? What happens when we realize that that horrible side of us isn't actually unique, but really common? In fact, will we even have individual tastes anymore? If I can understand and appreciate the things you like as much as you do, does that eliminate some of our uniqueness?

 

Bonus: If our individuality is destined to die with the creation of BMI's, how quickly will that death happen? Also, why do I find these thoughts to be so unpleasant? Makes me want to say ""Ewww yuck!""",21,4

It's more like real-life social networking app, which is aimed at organizing local events and activities. you use it by listing your interests in the app, allowing it to recommend a series of hand-picked local activities which it calls Loops. You can also organize your own events, and theres a map interface to view and respond to other peoples Loops.

In short, Shoelace looks like a social network that encourages people to spend less time on their phones, and more time doing something, anything in real life.

It's pro-active, and that is what I really like about this app. Other social media be it Facebook, Twitter, Instagram encourage you to meet people online or sit on your phone whole day while this will be the complete opposite, and will be pushing people to move out of there homes and meet new people with same interests.

2040,2019-7-21,2019,7,21,21,cfypw6,Will nature still be seen as an important thing in a heavily artificial and cybernated world?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/cfypw6/will_nature_still_be_seen_as_an_important_thing/,MeleeMeistro,1563713863,"Let me start by explaining my position on this matter. I believe that both nature and technology are beneficial to humanity in many different ways. I believe that it's best for us to have a balance between the two, and that often times nature and technology can have a symbiotic relationship. I am in agreement with technology as long as I am able to autonomously separate myself from it. I may not be able to see as well without my glasses, but at least I can take them off. I may not have access to the internet without my phone, but at least I am able to remove myself from these as well.

There are many things that prove nature's legitimacy and relevance, aside from natural beauty. For example, no matter how much we try to replicate a natural process like biodegradation, nature still has us beat; think of things like the banana peel or the peanut shell. It has been shown in multiple studies, even by places like the Natural History Museum, that separation from nature has negative impacts on our physical, mental, and emotional well-being, with frequent interaction with nature having the opposite effect. And let's not forget that nature is still really important for our survival.

Conversely, technology provides many of the things we take for granted. A serious infection would be almost certainly deadly a hundred years ago, but are now treatable with simple antibiotics. Without the internet, we wouldn't have access to all this information, entertainment, and all these other things; I could go on.

I do admit that there has recently been a change in my attitude towards things like altering ourselves freely and autonomously, because looking back at how we evolved I noticed that in order to survive we needed to use our intelligence. How can how best an animal that's faster, stronger, and more agile than you? Via intelligence and numbers. We have evolved, in a way, to become natural engineers, and so it seems logical from there that we survive by altering ourselves and our environments to suit us, which is partially what we have done.

My concern, is that as we become more and more cybernated as a culture and in ourselves, we will abandon nature entirely and have little concern for the natural world. Also, I fear that experiencing nature will be frowned upon or ridiculed in a future of cyborgs and body alterations. I've already acknowledged that not all things in nature are good for us, such as disease. But at the same time I feel it'd be good to acknowledge that nature also has many benefits to us, in terms of interactions, and also things of utile value, and that to stray away from such would be to our detriment.

I think that the best way forward would be for us to value nature and technology with equal regard - not living in caves and tipis, while also keeping away from things like 2077. Something similar to The Venus Project.

Innovations that try to improve user experience on gaming platforms are also on the increase. Blockchain introduction into online games has brought about some noticeable benefits for both the players and gaming platforms.

Blockchain technology has a way of simplifying both participation and administrative processes wherever it is implemented. This is not different in the gaming industry, where we have seen both platforms that employ blockchain, and those that are completely built on the technology.

Out of the many online games that are currently in existence, we will be taking a look at the top 10 games built on blockchain.

10. **Age of Rust**

This is an exploration game that is staged in the year 4424. This sci-fi futuristic game involves the exploration of abandoned space stations, mysterious caverns and other ruins. The players task is to unlock the many puzzles that are hidden within these ruins.

The game uses blockchain technology to implement a P2P rental market, where players can rent in-game assets for specified periods of time.

Currently available is the text-adventure version of Age of Rust, with an in-game currency known as Rustbits. These coins will eventually become converted to ERC-1155 tokens using Enjin Coins smart contract to enable this functionality. The full version of the game is expected to go live towards the end of 2019.

9. **Gods Unchained**

Gods Unchained is a multi-player esport game where users can battle each other, trade, sell and store gaming cards.

As a competitive came, Gods Unchained has already raised almost $400,000 for its first championship event. The game is based on blockchain technology and offers total transparency to players.

8. **CryptoSpaceX**

This is another exploration game that is completely built on the blockchain. All elements of CryptoSpaceX are assigned with digital ownership to players.

Players of CryptoSpaceX can build starships, customize their fleets and also upgrade them from time to time. Wars can be launched even across platforms to loot stardust.

CryptoSpaceX is also a competitive game that involves tournaments and various opportunities to win various prizes. The game was launched in June 2018.

7. **CubeGo**

This 3D-inclined game involves the application of 3D building blocks to build personalized models.

CubeGo is an imaginative game that tasks the players creative intelligence to build 3D characters called Cubegons. Each creation is unique and is fully owned by the creator. The characters created can then be deployed in battle in the playground that is in the background.

Some of the major companies that have partnered with CubGo are Kyber Network, Zilliqa, and Coinbase Wallet.

6. **EOS Knights**

This is not only a blockchain game that runs on the EOS platform. It is the first blockchain game to be available on mobile.

This is basically a task completion game that requires users to either collect materials, adopt pets, craft items and trade items using EOS. Despite being around for just about one year, EOS Knights has experienced several updates already, compared to several other blockchain games.

5. **Decentraland**

This is a typical hybrid of work and game with a lot of value attached to it. Decentraland is more of a VR platform that allows its users to create, experience and monetize content and applications.

The platform has also partnered with Altitude Games to build an arcade racing game called Battle Racers.

Developers on the platform are given access to a software developers kit (SDK) which enables them to develop games for the platform.

4. **Beyond the Void**

From a description point of view, this online blockchain game platform is set up in a complex manner. It combines the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre with real-time strategy (RTS) origin.

The platform issues an in-game currency, Nexium (NXC) which is used for transactions and access to other games by B2Expand, the creators of Beyond the Void.

3. **Ether Quest**

This particular blockchain game is based in a world of fantasy, where the characters in the form of mighty warriors from different worlds clash in battle for supremacy.

The activities of the game includes summoning, arena and tournament. Players in this game need a Metatask wallet to be able to participate.

2. **Spells of Genesis**

This is a trading card game that mixes different kinds of independent games together on one platform. The goal in this game is to collect, trade and combine orbs in order to build the card decks.

The in-game currency for Spells of Genesis, which also serves as the game fuel, is known as BitCrystals (BCY). This is one of the most established in-game currencies and was introduced during a crowdfunding exercise in 2015.

1. **DreamTeam**

DreamTeam is a blockchain game that is popular even in the Esports industry. Players and teams on this gaming platform are allowed to recruit and manage tools for the most popular PC titles, such as CS:GO, LoL, DOTA 2, PUBG, Overwatch and others.

Transaction on the gaming platform is meant to be possible only by using the native DreamTeam token. The goal of the platform is to use its native token for smart contracts that can facilitate tournament prize payouts as well as paid platform features.

**Conclusion**

Blockchain encroachment into digital content industry is deep and pronounced. There is hardly any area today where blockchain technology is not finding implementation, whether in partial terms or in full.

As a review platform, users can find information and reviews on tons of games on the [Blue Baikal](https://www.bluebaikal.io/?source=post_page---------------------------) platform. Even more interestingly is that the platform rewards participants who perform different kinds of tasks like reviewing and promoting content.

Unlike previous protocols where users have to depend on some central entities to determine the outcome and rewards, blockchain systems enable users to own their own value in a transparent system.

As the agent will be able to evolve so quickly that eventually will be able to just implement any idea into fruition in a matter of hours.

The same video on youtube:  [https://studio.youtube.com/video/H6djmwVBK5k/edit](https://studio.youtube.com/video/H6djmwVBK5k/edit)  

&amp;#x200B;

Who is Mr. Elon Musk? 

Mr. Elon Musk is an entrepreneur from the USA who is currently living in Los Angeles, California. Elon Musk was born in South Africa and he still has this weird South African accent which is so funny sometimes. Oddly enough, another famous person who comes from South Africa, is Victoria Secrets supermodel - Candice Swanepoel. You can check out her Instagram account with 13 million subscribers in it. I will provide the link in the description to this video. Elon Musk was born in 1971 and in 2019, he is 48 years old. He also holds South African and Canadian citizenships. He has 6 children and his net worth is more than $19 billion which sounds pretty crazy! 

Why is he so famous? 

There are two world-recognizable things that were invented by Musk. The first one is a Tesla car which runs on electricity and consumes no petrol or fuel. The second one is Space-X which is a private spaceship company financed with private capital. This is the only type of space company of its kind in the world. The rest are operated by countries and are government-owned. The fact itself that such a company and business can be handled by an entrepreneur is already incredible! Other world famous services like PayPal and OpenAI also belong to Musk. 

What is the Neuralink and how does it work? 

Neuralink is a new startup of Musks, introduced in 2019. This is neither a car nor a spaceship, it is not even a service - it is a physical device which is going to be connected to your brain with wires! Musk bought a startup from the UK and these guys came up with the idea that they will use a sophisticated robot arm which will inject thousands of wires, called threads, into your brain. It sounds scary but this is exactly what this project will do. There are little things in your brain called neurons. There are more than 100 billion neurons in a human brain. Each of these neurons produces a tiny electrical impulse which can be read by other neurons. All these instances create a network also known as a neural network. The same approach is used in a modern discipline called Machine Learning, where the model of a human brain is utilized and handled with various programming languages.  

Was he the first who invented this approach? 

This is not a breakthrough or innovative technology. Such devices are used nowadays in various medical spheres to assist with hearing disabilities, Parkinson's disease, etc. All these diseases are caused by electrical impulse transmission failures. In the case of a hearing aid, sound waves are picked up, converted to electrical impulses and sent directly to your brain. A special device must be attached to a humans skull. In the case of Parkinson's disease, ten electrodes are inserted in a human brain and controlled by a computer which artificially corrects the brains electrical signal defects caused by the disease.

What does Musk offer? 

He claims to follow in the same way but has made this device a thousand times smaller and has increased the quantity of electrodes inserted into a human brain, up to thousands of electrodes. He offers an approach which will allow you to upload and download information directly from your brain. The same functionality was first shown in the movie Matrix in 1999 when a helicopter pilot's knowledge was loaded into a brain in seconds, right before the main hero Trinity, needed to start flying a helicopter. Also, the whole concept of using Elon Musks Neuralink is demonstrated in the movie Upgrade, in which a little chip was inserted into the body of the main hero. Then the main hero became a tool between AI and the real world. I will locate the link to this movie and place it in the description of this video as well. 

What is the future of this gadget? 

There is a big future for such technologies and Musk is not going to be the only one who will try to leverage it. Nowadays we have access to terabytes of information but the amount of time needed for reading or hearing it is vast. Such devices will allow you to bypass the typical ways of transmitting data involving the human brain. We currently have only two: hearing and listening. 

Also it may change the whole sphere of medicine where it is about to be applied. This device can fix spinal cord dysfunctions and tens of similar diseases. 

I believe that there will be a special app store for such apps where you will be able to download different books directly to your brain or add the ability to talk to other people without using your voice or typing text. So instead of reading messages from a screen, you will receive it as a little thought which just comes to your mind. 

Are we gonna live like those people from the Matrix and Terminator movies? 

Yes, we are. This is exactly what is going to happen. The scariest thing is once all these devices are widely used as cell phones are now, a third party will have access to people's minds as Verizon has access to client accounts. I am not quite sure how people are gonna segregate their own thoughts from thoughts injected with Neuralink. It gives a scary level of access to your private life as an individual. Also, things like marketing and sales will dramatically change. There will be no need to promote goods and services, convincing customers to buy them. All these people will have the same idea coming to their minds at the same time. It can be: to buy a car, to vote for a president or to go to a war. The whole of society will turn into an army of human robots controlled by computers. The whole of society will turn into a zombie nightmare..

I think each person could have an allocated circle around them which represents how far they can walk within 10 minutes. This circle pulls like a market, demands food shops, doctors, dentists and other things to reside within the circle.

If many people are in a place and they all have overlapping demand for doctors, then the cost of setting up there as a doctor practice should be very cheap as the people there are all saying that is what they want to be there.

I want suitable work be within 10 minutes away from me, I want food shops to be within 5 minutes away from me on foot. I want food cafes to be within 5 minutes of home. I want food cafes to be within 3 minutes of work.

A less automatic approach is that city planning maps are available where people can vote on buildings usage. I thought about a service where people see a plan of a city as boxes and vote on use of the building. People could vote for a change of usage where you living too. Over time, algorithms and planning law pull shops and work places to certain places and towns form around communities where everyone has what they need.",0,1

A vast and deep network of links about things I have written concerning the future. I'm not vain or nothing. I just put it out there so you can see what i think about different aspects of the future. One day maybe i make it inta a book. But that is doubtful. While i am not vain, I am trifling as all get out.
Reading this first submission is but the tip of the iceberg. I welcome feedback. You can send private messages to me anytime!;)


I make what sounds on the surface like a lot of wild claims about what the future of the human race and what it will derive into, will be. Hint: No more biology. Awesome VR universes. (or will they be real? And does it matter?) 
Here are two examples I found.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7lk666/the_men_who_are_convinced_were_all_living_in_a/drmtt64/
https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7gpqnx/why_human_race_has_immortality_in_its_grasp/dqku50e/
So here is the thing. We attempt to predict exactly what the future is going to be like in this sub-reddit. So much of what I read is the belief that it is going to be just more of the ""same ol', same ol'"". There will still be politics. There will still be human issues such as race and gender and level of education and socio-economic status. You will still have to get up and go to work. The rich will get richer. Having some kind of medium of exchange will be essential. There will be families. There will be sports. There will be difficult for me to understand economic minutiae. There will be religion and tribal induced divisiveness. There will be crime, countries, poor people, climate change and mental health issues. Humans will continue to die in all kinds of different ways including old age. And on and on.
But I watch the astonishingly rapid advance of technology. Technology where new earth-shaking advances occur in months rather than decades or even years. I'm getting to the point now where I actually feel a bit of a sense of trepidation what the AI (artificial intelligence) is going to do next. AI in its many forms. Machine learning, deep learning, narrow AI and all the many other algorithms. Oh, and SDVs. (SDVs - self driving vehicles - are AI, oh yes.) As of this commentary there is no such thing as AGI (artificial general intelligence). We don't even know if such a thing is possible. But I suspect that given enough processing power, speed and access to big data that a narrow AI will be able to effectively simulate or mimic the effect of AGI. Then my question is, does it matter if it is narrow AI simulating AGI or real honest to gosh AGI. Consciousness and self-awareness are certainly not a requirement. And in fact a true EI (emergent intelligence--conscious and self-aware.) would be very undesirable. We don't need that kind of competition.
Then we have VR/AR. It is ultimate primitive today. But already powerful new technologies are developing that will take VR/AR, but particularly VR and will make it a technological phenomenon such as the world has never seen. The most recent was that weird ""metalens"" that I just learned about the other day. And everyone else did too. It was big news in this sub-reddit. But my point is, that technology is ideally suited to advance our VR in ways that we cannot today even comprehend. I'd take a good look at that movie, ""Ready, Player One"", and realize that by the time we actually reach the year 2045 that the technology you see in that movie will look quaint and primitive. And that is saying something because the special effects I watched in the movie trailer were amazing to see. I state flatly that VR is going to evolve to replace ""real"" reality in it's entirety. Humans will engineer themselves to fully exist in VR. You want nature? VR will provide nature beyond your imagining.
Caveat Emptor: VR worlds can be inescapable Hell as easily as blissful Heaven. It depends on who (or what) gets ahold of the technology (and you).

And next we have the impact of mobiles and mobile content on the human mind and psyche. Mobiles are super powerful, super computers we carry around with us, like a giant human social engineering experiment. Do you think the impact of hand carried supercomputers on human civilization is going to decrease as time goes forward? And ""social media"", the teeny, tiny foot in the door that opens to a universal ""hive mind"". Our ultimate desire is to merge that mobile's ability with our very minds, and bring the internet, the sum total of human knowledge, right along with it. I think we might be able to manage that within 50 years. After that we won't be the same. Not at all.
We are also quickly approaching the age of the quantum computer. I will admit that they do not work like a classical computer and that today there is no way that such a device could do what classical computers do. But that is looking at things from today's perspective. Humans are incredibly clever creatures and somebody is going to figure out how use various types of quantum computers to enhance the performance of classical computers. Of this I have no doubt. We programmed computers the best we could in the year 1955 and in 2018 we still program computers to the best of our ability, but the binary principle is absolutely the same, and since the 1950s we have moved with astonishing speed into understanding and precisely simulating incredibly complex chaotic systems like tornado-genesis within a supercell. Much of that credit goes towards what you see take place in this video here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRG8eq7miUE
You can call that ""Moore's Law or whatever you like. I call it stupefying progress. And now that progress is accelerating. Pause the video at the year 2015 and consider that is the year Deepmind's ""AlphaGo"" came into existence...
I don't care beans about how the processing power will equal that of the human mind. We are going to rocket past that arbitrary benchmark like it didn't exist anyway! No, pay attention to that doubling of processing speed and data capacity. That is what matters. That is rocket fuel for our AI efforts. By the way based on that video, about 2 years after the video ends computer processing power will make another full Lake Michigan of processing power and 2 years or so after that them two ""lakes"" will double again. I don't think I am extrapolating incorrectly. This is not even taking into account the likely transcendent effect of the quantum computer. I suspect that quantum computers will replace binary computers in their entirety in less than 20 years. I wonder what we shall come up with that is better than a quantum computer? 
I have often stated in my commentaries how in the year 1900, science (which had only taken on the actual term ""science"" about 50 years earlier. Before that it was called ""natural philosophy"".) regarded itself as incredibly advanced with little else to discover or learn. After all we had the train, the telegraph, the telephone, such incredible industries, the automobile and it was clear the aeroplane was in the works. Delightful diversions such as stereoscopic photography, the gramophone and even motion picture cinema already was a part of our world. Sheer electrical magick!
We even had a pretty good idea of what germs were. X-Rays for god's sake! What else was there? 
A lot as it turned out. We continued and do continue to make staggering discoveries into the nature of nature. Them gravity waves, which about 2 years ago we were not sure even existed, are now like an everyday thing. ""Oh look, two neutron stars collided""--the world shrugs. Exploiting gravitational waves observation brought us that news. I would imagine that between today and the year ohh, 2317, we shall make some additional fundamental discoveries in physics to include space and time I bet.
I have not even discussed things like fusion or solar, or all the biotech we are coming up with. Such incredible societal disruptions are inevitable even now. That backflipping robot... Man, that set a high bar for anything that can impress me more after that. What should I expect this year? A full floor routine? Elon Musk himself stated, when he saw that video; ""Just wait, in a few years you will need a strobe light to catch it's movement."" I don't think he is exaggerating in the least. 
That automation and those SDVs will take a good chunk of humanity's employment. The AI and robots will take the rest. Oh and about touchy-feely things like art, creativity and empathy? I predict that in less than 10 years humans will prefer the ""works"" of AI and prefer the company of AI as well. The narrow AI will be able to play our emotional and physical responses like the proverbial fiddle. 2018 humans are not that complicated.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7obqv8/truly_creative_ai_is_just_around_the_corner_heres/ds8rzp5/
Robots like ""da Vinci"" that humans surgeons use to perform incredibly delicate micro surgery on things like embryos and fetuses, those probe devices are recording exactly what the human is doing and learning to do it itself using AI simulations. In less than ten years all employment that requires a human to drive or sell things will be gone. I can't speak for anybody else, but I can state that the USA government is not only aware of this, but is worried about it's impact. Here is that report.
https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Artificial-Intelligence-Automation-Economy.PDF
I stick to my guns. It is probably going to happen the way I said. Narrow AI, but probably AGI too + VR + classical supercomputers/quantum computers + solar and manmade fusion (I bet fusion is only about 10 years away now. Well, that's better than 20 years away I think.) + biotech changes that inevitably slough off the ""bio"" part completely + ???(wildcard serendipitous discoveries and human ingenuity) + an interface of some nature with the human mind (hopefully, for my sake) = No longer needing reality and not even missing it.

Here are (a lot) more things I've said if you like. I just wanted to put some commentary in one place to keep it easier to find. And also to save and preserve it. There is an ""event horizon"" in Reddit whereby posts of anything over 1000 disappear for good. I learned the hard way. I lost years of commentary and did not even know it.

The idea is that American history unfolds in 90-year cycles called ""saecula.""  It's kind of like the old cliche that ""History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.""  Each saeculum has four phases: a High (things get better), an Awakening (things are good), an Unraveling (things get worse), and a Crisis (things are bad).  This repetition creates patterns in generations.  According to the theory, there are four archetypes of generations, and they are born in the same order every time.  In other words, every generation is the same archetype as its great-great-grandparents.  Let me illustrate:

We are currently in ""The Millennial Saeculum"" (1941-2021):  


|Generation|Generation Archetype|Birth Year Span|Entered childhood in a|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Baby Boomers|Prophet|19411960|High|
|Gen X|Nomad|1961-1981|Awakening|
|Millennials |Hero|19822004|Unraveling|
|Generation Z|Artist|2005-2021|Crisis|

&amp;#x200B;

Each saeculum begins with a High.  Our last High was the Post-War Economic Boom.  Our last Awakening consisted of progressive social movements in the 1960s and 1970s.   Our last Unraveling began in the 1980s as Neoliberalism became the dominant economic force of the Western World.  The Third Turning was also marked by terrorist attacks and culture wars.  The fourth/current turning is the Crisis we are living through right now: [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession), [War on Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror), [Climate Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change), [Opioid epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic).  

Since this is r/futurology, I'll focus on what the Strauss-Howe model can tell us about the future.  Right now, we are reaching the end of a ""Crisis,"" aka a ""Fourth Turning.""  Previous examples of Crises include (1) Great Depression/WWII; (2) US Civil War; (3) American Revolution; and, (4) Salem Witch Trials.  Fortunately, the crappiest part of the 21st Century is coming to an end.

According to the model, the most analogous moment in the last century of American history would be the early 1940s, when things started looking up: the Allies started pushing the Nazis back into Germany, FDR's large social programs lifted millions of people out of poverty, and veterans started heading home to reproduce and return to work.  

I'm on the Left, so I see history through a very ideological lens.  So, if you ask me, the current Crisis will end the day Trump leaves office.  When the federal government starts to move in a more progressive direction, then the US will enter another High like the Postwar Era.

\--------------------

It will be useful at this point to examine the coalition of generations--what Strauss and Howe call a ""constellation""--that will be available to effectuate this High.  

#### Prophet

#### Our oldest living generation, the Baby Boomers, is a Prophet generation.  Prophet (Idealist) generations enter childhood during a High, a time of rejuvenated community life and consensus around a new societal order. Prophets grow up as the increasingly indulged children of this post-Crisis era, come of age as self-absorbed young crusaders of an Awakening, focus on morals and principles in midlife, and emerge as elders guiding another Crisis.

#### Nomad

The people at the height of their careers, Generation X, are members of a Nomad generation.  ***Nomad*** (Reactive) generations enter childhood *during an Awakening*, a time of social ideals and spiritual agendas, when young adults are passionately attacking the established institutional order. Nomads grow up as under-protected children during this Awakening, come of age as [alienated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_alienation), post-Awakening young adults, become pragmatic midlife leaders during a Crisis, and age into resilient post-Crisis elders.

#### Hero

The younger workers, who will accrue political power during the 2020s, are the Millennials -- a Hero generation.  ***Hero*** (Civic) generations enter childhood *after an Awakening*, *during an Unraveling*, a time of individual pragmatism, self-reliance, and laissez-faire. Heroes grow up as increasingly protected post-Awakening children, come of age as team-oriented young optimists during a Crisis, emerge as energetic, overly-confident midlifers, and age into politically powerful elders attacked by another Awakening.

#### Artist

The Parkland kids etc are Generation Z -- an Artist Generation.  ***Artist*** (Adaptive) generations enter childhood *after an Unraveling,* *during a Crisis*, a time when great dangers cut down social and political complexity in favor of public consensus, aggressive institutions, and an ethic of personal sacrifice. Artists grow up overprotected by adults preoccupied with the Crisis, come of age as the socialized and conformist young adults of a post-Crisis world, break out as process-oriented midlife leaders during an Awakening, and age into thoughtful post-Awakening elders.

\------------

So, let's review.  The elder generation -- the people who will be running The White House, The Supreme Court, and The Congress -- will be the Baby Boomers (Prophet/Idealist).  Examples of important government figures will include Bernie Sanders, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, Sen. Chuck Schumer, and Rep. Nancy Pelosi.  

Next up: Gen X (Nomad/Reactive).  These people will be middle-aged.  Prominent leaders will include Rep. Mark Pocan, Rep. Adam Schiff, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.

Millennials (Hero/Civic).  Leaders will include Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez et al.

Gen Z (Artist/Adaptive).  Who knows.

\--------------

In conclusion, the way I see this going is that things get better starting on January 21st 2021.  Sanders becomes president, a bunch of lefties join the Supreme Court, universal social programs become law, and we end the War on Terror.  Thank you.",2,0

&amp;#x200B;

**We recently published a poetry book written by AI! The book is called** [**""The Art of Artificial Poetry"" by Robot Newman**](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Artificial-Poetry-Wrote-Three/dp/1076906516/ref=pd_rhf_ee_p_img_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=YVCZFGMF9ZW2PPV4FQ3P)**, and he wrote it in less than 3 hours.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Some background:** 

The book was written when we were researching NLP to test out different styles of chatbots, and we got a little sidetracked. We wanted to see if the AI could write its own poetry, and the initial results were really positive, to say the least. We trained it to read thousands upon thousands of poems to learn and get better from. When we were happy with its results, we set an official ""run date,"" and would use the poems generated on that date to produce the book. We fed the AI 154 unique prompts that we wanted it to write about (like 'dogs' and 'beer' and 'the meaning of life'), and limited it to produce 10 poems for each prompt. 2 hours and 57 minutes later, Robot Newman had written 1,540 original poems for us to choose from! Some are hilarious and vulgar. Others are thought-provoking and alarmingly deep.  We had a lot of fun making this book, and believe it serves as a good study on the imminent future of AI-generated art. To our knowledge, we \*probably\* produced the best AI-generated poet in the world. Let us know if you agree!

&amp;#x200B;

**About us:** 

We are [Human Mode](https://www.humanmode.com/)! We're a research-based tech company headquartered in Oklahoma City, working on all types of cool stuff in AI, VR and robotics. This is only the first AI project that we've released, but we have a lot of cool projects coming in the near future. Let us know if you have any questions!

Because with it, you can change things the developer doesn't want you to, and because it is a lot easier to break the software by doing something bad. 

A brain without root access might just not be able to think thoughts like ""I am completely worthless"" or ""I want to kill this person"" or ""I want to die"", because arguably thoughts like this do not benefit individuals or society. Also it would be a lot harder to break your brain, by which I mean having a mental illness. And then of course there is the problematic possibility of blocking thoughts like ""The leader of my country is bad"", but that is not my main point here. Let's assume we just want to help people with it. That would be good, right?

Unfortunately, a lot of personality development might become impossible when you don't have root access. People might become more like zombies. Or not, you know, we don't understand the brain very well yet, maybe they will just be better members of society.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, would you want your future kids to have root access to their brain if you had the decision?",10,11

Heres looking into how technology has changed our lives.

Although the environment has changed, the fundamental aspects of the world have remained the same. The only difference comes in the management approach that humankind has employed at the different eras of existence.

**From Candles to Electricity**

Lighting and visibility are natural elements that determine how we as humans respond to our environment. The difference between daytime and nighttime is determined by the amount of light present. Different parts of the world experience natural lighting at different times, this singular reason influences when and how people in different regions engage in productive activities.

In the olden days, the need for lighting inspired the invention of the candle. But things changed as humankind became more complicated. The people wanted a brighter light that would enable a wider range of visibility, and a longer and recyclable shelf life. In 1879, Thomas Edison invented the electric light bulb and our world has been brighter ever since.

However, adoption of the lightbulb was slow. In 1925, 28 years after its invention, only half of American households were utilizing it. If only theyd know then that the light bulb remains one of humankinds finest inventions. With a lot of improvement from its initial form, the light from electricity is precious and of enormous value.

**Horses to Cars**

At some point in development, horses were the most important means of transportation. Their use satisfied both basic and luxurious needs.

Things have changed significantly with the way technology has changed our lives and the way we do things. In terms of transportation, cars have become a more primary and more popular mode of transport. Speed cars, load carriers, luxurious cars, armoured vehicles, these all serve the varieties of solutions in transportation. Even the automobile industry has evolved in design, capacity and efficiency. Right now, we are on the verge of an evolution in the energy aspect of this innovation.

Jumping back to the beginning of this evolution, it was in the 1890s that motor cars entered modern stage development, and in 1908 the Model T was considered accessible to the masses. While the US were quick to adopt this new mode of transport, it took much longer for Western Europe and other parts of the world to catch on.

**Letters to Emails**

For millennials, the mention of post office and letter writing might sound very archaic, but this is a routine that only outdated itself two decades ago. Down to the 90s, when the internet was still trying to find its footing, letter writing was a popular means of communication.

Letters were mostly transported in stamp-bearing envelopes, and took days or even weeks to get across to their intended destination. The invention of the internet and email has changed everything. Written information between parties across thousands of miles can now be shared in split seconds.

The email technology came about and scaled our communication standard exponentially. Many people hardly remember what it means to write letters anymore, while the majority of the younger generation may not have written one single letter in their entire life. Between the invention of email (1972) and the adoption of it (1996, when popular webmail servers started popping up), the gaps of transformative adoption are closing in.

**Newspapers to Websites**

Distributing information in hard copies is still an obtainable practice, and quite popular as well. However, this used to be the most effective way of spreading news and other kinds of public information. Not anymore, with the introduction of websites and electronic tabloids. As a matter of fact, almost every recognized newspaper publisher that exists today runs a parallel online version.

Everything is going digital and the benefits cannot be denied. There is the saying, the internet never forgets. Stacking up old newspapers was a common trend in the past. With websites now in vogue, with a few clicks, we can retrieve whatever information our heart desires.

Websites also make it more portable and convenient to handle information, rather than the cumbersome newspaper approach. This is how technology has changed our lives.

**Banks to Bitcoin**

All the above mentioned evolutions have been fully established. They have passed the stage of emerging technologies, and now exist in their full nature as adopted processes in the mainstream. However, some serious change is happening in the money industry that is worth paying attention to.

The traditional banking system is experiencing significant changes at the moment. Transactions that happened through centralized institutions are now being processed using peer-to-peer networks. This is causing some major disruption and attracting the attention of top financial systems in the world.

Perhaps you are still unaware of the extent of infiltration of  Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have had in FinTech, you should consider the [tap app and card payment systems](https://www.tap.global/) to get a full picture of events. This platform allows users to store, trade and spend their cryptocurrencies easily, like doing regular business. That is how things change, by adapting seamlessly into existing systems, as we have seen with the other evolutions mentioned above.

**Conclusion**

Of all the instances described above, it is the Banks to Bitcoin revolution that seems to be hot on its heels right now. Like those before it, it is assuming a gradual process for now, and that is exactly how these changes occur.

Changes in civilization do not happen like an over the cliff event. They take time to become fully revealed, adapting little by little, one step at a time. However, those who identify these opportunities early enough, and take advantage of the benefits that they provide, naturally tend to lead in the industry for a long time.

A good place to start from is the tap platform which has developed a compatible system that can serve everyone. The tap prepaid Mastercard, which allows users to spend cryptocurrency directly in any payment point that accepts Bitcoin is a perfect introduction to the evolution of Banks to Bitcoin. This is how technology has changed our lives!

Their website boasts the cheapest international flights on the market (beating Google flights by $500 in some cases) and does so by leveraging machine learning optimization with obscure airline fare combinations.

The NuFare team set me up with a 12-day, round trip itinerary from NYC -&gt; London -&gt; Paris -&gt; NYC for only $289! I am set to embark on this journey in September, but I wanted to give this outstanding team some awareness for their unparallel services, and to help out other college students like myself travel on a budget (I will update this post with experience from my travels). Check them out below and show them some love for giving these big airlines the middle finger!

The level of brainwashing in mainstream media and education has reached levels that are ridiculously laughable (e.g. actually comical) to intelligent people.

It is true that one of the reasons for this is the War on the Family - by destroying marriage and friendship, the state atomizes society in order to make it more manageable. People whose only social connection is that to the state make it easier to set up an Orwellian tyranny.

Nevertheless, after examining the problem throughoutly, I think that there is one, more alarming, reason behind it, namely the attempt to reduce birth rates among certain groups.

Feminist women do not marry and consider children ""parasites"" - if they become pregnant for some reason, it is likely that they will commit infanticide before the child is born. Childlessness is prevalent not only among open third-wave feminists but also among all sorts of ""emancipated"" or ""career women"".

As women frequently utilize men to get pregnant, file for divorce quickly and then demand support, men are discouraged from marrying and having children because they can't know that they won't become ""money donkeys"".

Adultery, e.g. early and premarital promiscuity and the great frequency of intercourse alienates copulation from its only natural purpose, reproduction. The broad acceptance and even encouragement of adultery promotes not only contraceptives but also abortions as the ""deed"" is completely separated from the will to have children.

Combined with feminism, adultery has contributed to the fact that it is nowadays unacceptable for women to bear children before 30, and to have more than two or three children. This drastically reduces birth rates.

The problem with homosexuality is not only that it further contributes to adultery and promiscuity but also that it is an anti-biological form of cohabitation. Sexual deviants have to resort to adoption or artificial fertilization to have children, which is significantly harder than what a man and a woman would have to do if they wished to have a child. This means that birth numbers are also lower among homosexuals.

It is interesting to see that these three deviances/ideologies are most prevalent within both the established liberal-academic elite (the middle-aged parts of which are primarily comprised of former hippies, subculture members or left-wing extremists) and its younger and poorer cousin, the urban boheme. These groups are increasingly displacing conservative but well-educated people.

As the true elite disminishes in size, it is increasingly replaced by individuals of ordinary or even subpar intelligence and ability thanks to the ""equality""-driven college system which grants bonus points for members of ethnic minorities or children of proles.

What does this ultimatively lead to?

You're right, **the median IQ and ability of the elite decreases with the proportion of the true biological elite**.

In short: postmodernist society is **slowly sawing off its head**.",6,0

Seems like half of the questions on r/futurology are asking ""when will I become immortal"" I feel like we are looking in the wrong direction for experiences more life. Don't get me wrong, the first life extending technology will come through easier healthy choices and medicine/artificial organs, but I think our closest thing to immortality will come in a form different to what we expected. Computers are getting smaller, in turn, they are becoming more powerful, perhaps powerful enough to create a ""dumbed down life"". My idea is that we install computers that instantly fabricate years worth of memories and we implant them into one's head. 

 Although you lived through every single second of your life, not missing a single moment, all you have to confirm that are your memories. Think of how easy it would be, a couple of terabytes of imagery, audio, sound and feelings, and boom, you have critical pieces of one's life, along with random days in-between to reassure them that *is* their life. Of course, this technology would take some breakthroughs that give the ability to either upload computer data into a brain, or the technology to put small computers *in* a brain, but this is clearly more feasible than actual immortality right? You also get the *huge* added benefits of bypassing the whole only .000000001 percenters get this tech and the religious backlash. If this technology were to take off, ""dlc's"" of sort could be added. More content, more lives. Do you want to live as Michael Jackson? Sure only 20k and a day for surgery/upload. Want to live as a random Indonesian dude? Popular choice! Only 6k for this week and the standard operating/upload time. Improvements that make the memories cheaper, safer, quicker, and more vivid would surely be on the way as there is no denying that this would be extremely popular tech.

That's pretty much it! I've said my piece so I'm going to wrap this up by saying this is my ""pipe dream"" of sorts. This isn't some idea that I'm counting on or even expecting. I simply posted because I want to see what you guys and gals think of this technology. What's your thoughts on the feasibility, morality, and logic behind this idea? Would you guys do it and if so, how many ""lives"" would you live and who would you live as?

Could, theoretically, a show be done with entirely AI actors - the same logic as how truck companies replacing big rigs with self-driving trucks saves the wage bill or an automated McDonald's producing burgers to a set schedule with no human input aside from repairing the robots.

I know we've had things like a virtual Tupac Shakur, but could you imagine, in 2040-2050, a VR version of Mireille Enos or Carly Chaikin in a future television series with entirely AI or VR versions of [by then] deceased actors?

Also, how could automation affect the radio industry [other than voice-tracking, as we have today?].

How could a future [Pulse 1](http://pulse1.co.uk) of West Yorkshire look - assuming there's still local radio in some form [presumably DAB if FM transmission ceases] in 2030-2040 sound?

As for the radio station websites, could these be obsolete by 2030-2050 even?

As long as the solution isnt money travelling from our hands to the people whose fault this all is, then we fear harmonious prosperity.

Its an extension of how the powers that be want us to see the world. They want us to be afraid of ourselves, to flagellate ourselves, to know that humans are evil because of our genius. It is the atheistic version of Original Sin, rosaries for the Age of Enlightenment. They want to stifle any idea that will fix our world. They want us to think climate change is beyond beating, so they make climate change beyond beating. They want us to think the bees are beyond saving, so they make the bees beyond saving. They want us to prepare for an apocalypse that would be further away if we didnt trust them. Whether the right-winger decries immigration, cooperation and video games or the left-winger preaches a complete end to any helpful form of machinery, all politics is built for the same purpose. *Making us scared of the new, making scared of change, is how they control us.*

Do not give in to this fear. If you have a way of helping the world, chase it. If you dont, live for the present lest you fear a future you cant control. Love, seek friendships, know that youll wake up tomorrow. I love you all.",8,6
