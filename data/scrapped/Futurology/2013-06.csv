Are countries in Europe, with their already existing cradle to gave social safety net, better prepared for an easy transition to an economy where 90 to 100 percent of all jobs are automated?

Among Europeans is a great exporter combined with a great social safety net, like Germany for example, most likely to have a smooth transition?

Or how about Japan, already a leader in robotics and automation, they've also had to deal with many unemployed people, especially the young, thanks to the never ending recession they have been in past 20 years. Are they closest to a switch from the current everybody needs a job economy, to the new - no one can get a job economy?

And what about the US, with its abundance of cheap labor, and hatred of all things socialist, except for social security and medicare?

What about the developing world? They have been jumping over some of the developments the industrialized world went through. For example why build out a land line phone network with all the lines and stuff, when you can just jump straight to a mobile phone network. Skip the whole land line deal. 

Could the developing world adopt to a new reality faster than the developed world? For example, some Indian sates, among them Kerala: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_Kerala
have a history of Marxist governance. Are they best poised for a transition to a fully automated economy?

If you could move anywhere, where would you go and why?

With BrainPay, you can do that today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1fi0q2/access_your_money_from_any_internetenabled_place/,ThePiachu,1370142707,"[Here's a relevant Reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1fgjxb/brainpay_a_new_way_to_send_transactions_from_your/), and here is the [BrainPay Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tps-brainpay/aihogeigcnkcklfaljfimkefkmbmlomi).

So what's this all about? Well, some of you already know [Bitcoin](/r/Bitcoin), a futuristic crypto currency that uses math to make itself secure. Normally, you access your Bitcoin money through the use of a Client, which is a piece of software synchronising your computer with the rest of the Bitcoin Network, and a special wallet file containing your private keys - think of them like keys to your gold vault. The problem with the current model is that if you lose your wallet file, you lose access to your money. So some people decided to store your wallet online and access your money like a bank account - through logins and so forth. But the problem with those is that the wallet files are usually stored online so people can potentially gain access to them and steal them.

This is where BrainPay comes in. Basically, it creates your private keys on the fly from a strong password and never stores them anywhere. This means that while you still have access to your money, unless someone intercepts your password from your computer the moment you are entering it, there is no way your money can get stolen (assuming your password is strong enough). You no longer have to rely on someone else keeping your money safe for you, or worry that you can lose your money in a hard disk crash.

When I heard about the concept for the first time I was really intrigued, so I had to implement it myself. And thus, I went ahead and implemented [BrainPay](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tps-brainpay/aihogeigcnkcklfaljfimkefkmbmlomi).

Would a collection of AIs run different systems or would a single one govern a country? Does it just replace the bureaucracy or the entire electoral system of representatives too? Would a benefit be that given guiding principles, an AI should be ultra efficient and immune to corruption in the traditional sense? Humans tend to fear government because other fallible, corruptible humans run it - could an AI be the ultimate benevolent arbitrator of governance?

What do you envision?

**Edit 1 -** 

A better elaboration from my comment:

""Regarding the point about corruption due to human making, I find it helpful to think of a governance AI as being much like a constitution - yes there are shitty constitutions out there that are explicitly biased towards those who wrote it, but occasionally sound democratic and rights-ensuring provisions make their way into what are some of the most enlightened documents humanity has ever conceived. 

An AI could be much the same - if the intentions are good of the founding populace, they could encode rights and principles into an intelligent entity that would forever put them beyond the tampering of dictators or corrupt politicians. 

The server farms or supercomputers the AI was hosted on could be isolated or sealed off to avoid tamping, perhaps within a ""capital territory"" inside which the AI has force jurisdiction to protect itself should the need arise. 

Any ""patches"" or updates to the AI program by a representative body of the population  would be analysed by the AI itself to judge it's consistency with its founding principles and fundamental guaranteed rights. 

So an ""intelligent self protecting constitution"" that also handles the bureaucratic functions of government. ""
 

**Edit 2 -**

It seems most people feel an AI governance system would be very hard to implement in an existing nation-state, given competing interests, entrenched values and a population unaccustomed to it. 

Perhaps an alternative would be a prototype small scale city-state built from scratch, perhaps under the collaboration of the new class of young tech rich. 

**FINAL EDIT**

A lot of people have recommended some great fiction that has explored the ideas we've all discussed here, so I thought I might compile them in one easy place for anyone who is interested. Thanks to everyone who suggested something.

- ""Player Piano"" by Kurt Vonnegut, a heavily automated society divided into two distinct classes 
- ""I, Robot"" by Issac Asimov, specifically the last story 
- ""The Culture Series"" by Iain M. Banks, for an exploration of benevolent AIs (also where my username is from by coincidence)
- ""Polity"" by Neal Asher, Human/AI empire background
- ""The Dispossessed"" by Ursula LeGuin, Libertarian moon colonists working with AI systems
- ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", Anime
- ""PSYCHO-PASS"", Anime

It is a bit late here and my mind isn't working at full power. Also this was directed to a friend of mine so excuse some of the possible informal language. 

Economics and politics were invented by human beings they are artificial systems. The sole reason for our existence and to ensure our prosperity is technology. Us humans, through the thousand years of evolution was only gifted with one gift, and that one, is to have the ability to create and invent tools. If you were to strip that away from a man's mind and throw the man in the wilderness, the man would die within days, if not minutes, without a brain, we would be completely inferior to all animals, we can't run fast enough, we don't have strong arms or weapons built in our bodies, we can't see far enough, and we can't hear any sounds beyond 20 and 20,000 hertz. Give a man the ability to invent, and the man would dominate the entire Animal Kingdom, similar to what our ancestors did, and unfortunately, that was the apex of humanity.

Shortly after, a society and a bartering system appeared. The first currency, a sea shell, was invented. The community gradually turned from one that is established to ensure survival into one that focuses on each and every individual's ability of purchasing products, or an economy based society. Therefore survival as we knew it, which once relied on technology and tools, turned into one that relies on economy. Much like the society we live in nowadays. We do not need the numbers on the Dow Jones market to survive, but if that number drops below 1000 tomorrow, I guarantee you, you will starve for the next month and possibly die. The current education focuses on getting us ready into the society we created. It was created to put all of us on a scale as to who are willing to work harder and therefore would earn more money and would therefore ensure freedom. Is this what education really is, is it what we are designed to take into our brains? No. We are designed to create, to invent, and to use that to ensure our survival, once again, take our ability to create away from us, and we will drop from the top of the food web to the bottom immediately. To this day, it is absolutely stunning to see what a man's mind is capable of doing. Within 50 years of using chemicals in warfare, we developed a weapons system that can destroy cities with a push of a button. Within 100 years of knowing how to get into the air, we got onto the moon. Within 50 years of harnessing the power of the atom, we accelerated particles to 99% of the speed of light. And these, are just a tiny part of what all of us are capable of doing. It also proves that any limiting factor of a technological breakthrough is not the human mind, and is however, the amount of funding the idea receives. 

The Apollo Program and the Manhattan Project were funded by a blank check by the US because the government knew deeply inside, that if we try hard enough, we could achieve anything. It's just the money that is limiting us from doing so, and in the above cases, they wanted those people to achieve it, so they removed the main limiting factor, the funding part, and we achieved them. With that being said, The Earth is going downhill, climate change, pollution, over population, extreme poverty, diseases, there are definitely minds out there who has the ability of countering all the problems, it could be your Uncle Bob or your neighbour, or it could even be you. But no one would fund them because they can not get a profit from curing malaria, using an alternative energy source, or planting more crops around, or colonize other planets to increase the population limit, they see their money as something that is more important than the technology that would maintain our existence. The monetary system was invented by ourselves, so in a sense, our own invention of the monetary system would ultimately lead to the downfall of humanity. Because it is simply not what we are designed to do, we are designed to create, and not to take. 

The current educational system is weeding out all of the ones who have the ability to actually do the above, it teaches us what rather than how or why or go explore yourself. And that being said, even though I came up with all of these ideas, I would not take the risk to go against this system, as I might be the first ones to fail in this society. 

That should give you an idea of how seriously messed up we are at the current state, there is no turning back.

-facial detection technology
-preferably non lethal payload, something that would incapacitate rather than do any permanent damage.
-would have to detect knives, guns, etc and be smart enough to react in time without any false positives

Now my favorite question 

-Should an individual be able to own a defense drone with a concealed weapons license (I live in Texas where it is legal to carry weapons in public if you are licensed by the state) or should a private company get awarded a contract, or should it be government run? Finally will this not happen because it is outlawed? I find that outcome unlikely as suppressing technology has never been something humanity can do for long.

I have a few notions of my own but I don't want to flood this just yet with my musings, I want to hear some others. 

I think it's definitely something worthy discussing as I feel it tends to get left out of the futurist vision of the future in general. Perhaps there are a lot of functional atheists here (myself included) for whom such concerns don't arise - we tend to imagine a Star Trek type future of relative non-religion because we extrapolate from our own experience. However I think there are a few important facts to keep in mind:

1. There are over 1.5 billion Muslims in the world today

2. The futurist ""worldview"" is an amalgamation of different western historical processes and philosophies that do not fit neatly into the Islamic worldview or expectation of historical progress. 

3. There are over 2 billion Christians in the world, increasingly located in Africa and South America. Many of the increasing technological changes will grate against more traditional Christian worldviews too. 

4. Most of China is functionally atheist in regards to a higher power

5. Religions tend to be the longest lasting historical institutions, connecting people, places, values and ideas across millennia - compared to the relatively short lifespan of empires, states and even languages. 

So it seems unlikely religion will disappear in the near future, definitely not this century. So will it evolve? Or revert into more fundamentalist interpretations in response to a rapidly changing world?",133,31,False,self,,,,,

My boss posed a question whether or not technology makes life better. I wrote him this, he told me it was a bit too esoteric. I don't possibly get what he means. 






""Ive been a fan of Star Trek for some time. The technological gadgetry was not one of the selling points that compelled me to it. Dont get me wrong, I would love to explore space in a state of the art space ship, but no individual gadget on the Enterprise (with the exception of one of their plot enhancing gadgets, in the form of the Hollodeck) sticks out. Yes there are phasers, and large screens, and somewhat magical seeming healing devices, communicators, the ability to deconstruct and transport matter instantly and great distances etc. But all these devices are in the service of a larger cause  the production of a good TV show. 

However, the technology on Star Trek can bring up interesting points on the future of technology.

1.	**It seems they have reached a pinnacle.** In this I mean, what technological advance could surpass the transporter? While incredibly fantastical sounding, it gives a concrete example of something with practical capability that is beyond advancement (Im aware there is contention on this subject, but the imagining of fictional tools can develop a certain clarity of vision). With the development of technology it can appear overwhelming. So much new stuff to deal with all the time, theres a tendency to want to disengage completely. This is a sentiment I understand very well. But the idea that there is an ending point for technological advance, can give us perspective for our own gadgets that work just fine on their own (no more technological Keeping up with the Joneses) and a kind of mental return for your own investment in learning about technology.

2.	**The benefits of an actually inclusive technological life.** 
One of the things that bothers me most about technology is that I have to be tied to it, that it is not tied to me in my choosing, but I to it. Sitting at a computer limits, severely, the way we interact with technology. I really appreciate the idea of walking around a space ship (well, I enjoy the idea regardless) and not being tied to any area of it. The function of your job could take place anywhere. There are obvious practical reasons to be in a specific place, say: be on the bridge when encountering an alien vessel or working in the engine room, and these practical things of course will always exist, but the appeal to me is the function to pull up information at will, while still being your own person, in concert with the people around you. This is what bothers me about new technology, it can take away from our ability to be present. 

So instead of the modern focus of being forced to interact with a single piece of technology, a more complete vision of technology seems appealing, and can give one hope and perspective for the future.. when development stage jitters, start to get to you.""

In many works of fiction, and in the popular imagination, humans coming into contact with extraterrestrial life is consider our first experience with an alien intelligence and the initiator of all existential flow-on effects. 

However it doesn't seem to generally be considered that the first ""alien"" we will actually contact will in fact be on earth, living inside our computer systems. It would appear to me that AI fulfills all relevant criteria for being considered as such, unless one insists specifically on the factor of spacial proximity of origin - which in judging intelligence seems odd. 

In fact I would claim that AI will be more alien to us than typical alien life. If we were to contact ETs, we could generally assume that they evolved through the same processes of natural selection as we did, thus at least sharing some common survivalist traits with us.  AI on the other hand will be completely alien, perhaps almost incomprehensible.

Humanity I think is unprepared on a political, cultural, religious or existential level for any contact from ETs - so a serious question arises:

Some may catch us by surprise, but let me give you my candidates and let me know what you think--also, post your own ideas.

1. Always-on electronics thanks to power management and improvements in battery technology. This doesnt sound that important, but I think the ramifications are huge. People will be sharing GPS location 24/7 with each other, streaming music/video all waking hours, people will no longer check email or fb or twitter because it you'll be updated in real time.

2. Unlimited data and cloud storage will usher in lifelogging. Before the decade is out we're all likely be recording everything we do for all posterity. Forget what your wife or son asked you this morning as you left?...not anymore. Wonder what your friend is doing at the moment?...connect to their live feed. Distracted during the lecture?...replay it. Of course many people will want privacy and will restrict who can access their history, but 99% of what we do is too boring for most to care about, so eventually almost everything will be shared. 

3. AR--augmented reality. Life will be annotated with hyperlinked info. This will eventually fundamentally change our world. We'll be able to look around our surroundings and interact like never before. What is that piece of furniture worth if I want to sell it on Craigslist? What did I pay for it originally? Could I fit it in my car if I wanted to move it somewhere else? How would I fix it if I wanted to? What would a replacement cost...what does my wife think? Etc...and that's just some inanimate furniture, imagine walking into a store and every person you walk up to will have their name floating above them and a profile to view. Soon people will have their own avatars, so while your boss may look conservative to you, to his circle of LARP friends he'll have appear to be wearing Klingon garb. True heads-up directions...the truth is that AR is about to change everything. 

4. Cars. Electrically powered robotic cars are about to be a reality. Traffic jams can be largely avoided, schedules will be far more predictable, many more businesses will deliver to you, and accidents will be avoided. Perhaps even more important, dependence on oil will begin to be alleviated. Perhaps western nations will actually start to allow the mideast to solve their own problems and won't interfere...well, that may take more than a decade.

5. 3D printing. Many like to downplay this by reminding people of the limitations of today's technology, but they miss the big picture. Eventually we'll be able to manufacture the material goods we purchase and ship today. It will probably take half a century until we can build our own complicated electronics from scratch, but that's coming. 3D printing is the first step to universal constructors, and the implications are world changing. Already we're hearing of printed organs and replacement joints, in a decade it will be obvious to everyone that these will change everything.

2. [A node in a neural network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) is the equivalent of an artificial neuron. 

3. The human brain has only about [84-100 billion neurons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron#Neurons_in_the_brain). This means that Google's planned artificial neural network will have 10 times as many neurons as the human brain.

(Please keep in mind these questions stem from my lack of understanding of neuroscience or machine learning, so hopefully someone with a background in those areas could help me with these questions.)

1. How will Google's soon-to-be trillion neuron neural network differ from a human brain which has only 100 billion neurons?

Reading this subreddit and other news seems to suggests that jobs are being lost to the economy, machinery, and computers and are ultimately never going to be replaced, and (meaningful) employment will continue to decline (run-on?). In that regard, I'm wondering if there are any books/essays/readings in which writers write about possible futures and transitions into said futures where human society manages to free itself of the use of money. Potential questions raised/debated include

* Freeloaders

* Lack of innovation incentive

* Role of corporations

* Role of governments

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!

So, one key argument against drugs and medical treatment that could solve aging is the idea that the world would become overpopulated quickly. If we pretend that colonisation of other planets is still not feasible at that time, could we not just have laws or contracts put in place which state that the one prolonging their age may not reproduce? Like a population control, and that if one did have children, they would no longer be able to get the treatment?

In the same way that the EU struggles to assimilate many countries and cultures under one very loose jurisdiction, the USA has the same problem ruling over such a diverse and geographically huge nation. The empires have been broken up, large countries divided (just look at how Europe has changed since WWI) in a move towards self-determination and being able to have a system that allows individuals to have more of a say.
The more power is centrilised, the less power the individual has. When smaller areas are presided over, the people doing the presiding are more likely to represent their people, there's more room for the everyday person to become part of that and they are more directly affected by protests or demonstrations by the people. If 2000 people in New York decide to skip work and protest, do you think Obama could give a damn sitting in the White House presiding over 300+ million people? But if 2000 people skip work in a smaller jurisdiction and an important factory or public service has to be suspended, the person has to live with that and deal with it.
When you have so few people presiding over such an enormous area, with an established political system that makes it almost impossible for John Smith to hold any power without falling in line with the current powers, it becomes scary. The amount of power that is being held by the US Government is enormous, and when they are so powerful and withdrawn, they can start to get away with things that people wouldn't be able to in a smaller jurisdiction. When there is a more direct link between leader and citizen, it becomes almost impossible to do things like spying or breaking the constitution, because they have to pass through streets of their citizens every day, not hide away in the white house.

When I think of the future, I think of a single-government world where everybody works together and represents humanity, but the more I see trends in human behaviour and the behaviour of big governments, the more scary and counter-productive I think that becomes. We already have international science teams and other international efforts which work towards a single purpose, but I'd not sure that governments would have the same direction to be able to remain 'true', and when a select number hold absolute power over a whole planet, what can you do if you're unhappy?

So what do you think? Will our move towards centrilisation hold or that we split up more but maintain a high degree of internationalism. Perhaps we will split and become more nationalist, or perhaps we'll split up and eventually move back together when our societies and nature have changed enough to make a centrilised government possible without fear of corruption, abuse or political elitism?

I was thinking what might happen if the governments of developed countries made new regulations which would cap the allowed workweek at 40 hours and decrease the workweek by something like two hours every year so that after ten years the maximum is 20 hours or even less. Critical jobs such as brain surgeons for example would be temporarily excluded from this rule until they can reach the capacity where it is possible to decrease the workweek without sacrificing health of patients in the case of the surgeon.

I think that while it would initially cause quite a shock to the system it would also yield a great number of benefits:

* One the one hand sharing the jobs that are still around reduces unemployment. While the scarcity of labor will increase the hourly wages as companies have to compete to be able to fill their vacancies. As hourly wages increase the huge gap that has grown over the past decades between worker productivity and wages will narrow again. In the short term this would give the middle and lower classes more money again, and since they are most likely to spend money it might boost consumption and the economy too.

* Another effect of these measures could be to speed up the transition to a post-scarcity and post-work society. This is because the increased wages of the employees will drive companies to put even more effort in automation.

* There will be a lot of people who, even with the scarcity of labor that will result, won't be able to find a job because they lack the skills and are unable to learn them. However, these people will be out of a job soon regardless of how work is arranged. I'm thinking about all the people replaced by driverless cars, 3D printing, robotics, and Watson-like systems. In the scenario I propose these people might actually have a better chance as companies might be willing to invest more in the training of low skilled people when there is such high scarcity of labor. 

* Like in all future scenarios, it will be tough for the first people who become permanently unemployed, but if the scarcity of work does result in less unemployment in the near term, paying these people a decent amount of welfare won't be such a big drain on the rest of society. 

* Another huge advantage I see is that this system almost automatically insure a somewhat gradual transition to a post-work society. People will have to find new activities to fill the extra leisure time that keeps building until it's the primary concern that labor used to be. Once people find new meaning it won't feel like they've become worthless once their day job ceases to exist. 

* The increase in leisure time of the employed will also drive an enormous expansion of the entertainment industry and technology. The demand for things to do with the increased leisure time might also create a huge number of new jobs that people like to do but can't at this point. Think about the huge increases in demand for people who can teach the whole gamut of sport, crafts, and hobbies. Also the whole education system is ripe for a revolution where the ratio of teachers to pupils increases dramatically, giving teachers nicer jobs and children a much better and personalized education.

* In this system it's also clear to everyone from the outset that unemployment is the logical endpoint of the transition. This will also help low-skilled people who become unemployed earlier to feel and be less marginalized by society.

To me this seems almost too good to be possible, so I think I might be overlooking some macro-economic disaster that this system would result in. What do you guys think?

**TL;DR**  
Gradually decreasing the workweek will make everyone better off, bring post-scarcity even closer, and prepare people and society for a life of leisure.

Think of it like a wikipedia or a crowd-sourced type of a party. It would be messy, but powerful. Very overcrowded, but rich in ideas and passion.

 The question asks: ""What does your utopian future look like?""

 Lots of people put up some amazing ideas on that conversation. It's worth checking out. This goes to show how amazing collective brainstorming is.

 One answer that stuck with me is this one:

 &gt;My utopian future would be neither capitalist nor socialist, it would be an economy based on need where people were not paid to work, but to live. Just to produce and create would be its own reward. People would not own what they produce either, for the product or creation would be owned by everyone else who is producing and creating too. So, for instance, an author would be paid for living, and she/he would write just for the personal thrill of writing. The book written would not be owned by the author, but the society that paid for the upkeep of the author. Thus, the book (or a piece of music, a performance, a film, a technology, a type of medicine etc  anything produced or created) would be free to anyone who wanted to read (use, consume, watch etc) it. This would do away with careers aimed at becoming wealthy, and change them into callings whose goals are creative expression and self-satisfaction. It would mean that in a lifetime we could meet one challenge and then take up another, perhaps by indulging in life-long learning. It would mean sharing knowledge, not hording (and patenting) it. It would mean helping the poor not simply from charity but because we know that improving their lives would make them more productive and creative, and thus help the community as a whole. The political outcome of such a utopian system would be communities bound together through collective action, linked to other communities that contribute to the common good. Social capital produced and used like this ought to increase our chance of conquering diseases, going into space, ending wasteful conflicts, solving global problems etc. How to move from where we are in today to such a utopian future is what we ought to be thinking about and working for now.

 Sounds a lot like the [Venus Project](http://www.thevenusproject.com/) to me.

I think the Tomak at this stage is basicly dead, as these new technologies will(supposedly) come to fruition way sooner. I'm sure it has applications in plasma research but I Some very interesting approaches starting to appear.

My favorites are; Hellion Energy, Tri-Alpha, Lockheed-Martin and also the Polywell from US Navy. Everyone of them are working on smaller decentralized solution making them viable in ships, trains and other mobile or in decentralized applications. LMT likens the complexity to a modern jet engine meaning we can mass produce and distribute, starting as soon as 2022. They expect that 100% of the worlds energy needs will be power by fusion by 2050.I think LMT working on graphene and fusion both is no coincidence, as I'm sure they are leveraging graphene ability to as supercapacitors and superconductors, magnetic properties, heat dissipation and so on.

All of these seem to be talking about a 5 year time frame to be able to supply a working energy(100MVE for LMT, 50 MVE for Helion) producing prototype.




So in the end I think I buy it. I believe we will producing net energy very soon. 

How do people feel about these predictions?

What will happen to our economies once you can start ordering 100 MV reactors to be delivered to your door step(imploding oil companies, etc.)?






**TLDR;** I've been drinking the Kool-aid and I'm convinced fusion is happening for real this time. Any other takers?

Basically, my question is this: is it possible to reconcile our increasingly more virtual existences with the right to privacy as we currently define it? 

Say that technology progresses along the paths we expect it to and uploading or mind-simulation becomes a reality. What's to stop someone from holding another person captive inside their own brain or within the processes of their own minds? What's to stop them from torturing this person or a million persons? Increasing their capacity for suffering or altering their perception of time to torture them for hundreds of years every minute?

I believe in the concept of presumption of innocence and I imagine most of you do as well but how would we deal with the knowledge that *each person* we come into contact with could be committing crimes on a scale that is beyond anything we've seen throughout history and you would never find out if they didn't tell you about it or slip up in some way?

I've tried to come up with solutions to this dilemma that preserve our status quo but none I've managed to think of have been anything but evasion or denial. 

We're all familiar with this quote: ""Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."" Where is the threshold where this becomes farcical? The kinds of crimes in question are not ""little"" in any sense of the word.

I wonder if privacy will be my generation's civil rights or same-sex marriage debate where those of us who grow up now will be unable to let it go despite all reasonable argument our children will try to convince us with.

In contrast to this, I've many times seen people point out that the real magic factor driving technological increase may be in having a sufficiently large margin between what we require to live and what we can produce.

If someone must gather roots and nuts all day to feed themselves and obtain enough calories to feed their young, they don't have much time or resources for sitting around and inventing new things or corresponding with other people.  It may be this difference between our ability to produce and our need to consume that tends to be converted into more technological advancement.

And, to be sure, this also produces a positive feedback loop: have someone with a lot of time on their hands to invent an oil rig, and now you can use oil to boost productivity even more.

But it also means that if our needed consumption ever catches up to our ability to produce, for any reason, we go back to the caveman era in terms of technological advancement.  It's the margin between the two that gives us our growth.

Live has been on Earth since [about 3.6 billion years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_evolutionary_history_of_life).  It has been [about 28 million years since the great apes showed up, 2.5 million years since *Homo* showed up, and 200,000 years since modern humans showed up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_evolution).  Most of that time didn't involve a terrible amount of technological advancement.

[It was only about 10,000 years ago that we discovered agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_prehistory).  This represented a real change in energy input, where we could produce a lot more energy than we needed to survive.  That was, arguably, the big break that started us from wandering around in little groups and doing pretty much the same thing every year to suddenly having free resources to devote to advancement (being able to live in closer proximity to large groups of other humans without exhausting the food in the region also doubtless helped).

Ten thousand years is a tiny blip on the 3.6 billion year timeline of life, and yet it represented a phenomenal change in the course of development; instead of waiting for evolution to slowly address new environments, we were able to plan and develop up new schemes, and pass knowledge on.  We didn't have to wait for our brain to grow larger and the hips of the females of our species to grow correspondingly further apart; we could store knowledge in books or other things like that.

Written language, the wheel and most or all of the rest of the [simple machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_machine), metalworking, all of this antedated our very recent discovery of agriculture.  Using our free time, we could discover and make use of other energy sources: water, wind, coal, oil, nuclear.  Western thought likes to reference the ancient Greek society, where slaveowners had enough idle time from seeking to feed themselves to sit down and think deep thoughts and develop new technologies.

But what happens if that stops?  What if our global population rises enough to consume the additional energy we produce?  That probably won't happen in the immediate future, but any form of population control is fighting against evolution: if the primary selection criteria for evolutionary success is evading birth control or abortion, then all the energies of evolution are pushing hard to defeat birth control and abortion.  Maybe people develop a mental aversion to birth control, for example, or a predilection to views that would ban it.  At some point, [Malthus's concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population) dominate; the need for food pushes humans into a more-and-more spartan existence.

It's also possible that, if energy became constrained, that whoever could manage to seize control of those sources of energy would do so, to ensure their own high standard of living at the cost of technologically-idling much of the rest of the world, and to use those energy resources to help maintain their dominance.  Certainly the United States and much of the West already does enjoy military benefits from a great abundance of energy, and in turn uses those military benefits to ensure privileged access to energy themselves.

Thus far, we have been uncovering, developing, and exploiting new sources of energy at such a tremendous rate that such concerns have not really dominated.  But what if our rate of energy consumption, which has been multiplying and re-multiplying, outstrips our rate of new development of energy sources, so that those who can manage to do so pinch off access to an increasing amount of the world?  Even if there's plenty of resources, that doesn't mean that there won't be a few yachts and a lot of starving people: treaties and guarantees and whatnot are easy to break when they become very inconvenient; they can't provide any answer here.

Or what if we have a disaster, a ""fall from technology"", that occurs after we've exhausted easily-reached fossil fuels?  Sure, there's plenty of coal in the ground, and we used it to create the Industrial Revolution...but what if the coal that remains is far, far harder to extract, particularly using pre-industrial mining techniques?  Would we be able to get back on that exponential growth curve?

That ten-thousand-year period is a very short phase, and a very recent one, and if it is all a temporary blip, I wonder if we could potentially return to the plodding pace that has been the norm for life for almost all of the history of life on Earth.

Suppose their was a way for Doctors to implant an RJ-45 (Ethernet) interface thru your skull, touching your brain, thus establishing a direct connection. Suppose they did this to 2 people, who are set to die via a terminal illness of some sorts and have volunteered to so the study.


If you then connected a cable to both people, what would happen?  (Assuming that the proper diode was connected so only one brain can send impulses, and the other can only receive them)


Since the brain essentially fires impulses, and a connection between the people exist, the brain will eventually fire impulses thru the cable, correct?


Since the impulses are coming from a brain, they are interpreted as brain impulses by the receiving brain.  Now lets say that the interface was connected to the primary visual cortex, on the left side of the brain, that interprets the right side of our vision in each eye.  The receiver is now receiving multiple signals that are both being interpreted.


Can the receiver see a mix of both images? Or does one overpower the other?

Say we had this sort of technology, it was cheap, living in an age of plenty, and we could easily print out a vessel or grow it very cheaply, and then make whatever alterations we wanted, we could then make up a sport using printed out gladiator bodies that has flesh, blood and bones, but with modified pain to make it less uncomfortable to have your throat slashed, make it a bit more videogame-like to the driver, but from the spectator perspective, we just saw someone get brutally murdered in the arena.

Ever wondered about the canon of games like Quake 3 Arena? How come the same characters can die millions of times and come back seconds later unharmed? This might be a fun explanation to it. Hopefully there'll be something like this in the future. It wouldn't harm anyone and it would be great fun. Maybe we wouldn't even need to print physical bodies, assuming that we've built brain computers that by far surpass the smartest humans in intelligence and can hook you up to a matrix which they regulate with your input.

Tell them a bunch of variables that you want in your simulations, and going on some of that basic info, they'll have creative freedom to make anything you want. Hell why not ask a matrix computer like that ""Computer, simulate a brilliant sequel to the movie 'Pulp Fiction' which includes the actors Charlton Heston, Sean Connery, Heath Ledger and Bruce Lee"", and its intelligence and abilities might very well simulate the best of possible scenarios for what you described!

You're not going to colonize the rest of the universe. Humans are merely part of a greater whole, known as the biosphere.

Millions of years of plant matter and algae have been stored beneath our feet, in the form of coal, gas and oil. These reserves generally keep growing, and as a result, our planet has until recently been suffering from conditions of very low atmospheric CO2. This led to the evolution of grasses, with a C4 carbon fixation system.

In the grassy plains that emerge as a result of low CO2 conditions, a niche automatically opens up for a bipedal tool-using organism. An ape runs around the Savannah, scouring the Earth in search of other animal's corpses, which he consumes through use of his hands and stone tools. Eventually he begins to hunt to supplement his diet.

It's inevitable that this bipedal organism eventually figures out how to domesticate the grasses that surround it. In fact, this happened multiple times independently in different places.

Eventually, the naked ape runs out of wood to burn, and moves over to coal. This leads to a point where most coal available to the ape is underwater. The ape then decides to build a pump, allowing him to extract more coal. The pump is then transformed, allowing it to be used for different purposes as well. The burning of fossilized carbon accelerates, and eventually it is discovered that something must be done to cease burning carbon, but nobody can afford to stop. 

The climate now begins to change in rapid fashion. CO2 concentrations are high enough to favor the growth of woody plants over grasses. Temperatures rise, and the Earth gets wetter. Insects grow in number, preying on the agricultural fields. 

Humans find that like any other species they suffered from an overshoot, growing beyond the natural levels that could be sustained for their species. Humans discover that all of nature is evolving to take down their domination. Rats spread to every place that knows civilization, bacteria evolve antibiotic resistance, new fungi evolve to consume the grains we grow, tics infect the only prey left for them.

Nature, stimulated by increased levels of CO2, reconquers those portions of the planet once dominated by Homo Sapiens Sapiens. Even the deserts become green, as plants now have to lose less water molecules when taking up CO2.

Nature had a problem. Carbon was stored beneath the ground, with no way to retrieve it. Nature evolved a quick and dirty solution; A hairless megalomaniac ape that thinks he will spread throughout the galaxy. The solution worked, and is soon discarded.

What follows? Clever creatures, but not necessarily us. Dinosaurs were rapidly increasing their brain size until they were hit by a meteor. Today we have Elephants, Ravens, Octopuses, Dolphins, Whales, Parrots and many more. [Animals with larger brains are less prone to extinction.](http://phys.org/news/2012-07-animals-bigger-brains-prone-extinction.html) Rats are evolving to delay gratification. Rats have learned to eat a little bit of food and wait to see if they feel poisoned, before continuing on to eat more of it. Crows are starting to attack humans.

We are soon to be victims of the wild beasts that surround us, and humans will be remember as a species of useful idiots, good for retrieving fossilized carbon and not much else.",20,0,False,self,,,,,

I figured I might get some good insights from intelligent knowledgeable people from different backgrounds than myself, which might help me sharpen my thoughts, but mostly I just need to crystallize some of these ideas.

Firstly, I'm intrigued by the ongoing decay of market systems worldwide. The middle class is losing wealth at an alarming rate (-47% net worth in the American middle class since 2007) and because of this they cannot exercise the demand they have. The wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of financial institutions, ""[financialization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financialization)"" as I've heard it described recently. These institutions do not provide as much to the social good as their balance sheets indicate. They do contribute some to liquidity, and worldwide monetary movement, but the vast schemes to accumulate more and more wealth (which are being backed by governments) are parasitic rather than productive. The fact that lending/depositing institutions are not separate from the speculating/betting institutions ([repealment of Glass-Steagall in the 1990s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Act#Glass.E2.80.93Steagall_.E2.80.9Crepeal.E2.80.9D_and_the_financial_crisis)) is absolutely ridiculous. If anything shows the corrosive influence of money in the democratic process, it's this.

Secondly, we have skyrocketing world wide unemployment. Europe's in the 20%s, America's unemployment rises even as the workforce participation rate declines, and emerging markets like China are taking extreme measures to try to put everyone to work. Everyone is chasing employment as a herald of great economic times, **but why?** We could employ twice as many people if we decided that 20 hours per week was the new standard, and we could reduce overwork and societal stress at the same time. I assume many of you on this site are only actually working 20 hours per week anyway. If we decided to make 20 hours the new norm, the only thing that would change would be the removal of your body from some office that you don't want to be in anyway.

Unemployment will continue to rise due to automation in a process called [technological unemployment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment). It's inevitable, human demand can no longer grow as fast as machine efficiency. Advertising and consumerism have succeeded in increasing demand at the same rate as production capability since the 50s, but the trend is starting to slip due to the exponential nature of technological improvements. The unemployment we're seeing is permanent, and will only increase. Robots don't need vacations, insurance, breaks, etc, and they become better than humans at a new task every day. The chasing of profits by corporations is luckily fueling the move towards automation (lower cost of production, higher quality of good), which is resulting in fewer people having to work shit jobs like those in warehouses and coal mines.

When I bring this up to some, the knee-jerk reaction is that these people out of work will no longer have any purpose to their lives. ""They should be happy to lift boxes in a hot warehouse for little pay! That's their means of survival!"" In a sense they're correct, without a job they will no longer have any *economic* purpose to their lives, but who the fuck cares? Working in a sweatshop is a far cry from having a fulfilling purpose that enriches your life in any meaningful way. [In Praise of Idleness](http://libcom.org/files/Bertrand%20Russell%20-%20In%20Praise%20of%20Idleness.pdf) by Bertrand Russell made me rethink a lot of things. The essential argument is that **any market requires consumption of goods more than it requires production of goods**. This redefines ""job-creators"" as the ones who spend money, and shows that those who hoard wealth are actually job-destroyers. 

I'm coming around to the fact that someday not everyone will have to work, and I'm starting to recognize it as a good thing. How many of us actually enjoy working the jobs we have more than if we were **free** to pursue our own interests and whims. **""Freedom"" does not only mean freedom from government regulation of money,** as the talking heads would have you believe. ""Freedom"" is freedom *to*, not merely freedom *from.* (This is the concept that libertarians miss.)

We're not yet technologically at the point where none of us need to work, the economic machine still demands human time sacrifices. But I think with a concerted effort we could get there faster. There are those that say idleness will breed laziness and contempt, but we can empirically observe a population of freeloaders who completely depend on others and contribute nothing: our children. Are they lazy assholes? No, they're curious, thoughtful, happy, kind, friendly creatures. Essentially everything I want to be.",37,59,False,self,,,,,

I wanted to write say hello, let everybody know what we were up to, garner feedback and to answer any questions you may have about our editorial vision and future plans.

Since I first began formulating the idea for *The Ascender*, my intention has been to create an adaptive, modern magazine that combines powerful, investigative stories, beautiful, seamless design, and the innovative, digital technologies that can ultimately do justice to the expansive subject matter that the future dictates in an immersive, compact form. I see *The Ascender* as a futurist, general interest magazine covering all areas of human thought and cultural genre where all the stories have direct (or occasionally indirect) relationship to the imaginings or thoughts about the future. This will give us an infinite supply of incredible stories to tell and be part of our long term sustainability.  Through these in-depth, investigative narratives, *The Ascender's* mission is to gain a better understanding of the ""long view"", deeper insight into human nature, and in doing so, create a better future for ourselves, as we iterate and innovate into that future. Essentially, *The Ascender* is of the future, about the future, and for the future.  

Additionally, as as a direct, symbiotic compliment to *The Ascender* we are building a sleek, premium community where readers/members can interact with the editorial staff, get behind the scenes access, receive offers to special events, etc. called *The Ascender Insider*.  Hopefully, like [/r/Futurology] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology), the *The Insider* can become a bastion of futurist thought and ideation for many years to come. 

On that note we are running and Kickstarter campaign in support of the project, and the Kickstarter page has a many more details about *The Ascender* and where we are going. Here is the link: [The Ascender Kickstarter Campaign] (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1628571696/the-ascender-a-magazine-of-new-futurism)

Here are some other additional links that might provide some useful insight:

*A new blog post that I wrote discussing the impetus of the idea for *The Ascender*: [Becoming the Storm](http://www.theascender.org/blog/becomingthestorm) 

Anyway, thanks very much! I am very happy to join the community here and I look forward to some great discussion and feedback.

- A) That's neat but a long ways off (even if it isn't in the case of the Oculus Rift or some similar technology) 
- B) We'll all be destroyed before that happens (anything related to transhumanism/the singularity) 
- C) That's going to come to a halt eventually (accelerating trends, Moore's Law) 

Then when I see or hear about people talking about the future in general, like when they plan for their retirements or try to imagine themselves ten or twenty years later, they always imagine a future that is the same as now for all intended and purposes. Hollywood can be particularly bad at this, usually due to low budgets and a lack of creativity. 

Anyway, as people seem to be more and more intertwined with their technology and as technology begins to deeply affect our lives, take our jobs, enter our bodies etc. When will the concept of accelerating change or the singularity theory explode in public consciousness? 

Things do tend to explode, too. When I was in high school a decade ago I was teased for spending time on a computer for fun--now everyone does. Now we have them in our pockets for Christ's sake and check them frequently. 

When will we embrace the change as a culture? ",46,29,False,self,,,,,

Everyday we read about great new technologies and innovations and the possibilities they open up. What I want to do is ask you to help imagine a city and society built from scratch that takes these isolated things we read about and weaves them into a *comprehensive vision of the future*.

This will be a work in progress that I'll update to incorporate new ideas with credit given to the relevant OP. Here's what I suggest to start the thought experiment:

**PREMISE** 

- the thought experiment is similar to Plato's *The Republic*, the aim of which was to identify the nature of justice through a constructive dialogue. Our aim instead will be to imagine a society built to maximise human flourishing, founded in the full light of history and technology.

- the setting will be a post apocalyptic world where most of earth is uninhabitable and 90% of humanity is gone. But fret not! A small cadre of humans who have preserved technology and knowledge have the chance to found a new society on an isolated island (New Zealand perhaps?) 

- The reason for this dire setting is to limit the scope of our experiment to a single city or series of cities. This is perhaps as close to a blank slate as we can get for the purpose of our philosophising. 

From here I want ideas you submit to fall into a few specific categories, which you can state **in bold** at the start of your post. They are:

**Political Structure, Social Structure, Economy, Urban Planning, Education, Culture, Religion** 

As an example, perhaps you think the entire educational system should be based around something similar to Khan Academy and have some elaborate thoughts on how it should be implemented. Or maybe you think the majority of government bureaucracy should be handled by AI.

Let's hear it!

I've been reading about [renouncing one's citizenship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renunciation_of_citizenship), and stateless people like [Garry Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Davis) and [Mike Gogulski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Gogulski).

They renounced their US citizenship as a means of political protest. Others have done it to avoid conscription, nationalize in other countries, etc.

With the internet, we're becoming more and more of a global society. A group of activists in Idaho can hear all about something like the protests in Turkey and post pictures of themselves holding a big sign showing solidarity and the Turks can see that and start shouting at Erdogan that the US supports them, all in a matter of minutes. With the internet and better transportation technology we're transcending the landmasses and oceans that once kept our individual worlds relatively small. Hackers and activists are merging together to fight corruption digitally and things like Bitcoin are emerging which eliminate the need for national banking systems. 

I think that in the future, society will become global instead of national (think Futurama, sorta.) The petty differences between countries will begin to clear up as people gain better access to information technologies and become more accepting of all our individual differences. If we discover extraterrestrial life (or it discovers us/ approaches us) this will happen even faster as it seems likely that whatever ""galactic council"" exists won't accept delegates from all 196 countries here, but would rather have ""the representative of the planet locally known as Earth"".

So what I'm ultimately trying to get at is this:

There's been more or less failed attempts in the past to establish things like a world passport. I would like to band together with other redditors, futurists, hackers, activists, programmers, engineers, creators, etc. and establish an organization that would basically function as a global, catch-all, free-thinking, peaceful country without a specific landmass. The nation of the internet per se. 

It's all just ideas right now, but it'd have an official currency and language. Maybe Bitcoin and Esperanto in order to be totally neutral. No official religion because that shouldn't have jack shit to do with ""government."" We'd issue passports so people could freely travel around the world, and I suppose we'd have to have some sort of legal protection of our ""citizens."" Citizens would be free to maintain citizenship in other countries, not just ours. Maybe set up a secure online poll so citizens could vote directly on our issues. We'd probably want some sort of run-off election setup like CGPgrey explains in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=3Y3jE3B8HsE). Of course, direct democracy can have its flaws, so we'd want some sort of constitution to outline certain things. Maybe instead of saying what we want for our people in the constitution, we could outline what we don't want, that way we have a more solid basis of historical examples. We could establish aid to peoples in need, sorta like the UN does and we'd definitely support the sciences. We'd probably try to get recognized by the UN as an official country, but I think this is bigger than the UN. They should be absorbed into our nation of the world, we shouldn't be absorbed into them. As far as our views on human rights, they should basically be as liberal and open as possible. LGBTQIA rights, humanism, anti-rape, easy access to contraception and abortion, general pacifism, etc. We would definitely have a strong focus on education, but we would not now or ever have a need for a defense department for two reasons; war sucks, and as a nation comprised of free-thinking, accepting people from various traditional nations throughout the world, there's no specific target that potential enemies could attack. We might need cyber-defense, but that's actual defense, not America's idea of defense which seems to be ""attack.""

That's all I've got for now on it. Lemme know what you think and if you want to help. Start telling people about it and researching ideas. I might create a subreddit for it soon so we can easily discuss things.

**TL;DR** /u/huckingfipster wants to create a global, internet-based ""nation"" with an extensive focus on humanism and freedom and all that good stuff in order to fight the inherent problems of our current nation states.

For skyscrapers we're on the footstep of 1 km high buildings.

The stratosphere begins at something like 13 km off the ground.  The importance is that the weatherless region of the atmosphere begins there.  Several projects will possibly soon have need to use of this region through the use of tethered balloons/airships, and these include these, which are all intended for around the 20 km mark:

 - wireless internet balloons, like Google's Project Loon but not quite
 - Stratosolar, tethered PV
 - Geoengineering a la the SPICE project

I wonder, thinking about these, where exactly is technology for floating things on tethers into the statosphere?  Even though Google itself isn't talking about tethering their balloons to the ground, [other commentators are](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/googles-balloon-based-wireless-networks-may-not-be-a-crazy-idea/).  It seems that we've had 10 km tethered aerostat systems many years in the past and it didn't seem to be a problem.

Logically, the problem with buoyant lift for skyscrapers is volume and the corresponding wind force.  I [calculate](https://www.google.com/search?q=%28222%2C000+tons%29+%2F+%28416000*3+m^3%29) the density of a skyscraper to be about 100x that of air.  Lots of that weight is for structural materials that balloons could help to reduce, but we're still talking about a volume increase on the order of a factor of 100.  Aerodynamic forces could then be greater by a factor of 10.

SPICE takes an interesting approach, proposing that you could have aerofoils along the tether that produce lift when strong winds happen, which prevents bending.  Combined with some kind of 3-point ties to the ground and smart control, maybe this could be competitive with the current approach of throwing more steel at the problem.  The Hieroglyph project is already talking about [a stratosphere tower built with ordinary compressive methods](http://hieroglyph.asu.edu/project/the-tall-tower/).  I wonder if people become comfortable working with stratospheric balloons, maybe we can leapfrog a huge amount of that work in-between?",4,6,False,self,,,,,

3/ Climate change would lead to natural disasters on an unforeseen scale.


4/ There will be outbreaks of new diseases never seen before. Micro organisms would have mutated to fend off any medication.



True we might be able survive thanks to innovations in architecture, nanotechnology, biotech but we would be living in a completely different world. Only the very rich will be able to afford the luxuries we can afford today.


Yeah it sounds like any dystopian movie/ novel, but it's incredibly real. 

The people governing us are short sighted- puppets of the few global corporations who would still be able to thrive thanks to the existing economic/ financial structure that will wipe out any resistance to it through ""economic"" selection. 

It's a rant that will probably get buried. But just in case, someone out there has gotten over xbox one v/s PS4, PS10 will be born in a completely different world.

If so, then we might be able to use human developmental stages as a predictor for what the Earth will be like in the future, in some general way.

But, we'd have to identify at least some of the basic stages of the Earth's growth.  For example, do we know what the time period was for the prenatal gestation of our planet?  What would that even mean?  Is that the time between when things started being solid and when there life?  Or the time between when the planet first had life and when it finally started ""breathing"" oxygen (when plants first showed up)?

Thoughts?

Think about bacteria, how mathematically it shows that when bacteria is multiplying, it's speeding up, and that mitosis will constantly double bacteria, and if there was no stopping this, it would've filled the entire universe. However there's some factors that stop that from happening. I can only go on for as long as the environment is hospitable and there's nourishment for the bacteria.

This makes me think of the singularity. Are we so unlucky that there's likely to be a few factors that will make the idea of the singularity, advancements so fast that we'll experience more change in a day than in the entire history of mankind, so much change that we won't recognize our home from one day to the next, is there likely to be a bunch of factors that makes it an impossibility?

Promoted by science fiction writers, it has become something of an impersonal arch-villain of the universe. Fighting entropy sounds inherently noble.

Indeed the state of maximum entropy  gas at thermal equilibrium  is not too conductive to life, and indeed any living thing needs to continually expulse its entropy outwards in order to continue living. But not all decreases of entropy are good for us humans. The world of zero entropy is no paradise  it is more like Snow Queens realm of perfect crystals at absolute zero. If we want to humanize scientific concepts, we better leave entropy alone and look for something else.

**Extropy** is, etymologically, the opposite of entropy, and it has already been used to bundle together everything good that opposes entropys bad. However, the definitions quoted, for example, in [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extropianism) are all quite vague. 

I propose a new definition of extropy that is nicely symmetric to that of entropy, is more quantifiable and rich in implications. I think it deserves attention of future thinkers as an attempt to solidify the intuitive notions of ""progress"" and ""good complexity"":

In my defence, had I known this guy's credentials, I would've walked away from it entirely (as I'm lacking in relevant credentials) but considering it's Reddit I just assumed it was some guy who was talking out of his ass when the argument started. 

Anyway, he raised a lot of interesting points to counter what we'd hear on this subreddit. I was just wondering if there are any qualified people on the other end and what opinions you might be carrying. He expressly said that he will not reply to my counter arguments, so I'm left with a lot of unanswered questions. 

[Here is the comment thread. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1h2qxn/xbox_one_vs_ps4_memory_subsystems_compared/caqjkd8) Don't go after him unless you honestly think you belong in the argument, otherwise it will just seem like I'm throwing trolls over there when I'm actually just trying to get both sides on things. This is what he said (after he edited it multiple times to be less rude/condescending): 

&gt;*After graduating from Berkeley with a degree in Organic Chemistry and a cover article in the world's most established chemistry journal, I worked for the first biotech company and, with just 4 other people on my team, developed a drug that entered FDA clinical trials. I was accepted into Harvard where I got a PhD and discovered the sixth mechanism of apoptosis induction. I then worked in cardiovascular medicine and now in radiation oncology while getting my MD on full scholarship. So appreciate your recommendation but I don't need to read a book about futurism because I am one of the few people who are actively defining the future of medicine.*

&gt;*Your analogies about Moore's law have absolutely no place in medicine. Here is why:*

&gt;*Moore's law applies to computer hardware where a simple discovery can be implemented immediately for a massive increase in power. Medicine is the opposite of Moore's Law. We make amazing breakthroughs regularly but struggle to translate them in to improved clinical practice. Why? Because medicine is massively complex. Let's take a close look at what we would have to do to realize any major change in lifespan:*

&gt;*People die from many chronic diseases that all kick in at the same time. As I said before, if you cure cancer, the life extension will be small because heart disease will kill you instead. This is known fact taught in medical schools everywhere. There is plenty of data on this and it is not controversial.*

&gt;*So then what? Cure all major chronic diseases? There is no indication that we can cure even one major chronic disease, much less all chronic disease. There is no common mechanism. We don't even know basic things about the genetics of cardiovascular disease. 50% of your risk is genetic. How do I know all this? I published a GWAS paper on this exact topic.*

&gt;*Suppose you did figure out how to cure all chronic diseases. You still need to make it into a therapeutic. There are dozens of parameters you need to optimize for even the simplest drug. This process takes time. No drug has come from basic lab discovery to market in less than 10 years (any exception is a ""me too"" drug that is basically the same as an existing drug).*

&gt;*Such a massive drug project would be massively expensive. Who is paying for this type of expenditure?*

&gt;*Suppose in 10 years we have this wonder drug. By then, the irreversible patterns of chronic damage would have already taken root in your body. You cannot repair cartilage. Your heart valves would look bad, your major arteries would be scarred with plaque. You would have fewer beta cells in your pancreas. There is no process in humans to regenerate most tissues except for organs like the liver. Neurodegeneration starts early. The damage is done.*

&gt;*There is literally no way for what you are saying to be possible. Even if we did find a magic drug that cured all chronic disease, it is too late for you. Irreversible aging processes start early.*

&gt;*All of this ignores the fact that there are untreatable infectious diseases like MRSA and VRSA that are more common every day. These are becoming huge problems as well.*

&gt;*The futurist subbreddit has been feeding you absolute fantasy that has no place in the near future and probably not the midterm future. Certainly some day but I am right now looking at the work we have to do to figure out just basic things like epigenetics and I can tell, from experience, that this will take decades of work by the entire scientific community. It will not happen soon.*",0,0,False,default,,,,,

There is a lot of talk about technological unemployment on this subreddit and an equally intense conversation about solutions to diminishing consumer income. 

I thought it would be interesting to take a closer look at exactly how the mass automation scenario could/will play out. Doing so meant finding some hard statistics on current employment and looking explicitly at what those jobs involve as a measure of their susceptibility to automation. 

I think it is interesting to note that the **two largest categories also seem to be the most at risk of automation** (in terms of ease and financial incentive).

I would like to rally r/Futurology towards the task of crowd-sourcing links to articles and videos relating to technologies that could have a *definite and specific effect* on the jobs outlined above.

**Automation won't happen overnight, it will be piecemeal and targeted to specific areas of the economy first,** and by taking a hard look at the statistics, **we may be able to develop a timeline and do some scenario building**

Let's brainstorm.  ",7,7,False,self,,,,,
