It was the robotic equivalent of a kid saying ""I want cereal!"", and I felt completely fine with it.

We're really excited to officially begin the month of future discussion. For today, we don't have a specific topic. Rather, we're inviting you to ask any questions that you might have about the the future, or future studies. Many of these questions will eventually become part of the FAQ which will be created at the beginning of the month. Here are 3 of my questions that I'd like to see the community's answers to.


1. What is the purpose of studying the future?
2. Is accelerating technology a good or a bad thing for humanity?
3. What is the best way to convince others of the effects of accelerating technology?

Feel free to ask any questions, big or small, about future and future studies. I'm looking forward to seeing where this month takes us.",1,12

If this is too theoretical / speculative for this sub, feel free to request that a mod delete this submission to keep the sub on track.

We are each a little speck of animated universe: chemistry and physics, matter and energy, set in motion across time. We're dimly self-aware for brief moments from time to time. Usually we're busy reveling in our animal madness. We (the angels in the hearts of men, so to speak) can see a better way to be, but are continually led astray by our fallible animal nature. As an aside, if five billion people take baby steps towards being better people...catch my drift?  ...back to the point at hand: 
 
The notion of humans ""having souls"" is cute. Yes, let us imagine ourselves lifting away from our base animal nature: that is absolutely a noble goal for us to fix in our imaginations. ""To be a human"" means something new, certainly not an animal,  how horrifying and improper. At least, perhaps our undoing. 
 
We are a thin green scum living in a warm and shallow pool on some random planet in a fairly young universe. Yes, being dimly self-aware does occasionally mean we catch a glimpse that we are fundamentally interconnected with the rest of the universe (consisting entirely of time, space, and matter) in a way that we recognize as true, but can only crudely recreate to approximate reality for others to share as information: not yet having the correct terminology nor much knowledge means we cannot form proper opinions to entirely share of our collective situation. Give us five hundred years...if we manage to avoid devolving into mindless viruses, consuming and brutalizing everything we can crudely grasp onto.
 
We're animals. We're terribly smart for animals, very clever. We have a reasonable (but not exceptional) memory.  Memory has been established. We've evolved an innate ability to use ""language"": a very unique tool considering how flexible and adaptable our bodies and minds are. We have started forming permanent memories and have founded civilizations (as far as it is currently known, this seems to have started in the fertile crescent): we started history, the reliable passing on of knowledge in a very fixed and intentional fashion. Those are physical things we've done as animals.
 
Now, we also have a desire to understand the world (and by extension, the known universe (matter and energy interacting via the rules of physics and chemistry through time)) around us. We have quite the vivid imagination. Clever little things. We are constantly trying to make sense of things way beyond our existing knowledge, outside our ken, beyond our present ability to quantify and place into easily recongizable labled boxes. We create stories to make sense of the complex and imbue these stories with belief: I believe this to be true.  In reality, what we believe to be true is nearly universally a mental shortcut, a tidly labeled box: an approximation, regardless of our belief, based upon our personally incomplete information.  As 'human beings' at this current point in time, April 12th, April 20th?, May 6th...it is my desire to listen.  Ah hell, I got sidetracked by a fundamental need to understand...Let me go back to active listening:  Historically, our desire understand reality; our universe, time, matter, and energy; has obviously led to religion.  Believe untempered by the scientific method, wild little things.   Lately it has been expressed in a more consistent via the scientific method.
 
At various points in history, our imagination/belief and the desire to understand reality intersects in a uniquely (for us human beings) self-aware fashion. People feel a desire to improve our shared human condition. Let us build a roof over the area where we sleep. Let us build a shed to store extra grain so that we might have bread through the winter. Let us codify laws that allow complex society to interact smoothly. Let us consider ourselves and be self-aware: the historical buddha immediately springs to my mind. I suppose for people who feel interconnected with the story of Jesus, his teachings would a familiar intersection. To continue that ""higher nature"" to it's natural conclusion, I would posit that humanity can imagine their own future into being.  Yes, that's a powerful responsibilty.  Sometimes they do this intentionally. Sometimes a group of individuals work together to push through their own vision. Sometimes unstable situations collapse into chaos when pushed wildly in many directions.  Sometimes, we listen quitely to ourselves and find the thread, the present moment, the simple truth of the transient phenomenon we call ""right now"".  My description itself is but a poor approximation, as we're woefully incomplete and inadequate at describing reality at this early date...
 
Only partially related, and to repeat myself: In my mind, it seems the human desire to have a soul is a crude approximation of a desire to be a permanent component in the universe (which of course we are barely prepared for). We're afraid of dying, afraid of being the temporary little things that we are. Buddha said all things change, and letting go of our grasping allows us to experience reality without profound suffering. Jesus said that we should be better people and foster a noble vision of love into our hearts in a deeply profound way (and we'd be rewarded with eternal life in heaven (at least, that was what was passed on, who knows what he actually believed)). I suppose there have been others in the meantime who said we should be better people in various fashions and to various degrees...what does it mean to listen?My lesson is to listen.  Clairty, kindness, confidence.  Each day, more aware and slightly better than the past.  What a terrible responsibly.  What a heavy burden to bear.  I want to say this is sarcasm, and yet I cannot pull it off myself. Yet I have a desire to be something other than a brute, a mindless virus endlessly consuming the host, a cancer throbbing and multiplying to devour the bits of the universe that we can reach.  To quote poorly: ""Never forget: just believe in yourself.  Not in the you that I believe in, not in the me that you believe in, have faith in the you...that believes in you!""      ...a crude approximation from a silly (yet interesting) cartoon. 
 
I like to revisit another metaphor:  we're like children stumbling out of a dark nightmare.  Holding a guttering candle aloft, we see dark trees arise out of the mist.  So rarely do we see the forest or consider our path through it.  Ah, that was a terribly incomplete metaphor...",0,0

I do believe that space is our future. However, I think that we need to significantly advance other areas of technology before space travel can be anything other than an academic achievement. (not counting Planetary Resources, which I am extremely excited for). Can any of you tell me that you think a moon base, or large scale colonization of Mars, can come before we have significant advances in other areas of technology?

Although it destroyed a valuable part of NASA, it put the future of manned space flight in the hands of private companies. These companies are in it to make a profit, and I think that the competition between these new private companies like Virgin Galactic, etc. will spur the advancement of manned space flight. If the government didn't limit NASA's budget so much it might be a different story, but right now with the current lack of support in the space program (at least nothing compared to the 60's and 70's), I feel that private competitive space programs are the better way to go.

Personally, there are two books that have forever changed the way I think about the world.

The first was The Singularity is Near by Ray Kurzweil. This is the definitive book which outlines the power of Moores Law and the growth of exponential technology. Whatever you think of Kurzweils predictions about the singularity and things like that, this was the book that brought the discussion of the amazing power of exponential technology into somewhat mainstream dialogue. This is an absolute must read.

The second book was Abundance by Peter Diamandis. While The Singularity is Near makes outrageous claims about the future, Abundance makes inspiring claims about the present. Diamandis puts together a thoroughly convincing argument that using currently available, or very soon to be available (next ten years) technology, we can create a life of possibility for everyone on earth. He outlines a concrete, plausible plan where every person on earth has access to food, water, energy and education.

These two books are both fantastic, and similar in some ways, yet the way that they affected me contrasts one another. The Singularity is Near made me dream. It made me think about the future, imagine the limitless possibilities that could be out there. Abundance, on the other hand, made me act. It made me decide that I couldnt sit around and watch this happen, I had to get involved on the ground level. I had to actually do something.

Those are my two favorite books /r/futurism. What are yours?

A bunch of meaningless symbols gathered together to create a familiar idea. Some people find it easier to express themselves via meme. It's just like referring to artwork or a book; the idea of the book is used. For example, ""Big Brother"" from 1984 is a meme. It's over a half-century old, but it's still used. Instead of taking the time to write several paragraphs describing the police-state society with surveillance cameras, it's easier to simply say ""Big Brother"". Not only is it easier, but it carries a lot of cultural heft and can be a better medium for expression. After all, language is simply a means to translate an idea from one mind to another. Sometimes language isn't the best medium to transfer ideas. This is where memes, and art, come in.

And lets throw ourselves in the future, when Kurzweil says we'll become electronic entities living in a digital world. Do you think we'll still use something as difficult as the English language to communicate ideas? What if communication will be completely upended and dramatically changed? We will communicate in pure ideas, ones and zeros. Sure, today's GIFs and phrases probably won't be the means of communication in the future, but today's memes are the infant stages of this new form of communication. And, like babies, we're playing around with it, testing the waters and using our imagination to see how far we can take memes. So what if people share endless amounts of inane memes; let them express themselves. The future is an experiment -- let's have fun with it.

**Post-Oil** 

In a world where suddenly a billion Indians and a billion Chinese are driving cars, oil will very quickly become too expensive to obtain by any reasonable means. There are lots of alarmists who talk about this.

**Post-Antibiotics**

There's also some people who are worried about drug-resistant strains of bacteria. In a post-antibacterial world, routine surgery is no longer routine, minor cuts can lead to fatal infections, and we have to worry about things like TB and whooping cough again.

**Crop disease**

Since all our crops are becoming GM'ed, homogeneous clones, a few bad fungii or other plant diseases can mean we are out of the rice and wheat business. That sucks when you need to feed 8-9 billion people every day.

**18th Century Future**

Given these factors (and a host of others, I imagine), it seems like we're in a race. Either we hit the singularity and everything's taken care of (with or without human participation), or we run out of oil, medicine, and food, and we're thrown back to 18th Century technologies and population levels.

_The Windup Girl_ is a novel largely concerned with the transition period to a steam-powered future (where access to computers and internal combustion isn't impossible, it's just rare).

My question: are there any non-fiction papers that address this? Is there any way to tell how likely this actually is? People have been worried about peak oil, for example, since the 70s, but here we are in the '10s and drilling shale and everything seems okay for now.

I'm not just talking about far-out ideas like 'Mail Rockets', but also about more subtle 'failures' like card phones that died with the mobile phone. Of cause it can be argued that card phones didn't fail as such, but it was nevertheless a short lived technology, and they are likely to disappear completely within a few years (possibly without having recovered the production price of the phones). What I'm really looking for is ideas where our vision of future technology turned out to be wrong.

We have all the classics (that still occasionally appear in the news): flying cars, underwater cities, jetpacks, vacuum trains and Moon bases. There must be thousands so let me hear your favorite failed technology.

Another thing that spring to mind is the much heralded Segway (sure the beast is still around, but we don't have one each and it certainly didn't revolutionize transport  in fact it's a bit naff). ",15,5

I know that many  of us are waiting with baited breath for the day when human consciousness transcends the physical form and humanity takes the next step, living forever in super advanced robotic brains, striding about the Galaxy writing our names across the stars.  I have always had a little problem with the idea, and I was wondering if someone could clear it up for me.  If a person could simply download their entire lifes experiences into a computer, and they had the raw computer power to imagine anything that could possibly happen to them or anyone else for all of the foreseeable future in an instant, what would be the point of continuing on?  Why would a being that could simulate every possible permutation of every action they might take actually take those actions beyond a lingering sense of whimsy?
Some of you are going to make the clich argument for the pursuit of knowledge.  I counter that the being could in a second imagine an entire planet Earth, with a separate consciousness for each of its citizens, and run simulations for what happens with to that imagined Earth through the introduction of trillions of different variables, one at a time or all at once.
What amazing sights could exist that this being could not imagine better, and in more detail?  Why span the stars if you know from your understanding of physics what you will find around every corner?  Please keep in mind that this creature is devoid of the fleshy glands and bodily concerns that prompt gut reactions and fairly irrational needs to see things in person.  The being is pure, powerful thought, physical presence is an arbitrary thing.

Edit:  Thanks for all the comments.  I would further pose that these super beings would only be human in that they have access to human memories.  There would be nothing to stop a transcended human who had just downloaded from simply erasing all of the memories they had brought with them.  What connection would that being have to the rest of humanity anymore?

Sorry if this has already been posted here, although I find it an interesting rewatch :)

The video seems quite plausible in that we already have screens everywhere to assist us with our daily activities, therefore their continued and deeper integration is likely. What I found significant about this video, however, was the lack of qualitative difference imagined. For example, the augmented reality was quite light, if one could really even classify some of the technologies as such. Also the environmental technologies, such as the transportations and building structures, seem quite contiguous to our own time, if it was even different at all. 

But clearly the point was to focus on screen life. What do you think of its potential accuracy?",2,5

Re-reading it now, it's interesting to see what they got right and what they got wrong.  They were definitely too optimistic about hydrogen-powered cars:
&gt; By 2010, hydrogen is being processed in refinery-like plants and loaded onto cars that can go thousands of miles...

But they were spot on with most of their computing and Internet predictions:
&gt; By about 2005, high-bandwidth connections that can easily move video have become common in developed countries, and videophones finally catch on.",8,30

I clicked on it, thinking it was bullshit, and the story quite literally changed my life. So naturally, when Mr. Grossman was doing an AMA yesterday, I coulnd't help but ask him what his personal opinions on Kurzweil and the singularity were. Here's what he said.

""It's always interesting to be in the presence of somebody who is demonstrably carrying around a lot more processing power than you are. I don't agree w/ Ray on everything -- by a long shot -- but he did convince me that things will not stay as they are, and what's coming is very, very weird.""

I thought this was an excellent response. Personally I agree with Lev. I don't exactly believe everything Kurzweil says. I do believe that Kurzweil is extraordinarily intelligent, and that his idea of accelerating technology cause massive change in the world. I think that this idea is what we need to push. We don't know what's gonna happen. We just know its gonna be very, very weird.",8,28
