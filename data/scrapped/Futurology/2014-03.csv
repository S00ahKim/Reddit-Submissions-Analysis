I was thinking it was just like the movies! And I was thinking how I could do that without, you know, having a good possibility of either dying or being in prison for the rest of my life. Then I thought of virtual reality...but that's a problem because the adrenaline rush just wouldn't be the same if you *knew* you were safe and just in a virtual reality.

For instance, Call of Duty isn't the same as being out in combat in Afghanistan. So I was thinking, we'd probably want to *temporarily* induce an adrenaline rush by erasing our memory that we are in a virtual reality. Maybe we even invent fake memories, like being a CIA agent and being recruited and everything, sort of like Total Recall. 

Then, when the virtual reality simulation is over, we wake up, and remember our past life and everything, but we also remember our experience in the virtual reality and the adrenaline rush we felt, etc.. Kind of like how we watch movies, get caught up in the movie and forget about our daily lives, just thinking about the movie, and then when it's over, it rushes back to you, but you still remember how cool that movie was.

Even if I were to believe in Kurzweil's timeline I would not see the singularity until I was 54-years-old. 

I do not plan on doing anything differently because of the singularity. I might not live to see it, and it will probably come after I am done most of my working years. I suppose it would be cool to see a higher than human intelligence be created close to the end of my life, but I doubt it would have much of an effect on me if it occurs after I have retired. 

The only thing that concerns me about the singularity is the potential for human level AI. The Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford made a short video called [A little talk about the future](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnLExpkcQqM&amp;feature=c4-overview&amp;list=UU_qqMD08PFrDfPREoBEL6IQ) in which Dr Stuart Armstrong said that human level AI could mean total unemployment. Kurzweil predicts that human level AI will be available by 2029, but I think his prediction is too optimistic. AI is an extremely difficult field and I anticipate more setbacks in the future. 

If human level AI were created it would put a lot of humans in the same categories that horses found themselves in after the invention and mass production of the automobile. Even if the artificial intelligences did not have robotic bodies they could still automate a lot of white collar work. I do not think our society would deal with such an employment disruption well. Thankfully this kind of automation probably won't affect me for 15 years or more. 

I hope I get to see the intelligence explosion in my final years. That way I will get to see the artificial intellects without having to worry about becoming unemployed because of their abilities.

Many years ago people could never imagine the technology that we would have today. Things that we thought were never possible for us to do, we are now doing effortlessly everyday. If you think about the world in the many years to come, the future technology possibilities are endless. On Reddit there was many user with different ideas of what is to come and how it will improve and depress humanity. One post that was very interesting to me was posted by Rumblestiltsken: Future Prediction Project. The point of the post was to generate a set of predictions about future technology. A lot of the comments were very informative. The first point that caught my attention was the users commenting on Self-Driving Automobiles, this topic had a little controversy. As some users commented on how this could be a positive impact on technology and how people who don't have their license, are unable to drive or under the influence of alcohol could easily be transported. However, other users brought up certain negative aspects of Self-Driving automobiles, such as; how will the vehicles be insured? Who will take the blame for accidents involving self-driving cars? Who will stop passengers from damaging the vehicles' interior or leave the vehicle without paying? These are many challenges that would have to be overcome before the vehicles are ever put out in to the public. 

Another post that I came across was from Alecksandros, he wanted to have a formal discussion through Reddit on the future of employment in an increasingly automates society. What I found interesting about this post was that a lot of the information I gathered about future technology was from the comments. I learned that comments are a huge part of Reddit and you will find most of the information you are looking for by looking through comments of other users about this topic. The comments on this post worked off of each other and they came up with ideas that improve others concepts. A user, Airchompers, that worked off of Alecksandros post talked about more efficient production and lowering the cost of industries, and about the worth of human labor/intervention. He says in his post ""If humanity has blueprints for every thing and machines can fabricate and assemble/repair each part, and machines can move cheaply with their cargo, then what basic functions of life really need to be sustained?"" I found that what he's saying is true, however, from my opinion I don't know if this is actually a good thing. Maybe for the companies these machines could be positive for them, but if you think about the economy and how many people would lose their jobs over this, it is too big of a risk to have machines do all the work. 

The third post I looked at was by CrazyGentleMan, he asked a simple question: What is the Future of the Internet? This topic was very broad, it is allowing the users of Reddit to completely put their opinion in about the internet's future. The other two posts I looked at had more to say about technology and constructed the way they wanted their comments to be. The comments on CrazyGentleMan's post were a lot more brief and a little less organized than other comments on the other posts. However, the users seem to have interacted with one another more. A topic the users were commenting about was how in the future the internet would have a more sufficient ways to get information. The commenters snowballed ideas such as, to have AI's on the internet. They talked about different things that could improve like doctors and lawyers where you can tell them your problem or symptoms and it tells you what tests to get or gives you advice, costs and outcomes. Although most of the comments were brief, as a group they had many interesting ideas on the future. 

Technology in the future is going to change a great deal, there are so many positive aspect of the different possibilities technology will have to offer. Reddit has helped me make some predictions on how technology could change in the future. And also has brought to my attention many obstacles and problems that future technology will have to overcome and improve before ever being accessible. A video I found on youtube showed their prediction of how they believe future technology will look, the video was very interesting and intriguing.

One for English and another for Psychology. Luckily I can choose any topic I want. 

The only rules are that I have to choose something that is not too opinionated (ex. politics, birth control, etc.) And that I must be able to find a decent amount of scholarly articles or reputable sources to pull quotes and such from. 

Does anyone have any experience in writing a research paper on futurology related topics? 

Some of my topic ideas so far: 

1. How natural human psychology will have to be altered by advancing artificial intelligence/consciousness. 

2. With lifespans potentially exceeding 150+ years, how will we look at day to day life. (not sure how to quite word this topic idea)

3. How having a digital record of your life (via social media and the internet) will transcend history and allow accessibility into your life to your distant offspring.

If Apple closes up shop, will there be anywhere else like the Apple store?  What if Apple goes out of business?  Millions of us depend on Apple products every day to get laid!

The idea was to pick a few companies, which may be risky investments, but are working on the developments we here at futurology enjoy so much.

I have 1,000$ to invest, and I'd like to take your suggestions. I am prepared to lose it all, although I'd hope for the opposite! 

**Notes:**

 I likely won't reinvest in stocks I already own stake in.

 I'd prefer some of these be small cap stocks, so we can have some variety.

**Short List:**

FMI - Foundation Medicine: Personalized cancer treatments.

XONE - Exone: 3D printing company, larger industrial sized machines.

NUSMF - Nautilus Minerals: Underwate mineral mining, small cap play.

ROBO - Robo-Stox Glbl Robotics &amp; Automation ETF: Fund specializing in robotics.

ONVO - Organovo: 3D printing organs, currently focusing on simple tissues for testing purposes.

IBM - IBM: Watson hopeful.

QTMM - Quantum Materials Corp: Producer of Quantum Dots.

LQMT - Liquid Metal Technologies: Specializes in amorphous alloys.

ILMN - Illumina: Cheaper Genome Sequencing technology

TSL - Trina Solar Limited - Solar company

**Final List Purchases on March 3rd, 2014**

I doubled the $1000, and ended up spending a bit over $2k. [Final Buys](http://i.imgur.com/gZvgdbJ.png)

FMI **4@$35.78 = $143.12**

XONE **5@$46.24 = $231.20**

NUSMF **1000@$0.22 = $220.00**

ROBO **10@$27.45 = $274.50**

QTMM **3000@$0.07 = $210.00**

LQMT **600@$0.30 = $180.00**

ILMN **2@$178.92 = $357.84**

TSL **10@$16.62 = $166.20**

LIT **12@$14.26 = $171.12**

Total : $1953.98 + ~$90 in trade fees

The factor is the economic system doesn't produce technology systems based on altruism but on ownership profit maximization.

What this means is unless the politcal will changes, the economic system governing technology wont provide abundence without cost for people but will instead displace people because of their cost.

Unless someone changes the profit sharing equation no one will pay people to sit at home while robots work.

And no one will offer life extension or any other future benefit at prices that a non working person can afford because there is far less profit in that.

If this wasnt the case we would already have bank tellers replaced by atm's enjoying dividend funding vacations year round, and displaced auto workers traveling the highways instead of lined up for free healthcare and foodstamps.

To be build the future everyone dreams of we have to also reinvent the business dividend system .  Not socialism or central planning. Just expanding  what works to ensure that a percentage of all corporate dividends also go to society members as well as the amounts that go to the capital providers and traditional owners.

You dont have Star Trek without a reallocation of the profits of technology.

A replicator invention does you no good if you cant use it and its use is reserved for a priviledged few.


I dont know the answer but I do know it has to be as much of a rescaling of allocation of technologies benefits as Moores law.

An energetic talk condensing a range of futuristic concepts into one hour. Sometimes we need to step back and realize that telekinesis, recording memories (in mice) and videotaping our dreams and thoughts **already exist**!

A few takeaways from the talk:




* Strong AI is far off. I know we get excited about AI on this thread but he mentioned a few times how surprisingly little we have accomplished in this area. The smartest robots are as smart as cockroaches.
* Controlling avatars with our mind will be used for dangerous jobs like cleaning up radioactive waste and space travel, but also for fun.
* Future of the Internet will have emotions and memories. Someday you will send your friend the memory of your first kiss on Facebook.


* Theory on [quantifying consciousness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GS2rxROcPo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m51s). His theory suggests that consciousness is the number of feedback loops required to create a model of your position in space with relation to other organisms and time. 



He believes a thermostat has 1 unit of consciousness - it senses the temperature around it. A flower has around 10 units of consciousness - understands temperature, weather, humidity, gravity, etc.


Level 1 Consciousness: Example - reptiles. Understand position in space.


Level 2 Consciousness: Example - mammal. Understand relation to other organisms -  emotions, social hierarchy.


Level 3 Consciousness: Example - humans. Understand relation to time, ability to imagine the future.


I would love to have a discussion on his theory of quantifying consciousness. How does his theory hold up? What are some holes in his theory?

I'm going to start a tech company! It's going to revolutionize the world! In 3 years, we'll be massively data mining our billion users. We will persistently track your location. Our algorithms will understand you better than you understand yourself. Our technology will be instrumental in artificial intelligence. Bought out!? No! We will dethrone the current industry leaders!

We will be compliant with governmental overreach. Our data will be hacked. We will use IP as a weapon to stifle potential competition. We will lobby for laws that solidify our market position. We will prioritize shareholder profits over the potential negative externalities of our revolutionary technology.

Why? Because my tiny tech startup lacks the tools and the support to **prevent this from the beginning**.

**Solution**:

(1) **Legal Templates**: Pre-designed and legally vetted corporate documents and policies that tech startups can can adopt from the outset to ensure data privacy and transparent legal compliance.

(2) **Formalized Community Standards**: We are members of an extraordinarily valuable, influential, and *potentially dangerous* community. From data mining to artificial intelligence, it is incumbent upon us to voice what we expect of ourselves and what we expect of others. And that conversation needs to be taking place *now* (before certain fast moving technologies reach their next stage).

(3) **Legal Support Network**: Legal templates and community standards are very good beginnings, but when up against the deep pockets of a multinational corporation, the strategic 'go away' costs of a patent troll, or the strong arm of a government agency, a good-intentioned company has no practical legal recourse. We need a *unified legal support network* that will provide timely expertise, defend our community standards, and consistently fight back against the  current structural weakness of the status quo.

---

Yes, from patent troll defense funds and open patent pledges to DeepMind requiring Google to form an AI Ethics Board, we are seeing some minor progress. But it's not enough. We need this infrastructure in place now because the next gen tech startups that need this are being formed everyday. We need to stop expecting positive government intervention to solve these issues, and start taking proactive measures to solve them ourselves!

**This needs to happen now!**

**Help me Reddit, EFF, ACLU, Wikipedia, Mozilla, etc. -- you're my only hope!** ",0,2,False,self,,,,,

Edit: For those of you wondering the most recent prototype is WB-8, completed in 2011, and while the project has been successful and more funding has been requested the budget still remains painfully small and research proceeds at an unnecessarily slow pace. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polywell The argument here is that we should follow Bussards research strategy of a one-and-done approach rather than the Defense Departments bureaucratic approach of continuos scaling. Bussard had made it pretty clear this was a rather foolish approach that requires many small, repetitive and expensive steps and will only serve to delay the construction of a full scale reactor. We won't know for sure if the reactor will reach break even as claimed by Bussard, but every prototype thus far has offered empirical evidence to suggest that. We have many incredibly threatening technologies on the horizon as well as looming environmental catastrophe and time is incredibly precious as a result; at a measly cost of 200M dollars I cannot imagine any logical or informed argument against drastically stepping up research for this technology. Fusion could provide an enormous source of peace and stability for the world, but the world we are trying to preserve today may not exist tomorrow. Hoping this technology will come online before other technologies or developments unravel our society is not just foolish, but dangerous. Clean abundant energy should be our number one concern, not something that takes a backseat to defending against imaginary super-powers with overpriced planes that do not work for shit.

Recently, Sandisk had released to the public(for sale on Amazon and ect.), a 128 GB MicroSD memory card. Which was posted about and talked about a lot on /r/technology. Somewhat of a sister subreddit to /r/futurology. Which is pretty impressive for something that is around the size of a fingenail and could easily fit inside the human body. But I feel that there is a long way to go.

There are a lot of questions about AI or general technology much more revolutionary than a simple technology like this. General predictions are much easier to make. But I thought it would be interesting to talk about a very specific type of memory for a change. Which is a tiny piece of a much larger part of a exponential growth.

I know that MicroSD cards may not be the face of mobile memory in the future. As well, the ""cloud"" is supposedly going to continually make local storage less necessary as more companies buy and provide server storage for lower prices, and internet speeds increase and become lower in price. But I don't think that cloud storage is completely there yet, and there will always be an industry for both local or personally provided storage and storage in the hands of others on the internet.

I also think that people want a lot more than even 128 GB of storage on their mobile devices. And the sooner that storage disks reach more than 10 TB commonly, the better(rather, I would have liked it if petabyte drives became common a long time ago). Mobile markets are increasingly large and a person can only download a fraction of the apps that one may even want from services like Google Play.

People often talk about cell phones and cell phone speeds as an important measure of how technology is growing exponentially. I think that memory of mobile technology like MicroSD cards is an interesting measure, as well. Where do you see the future of this technology, for instance, by the year 2020? Again, I feel that 128 GB isn't nearly enough, for many people today. Especially if phones and tablets are to largely replace traditional cameras. There are phones today that can capture 4K video, but you can't hold much 4K video capture on a 128 GB MicroSD card, you would want several TB to record long videos. And the data plans and cloud services to be able to hold and transfer and stream such large video files online would be very expensive. And Gbps data plans and TB per year cloud plans are not affordable to the average consumer. Making local storage still very relevant.

Again, I'm interested in your thoughts on this technology, and where it will go. An estimated guess on how long it will take to reach 1TB or more, and where it will be in 2020.

* A bit of an embarassing typo I made and should have paid closer attention to. But I of course meant to say ""When will we have 1TB or greater MicroSD cards"". Technically, though, a greater than 1TB MicroSD card would be pretty great. At least by today's technological standards. ",13,20,False,self,,,,,

Our current unit of study is in regard to emergent technologies, youth culture generally and effects it has the brain and society.

Does anyone have any links to any intelligent, even-keeled video content that provides an overview of how digital technologies, emerging trends in human/computer interfacing, or even social networking has on cognitive development and/or its effects on society at large?

I have one film already that is very biased, but I plan on explaining the role of bias in rhetoric anyway. I am looking for something that does not glorify technology, but instead treats it evenhandedly, or perhaps even critically.

that number had decreased to 2,071,520. 

&gt;Assuming that the number of farms decreased according to the exponential model:

&gt; A). Find the value of k, and write an exponential function that describe the number of farms after time t, in years, where t is the number of years since 1950.

&gt;B). Estimate the number of farms in 2000, 2005, and 2010.

Which is to say: don't just downvote me, convince me why I might be wrong. ;) I really hope I am.

The reason I came to writing this is the KUKA-Boll story. I saw the ""teaser"" and like most people was quite fascinated by it. However, I wanted to know more about it and so I looked at the company website. There was nothing to be found about a real life match, instead it clearly stated that it's about a ""movie"" (=commercial) they were gonna show at the opening of their new plant in China. It wasn't hidden in any way, just one click away from the main page. Yet hundreds of comments and not a single one picked up on it. It was all about who would win and why and OMG technology.

I believe the same thing is going on in many other areas of technology today. People are in their minds far ahead of what's actually possible today.

The table tennis playing robot is maybe the worst example. I think a company like Google could pull this off in a couple of years, if they really set their mind and some ressources to it. But it's certainly not as easy as just hacking a couple of formulas in a program in a matter of weeks and then beeing able to beat a world class human player.

Some other areas where I think the same thing is going on, where people are far ahead in their minds and way too optimistic about the timeframe:

* 3D-printing
* driverless cars
* nano-technology
* the internet of things
* big data medicine
* big data everything
* longevity

to name just a few.

I'm not gonna expand my personal doubts about all of these (but I could since there are major problems in every single one of them), but I'll say it's much more complicated as most people think. I really do believe that I will see substantial progress in all of those within my lifetime, but in most cases it's very likely far more than the 5-10 years often predicted. 

I'm close to 40 years of age now and for me this is like ""talking to your computer"" and biotech and fusion reactors all over again. ""Talking to your PC"" I believe came up really big with the advent of personal PCs in the 80s. You had Knight Rider talking to his car and so on. It was always some years (5 to 10) ahead, but always just out of reach and very close to being solved. Today, 20 to 30 years later, you can talk to your PC or smartphone or xbox, but it's still not even close to what people imagined how it would be. That is to say like talking to a real person, just asking for whatever you want.

The same with biotech. The promise was that soon we'll cure cancer and in fact all illnesses and all of medicine would change in a big way very soon. Now 10-15 years have passed and while there were some advances - some drugs, some cures, some tests - it's still a small industry and the overall impact on society isn't that big.

We had some amazing developments and sometimes huge progress in some areas, but I believe the internet and smartphones made us think that we can have that kind of progress everywhere with just the same speed.

I'm not saying Moore's Law doesn't work, but it might not translate very well in other areas like medicine or driverless cars or basic research.

If pedophiles have a hunk of plastic and metal they can get sexual release from, a lot fewer of them will probably take it out on actual children. On the other hand, the whole concept is *really, really* fucking creepy and weird. I'm not entirely comfortable with it and I can't blame anybody else for not wanting to live in a world where there's even one sex robot that looks like an eight year old boy.

How would someone who wants to buy one of these things go about it? There's no way you're not going on some government watchlist the second you make an order and you definitely wouldn't want another soul to know about it. What if somebody finds it in your closet? That would pretty much ruin your life right then and there? Your career, every friend you ever made, all gone the second your secret's out. I mean sure you haven't done anything to hurt anybody, but nobody wants to be around a goddamned pedophile plain and simple, no matter how many humans they have or haven't molested.

While the interface technology is gradually getting better, this seems to be R&amp;D's biggest stumbling block.

The ego, the ""I"" is an evolutionary illusion designed to resist pain and death, among other things, and is merely a function of the brain. One of the main functions of the ego is that it never wants to be shut off. The ego is just a running program. The only real important aspects of the brain is the information(memory), and the stored programs(processes), including the ego, not the actual brain running(consciousness). So in a way we are very much like computers, just with different and much more highly complex programs running that care about the computer as a whole, and care about not being shut off. 

Why doesn't our ego program have Hypnophobia, the fear of sleep? Sleep basically shuts off the ego, something that the ego is supposed to protect against. It's because, the ego has gone through sleep so many times that it puts sleep basically on an exception list, the only exception in fact that it allows. I don't fear sleep, because I know I'm going to wake up, that's the ego program running. 

The ego program was very useful in past histories, if the computer(brain) ever stopped running, even for a second, other than in sleep, the brain, and all its information, would be gone forever. However once we have successful mind uploading, the ego program that fears being shut off is just as irrational as a standard computer with it's hard drive backed up in the cloud being shut off. 

What does this all come to, eventually, I believe that ""death"", or the stopping of consciousness, will not be any sort of problem, as long as there is a strong guarantee that the memory and programs that are currently being ran by the consciousness (just as a computer with a hard drive and memory is being run by electricity) is backed up, and (for the sake of the ego program) has a guarantee of having a consciousness re-activate the same, up to date, memory and programs in the future. This should be the case even if the memory and programs are copies of the original, similarly to a cloud saved (copied) backup of a full hard drive and OS. It does not matter if the computer is shut down, as long as there is an up to date (to the second) copy of it online. That idea should make your ego program go berserk (it makes mine go crazy), but that is just nature of the ego program doing its (soon to be outdated) job well.

So what do you think of these ideas?",26,0,False,self,,,,,

According to it, while the potential for graphene demand is staggering, in 2012 the global graphene market size hit just USD 9 million.

And here is an interesting article about Australia falling behind the graphene patent race: http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/business-it/australia-falls-behind-in-race-for-graphene-20140311-hvgvs.html

It seems like everyone is busy patenting as much graphene related inventions as they can. But no one is really close to mass producing, high quality dirt cheap graphene. And no one will actually start selling a product before that's available. And that may not be available without there being tons of demand for it first. 

So it's a chicken and egg problem. No graphene products -&gt;  not enough demand for graphene for mass production -&gt; no cheap enough graphene -&gt; No graphene products. 

And  yes, I am aware this Polish startup started manufacturing graphene recently, but look at the prices and size of what they are selling: http://www.grapheneshop.pl/en/

Today you hear a lot about the NWO (New World Order) and illuminati, depopulation agenda, fema camps, etc... And people in the conspiracy circle make some pretty ardous claims, while failing to provide the necessary data to completely back them up. 

My questions are:
1. Why do you think religious people are so against transhumanism, GMO's, gay rights, technological advancement, etc...?
2. Do you think religion in the future will die out?
3. Do you see the dichotomy between people of science and people of irrational logic growing larger?
4. How do you feel about the whole NWO thing? (Personally a one world government may be a great first step toward a type 1 civilization according to people like Michio Kaku.)
5. How can conspiracy theorists say someone like Bill Gates is a bad person for donating towards vaccines in third world countries?? (They claim is part of a depopulation agenda and satanic worship, etc..)

I used to be a firm, firm believer in the NWO and all of that, but after using logic I am beginning to see a lot of holes in these theories and holes in new age dogma as well as religious dogma. 

It just seems like these people want us to live in the stone age and not evolve and pray that God will have mercy on us for our fault of sin and not repenting lol. 

Also: Do you think man will become immortal in the next 50-100 years?

Now you are currently located in avatar A, all of your memories and processes are being constantly copied and backed up in the cloud. In order to test what ""dying"" would be like, you ""transfer"" to avatar B. Avatar A(who you currently were a second ago) is now instantly shut down without pain, and for all intents and purposes dead. You just died, in our current sense of the word. Now in almost an instant the memory, processes, even the state of the electrons in the brain, that were copied and stored in the cloud are now transferred into avatar B. To Avatar B it just seemed like teleportation from avatar A, however avatar A is now ""dead"".

Avatar B now makes some new memories, and then transfers back to avatar A. A is restored, and then after a microsecond, all of the new memories from Avatar B are now transferred into A. Avatar B has now died instantly and painlessly. After A is revived but with the new memories from Avatar B, the mind uploaded user now realizes that the notion of dying is a silly thing if your memories and processes are instantly transferred, and now does not let the ego get in the way of him happily jumping to and from multiple avatars. If there ever is doubt, you can always inhabit a previous avatar that had died to make sure that you don't really care anymore.

To be honest, it's a very zen like thing. There is no feeling in death, There is no consciousness, there is no ego, There is no fear, there is no want to keep on living, there is no want to see the future, there is no want to survive, there is no wanting for anything at all, even in the slightest, there is nothing, pure nothing. This is why we will not care in the future. As long as we live on in another state, we should be happy with instantly transferring our minds, it's something you will consciously have to do, and the instant you decide to transfer you will either go into pure nothingness and not even care about what just happened, or you will have successfully transferred into another avatar, and be very happy with the results. Again, YOU will have to decide to transfer, and once you go through with it once, I'm sure you would find no problem with it at all.

But let's try to think differently for a minute - what kinds of new jobs can be created (while hopefully offering valuable services)  ? 

I'll start: there's a story about uber for transportation [1] with a good chance to shift people from driving their cars to using it. This could create 2.3 million jobs per every 10% shift in driving patterns. (of course this is temporary until self driving cars come , but that'll probably take a long time). 

Another possibility: In the UK healthcare system, they have given some doctors jobs to nurses. The nurses do it in double time but since their salary is half of doctors - it comes to same cost, same medical quality(according to research) and double time for communicating with patients(which seems like a good thing). 

So , do you have any good ideas for job creation ?

I'll start with three simple assumptions, which I think are reasonable:

1. As general AI becomes possible, the technology will spread and be recreated many times.

2. These different recreations will have slight variations.

3. Not all variations will be intentional on the part of humans.

From these simple assumptions, we have a spawning pool for natural selection. Whatever the intended design, eventually some of these AI's will begin to expand and reproduce. These expansionist AI's will quickly occupy the computer networks to which they are connected (e.g. the Internet), displacing anything in their way; in time, all networked computers will be occupied.

Does this seem a reasonable conclusion?

I like this subreddit, seeing people discuss change. But there's a difference between visionary thinking and implicatory thinking. If there's a phrase for rose-tinted future spectacles, then it should go here.

It's not something you'd probably expect to hear from a 19 year old  typing on a desktop computer with a laptop gathering dust on one side, an Oculus Rift devkit on the other and a smartphone buzzing away in their pocket; but the future scares me. Because when I look forward, I look at the past.

I shall use this bus stop analogy I made up: 

My older sister in her teens spent time with her friends farting around the bus stop. She went home and stayed up till 4am talking to her boyfriend on the phone.

Mobiles arrived, and she spent time at the bus stop chatting with her friends that were there, and texting those that weren't. She would go home and call her new boyfriend until 4am, while texting all her friends. MSN arrives and dies between this and the next one.

Our phones starting doing more things, and I started getting more spotty. I spent time chatting with my friends at the bus stop, texting those that weren't, calling those that should be, catching  up with my sister in another city and showing my friends silly images from the internet. I then went home and messaged everyone on facebook, catched up with friends around the world, showed everyone silly pictures, and stayed up till 4am doing that and using up all our house's bandwidth.

My younger cousins aren't at the bus stop anymore. They're at home, doing all the above, whilst playing games, whilst also watching a movie.

This change is what scares me the most. Where's the disconnect? Where's the option to just stop? The up and coming generations* are going to be subject to 24/7 social pressure that we never experienced. Every move and decision they make will be documented and archived somehow, somewhere. We were campaigned to that ['digital dirt sticks'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJfw3xt4emY). It's only just around the corner that this will be severely outdated. Everything we do will stick.

Parents wonder why their kids can't just unplug. But it's obvious, the boundaries between what we experienced as two separate worlds have dissolved almost entirely. Even worse, the comments I see on news reports of [teenage suicide](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-26462809) over 'cyber-bullying' profess the same thing:

Why can't they just walk away?

Look at how you started using the internet. Some of you didn't get an email address until your first job, or when you went to university. I joined when anonymity was the watchword, for online that equalled safety. Often, it's the very same companies that ask for our every personal detail that previously preached safety online through keeping details under lock and key. Here's an unpopular opinion. Are usernames on reddit really going to last?

But that's approaching practical impossibility. I'm not butthurt because YouTube still insists I must use my G+ account, I'm saddened, because that decision wasn't [magicked out of thin air](http://youtube-global.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/youtube-new-comments.html). As much as we raged, we were still the minority in the issue. The public demands greater accessibility, and is thus required to incorporate their lives into it in a way no one really saw coming.

And now we're going to start wearing the internet on our face.

How then do we walk away?

It would be blas of me to just namedrop [Google Glass](http://www.google.co.uk/glass/start/what-it-does/) as the centrepiece to all my fears. The up and coming market of ['wearable tech'](http://mashable.com/category/wearable-tech/) is well researched by prospective players, and indicative of where we can expect to be in 2 to 3 years' time. The acid test, I believe, is whether Apple can peddle out a dedicated wrist accessory to it's zombie on a bungie cord crowd. If they can convince people to put their tech anywhere other than their pocket, then anything's possible.

This lack of disconnect from the online realm we see increasingly in the proceeding youth is going to be responsible for social trends that I refuse to believe that tech companies' happy-go-lucky focus groups have foreseen. An example would be exactly what I know my friends will do with head mounted ICT.

I went skiing with the Army in Janurary this year, and one of us had an inexpesive and tiny GoPro camera with a 2TB SD card inside. She recorded a whole day at a time in 720p at 60 fps, and uploaded at the end of the day. In the bar with a pint at the end of the day (oh, did I let slip we got beer on taxpayer money? oops...), we would watch and laugh at people faceplanting in the snow.

Imagine now, what with WiFi at pretty good speeds in city centres already (went to Paris last summer, they got [damn good wifi](http://www.paris.fr/english/english/how-to-access-the-wi-fi-free-of-charge-in-paris/rub_8118_actu_109289_port_19237)), what people will do with cameras attatched to their head. That's right, people will record their entire day, uploading it to a cloud drive as they go.

When we actually get round to meeting up with friends, we will no longer need to tell stories: we will have them with us in 1080p, cropped and ready to go. Set the specs on a table and project that cool thing we saw that day, on the wall, or even directly to everyone else's glass.

For some reason, things like this terrify me. I'm not envisioning some nightmarish scenario where we all contribute to our own intrusive government sponsored surveillance or something. I'm worried because I know my friends really well, and I know how the way we socialise as a group will change. So maybe I don't like change.

I wanted to see a movie the other day, but half the group said 'nah, we'll watch it later online'. How long until 'nah, I'm downloading it on my glass for the train journey'. I just wanna go to the f-ing cinema for once, guys.

*I feel somewhat silly saying this. Considering how many people there are now, I see 'generations' as every 3 to 5 years.

However, if you make a system where you allow families economic support to be students, this could lead to serious progress. We, armchair generals in transhumanist revolution see support for the idea of basic income and those who oppose it have better qualified employees.

If the United States went back to Eisenhower era taxation, we could have people making poverty wages while being full time students, debt free. The idea of a ""Star Trek"" universe wage system could be possible through keeping creators students as long as necessary.

Taxes pay for public education through adulthood, often subsidized through public-private partnership. This could just be an extension of that. It might not be win-win, but it could be the most feasible argument for the practice.",13,9,False,self,,,,,

Although everyone agreed that it would be best if our future was that of Star Treks, many proposed a sort of socialism as the way to get there, where people wouldn't have to work, they would just do what they loved, such as writing and art. The reason being was that technology is making everything so automated, that there would be no jobs left.

What made me chuckle is how all these futurology redditors were so idealistic, but backwards thinking. The moment we become a socialist society, is actually the moment any progress stops at all. Capitalism is the whole driving point of new technology. There will always be jobs, but these jobs will move from being mindless jobs that can be automated, to jobs that require creativity and thinking that robots can not and can never do.

In the future, if we all had a choice to do whatever we wanted, who would want to spend countless hours working on new technology, and working out all the nitty gritty details, when in the end, you wouldn't be rewarded at all for the great progress you made. You could have just went to go doodle, or make a painting, or watch TV or something. Who would maintain all the robots, who would heal the sick, who would do any hard job at all for absolutely no reward?

The real solution is capitalism. Not crony capitalism like we have now, but real capitalism. One without so many regulations that make it hard to enter a market. Capitalism pushes individuals to become entrepreneurs, who make the world a better place. Entrepreneurs are the ones who want to provide a better product or a lower price for the consumer. The government is the real evil, as lobbyists will pay off the government to stop entrepreneurs.

If you don't believe me, I dare you to go to angel.co and see what entrepreneurs are doing for the world. True capitalism is the key, socialism always sounds nice, but is never the solution.

edit:
The beauty of the free market is that companies compete on providing you the best/cheapest service. When it's hard for companies to enter the market due to regulations, such as the cable/internet market, the consumer gets screwed. But let's touch bases on another market that is more free, the electronics market. Every year we are getting better/cheaper electronics, as there are companies competing with each other for your dollar. That's why our technology has advanced so much faster than our broadband has.

My vision of true capitalism is when everyone is innovating to provide consumers with cheaper/better service and goods with minimal government regulation. Competition spurs better products/better services for people, and in the future will provide very cheap basic necessities, in which people will only have to work a few hours a month to obtain.

Automation allows companies to provide better/cheaper goods and services, and make them available to more people. For example, computers, smartphones, cars.

The problem with everyone thinking that we should become socialist after we have the technology to provide for everyone is that this technology will never ever exist if you told them that there wouldn't be money in the future.

Also, everyone's talking about Artificial Intelligence replacing humans. Who exactly is going to make this artificial intelligence if the society is socialist? That shit would be hard as hell, and there would be no reward for doing so.

edit:
I think that capitalism does have it's flaws, mainly stemming from monopolies, government intervention, and corporate lobbying, but socialism is DEFINITELY not a viable solution. For example, no one is going to spend countless hours studying and memorizing biological terms to get a medical school degree if they were rewarded the same as the guy who dropped out of school and smoked pot all day. No one would study for a test if they knew they would get the same grade as everyone else on the test. It's just not human nature. Capitalism is driven based on the flaws of human nature. Socialism believes that human nature doesn't have flaws.

I like how all the socialist on here are basically discounting the whole study of economics.

 *It is therefore of the utmost importance that those, who have any intention of deviating from the beaten roads of life, and acquiring a reputation superior to names hourly swept away by time among the refuse of fame, should add to their reason, and their spirit, the power of persisting in their purposes; acquire the art of sapping what they cannot batter, and the habit of vanquishing obstinate resistance by obstinate attacks.*

Among the current top posts are articles about how a major shift in production, labor and the state of the job is coming and how it will benefit everyone. But what if the end of the labor economy destroys us? What if the change is too fast to prepare for or transition through smoothly?

Or another change: genetically/mechanically enhanced humans. What's to stop this advancement from becoming the sole realm of the haves, a commodity to be purchased, as opposed to a right, as part of the medical right to live or as part of the fundamental right of self-expression? Will we live in a world where the haves, the enhanced, rule and exert political, social and economic power over the have-nots, the pure human who is also sub-human, or will we live in a society where people are enhanced at their leisure, regardless of social, economic or political class, and no one is thought less of, whether they are enhanced or are pure?

There don't even have to be advances; even now the future approaches with all the changes inherent to it. Debates over the surveillance state, the nature of the internet, the rights of nations to self-determine. Opinions about the fate of Israel, *one nation out of nearly/over 200*, are enough to spark argument, or even war, so why isn't the fate of humanity more openly discussed?

If my cynicism about the future seems unwarranted, consider the following: Nearly twenty years ago the Soviet Union dissolved, and the Cold War, arguably, ended. By that time, more than enough nuclear weapons had been constructed to completely destroy humanity. Even though the Cold War rivals are disarming, other nations are not. Pakistan and India, two countries with not-so-good relations, both have nuclear weapons. Israel may or may not have nuclear weapons, they have neither confirmed nor denied such an arsenal. And finally, North Korea, a state which neglects its own citizens health and well being, has been openly testing nuclear devices and rocket delivery systems, and may be foolish enough to use them if provoked.

Him: ""Will people have jobs in a post-scarcity society? No. Thats what post-scarcity means.""

Sorry, that's just impossible. Most people aren't going to give away their best work for free (even if robots did it...). Technically, the US is already post-scarcity in that we can provide all the food, energy, shelter, clothing, and basic health care (no, I'm not talking about the recently passed bill...) we need for everyone in the nation...and yet we still have money, jobs, and a need for them.

Jobs are about value exchange. The employee gives the employer his time, knowledge, experience, and production (be it a physical product or otherwise) in exchange for tangibles to make his life better.

Even if the government (or whomever) provides everything we need to live (and live well) there still will be a need for value exchange and people willing to do more to get more. The more highly valued things are, the more they will cost, etc, etc.

Jobs will always exist.

A disappearing middle-class is a bad thing in that it divides the populace even more than previously and QoL differences will necessarily provoke unrest, but I think this take on it is ... weird.

Me:  Ahh, an intelligent and insightful post from my former office mate. I feel like I should give this my best effort. Here goes: Most important point, in my opinion is ""we will still have money, jobs, and a need for them."" Yes. I agree. The article goes into hyperbole on that point. Money is necessary as a means for exchange. If people will pay for work that gives value, then people will demand money for their work that gives that value. Yes, absolutely. (edit, did not shift-enter, more incoming)

Me: Why do people work. Currently for two reasons. First is dignity. Work provides purpose to life. Without purpose, a person withers. But second, now, is that without a source of income, one is dependent on the support of family and friends to survive and not starve homeless. (more incoming)

Still Me: A basic guaranteed income would remove the second incentive to work, but not the first. With a basic income assured, people would be free to take risks with their time in order to do what is, for them, the most dignified work.

Still Me: What I think this article points out is that the balance is shifting from jobs being seen as a commodity that people demand to work seen as a commodity that corporations demand. Once that shift happens, work will be much better compensated.

Him: ""people would be free to take risks with their time in order to do what is, for them, the most dignified work""

To a certain extent this is true, but how are we to guarantee the minimum QoL people will accept? If we don't meet that standard then, yes, people are forced to do SOME job to pay for the QoL above minimum that they will accept. We can't, tautologically, provide everything for everyone.

Me: True. I suppose that 'minimum' would be defined as 'minimum amount necessary to pay rent, buy food and replace clothing in your current location based on last year's prices.' Which, granted, would probably be somewhat below what many would find 'acceptable.' Those people would feel an incentive to go out and find paying work (which would be better compensated due to the number of people who do feel that the guaranteed minimum is acceptable) in order to increase their quality of life.

Him: ""a commodity that people demand to work seen as a commodity that corporations demand""

When the need for jobs exceeds the population, things will, of course, improve. In a society with almost-free energy and food... the only possible economy (besides exporting) is a consumption-based one.

We make what people want (desire, not need...). If people don't want what we make, our economy will fail completely. Our current job situation is more of a symptom of the problem with a consumption-based economy than a specific trigger. When people stop buying what you're selling...you must find new markets, make new products, or cut people. Corporations have been choosing the last.

Me:  I should have said that 'some' people would be free to take risks with their time in order to do what is, for them, the most dignified work.

Him: And, I think that this last is exactly the problem with the middle class disappearing. These 'some' people are the upper-middle class and the elite. With their numbers dwindling (due to disappearing jobs, due to people not buying our (entirely optional) products), the number of sub-minimum-QoL-providing-jobs being worked is vastly increasing...leading to discontent and, eventually, financial problems or revolt.

Me: I feel like you misunderstand my statement based on your quote.
Proper dichotomy: 1. Jobs are a commodity provided by corporations that people demand because they need to work to avoid starvation.
2. Work is a commodity that corporations need in order to produce the products that they sell for a profit.

My point is that the need for jobs will never again exceed the population due to automation and computerization.
As far as what you are saying about the current situation being a symptom of a consumption economy, are you recommending that we attempt an economy with a 'favorable balance of trade?"" That is unsustainable globally and leads to world war.

I agree that the current trend will lead to revolt due to the reasons you mentioned. I argue that the introduction of a guaranteed basic income will destroy the necessity for the revolt.

Him: ""the problem with a consumption-based economy"" is that there is no essential demand for the products from the economy.

There is nothing, actually, forcing the economy to continue driving itself.

The number of people wanting a job to increase their QoL versus the number of jobs available that will do so is the critical factor here.

With a consumption based economy, there is no way to assure that the second number remains larger than the first (or equal). It's bigger than just computerization and automation, it has to do with the fact that our economy already produces more basic-level output than we can consume.

There is no (need for a) drive to work so that you can survive in the US. Our economy is already consumption-based. People stopped buying the products we're selling, jobs stopped existing, many people lost QoL.

Me: All true. We are in agreement. What do you think of the institution of a guaranteed basic income?
I argue that the institution of a basic income will decrease 'the number of people wanting a job to increase their QoL'. I also argue that 'the number of jobs available that will do so' is on an inevitable downward trend.

Him: ""I argue that the introduction of a guaranteed basic income will destroy the necessity for the revolt.""

That would be nice but I can't believe it.

Two problems:

- Who pays for it?
With the need for work eliminated, eventually, the income (to whomever is paying for it) will be outstripped by the popular demand for continued support. (see medicare/medicaid for a modern example. With the aging of the baby-boomer generation, the system is in serious trouble)

- What is the definition of basic income?
No matter what it is, it will not meet some person's standard for QoL. No matter what it is, it must be payable for every individual born, immigrated, or illegally entering the country. You answered this in part, but ""how does it increase to account for inflation?"", ""how does value change in the country as a result?"", ""Is it feasible to introduce a basic provision for QoL, then continue to raise that requirement as persons providing the services for that QoL raise their prices?"" are all questions that arise from a more-specific answer.

""A basic 3 bedroom dwelling with bath, electricity, nutritional requirements for 6 and clothing for same"" for instance, will change value as the basic income guarantee hits the market. The costs for such will constantly increase as the providers require more and more income to account for the rising cost of same... inflation. Normally, this is mitigated against by federal controls over investment and loan rates; however, since demand is now GUARANTEED to meet a certain level, laws would have to be passed to hold the cost of basic QoL products down...and on and on.

Still Him: ""I also argue that 'the number of jobs available that will do so' is on an inevitable downward trend.""

Consumption based economies mitigate against that by constantly producing new products that are must-have in the eyes of the consumers.

Apple isn't making money off the iPhone 2 any more. No one buys it. If it were the only product they were selling people still wouldn't buy it. A newer version was offered that increased value without drastically increasing cost to the company for production.

Similarly, if production of a product outstrips demand in an industry people will be laid off (unless a newer product is formed). Our current jobs problem is a lack of innovation in the market (there are no new ""killer"" devices/apps/etc that people want. We lack things to produce that people want.

""I argue that the institution of a basic income will decrease 'the number of people wanting a job to increase their QoL'.""

Yep, totally true. Then, the problem becomes: ""Who pays for it?"". No one is working, so where does the money come from? Those producing the basic QoL stuff will still want to be paid. With cost vastly out-stripping demand, how do you continue the program?

Welfare programs will always enter a stage where they are unsupportable. The provider (probably the federal government through taxes) has a few choices:

- Stop the program
- Reduce the cost (by lowering QoL)
- Eat the debt
- Engineer the society to get more people back to work",3,1,False,self,,,,,

Basically, I really do not see humanity being able to come together to work towards a common goal collectively, that being to a)un-fuck what we've already done, and b)move in a direction that isn't headed to the end of society and is headed to the bright and hopeful future that I don't believe can come to fruition.  Mostly, my concern lies with the ways that the governments of the world are handleing themselves and their peoples, and with infrastructure.  As I see it, the infrastructure of this world is built upon is oil.  Now, really, even though there are extrememly promising renuable energies being developed, I can not see them ever being able to replace oil.  That is, until it's too late to do anything, because the energy we need to build those windmills and solar panels come from... oil.  There will be no way to transport the pieces of those things together to construct the finished product, no way to get it to an advantageous position, no way to even build the fucking pieces in the first place.  Or even better, no way to mine the resources to build the pieces out of.  And how could it go that far? Because of the governments of the world, how they happen to be run, and how it can be manipulated by outside forces.  Because really, the oil companies have the entire world in their pockets, because the entire world depends on their continued production.  Every vehicle, every factory, every powergrid, every fucking thing.  And once their is no more oil, the oil companies are going to make the governments of the world keep the illusion of everything being fine until there isn't even a drop left, and then it will be too late.  That point will come within 100 years if something doesn't change.  And what will? I can't think of anything.  Never in human history can I think of a point when humans have planned ahead, have invested huge amounts of resources for the future.  The only time anything gets done is when we have some other humans threatening us seriously (I.e. cold war, ""space race"").  So why would humanity have any reason to do anything about this, when all they really care about is a number on a sceen.  Just please... convince me otherwise.  I want to see the future not crumble apart, I want society to continue to prosper, to thrive... but at this point I just can't see it.  EDIT:  Well shit.

What does /r/Futurology think could replace it when we run out of excuses to keep it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/20kv9d/democracy_isnt_going_to_work_for_much_longer_to/,deepsandwich,1395005270,"I'll start by discussing the reasons I feel the system is broken and what may be done eventually to repair the public faith in government.

Democracy is a beautiful idea- Give people the opportunity to vote on changes they would like to see and give some direction to the political process and policies of their nation. It seems perfect, to give power to the masses while using elected officials to carry out the orders of the people but there is a rub- Majority rule isn't always right, in fact, historically it is almost never the right way to do things. Majority rule always ends up ignoring the priorities/policies of the most educated in a society, since the most well educated individuals are a minority in every culture. We end up with a system that means well and is accepted by the majority but only because they think it gives them power, and it does... sometimes. The issue is really this- Do we want the most average people to have the most say over the direction of a country/region/planet? Do average people make the best decisions for the whole? I can't say they absolutely don't but the evidence thus far is that average people, with average lives and average intelligence don't make decisions that benefit the whole of humanity, they barely make decisions that benefit themselves in the long run. This is because we are programmed for relatively immediate gratification. Look at our energy policies- We are using methods that endanger our future because we don't want to be less comfortable in the present. That is just not an intelligent way to run a society. To be fair, capitalism plays a pretty big role in our overall bad decision making, but again, capitalism wouldn't be an issue if democracy didn't allow it to run rampant (I'm using the word capitalism in the place of crony capitalism because there is not a true capitalist economy left, so in a sense they are the same now).

I think there are solutions but they aren't pleasent and we may never get there.

1. Before we can move on from democracy we have to make it work until we have a better system. Removing money from political campaigns is a start but requiring specific educational background to sit on committees should be a no-brainer. Right now, the House science committee has a majority of members without any educational background in science. A degree in a field, at least related to the committee you sit on should be mandatory.

2. Education and free contraception. This may seem off topic but our culture will die if we can't get birth rates under control. We will literally run out of the time we need to change the system if we don't start slowing the population growth  of America/the planet. Currently Iran has a more comprehensive system than the US when it comes to family planning. Educating young women and offering free contraception will go a long way in repairing our political system in the long run.

 This is where I start to lose people, so if things made sense up until now and you were shaking your head in agreement I apologise if that comes to an end now. (I'm hoping this is the one subreddit that can get on board)

3. We need to dump a massive amount of resources into AI. Not only will this greatly improve our ability to advance technology we may eventually be able to put our resource management and policy issues in the hands of a more intelligent mind. If we can manage to build a hyper intelligent system of computers it may be able to ""Save us from ourselves"" to a point. I know, this sounds pretty sci-fi and it is but it may solve some of the problems we have with corruption and the imbalance of power that humans inherently give themselves when democratically elected. We may be able to outsource our politics, with the understanding that decisions being made are in the benefit of everyone. The argument will be made- ""What if the system decides we are the problem"" Well you make sure it isn't physically in control of anything. We don't want some Matrix or Terminator situation so you build in safety systems. I don't think that will be an issue because if we are able to build a system that thinks and feels, hopefully is will feel good about us and with some programming it will want to help us.

That's my solution, it's not great, it might even end horribly with a scorched sky and a bunch of Arnold bots, frying eggs on their tanks. How would you want us to move forward? Incentivized voting? Universal everything? The sky is the limit.",63,16,False,self,,,,,

Once other populations of the world could see the incredible benefits they would demand it.  Hell, the US Congress has an approval rating of 13%!

Very Different People:
The Ongoing Voyage toward Extraterrestrials, not Monsters
By Bryan Tebeau










This is for the young minds yet to stand on giants shoulders.  



















Be brave. Dont panic.  This is all make-believe.
The people, from Earth, love you and wont leave.
Please, dont worry.  You are here. They are there.  
We have each other, your family and friends that care.  

Your mind can make you pretend this is real.
If you become scared, express how you feel.
















Before we embark on any travel,
our minds must think with a balanced level

No matter how much your mind should soon grow,
there is boundless Multiverse yet to know.



Up, down, left, right:  Which direction is real?
Which way to take in our ship made of steel?















On this voyage we shall soon enough take,
there will be many friends we shall soon make.  

So, lets put on our very special suits,
and, please dont forget, to tie tight your boots.

Are you ready?  Buckle up!  Sit steady!
I hope you used the restroom already!

Look at the starry sky and through the clouds:
Upward, we go!  We wont soon turn around!

Now, could you count three backwards, for me please?
We will blast into outer space with ease

Three!  Two!  ONE!
          Lets go?!
                    To fly?! It is too fun!
There are these galaxies, their stars: theyre suns!

Some time has passed.  We have travelled light years.
Lets see these other suns orbiting spheres.

What different people will we soon see?
Are they the same people like you or me?


There!  Theres a person Ive never seen!
I wonder:  what could be within its genes?






Does this one person vary much very?
Well yes, by looks alone: quite contrary!















This person is very short:
She has six limbs instead of four!
What kind of person do you see?
Why is this person so much smaller than me?
















These people work like an ant colony.
Like plants, they make their own energy.  They make their own energy from their two Suns, just like plants!What kind of person do you see?
Is that person a he or she?












Instead of being just a lady or gentleman,
There are three genders within this species span.

are called lefts, mids, and rights.  




What kind of person do you see?
This person could live in our own seas!


Who is this different person you see?
Are they the same people like you or me?







Dolphins and whales are smart.  Did you know?
They lack arms and hands, but their fins help them flow.

What kind of person do you see?
To aliens, maybe that person is you or me?!




Keep on pretending, read this again:  you will float.
In our spaceship called Earth, were a boat.

No matter what person we shall meet,
Earth as an organic spaceship

Always ask and wonder all the appeal.  
How could life elsewhere be such an ordeal?
How can I express these feelings I feel?
This is make-believe, but there is the real.

Math, physics, chemistry, and biology
are some sciences to name a too few.
These fields contribute to technology,
and, do not forget, astronomy too.

Humans rule Earth through science advancement.
Our technology allows enhancements.
Our gizmos may appear to be magic.
They are just smart, placed-together plastic.

Until sometime much later, space cadet.
Be kind, and work hard to build up the sweat.

Astronauts put effort to become fit.
You can start now: stay strong and never quit!

Focus your mind both in and out of school.
It may not seem as the coolest of cools.

There are so many ways to help you learn.
Do as you can.  Your new brilliance is earned.

Learn new words through your own dictionary.
Do you know the word vocabulary?

Dont let adults discourage your insight.
Stay curious.  Ask questions.  Be polite.

It may all seem almost impossible.
Give your all the most and youll be able.

So shine on, like our sun; which is a star.
Your minds build the future and take us far.


We have knowledge, which continues to grow.
Imagine how there is so much left to know.
So long, for now!  As you grow, learn to know.

At this point, the human labour market will be drastically changed as human workers compete with robots and computer programs. Computers can run orders of magnitude faster than the human brain. Similarly, the intellectually disabled have minds that run much slower than the average person's mind. Currently, the intellectually disabled are supported by the government in the form of disability allowances. I propose that it would be a good idea to put all biological humans on the same allowance. There may be some technology to augment human capacity, or genetic engineering, but it will still probably not close the gap between humans and computers or emulations. I also think it is unethical to make someone choose between remaining biological and being able to support oneself financially. For this reason, I believe that all biological humans will be put on disability allowances in the future.

Here is an example of some reasons why I don't understand how it could work in the US.

Current US population over 18, 209,128,094
[Source](http://www.infoplease.com/us/census/data/demographic.html)

Annual cost of UBI assuming it starts when citizens turn 18, and UBI of $10,000.
 
2091280940000
or just over 2 trillion dollars.

The current US revenue budget is 2.8 trillion,
[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget) 

We are currently at 2 trillion in social programs, [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States)

Assuming increased automation will significantly reduce current employment levels how would this be feasible without a radical increase in taxes? It seems just barely workable at the current levels of employment and population, and doesn't really consider that the US is currently running a budget deficit.

As employment would decrease, how much money could be taken from each working person/corporation to support some increasing number of non-working persons?",20,15,False,self,,,,,

   01: The standard full time work week would be reduced gradually say over 20 years to an average of a 20 hour work week to decrease unemployment (by doubling the amount of workers needed).   Anything over 20 hours would be required to pay 1.5x the rate.

   1.1:  Workers could choose a weekly limit or yearly limit on hours worked.  If a yearly limit is chosen, full time would be considered  1,040 hours per year, anything over would be considered over time and require employers pay 1.5x the hourly rate.  If the yearly option is chosen by the employee, anything over 12 hours per day or 60 hours per week and/or 1,040 hrs/yr must be paid 1.5x the hourly rate.  The employer would not be allowed to mandate the yearly option be chosen.

    1.2:   Subsidies would be limited to 20 hours per week or 1,040 hours per year.  

   1.3:  Hours worked would be verified by two supervisors and the employee them self.  The penalty for falsifying information would be equal to 200 times the hourly subsidy rate for each hour falsified for each supervisor and the employee.  

   02:  Minimum wage and payroll taxes would be gradually reduced to $0 to help workers compete with automation.

   03:  The government would start subsidizing each hour any citizen works, goes to school, interns, or volunteers.

   3.1: For each dollar the minimum wage is decreased, this income subsidy would increase by the same amount. 

   3.2: Once minimum wage reaches zero, the income subsidy would continue to rise at the same rate until all citizens earn a basic income level.

   3.3: The subsidized income would apply equally to all people based on hours.  Any money earned working would be in addition to the subsidy.

   3.4: Persons unable to work because of inability to afford daycare or because of disabilities could choose to have modified work weeks as follows:

   3.4.1:  Parents of children under 5 years old
would be able to choose to do guided online or traditional child development education or online/traditional parenting classes and would be subsidized for those classes up to 10 hours per week at 1.5x the normal subsidy rate.  

They would also be allowed a subsidy to work,telecommute,do online classes, or volunteer up to 5 hours per week at the normal subsidy rate.  

Parents with prior drug or alcohol history would require random drug/alcohol testing to qualify. 

   3.4.2:   Anyone with a diagnosis of a disability from a doctor (no government assessment other then verification of documentation) would be allowed to opt for a reduced work week.  

Subsidies for work, telecommuting, online classes, or volunteering would be allowed for up to 10 hours at 2x the normal rate as long as accompanied by at least 5 hours per week of therapy.   

Therapy would include things such as physical therapy , occupational therapy, speech therapy, counseling, medical treatments, or any other therapeutic activity prescribed by a doctor. 

3.4.3:  Anyone completely unable to do any work at all or could not benefit from any therapy would be paid a basic income equal to 20 hours per week subsidy.  A licensed doctor would need to certify this annually.The penalty for falsifying this information would be equal to one year of the doctors salary.

    04:  A national retail luxury sales tax would need to be added to increase revenue.  

    4.1: Items would be taxed a percentage equal one half the percentage above the average consumer price of an item. 

For example, say the average american car is $20,000 and someone purchases a $40,000 car...that is 100% over the average price so the tax would be 50%, $20,000 and that vehicle would cost $60,000 to purchase.

   05:  Welfare, disability, and unemployment pay would be gradually phased out during this period.

   06:  College tuition would be subsidized at a rate equal to the average cost per credit hour in the US.  Tuition over that amount would need to be paid by the student. Anything under would be paid to the student.  Classes must be passed with a C or better or must be paid back.

  07:  Volunteer organizations would be expanded through a government program.

   7.1:  Any established non-profit organization would be allowed to verify volunteer hours.  All hours volunteered would need to be verified by two supervisors and the volunteer them self. The penalty for falsifying the information would be 200 times the hourly subsidy rate for each hour falsified for each supervisor and the volunteer.  Random checks by the government volunteer organization would be done to ensure work is actually being done.

        The effect of subsidizing hours contributed  would be beneficial in many ways.

- It would reduce unemployment to near zero

- It would keep people ""off the streets"".  Busy, educated people are less likely to commit crimes. It would keep people's minds active and give them a sense of accomplishment and purpose.

-Eliminates the ""race to the bottom"" problem  such as people having kids to receive welfare instead of working, or abusing the system in other similar ways without benefiting society.

-It would have all the same economic benefits as an unconditional basic income, allowing the base of the economy to continue earning enough money to feed demand for products and services. 

-It would massively redistribute wealth and close the huge and rapidly widening income disparity between the upper, middle, and lower classes.

-It would benefit society over just giving an unconditional basic income.  Whether people are working, getting educated, or volunteering, society benefits: 

A). People may decide to become career students in the subject that interest them most such as scientific research, engineering, medical research, art, music, theatre, philosophy, psychology.  Resulting in a richer, fuller society and possibly a second Age of Enlightenment.

B). Other people may decide to become lifelong volunteers, helping society in the way they choose.  Government programs would ensure there are enough volunteer jobs for every person whom wants one.

C). The traditional worker still can work, and with minimum wage gone and a subsidy for every hour worked would add value to a worker for a company.  With no payroll tax or minimum wage,  employees can compete against automation better because they could potentially be paid near zero or be unpaid interns.  Workers in skilled trades with little risk of technological unemployment would earn even more due to the subsidy, yet work half as much and would have at least twice as many full time workers due to the decreased work week.

Comments welcome, I know some will shoot this down in flames but I want to know the criticisms! 

TL;DR:  subsidy for every hour worked, educated, or volunteered.  No minimum wage, payroll tax, welfare, or unemployment.  Free college. Add luxury sales tax.

Edit: Added hourly cap if yearly option is chosen as suggested below.  Changed wording from ""compete with any machine"" to ""compete against automation better"".  ",19,21,False,self,,,,,

I wanted to get your opinions on it.

Looking at the route that technology will be going with regard to graphic displays, I see two routes. Moving away from a flat screen and replacing it with 1) a 3D projection (hologram) or 2) wearable displays that provide the user with an augmented display that creates the look and feel of a 3D object.

With the invention of things like glasses and contact lenses that can display stuff over our field of vision, what is the likelihood of holographic displays being deemed as unneeded? Will both of these pieces of technology continue to be developed or will one ultimately be deemed outdated and limiting?

I personally can see them being developed, but I see contact lens displays (and ultimately surgically implanted displays) winning out over actual holographic displays.

We can't run out of it and the more we imagine, the better we get.


As we get older, we imagine less and less to the point where most people in their 30's, 40's and especially 50's, 60's and 70's never imagine. We do not set aside time to do it and society teaches us to think logically and in the present.



Society in 10,000 years will change more than we can possibly imagine. We are cavemen in the cosmic horizon. If you showed humans 10,000 years ago smartphones and space ships, they would think you were an alien species or higher being.


Over the next 10,000 years, we may discover new laws of physics or develop technology that makes things we currently perceive as impossible, possible.


To improve our ability to imagine and break down our belief that some future technologies are impossible, let's discuss the most thought provoking, possible or impossible technology, societal structure, philosophy, anything - as long as we can't do it now.



Tonight, I'm going to a [Boston Futurist Society meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Futurist-Society/events/170336642/). We'll be doing a similar thought experiment and I'm excited to share some of our global community's greatest thoughts!

How is no one talking about this?  I looked around Reddit and couldnt find anything on this?  If theres already a thread on this, someone please link to it.

Anyway, this is a little ominous, isnt it?  This isnt some dirty hobo standing on a street corner yammering on about the anti-Christ; this is NASA.  These are some of the best and brightest scientists in the world saying this.  

I think its important to note that they DIDNT say the world is coming to an end; they said the system is going to collapse, as well it should.  Its not sustainable.  Thats why its collapsing.  I think we will transition into a new system, but the transition is likely to be rough.  The study points out that all empires fall, but I think were in a better position to recover from that fall than people were in any previous collapse.  We know a lot more than they did.  We have the tools and the knowledge to rebuild.  

The study cites income inequality and the depletion and mismanagement of resources as our downfall, so it seems obvious to me that the new paradigm, whatever it is, must be more responsible.  We already have the technology to solve our resource problems; were just not taking advantage of it because too many people are making too much money exploiting our resources under the current paradigm.  Solving income inequality is another matter, but I trust that once the old system collapses, we as a species can work out a new and better system that does away with that problem.

Im not too worried about our ability to bounce back.  Im more concerned with our ability to deal with climate change until we do.  I remain naively confident that technology can help us find a way to either adapt to our new climate or reverse the problem.  We have no other choice.  However, if the world undergoes a catastrophic system failure that sets us back a century or two, we could be screwed before we have a chance to save ourselves.

Another thing Im a little worried about  if I may get a bit conspiratorial, here  is that the people who make a killing off the current system will find some way to capitalize on this collapse and continue with their dastardly shenanigans in the new system.   

So, how about you?  Any thoughts?

It's a very young technology, and all the implications, effects, side effects, and limits aren't known. What is known that those who have experienced it are still recognizably human, have no overt ""Borg""-like attachments, can go in and come out of the link at will, can fully experience all the sensations, thoughts, remembered memories, and learn from the knowledge of the people they link with, though only while linked.

The country/culture is the important bit, there. I'm trying to find a group that I could somewhat reliably claim might embrace this technology. I have a few ideas, but I'd like to get plenty of US and especially NON-US resident opinions.

Unfortunately, not all therapies can be protected by patents (e.g. unpatentable and unmonopolisable therapies). Would prizes for clinical trials help fill the gap?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/20z7ca/we_pay_hundreds_of_billions_of_dollars_a_year_to/,MedicalPrize,1395384524,"I am conducting a thesis on gaps in the patent system for medical research. In particular, there are no private incentives to develop 'unpatentable therapies' and 'unmonopolisable therapies, which are therapies with potentially high social value which lack private incentives for development as they cannot be exploited using patents. The problem of unpatentable therapies can be solved [by providing extended regulatory exclusivity](http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/10611775/Unpatentable%20Drugs%20and%20the%20Standards%20of%20Patentability%20-%202009.pdf?sequence=1) as proposed by the [MODDERN Cures Act Bill currently before US Congress](http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3116). However, extended patent/regulatory exclusivity cannot solve the problem of unmonopolisable therapies. Examples include second indications for cheap generic drugs or drug combinations for which patent/regulatory exclusivity cannot prevent off-label use by doctors or patients. For the same reason, patent/regulatory exclusivity cannot be used practically to enforce monopoly prices for diets, dietary supplements, lifestyle interventions, surgical methods, natural remedies, and many complementary and alternative medicines. Unmonopolisable therapies fall within a broader subset of unprofitable therapies which include therapies for neglected/third world diseases, as an innovator company could not recover enough money from the market to justify significant R&amp;D investment, even if they had patent protection. 

The inability to enforce property rights over a medical therapy has no correlation to its medical value, therefore, arguably, there is an irrational systemic bias towards monopolisable therapies which are becoming more expensive to produce over time, at the expense of unmonopolisable therapies.' This is a major problem. 

I propose using prizes for clinical trials to incentivise clinical trials 'unmonopolisable therapies' within a particular disease subset. 

The prize fund will be implemented as follows:

1. Donors pledge money towards an incentive prize fund;

2. Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of at least 100 patients showing clinical efficacy of an unmonopolisable/unprofitable therapy for a particular disease are registered with the prize fund for 5 years; and

3. Prize panel allocates rewards to the registered RCTs proportional to clinical impact in 5 annual instalments.

As donors only pay for successful RCTs, the risk of RCT failure is shifted to the market. RCTs of unmonopolisable therapies cost US$1-2 million, therefore, an annual US$2 million prize fund can provide a viable ROI. With payment of fixed annual rewards, the mechanism (based on the Health Impact Fund proposed by Incentives for Global Health) is self-correcting, as the registration of additional RCTs will decrease the amount of likely rewards and vice-versa. This means sponsors of RCTs are not under or overcompensated. The larger the prize, the greater the incentives to fund RCTs. Notably, the prize does not pay for failed RCTs, which still comprise highly valuable information.

Prize rewards will allocated by the prize panel according to incremental clinical impact vs usual care. For example, a registered RCT may show that an unmonopolisable therapy lowers a certain negative clinical outcome by 150% points over usual care on average and another RCT shows a reduction of 100% and another RCT shows a reduction of 70%. In that case, the $2m annual rewards will be allocated in a ratio of 150/100/70 for that year (with RCTs eligible to receive rewards for 5 years in total). Notably, each of these registered RCTs show an improvement over usual care and therefore represent a clinical breakthrough for patients.

**TL:DR** There are major gaps in the patent system for incentivising socially valuable therapies for unmet medical needs which can't be protected by patents. Regulatory exclusivity and prizes for clinical trials could help fill this gap. ",10,21,False,self,,,,,

IBM already has Watson, which can understand human language very well, but its ability to communicate language back is still very robotic and jarring. For firms to be able to develop software that can react and emote in a deceivingly human-like way it seems like they will need a large swath of example data of many different types of people. So let your conspiracy theorist side breath a little - is there any chance the government is working on advancing AI?  With social media becoming such a huge factor in the organizing of revolts across the world, it seems like it would be in the CIA's interest to have an ability to control the conversation in some of these countries.

This would provide an escape for the entire human race to spend their free time indulging in whatever fantasies they want to pursue. We don't need better and better tech through playing by the rules of our reality and painstakingly manipulating matter. We need to create a reality we have full creative control over and let imagination take its course. Subsequently material goods will lose most all value and only the essential issues like food, healthcare, and energy will become of importance. It is a logical milestone in the evolution of our species (valuing limitless data instead of finite resources) to accomplish and should be pursued earnestly.

People posted about innovations and the incredible technology which could improve all of our lives in the future.  There was a real sense of optimism about the future, something lacking from so many other parts of reddit or indeed public discourse in general.  Indeed the situation was so hopeful that those who believed in a dystopian future founded their own subreddit (/r/darkfuturology) in protest.  Even though I only lurked and visited once in a while, it was always incredibly life-affirming to know that we *were* advancing, we *were* moving forward, and in all likelihood we *did* have a bright future ahead of us.

Recently, however, this sub has gone from making me feel optimistic, to making me far more worried about the future.   Dealing with issues like automation and rising inequality is an important part of the future, but the inherent cynicism that has been creeping into this sub lately is, in my opinion, dragging down the quality of the discussion, and the atmosphere of the whole place.

Comments that contained doomsaying like ""the system will collapse"", ""we will need a complete revolution"", ""the rich will make us starve and die"", ""automation will lead to feudalism"", ""we are about to head into 1984/dystopia/brave new world"" etc.. were once downvoted and ridiculed.  It is a shame that now these things are taken as gospel, and those who have a more hopeful perspective that our future may not be as radical, revolutionary or extreme as these people say are dismissed.   Recent posts on increasing levels of automation, for example, have allowed no opposition views whatsoever, and have descended into an orgy of people upvoting ever more dystopian visions of a future in which half the population will be unemployed in 15 years while we rot in some kind of feudalistic corporate nightmare state.  As I said, I've just lurked here for a while, but that's my impression.

I can imagine given the capabilities, we'd like to give ourselves higher refresh rates and the ability to see more of the spectrum. This however, may ruin the way the world looks together. Suddenly monitors may look jagged and glitchy, things we once thought looked pretty and went well together may look hideous and even worse, we may not be able to differentiate the important information from extra light, in fact making things impossible to see.

I am very concerned about the future. I think AI robots are a terrible path for us to go down honestly. What is the likelihood of fully AI robots taking all of our jobs/being our bosses? Don't get me wrong, I like technology to an extent (computers and phones, medical technology), but AI robots, no way. Manufacturing jobs with robots to help with menial tasks is one thing but I like what I do for a living, I want to make a career out of it. I don't want to see a robot in my place...ever. I don't even want to see it working with me for that matter. I will always want my human counterparts working alongside me. Don't even get me started on ""robot rights"" that seems like a nightmare in itself.

I think robots taking any more jobs would be detrimental to humans. I mean people can't do basic tasks or have basic knowledge anymore even today due to some advances in technology. Some people don't have a clue where they get their food from besides the supermarket or how they would hunt or farm if that need be. People are somewhat clueless thanks to some technology. People think that basic income will solve everything, I think even that will be detrimental to society. Basic income, while some will find other things productive to do, most won't. Lots of people being bored. Even I do not know what I would do, I have no extra interests or hobbies, I would sit around bored. I fear basic income will also actually cause crime levels to rise because people will always want more and more, especially through the easy ways (crime).

To me the future looks bad. If full AI robots come about in my lifetime, I will definitely look for a community without them.

I don't generally pay much attention to it as this has been being said for years and Moore's Law is still on track (the CEO of Intel came on reddit recently and claimed they're going to stay on track no matter what).


Suppose the sceptics were right, though? Hypothetically speaking, what if Moore's Law were to come to a halt, at least temporary, within the next 3-5 years while R&amp;D around the world scrambled to find alternatives to silicon transistors. I'm not sure why it would suddenly come to a halt; maybe we'd just reach the limitation of how small transistors could be within the 5-10nm range. Who knows.


*In any case, if Moore's Law were to reach it's end given our current level of progress, how far do you think we'd get with just a few more doublings in processing power and an added emphasis on software optimization/ingenuity?*


On the positive side:


- I'm a VR nerd so I know that no matter what happens, with the recent advances in VR hardware and a few more doublings of processing power coupled with the newest generation of GPUs, *very decent* VR will be possible even if Moore's Law were to come to an end in five years. We're almost already there. Within five years we will have 2-4k (per eye) resolutions, environments with higher fidelity than the best looking games of today running at 120fps on 120hz screens taking advantage of things like haptics and fancy input schemes that haven't even been invented yet. All of these things are already on the horizon in VR so even if we do hit a brick wall in terms of processing power, VR is still bound to become a global pastime for a lot of people and highly detailed/interactive VR worlds will definitely become a thing.


- We may not get true AI but we'll definitely get a lot of interesting Weak AI applications. We'll have the personal assistants and all the potential job loss we've discussed as Weak AI could do pretty much everything except for jobs that required human insight/creativity. We'll still be able to make great use of big data with increasingly intelligent algorithms though we'll eventually hit a brick wall due to limitations in processing power.


- I'd imagine robotics would get really far. Autonomous vehicles, robots with advanced vision systems that could understand the environment around them and interact with them. 


On the negative side:


- Nanotechnology would be stunted as limits to how much we could miniaturize would be set.


- We'd never have Strong AI in real time, at least not without a massive supercomputer. It wouldn't trickle down to everyone, at least.


- AR would never amount to much as it requires more processing power than would be available. It would exist of course; just not in the amazing ways promised by science fiction.


- I'm guessing that Moore's Law suddenly ending would negative impact the economy in a lot of ways. I'm no economist though. On the flip side, it might be good for the environment: a smartphone could be built to last for thirty years and only ever require software updates.


**TL;DR What does everyone else think? With a couple more doublings of Moore's Law, how far could we possibly go? Since we've made it this far I'm pretty optimistic that our lives would still be significantly better as we're already poised to do amazing things with our current level of technology once software catches up and is able to take full advantage of the hardware it's built on.**",43,41,False,self,,,,,

Half of the replies I received to the first thread quoted the typical Kurzweilian mantras that have sustained many followers of /r/futurology for a long time. The other half posted what I'd equate as proof that Moore's Law is at death's door. Who to believe? 

**In one corner, we have (to quote one person whom I think summarizes one side of the debate):**

&gt;The Law of Accelerating Returns was happening before Moore's law. He just saw it in a specific thing. Computer Tech has stayed on a solid climb through all major events like the world wars and the great depression. Moore's Law will end in that field and will create an S-curve while the next paradigm picks up. There's no end anytime soon in the Law of Accelerating Returns.

**And in the other corner:** 

&gt;The laws of physics are quite clear here. We only have a few die shrinks left before the transistors become 1 or 2 atoms thick. After that no amount of wishful thinking will keep Moore's Law going... Quantum or Molecular computing may provide another avenue for performance/Watt to double every 2 years, but its its highly unlikely these technologies will mature in time to provide a smooth transition.*

In this episode, Alex and Jason were joined by Tom (moderator Ion-Tom) to talk about his time at the Seattle Futurist meetup.  For those of you following nuclear fusion, this will be interesting.  As far as the top links go, here they are in order.  We took out a story about UBI (universal basic income) due to the fact that we'd like to have a full debate without the same old circle jerk.  We need one volunteer to represent the pros of UBI and one who is against it.  On the next podcast we'll hopefully get some solid points from each side.

I am writing to you today to plead for immortality, and tell you it is possible.

At the moment there is still the belief that immortality is impossible for us to achieve. There's not enough information out there. It can't be done.

Think however about how the body works, really deep down. Essentially your body is copying itself, your cells multiply and with this copying comes errors. These errors build up over time which damages our bodies and eventually enough of these errors build up and your body can't cope. It shuts down.

All we need to do then is figure out why the copy mechanism is broken and fix it right? We can do this with technology currently, but eventually we should be able to become biologically immortal too. Who's in control of your body? You are, motherfucker.

How do we get good at things? We learn all we can about them, then practice doing them until we're incredible at doing the thing. We could do things like make really tiny machines and get them to check what our bodies are doing, and report it back to our brain. The machine can then fix the error, but we know the body is doing it. The more information we have about how things work, the more we can simulate this in our heads. The more we can do that, the more we can work out what's going to happen so we can control all of the factors.

I hope I've bought forward a good argument on how to do this. I've been thinking about this for 27 years, since I came into this amazing world. We can all do this. If we do, then we have more time to work out how to be the best humans we can be.

Cheers,

Matt Yianakis

I'm sure this question gets asked every day and I intend to look through past posts shortly, however I would like to rephrase the question above. Are there any search terms that I can use to distinguish between all future technologies and those that are actually on the cusp of being implemented as a working product within the world we live in today? For example, autonomous vehicles are much closer to implementation than say fusion power.

I'm interested in the subject and I'd like to write my MA dissertation on something having to do with security policy and future tech so I am doing some preliminary research to see how feasible this would be. Plus I like the subject matter and want to learn more about it. :)

A government is formed by the consent of the governed to fulfill certain fundamental goals. Ideally, I think we would all agree that a good quality of life, economic success, safety, freedom, etc. would be some of the goals of such a government.  
  
The question we should ask then is this: So long as our means are peaceful and democratic, why should the means matter? I think it shouldn't matter it all. All that matters if whether a set of policies can achieve the goals desired by the public.  
  
Take communism and capitalism as placeholder examples for contrasting ideologies. It's clear that if, hypothetically, both a communist government and a capitalist government could both achieve the same identical ends with the same evolutionary path, that the two would both be acceptable choices. If an ideology, let's say communism, fails to do achieve the goal, then it should be dropped.  
  
The problem is that most ideologies and ideologues are not pragmatic in pursuit of their goals and our driven by irrational drives. Ideologues have a tendency to be intransigent and inflexible even in the face of negative consequences (e.g. economic decline and the Soviet Union).  
  
It seems to me that the virtuous government would be one that cared so greatly about the well being of its citizens that it would put aside ideology to obtain the best of all possible results for its citizens. This sort of patriotism dedicated to the well being of citizens is important. Most parties are built for a particular base with a particular set of means that are acceptable. A truly pragmatic and concerned government should be open to all reasonable alternatives and should measure them by objective standards.  
  
That is, for me at least, the reasons why I would support a pragmatic sort of technocracy. ",31,35,False,self,,,,,

What do you think?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/21guo6/cleaning_up_oil_spills_using_foam_what_do_you/,Ornlu_Wolfjarl,1395883207,"Sorry for the long text, unfortunately, THIS IS the tl;dr version.

So a couple days ago, me and a friend were discussing about environmental pollution containment methods (we are biologists, it's perfectly normal for us to do this discussions... I think). I remembered a professor I had when I was an undergrad who had told us about his research on using foam to contain and clean up oil spills.

The basic idea is that foam is a medium that can retain all 3 chemical states, it is part liquid, part gas and if you wish, you can add solid to it as well. For example, a few pinches of dust could be either dissolved in the liquid part or be trapped in the gas (bubbles) part. So you add to the foam bacteria that can degrade oil (i.e. that can utilize big hydrocarbons as a source for energy). You then deploy the foam in the ocean for example, where there has been an oil spill, or on land. If in the ocean, some form of bigger containment mechanism needs to be devised, to ensure that the foam won't disperse in the ocean too quickly. So the bubbles in the foam will trap oil in them, since oil is hydrophobic and hence will avoid the liquid part of the foam. On the surface of the bubbles, the contained bacteria will start metabolizing the oil. Since most of the oil will be in the foam, you can scoop up the foam and transfer it in an incubation tank to allow the bacteria to do their work, while any toxic product they produce (mostly, methane gas) can be harvested for future use. This also means, that not only you don't just leave the foam there and leave (which could disturb the environment even more if you do), but you can deploy as much foam as is needed to completely clean up the spill then and there.

If you are interested, here's the paper:

I haven't noticed this argument put forward very much, but I'd like to make it here. 


First off, the entire basis behind the idea that it could only be a good thing regardless of the direction taken is that Facebook is the gigantic social media platform. This means that virtual reality technology is being pushed into the spotlight for hundreds of millions more people than it otherwise would have been, due to both the sheer volume of people using Facebook and the news reports putting a spotlight on the acquisition and the technology behind it. This can only be good.


This technology which was already on the fast track to mainstreaming with gamers is going to be charging forth to the mainstream with the general public. This means all kinds of new uses for the technology will be invented much sooner and faster development as well.


In addition to this, it also means more competition. So in the case of everyone's darkest nightmare, that Facebook doesn't just take a backseat and they do fully integrate it with Oculus and bastardize it into an unusable social media cesspit, that's okay! There will be competitors, you can use those products instead. Though, it doesn't do much for the feelings of betrayal of the Kickstarter backers and fans of Oculus.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As I'm sure you've already read, earlier this week Facebook acquired Oculus Virtual Reality for $2 billion.

 This is a huge deal... and here's why:

 Brief Company Timeline:

 - August 2012 - Oculus Rift raises $2.5M on Kickstarter

 - June 2013 - Oculus Rift raises $16M in venture capital

 - December 2013 - Oculus Rift raises another $75M, led by Marc Andreessen

 - March 2014 - Facebook buys Oculus VR for $2B.

The CEO of Oculus went from:
""I've got an idea"" -- to -- 
""I run a $2 Billion company"" 
...in under 18 months. Ouch!

A few more impressive numbers:
 The CEO (Palmer Luckey) is a 20-year-old college dropout 
 The company had only 50 employees at the time of its $2B exit
 This is one of the more striking examples of exponential growth as of late, and hits on many of the lessons we're learning about at the Abundance 360 Summit.

Let's break down why this is so incredible.

**Crowdfunding** - As we've discussed, crowdfunding can help you secure your seed investment (which for Oculus was $2.5M) by validating your market and fit. Then, with the momentum you build, you can raise venture capital. In this case, that meant $95M... This deal substantiates the claim that the value of crowdfunding is so much more than just the money raised during the campaign. Oculus VR received incredible market validation and curated a massive network of passionate developers to push the technology (and business) forward.

 **The User Interface Moment** - As we discussed at Abundance 360, the key to monitoring exponential technologies is looking for User Interface moments, which herald something big. Very big... (If you are unfamiliar with the term ""User interface moment,"" think back to the Mosaic Web Browser created by Marc Andreessen. It was the moment when ""the web"" became useful to the world).
Breakthroughs Coming from a Novice - There have been MANY attempts to bring virtual reality headsets to mainstream audiences, and hundreds of millions have been spent in the process. This breakthrough didn't come from an expert (who normally can tell you what can't be done) but from a passionate novice who didn't know what couldn't be done. So, it would only make sense that Marc Andreessen was the lead investor in Oculus VR - a veteran in spotting the true ""user interface moment"" and capitalizing on timing.

**Exponential Organizations** - The story of Oculus VR is another incredible validation of the power of Exponential Organizations. Like the examples of Exponential Organizations before it, Instagram, AirBnB and WhatsApp, this story has all the pieces of the exponential organization puzzle: A Massively Transformative Purpose (MTP), a small team, use of exponential technologies, use of the Crowd &amp; Community, etc.

**Passion Trumps All** - How can a 20-year-old USC dropout succeed where experts of the past have failed? Passion. This story should inspire everyone to pursue his or her passions. Palmer Luckey, the founder and creator of Oculus VR, had but one goal: make video games even better than they already were. Once Palmer realized he could use virtual reality to fulfill his dream, he did everything in his power to make it come true. Luckey's approach to this was simple: ""Use virtual reality to make me love something more than I already do."" You need to build things with a purpose. Pursue things with a fiery passion that gets you out of bed in the morning. Don't just go build something for the sake of building something.

 I hope you find this useful. I wanted to bring to life some of the critical lessons we studied together at the Abundance 360 Summit so you can remind yourself how to apply them in your own startup or business.

 At the next Abundance 360 Summit, I plan on diving even further into virtual reality and the huge boom it could create across all industries. The potential impact it will have on the cost of business, travel, real estate, etc. is enormous. I hope to see you there.

 Best wishes,

 Peter

 My MTP is: ""To empower entrepreneurs to create extraordinary wealth while creating a world of Abundance."" (What's yours?)

For those who haven't read it, its an interesting story on approaches for the development of AI, and what relationships AIs will have with humans (legal rights, independence, etc.) It follows one particular group of programmers who create an AI who behaves like a young child, and evolves like a young child.

In the authors notes Chiang says that his personal belief is that we can keep making AIs which are increasingly specialized and proficient, but in order to create versatile AIs, and AIs that can exist in the world and we can interact with, they need to have some sort of emotion, and there needs to be a corresponding evolution of said emotion (it can't just be prepackaged).

Does this argument hold any merit? I don't personally believe that AIs will require emotion to have the kind of versatility or interaction that we would expect out of a fully fledged AI, and I don't think theres anything stopping someone from instantiating an AI that is already preprogrammed to behave in such a way.

The most prominent examples are for sure Netflix and Spotify, the first one giving access to movies and tv shows and the second one to music. Now since streaming has become more and more popular I have wondered whether the buyable medium, such as the CD or the DVD / Blu Ray, will still exist or vanish in the future. I think it's quite difficult to say because first there are two kinds of people, those who will be satisfied with just streaming a medium and those who actually want to own it, and second because the companies have still to be profitable and if they for example sell the streaming rights for there movies to Netflix without receiving any other income, not counting merchandising, then I kind of doubt that producing high value tv series would still be profitable.

This leads to a creation of a massive robotic workforce that works for subsistence level wages. Human level AI may be created some other way, but when it is developed it will be put to economic use. This could happen between now and 2050, and almost certainly before 2100. Ray Kurzweil thinks it will happen by 2029. Many people cite past failed predictions as a reason to not believe any predictions, but the past era of AI was before computers had the raw MIPS of the human brain. 

[When will computer hardware match the human brain?](http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm)

Robin Hanson says that humans will end up being like retirees, but does not elaborate on what this would mean. He says that humans would have to own assets to have income. I think there will be many humans without assets if this happens, leading to mass poverty without invention. I propose that machine labour be taxed and redistributed to non-enhanced humans since non-enhanced humans will be totally unable to compete. This would be a form of basic income. 

What do you think is going to have to happen when human labour becomes noncompetitive? What should we do to prevent human suffering when it does happen? This may not occur for many decades, if not a century, but we will have to deal with it eventually. ",27,8,False,self,,,,,

I've been trying to find some input for the game, and I feel like this is the best place to place my question.

Some back ground information:
TL;DNR version: Some AI is taking over the world.

Long Version: 
I'll start this off by paraphrasing one of my favorite people on the internet, mr. Burnie Burns ""Eventually, the proliferation of technology has got to stop, because if it doesn't, we're going to kill ourselves.""

My game--which at the current moment is still heavily in alpha--deals with this and a couple other things. The current goal of the game is to see how people will decide to fuck up their world. The only current functioning ""end world scenario"" [EWS from here on out], is Artificial Intelligence gone Rampant. 

Now, i'm trying to figure out--as i've stated above--exactly how difficult it would be to control it. By this I mean; do you think that humans would be able to stop an AI at all? How quickly do you think it would ""Spread""/""Infect"" after its... birth (for lack of a better term).

Right now it's infection rate is something like (X*.25)/2... X equals the number of worlds infected at the current moment. I'm still tweaking this forumula, and i've recently added a less-stable but more lethal version of the AI that infects faster but essentially unravels itself within a couple hours.

anyway... i'm rambling.",28,14,False,self,,,,,
