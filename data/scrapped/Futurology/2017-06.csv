However I believe unmanned tanks are the future for tank warfare, and was wondering why one couldn't use VR to remotely control tanks.

Take a tank, put camera's all around it, and feed that video link to a nearby APC where a number of soldiers use VR headsets that allow them to have excellent all round visibility without exposing themselves to danger.

This would allow one soldier to focus on driving, one on every machine gun, one on the cannon, one to keep a general overview... and as many as you want to just act as a lookout. That's because everyone can use the same video feed from the tank to look in every direction, once the signal arrives at the control post it can be duplicated as much as you like without the need for more data feeds.

This would also allow to easily swap out soldier to control the tank, and for commanders to have a good idea of what is going on because they get to see the same thing their soldiers are seeing. Hell you could have generals directly taking control of tanks if need be.

In advanced warfare you'd need to keep the operator APC close to the tank, so you can have a short data link chain that's hard to detect or disturb. But against say insurgent enemies, who generally lack the advanced equipment to detect and jam such signals, the data link would be effectively invulnerable, and could be as long as you want. In effect Trump could directly control a tank in ISIS territory from the White House.

An unmanned tank could be to the ground forces what modern combat drones are to the air forces, a cheap and effect weapon against low tier enemies, that doesn't expose soldiers to harm.",0,3,False,self,,,,,

Here is a fact. Population is growing exponentially. This can impossibly continue. So it will end. 

But how? There are a few scenarious. People just close their eyes, keep producing children and health care is getting more efficient. This is the most likely scenario. This will lead to a supervirus that will kill off most or all of humans. Less likely scenario is birth control gets more effective and popular. Then the problem will be smoothly solved without nobody ever noticing there ever was a big problem around that was threatening humankind. This scenario is less likely though. Since especially women desperately want to give birth to children by our biological hardware wiring. To go around that will be very difficult. With too many people there is also the very likely possibility of a third war breaking out in one of the less stable nations and quickly escalation dragging in all of the world, killing off most of the humans. Finally there is the possibilty that sex drive is disappearing, leading to sudden extinction of humankind within just one generation. Or another supervirus or genetic mutation happens for all humans at once, that makes all of us infertile. Such a thing may happen as food gets less nutricious in the future, due to overpopulation and overconsumption of resources on this planet. Most likely there will be a sudden change killing off most of humans. A smooth solution to this problem is unlikely. Look at the sky. Airplane after airplane is traversing the sky. Nobody wants to go back to the period when airplanes did not exist. Nobody wants to give up a convenience we have gained. This fact is likely going to spoil our planet causing mass extinction of humans. Thus a natural disaster could be another mechanism killing off most of humans. 

Is there no hope for a brighter future? Actually I don't think there is any hope given the fact that people are egoistic and convenient. Also, if civilizations could proceed past this barrier, we would have met them. They would have contacted us from other planets by radiowaves. The fact that nobody has contacted us, is clear evidence that once industial revolution happens, any civilzation can survive only a very short time. So short that it is statistically insignifacant compared to the age of a typical habitable planet in our universe. So short that the likelyhood that such an industialized civilazation will exist at the same time as ours at some other planet, is negligible small. That is the onle way we can explain the lack of signals from other civilizations in our universe. 

In fact, we moved from thinking earth is the center of our solar system to understand that our planet is revolving about the sun. And furthermore there is nothing particular with our planet. There must be many planets like ours in the universe. Now look at our own solar system. It has just one planet at the right distance from sun where water is in liquid phase. That planet has life. It is our planet. Extrapolating this to the rest of the universe we find that the likelyhood is one-hundred percent that life will exist on any planet in the universe that is in a termperature range where water can be in liquid phase. One-hundred percent certainty this planet will have life. Yet we have never been contacted by another civilization. This is very strong evidence for that after industrialization, no civilization can survive for very long. If it did, then we would have no doubt been contacted by that civilization.

(EMH = Efficient Market Hypothesis)

The efficient market has won, and people like Nassim Taleb, Nouriel Roubini, or Malcolm Gladwell have lost, once for all.

Stock prices for the big companies will rise forever, since there are no competition and any competition which might arise will be gobbled up quietly.

The rich will get RICHER, and the middle class and the poor will be driven to penury, homelessness, starvation and - elimination even faster.

It is an extinction event for most of the humans, for which there are no remedy. The financialization is complete, and there are no more 'slack' to be exploited anywhere on earth.

As economic singularity becomes a reality, those who missed the boat will be very, very sad, poor - and starving. Meanwhile the lucky and smarter few will laugh about the plight of the poor, who will die off-screen.

It is just going back to the world before 1913, which Gavrilo Princip and Charles Fitzclarence destroyed for a century. The only regret is the century of waste, which brought so much resource depletion to make Civilization 2.0 a toss-up event, rather than a certainty by 2000 if all the cream of Western Civilization did not perish at the trenches of Flanders and the rocks of Gallipoli, replaced by less civilized Americans, Japanese, Chinese and people from the Subcontinent.",8,0,False,self,,,,,

As such, we also support any initiatives, especially global ones, that seek to unite the planet, and all of humanity, to mitigate and minimise the impact of anthropogenic climate change. Therefore, we announce our support for the Paris Climate Agreement.
 
This stance that we are taking is a non-political, non-partisan one. This is not a conservative or liberal position either. This stance is the same regardless of political party. We believe strongly that climate change is real, and it is happening right now, and that time is running out, for ourselves, and for our children. Our belief is based on the available scientific evidence, which is strong, compelling, and supported by research and the majority of the worlds scientists and scientific bodies.
 
We join with other subreddits, like /r/science and /r/askscience, in making this public stance.
 
The purpose of making this declaration is to give an opportunity for our sub members to respond, discuss, and debate this very serious and important issue.
 
Any comments in this thread are subject to our normal rules, specifically Rule 6, as outlined in our sidebar.
 
Thank you, and please do let us know your thoughts.

In the next 5 years millions of people will lose their income because of self-driving cars and trucks, focus just on this major disruption, you don't need to imagine any other one.

Since the invention of Capitalism, the idea was to concentrate property in a few hands in a way innovation can occur, something impossible under the Old Regime because the nobles (most of them) were confortable with the idea of owning the land and having power. Well, productivity and production increased and the living standard too.

Today, Capitalism has won, I mean, it's a total victory. The Capital has figured out how to eliminate the Labor Factor in the production process thanks to technology and that leads to a society where nobody has to work but everybody has to receive an income in order to allow the market to work. All the neocommunists, under the marxist idea of the intrinsic value of work don't understand this point: they keep thinking everybody has to work, no matter what.

So, my bet it's we're gonna distribute wealth, not with well paid and protected jobs like we did in the past, but with a massive distribution of this capitalized production by ownership. The State will provide a Citizen's Dividend the way the Market provides dividends for private shareholders.

The alternative is to keep jobs alive even if robots and algorithms can do these tasks. But that's imposible because that's why the Soviet Union failed: the US was far more competitive and productive because Capital Freedom allows technology to improve. If we support employment policies like crazy, we may protect the status quo but other countries will apply the CD/UBI, allowing capital to increase tech in a more efficient way.

Work is something to abolish. Now.",1,2,False,self,,,,,

How does this new world look like? Do we have the motivation to achieve anything in our lives? All in all, will it be a dream or a nightmare?

Lets start with the first question  how will the world look like?

The dream of becoming rich  gone. The excuse of solving all our problems with money  gone. So whats left? What are our new dreams?

I believe we will start to put in way more effort to find our passions in life. Everybody can follow their dreams without the anxiety of becoming homeless on the way there. 

In this world, everybody will have a home, everybody will have enough to eat. There will be people who love architecture that much that they will build you a house, there will be people that love food so much that they will organize the distribution of nutrition.

I believe you will find your place in this order very fast, the only obstacle is finding the right people to get you started on your mission.

The rich and the poor will both get a new life. I guess the poor will have no problem to adjust to their new lives, but what about the rich? They no more have power over other people. I hope they will live through kind of a cold turkey and move on with their lives, also doing the things they love and find true happiness in that.

With that being said, who has power in this world, and what for? People passionate about politics will have the only power needed in this life. We still need the law and authorities to structure and order our togetherness.

On another aspect, they will have a way softer time dealing with wars and negativity in the world. I believe the only conflicts left in a world without money will be culture clashes where there is no money involved. But thats another topic.

Innovation will flourish. Inventors will use their whole day finishing one idea after the other. And when the good ideas get together with good distribution systems, progress will explode in all different areas of life.

Now that I painted my view of this future, let me talk about the motivation of people actually doing anything in this new world.

I believe that money will always be a poison when it comes to living our passions. Its an extrinsic motivation that has nothing to do with you doing the things you love doing. If we manage to delete this factor from existence, there will be only your intrinsic motivation left. You will again feel like a child who is curious about everything he tries new.

You dont need an external reward for your efforts. You will fall in love with the process so much that you are way happier than before feeling the greed about getting rich with it. The only external reward left would be awards and prizes if anyone cares about that anymore.

People will fall in love with contributing to society because you just dont have to think about providing for your family anymore. World has become a with each other where everybody does what he can to make the world a better place.

When I look at all these different areas I talked about, I see only opportunities. But what about the dangers of this new world? The only danger I can think of lies in the former rich people who just refuse to find their happiness in doing things they love because they have some kind of messed up childhood they cant get over yet. But in reality, what can they do against this system? The vast majority will be for it, former rich people are a great minority, so they dont have the numbers nor the means to do anything against money being gone  because nobody can be bribed anymore.

A World Without Money  For me that is a dream I wanna live in.

What if artificial intelligence followed a similar development? A.I. 1.0 would be what we have now, where wealthy enough research companies develop A.I. programs for very specific tasks. Such as an A.I. program within a self driving car detecting objects around it.

But eventually A.I. could develop to allow users to create their own specific A.I. programs that accomplish very specific tasks? And on the spot with little effort too.

For example, you could create an A.I. program to record and track your progress with practicing a piano song and determine parts of the song you would need to improve compared to performances online. Somehow A.I could develop to have a user interface that would allow for you to request a very specific task such as this.

A.I. 2.0... any thoughts? I've never posted here so I'm curious to hear your ideas and other programs that would fit under this hypothetical technology.. :)",4,11,False,self,,,,,

446,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017-6-4,2017,6,4,7,6f3yo6,self.Futurology,Automation will recreate the lose-lose economics of the antebellum Deep South (without distributive policies).,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6f3yo6/automation_will_recreate_the_loselose_economics/,KubrickIsMyCopilot,1496529189,"This is a long one, but necessarily so.

It seems like a paradox at first glance that most *free* people in the antebellum (i.e., slavery-driven) Deep South were dirt-poor: How could people who were entitled just by their race to force others to work for them still mostly have been impoverished and desperate?

Well, it turns out the two circumstances are not only related, but inextricable: Slavery meant that the handful of wealthy plantation owners who had all the money and land didn't really need to hire many free employees, so jobs were in short supply and paid very little even when they existed.

A small farmer with a few slaves couldn't compete with the prices offered by a big plantation with a massive slave workforce, so they ended up having to sell out, further driving the accumulation of wealth into fewer and fewer hands.  

Typical free people lived spartan, subsistence lifestyles while the handful of plantation owners lived in neo-feudal splendor in huge, palatial estates, waited on hand and foot by armies of household slaves funded by the hellish suffering of the field slaves.  Their handful of free employees - guards and a few professionals in various capacities - lived in small houses with one or two slaves of their own, and that was basically the whole of the economy.  Everyone else was Surplus.

The physical basis of the economy, the profit it made, and the political power were all bundled together in the same plantations, so things didn't move or grow.  Those who had everything, did nothing - everything they wanted was already for there for the taking.  Those with an incentive to do things were too poor to create economic demand for anything.  

The only roads that were built were between plantations and ports to export their goods, so most people still lived a rustic lifestyle.  The rich could pay to have tutors come teach their children, so there was no investment in education for anyone else beyond what churches could provide through meager donations.  And the same was true of medical facilities, universities, banks, etc. etc.  Even factories.

Why build a factory to mass-produce something when you could just import it, or make a slave build one for you?  And even if you wanted to, how could you economically support it when most people were too poor to buy the output?

Hopefully at this point it's clear where I'm going with this.  When the entire supply chain of an economy is bundled up into the hands of the same small group of people, they can just cut everyone else out, and everything grinds to a halt.  

With extreme automation, the rich will be able to afford faster and more effective software and robots than everyone else, so their wealth will just continuously increase and squeeze the vast majority of the population out of access to the benefits while simultaneously pushing them out of employment.  

As that happens, the part of the economy that sold automation to the masses contracts and the technology becomes less and less affordable since more and more of the dollar-for-dollar demand is coming from the top end.

Ordinary people lose both income and access to means of production that could independently generate it for them.  In the absence of distributive policies that force access to the benefits of automated production, this just means everyone becomes very poor, and ""the economy"" (such as it is) becomes indistinguishable from the household consumption patterns of a small minority of very wealthy people.

You end up with the seemingly perverse paradox of armies of robots and more complex machines swarming around city-sized factories to produce colossal luxury technologies while the masses struggle to have food, clean water, and basic shelter.

These mega-oligarchs will - judging by human behavior throughout history and around the world even today - feel no incentive or obligation to devote any significant amount of their resources to benefit society, no matter how trivially doing so would impact them and how hugely it would benefit others.

To their thinking, why should they fund a school if they have no need of the human employees it would make available?  Why fund a hospital to keep ""surplus"" people alive?  Why fund roads and bridges when their hypersonic flying yachts can take them across continents in 2 hours?  Why fund the scientific study of *anything* other than weapons and surveillance to guard their wealth against the starving hordes and impose their will on their competitors?

Even more sinister, why fund through taxes - or even tolerate the *existence* of - democratic political states whose functions they don't need, because they can either buy everything they want or steal it by mercenary force when they don't feel like paying?

Most sinister of all...why tolerate the continued existence of large numbers of human beings who are of no value to the growth of their wealth, but are a constant source of danger to it and agitation against their power?  The human beings outside of their giant resort-estates will not be people to them: They will never even meet them.  

The entertainment they consume - all of which will be tailored to them, because they have all the money that defines ""demand"" in a market - might not even acknowledge the existence of the vast majority of people all around them.  We already see this silliness in TV shows to some extent, and have for a long time - waitresses and college students living in giant downtown loft apartments somehow - but imagine that x1000.  

Imagine that all of TV and movies were scripted for the biases and expectations of people who were born billionaires.  *Today*  these people are forehead-smackingly ignorant and oblivious, even with plenty of opportunities to be otherwise.  *Today*, they say things like ""Where do you Summer?"" on the rare occasions they bother to strike up a conversation with The Help.

Now imagine people whose *entire* environment from birth to death makes them believe that typical people own their own jet aircraft and have houses on every continent, because that's true of the handful of human professionals they personally employ.  And meanwhile 99.9% of the species is living like the streets of Calcutta.

But then ""out of nowhere,"" they suddenly become aware that oceans of desperate people are storming their factories and private airports.  Their executive AI pops an authorization dialogue box into brain.  ""Remove threat?""  

No further details are offered, because the AI knows that knowing the details would slightly distress his majesty, but it must seek at least basic, high-level permission to make a big move like this.  ""Do it,"" the idiot thinks at his servant, sighs a little, and goes back to his golf game on the domed roof of his 10-mile skyscraper.

The screams of millions (or billions) reach the oligarch, if at all, as highly sanitized news reports of handfuls of independent millionaires offering mild criticism in carefully-structured political forums.  And even that is then automatically denounced by the oligarch's automated troll armies, mimicking a massive outcry against the ""agitators,"" and perhaps having some of them murdered as a warning without even considering *that* significant enough to ask his permission.

He continues his golf game, untroubled - content in a fantasy world created for him by his machines and kept separate from the real one by tsunamis of blood.

This has happened before in economies driven by slavery, both ancient and modern; happens today in economies driven by human corruption; and the scale of it that automation would make possible is gut-wrenching.

Some Italian units, like the Folgore, fought well but not too many of them did.

Likewise, if everyone in the world were like the Japanese, docile, and accepting their fate without making too much noise, we would have reached the Singularity by now.

By bolting out from the Paris climate agreement Trump has shown that he won't travel with the Future Drivers, including Elon Musk, the patron saint of /Futurology.

The Singularity, etc, will only be possible thru techno-commericalism, or techno-feudalism (depending whom you are asking), where economic singularity has already taken place (i.e. the tech giants control ALL resources, including people, and all non-essential people have been reduced to tenement-style penury).

Only the elites and some more intelligent people will benefit, in an eternal class division which will be completed by genetic enhancement.

However, unfortunately, the 'people' appear to be awakening. They don't know what is hitting them, but they are getting increasingly aware that there is nothing for them in the Future.

And hucksters like Trump are using that fear to hinder the progress to the Future.

The tech giants and today's elites need more and more and more money, to invest on the future tech which is not cheap.

What Trump and his followers are doing is using that money to better the lives of some people in the lesser developed part of USA, to little lasting benefits in the end like Lyndon Johnson's ""The Great Society"" program.

[JFK caused way, way more harm after death than when he was alive, since in his name a lot of social changes took place.]

People like Alex Jones and Clif High are inciting the masses about 'Elite plans', which are true. There are no place for the low-IQ, low-wealth people in the ""First World"" for the future.

The future is brutal. It will be an extinction event for many tribes, and animals, since they have no place under it. 

It is imperative for all world leaders to join the ""Deep State"", to control the enormous amount of money, tech, financials, etc to expedite technology, no matter how obnoxious the members of deep state might behave. They have to be forgiven in a 'utilitarian' way since their presence creates the greater good by advancing civilization.

If nothing is done, available resources will be consumed by the billions of people and tech will collapse due to the lack of resources. The masses 'win' without fighting, although that means civilization will die.

It is unfortunate that Trump is having his way; even if he is out by 2020, that's 3 more years Civilization will have to stagnate, and 3 more years until the point where resource shortage negates all tech gains.

It is very possible that Trump might cost the chance to reach Singularity and reach the outer space, just because he wanted to look good to the poorer electorate in the Rust belt.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

[Long],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6fpulr/how_will_automation_effect_us_long/,Snazzy22,1496794025,"With every coming day, a new advancement is found - whether it be in computer sciences, medical studies, or space exploration. These advancements generally have one thing in common, they make our lives easier, but in the long run, our drive to advance could end up hurting us.
   
One such way technological advances could hurt us is by taking away our jobs, through automation. This can be seen in many different fields today, for example assembly lines are no longer run by hundreds of people, but just a few overlooking machines that do the job for them, but this allowed for much cheaper and high quality cars. This trend can also be seen over a much more vast period of time, in agriculture. In the beginnings of civilization, basically everyone worked as a farmer or another job responsible for producing food. But then we saw the domestication of animals and the ox-powered plow, which freed up a few peoples time in order to do other things, such as develop written languages and make scientific observations about the world around them. Now, present day, after many more developments in the field, the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that less than 1% of the population works in agriculture. This change seems to be a good thing for civilization as a whole, as we've now developed new jobs in new fields that were created due to our technological advancements, such as computer sciences. But who's to say the same thing will happen when the jobs we currently hold inevitably become inferior to a computer doing the same thing?

 Well, we won't really know until it happens, but if history is any sign of how this kind of thing turns out, we seem to have a bright future ahead. Employment opportunities for positions we haven't even thought of yet could be the dream jobs of our children. Sure, jobs such as teachers and fast food workers may be taken by a robot, but millions of jobs could be created through scientific fields we haven't even discovered yet.
Nevertheless, steps can be taken to help insure the future of our children and perhaps even ourselves. Embrace the growing job fields and pursue a career in a sector that isnt being overtaken by technology. This all starts at schools. Schools need to offer more specialized classes that encourage students to adapt to their new world of technology and information. For example requiring students to take a computer sciences course in order to graduate would be a good start. What do you all suggest we do, if anything, in order to prepare for the future of employment?
P.S This is for a school project so comments/feedback is much appreciated :)

Did you know that leased vehicles accounted for about 25 percent of total vehicle sales in 2016 and 31 percent of retail sales?  ~Experian Automotive State of Automotive Financing

Therefore, since total sales for 2016 were 17.6 million cars and trucks sold, it follows that there are approximately 4.4 million new cars and trucks being leased each year.

A quote from a recent news article: ""A lease is often a much better, and more affordable, option than a purchase. ""

http://www.whio.com/news/local/reasons-why-people-don-lease-cars-and-why-they-really-should/nRriZSj2yfEuYDNrXpM3iP/

Another quote from a different news article: ""Despite today's low fuel prices, fuel economy remains among the most important factors for car shoppers.""

http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1109986_aaa-interest-in-electric-cars-rivals-interest-in-pickups

My question is: why don't car companies who are leasing their electric vehicles shout from the top of their lungs that driving a mile in an electric vehicles cost 50%+ less than their gas guzzling equivalent once the car is driven off the lot?

Big Cable companies are pouring a ton of money into lobbying, misleading ads, and astroturf campaigns in an attempt to confuse the public. If they succeed, the Internet will never be the same.
 
**[Were joining an Internet-wide day of action (like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown) on July 12th to help save net neutrality.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** 
 
Regardless of your political beliefs, this issue affects all redditors. Online communities like ours wouldn't exist without the principles of net neutrality that foster creativity and innovation on the web. Weve worked together to defend the Internet before, now we need to do it again.
 
**Lets have a conversation about how we as redditors can organize together for July 12th to make sure that decision-makers in Washington, DC listen to real Internet users, not just telecom lobbyists.** 
 
Reddit itself has agreed to participate in the day of action along with popular sites like Amazon, Etsy, Kickstarter, Vimeo, GitHub, and Mozilla. Dozens of other subreddits have already jointed too. This is going to be big.
 
But theres so much we can do together, from flooding the FCC and Congress with comments and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Learn more about the day of action at https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12 and lets discuss in the comments!

If this was the case I think a lot of value would be created for the companies who are creating these technologies.  Look what has happened to AMD and NVIDIA over the last year for example.  If someone had even a small amount of technology stocks today it would explode in value over the next 30 years or so it takes to get to an AI society.  These people would be collecting dividends and be able to give their kids trust funds so not having a job isn't a problem.  Basically I think we all need to make sure we have at least a small stake in the future right now so we reap the benefits of being an owner of the technology that takes away all the jobs.,4,6,False,self,,,,,

All rich people buy lands inside the city, collect rents, and force middle and poor class to either rent or move out to deserts/jungle. It's not fair even. Land is at premium, and you shouldnt have any monopoly over it. Imposing such tax will also help curb corruption, because we all know rich people want to evade taxes, and land value tax is the most obvious tax that they can't avoid. We may reduce income tax, and increase LVT also. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax Land Value Tax should be introduced. Land is at premium, and you have to pay for it if you want to hoard it. Just don't tax the land on which you live, only tax the land where you don't live, because there are many poor people who can't even afford land value tax.

So replacing them is next to impossible.

I think that in the future, these massive infrastructure, when it was necessary to fight the cold war (although I think it would have been wiser to abandon the Third World and let Soviets try to feed it) will not be built.

Future tech is only for the , well, 'initiated'. Only maybe 2-3% of today's pop will enjoy them, while the rest will be housed in tenements like 19th century New York or the building described in Marshall Brain's ""Manna"".

Since only those who are 'connected' will need infrastructure, and the rest reduced into abject poverty, penury and deprivation and guarded by mechanical soldiers ready to destroy them at the slightest intrusion, I don't think large infrastructure is needed.

I am not aware of any better ideology other than technofeudalism which could bring Singularity, and wasting our resources for, say, building new infrastructure for people who will be obsolete is like trying to keep a child without brains alive.

technical improvement does not have to mean expansion. We don't need to reach Kardashev I to go to the space ; the Soviet scientist did not understand the meaning of efficiency.

Here are my thoughts on the topic, of the future of solar panels. Please feel welcomed to share your thoughts too.
Solar panels use the energy of the solar radiation, which comes to the earth. Facing the fact, that they are not really efficient, I do not get, why so many people feel euphoric about them. 
It is estimated that there will be about 10 billion people in the world (some statistics say, there will be just 9/9,5 billion - for more information just google). If you have solar panels on your roof. It is often just enough for your own home. Solar panels are just not getting enough energy per square meter. Space is getting more important with the rise of population, as well as with the rise of modern technology, which will simply need more energy. There is also the industry, which needs just more energy. In Germany, we have a relatively high population density and a lot of industry. How should this country get the electricity it needs from solar panels? In a few years, most countries will be populated as high as Germany. 
Another important point to mention is, that the manufacturing of solar panels uses rare metals and rare elements. 
We say, that we do not want to use limited resources as oil, but indium and other materials. 
Still, it is important to mention, that the efficiency of solar panels will rise.

For example, people used to work in large numbers together to get/make food for themselves, until futuristic technology came and people couldn't make food and get food from robotics, etc. so this is considered selfish.

Also, more and more people want immortality (biology kind of immortality) to exist, which is also selfish as humans don't have to live forever and if immortality is implemented in all people, it could cause more overpopulation problems and more habitats will be lost.

Also, AI, Robots, Self-driving cars, etc. are also making people not caring about cleaning, cooking, manually driving, etc. for themselves, which is also a very selfish thing.

&gt;Such companies include the ones I have been recommending on this blog for years: Amazon, Facebook, Google, etc. Nearly a decade later, no one has been able create a viable competitor to these companies and likely never will. Thats not to say its impossible, but its very improbable.

&gt; High-IQ regions attract capital inflow from rich foreigners, which is one reason why Silicon Valley and New York not only became so wealthy but stayed wealthy

&gt;Tech, consumer staples, and healthcare companies dont have the same debt problem as manufacturing, low-IQ retail, and energy, and due to high-IQ management, these tech companies dont take on debt to expand but instead rely on organic growth. ..High IQ+ huge profits+ huge growth+ market dominance is an impossible to beat combination.

==

On about 1913, there were only five countries which mattered, Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia and USA (much inferior). Austria, Turkey and Italy were allowed to participate because of their tradition , and Japan was allowed as a nonwhite rep, but Austria was a vassal of Germany, Italy that of France, and Japan that of Britain.

We are simply going back to that era, with no quarters given for the smaller fishes.

The major cities of the new civilization, Boston, NYC, DC, Silicon Valley and some other tech towns in the coasts, will enjoy a godlike existence as economic singularity concentrates all the companies and holdings into the hands of less than 100 people.

The great technologies will arrive, benefiting only the most valuable of humanity, with the rest shivering like tenement dwellers before driven to extinction.

However, the path may be compromised by people like Trump, who know they don't have any place in this cutthroat, high-IQ world, and want to mess it up before it arrives, like the gangster 'king' of Serbia (who should have been shot for Crimes against Humanity, as well as everyone in Serbian Army higher than a lieutenant) and his terrorists who messed up the world which was just a tiny bit away from Singularity.

I watch the same show this time every Friday night. How does AppleTV not know that already.  Then I realize that Machine Learning will  be the expectation we have for all technology in the future.  I was mad because a 6 inch box (that contains every show ever made and can be delivered to me instantly through the air) didn't already know the one show I wanted to watch right now. I actually have to type it out (on my phone which also controls my tv). Me 20 years ago would reach through space/time, if he saw me now, and slap me like a little bitch. 

Me 20 years ago was happy if an application opened  in under a minute. Now, if my app doesn't open within a second or two I curse out my phone. 15 years ago I would spend 10 minutes downloading 64-bit boobies and I was happy. Now i have access to billions of boobies just by ""asking my speaker"" to show me them. But don't make me ask twice Alexa!...so annoying. 

So one day we will be annoyed when we get in a car and it doesn't automatically drive us where we want to go or when we go to Amazon and it doesn't know exactly what we came there to buy.

For many years, America meddled with the politics of tinpot countries who tried to better the lot of their own people rather than serve US business interests.

That is a good thing . The resources, which should be used to advance economy so more money can be invested into tech development, should not be wasted to better the lot of the hapless denizens of tinpot countries.

A lot of people are misunderstanding the issue. Tech is not to better the general pop. It is to make money for its creators, and to advance to a higher dimension, not to make the lives of the masses better.

Those who will be reduced to penury , stuck in gig jobs and other low paying stuff should be glad they are contributing to the economy, like the Japanese kamikaze pilots who were expected to be happy about given the chance to die for the Emperor.

Lots of people will die. Lots of populations will be culled. But all of these is to reach Singularity, and to the stars. If that goal is reached, a higher dimension is reached and it is a greater good than anything else you can think about.

The Duke of Conde, after a major loss in a battle, said 'A night of passion in Paris will replace all these losses'. That is how those who run things see the world.

It is imperative to focus on Singularity and Space Exploration, and other stuff to advance civilization, rather than waste time and energy on public welfare.

If the efforts of people who support Trump, for example, succeed and our dwindling resources are wasted to support the people's welfare instead, then 

we will be stuck on earth

economy will collapse and the smarter people will be hurt

and mankind will lose its chance to enter a higher dimension,once for all.",43,0,False,self,,,,,

I understand people have a lot of views about stuff and we tend to get carried away, I understand that. This page has grown amazingly in the past few years, I remember when there was only 100k subs!

But unfortunately with more people it tends to formulate quite divisive topics, where some people think we are going and already are living in a dystopian nightmare. The other side of the fence people think that we will live in utopia. I feel this has got in the way of any reasoned rationale. Now I am not in any way discrediting these very valid opinions but I also think that it can also be quite harmful to have a perspective that isn't broad(also just my opinion).

Think about it for a second: maybe I am alone on this, but doesn't a lot of the ideas and views give yourself a sense of anxiety but also overtly optimistic ideas that when it doesn't come to fruition you would feel jaded and let down? 

I see things on this page and I worry that it would be a horrible future to live in if that were true. Certainly would fight for a better one. But also in a dream come true, there will be always something that isn't quite right. 

Just some thoughts of mine. If you disagree its fine to downvote but I appreciate some discussion. Thanks.  ",4,1,False,self,,,,,

But let's imagine a future where there are distinct professions committed to maxmizing these metrics, and human beings devote their resources to the metric that most applies to their desires.  The people who lack space, invest themselves in maximizing space.  The people who lack a commodity devote their resources to maximizing that commodity.  And so on.

What happens then?  

We get diverse results.  **Interesting** results.  We get people who, by virtue of their deprived circumstances, have unbelievably massive homes at relatively low unit prices.  We get people who wallow in some commodity or other - water, greenery, food, etc.  And all things between.

So what happens then?  At that point we get people who try to find **optimum balance** among all possible metric spaces.  We find people who try to optimize their space among volume, water, access to organic nutrients, clean air, subjective factors, and others.

These are the far-future ""Brahmins,"" but still people have a choice - they may wish to live at extreme altitudes, live within extreme quantities of volume, etc.  They may be admired by many, and despised by aristocrats as crass nouveaux riches.  But people get what they want.

They use many current trends with technology to speculate what life would be like in a few hundred years from now (not actually a million years in the future, but hey).  

I find that no scifi shows to date really do a good job at integrating current technological trends into what the future might look like, except this one.  They also discuss many of the societal impacts that these types of technologies would lead to.  Many awesome topics covered, from AI to brain computer interface technology leading to a hive mind intelligence that can harness the powers of all human brains combined.  Communication would be done at the speed of light, instead of the ""40 bits per second"" that we can communicate using spoken language (assuming no processing bottleneck of our brains themselves). 

 A lot of the theories seem pretty sound and not ""out there"", at least coming from someone with a background in computer science and someone who thinks about this stuff all the time.

But i haven't found any articles or discussions about how our society and culture will evolve, what new trends will we see. 

One thing that came to mind was that currently technology and progress is making us more isolated. We are involved all the time with our smartphones and computers and have very little time or desire to meet people in real and spend some good time with them. Also completion and pressure to have successful career leaves little time for our friends and families. That is because material gain depends on work and various metrics of work like what type of work you do, what quality of work you do etc.

Now suppose everything is done by machines then everything changes. People have no stress, no pressure to succeed in career, in fact there may be no concept of career as such. People will have freedom to live the life the way it's meant to be. I believe at such times people will spend much more time with each other. Complete new social institutions will emerge to enable us to spend our free time in novel ways. For example you will be able to find hobby clubs based on every niche interests. People will be doing creative things together and participating in various competitions and tournaments based on technologies not yet invented. Multiplayer gaming will be completely different and really huge compared to present. Imagine a simulated reality game based on interplanetary adventure or hyper speed racing game which you can participate in with other people. It will be so much fun. 

So there will be things as such we can't even imagine now. Right now we have some technology but no free time to use it in creative ways. In future there will be much much better technology and all the free time you need. This will change our society unlike anything till now. 

So i am much more excited about the societal changes which advanced technology will bring rather than technology itself. Let's discuss what you think about it and various other things we as individual and as a society will experience.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6gqkm4/a_common_misconception_about_the_industrial/

This post was viral in here, although I think it is a tempest in the teapot. TL: dr, Industrial Revolution did not increase economic prosperity, and any gains were claimed by the owners of capital, and individual lives did not really improve.

Gregory Clark already proved it in his ""A Farewell to Alms"".

People's lives did not really improve much until after World War 2, thanks to fossil fuel. it did improve somewhat after the end of Great War because govts had to fear the populace rising up and doing the things the Bolsheviks did to the Czar, but not that much.

And, I have argued a few times that the 'heroes' of the Great War f'ked up Civilization far more than Hitler or Stalin, both of them who would have remained obscure figures.

Now, the new bottleneck has been reached, and this time a new Great War is unlikely. The offending nation gets showered with smart bombs, Mother of All Bombs, depleted uranium bombs and other bombs and that's it.

The problem is, 'some' masses, thanks to people like Clif High, Alex Jones and other enemies of Civilization, are being awakened to the fact that there are no places for them in the Future.

if they rise up before the point of no return, which I estimate to be about 2025, is reached things could get very nasty.

It is very imperative to keep the progress unimpeded. 

Some people want a reset so they could join the party even if it is late, knowing there is nothing for them. 

But if there is a reset, there is no slack to rise up. The world was still largely empty in 1920, and we had only about 1/3 of the people now back in 1950. And we did not use up a lot of the world's resources.

Now there is no place to dump the poorer people, no slack to recover the destruction, and no real way to rebuild the infrastructure, which won't be rebuilt once they wear out.

If the masses can be controlled we will probably be able to make it. If not and the screw falls out before 2025, then we will probably lose all the gains since about 1800. I don't see anything in between.",22,1,False,self,,,,,

If it can be conceived, it can be achieved, If you believe in something have the courage to stand behind it. One world government has always been demonized because a true one world government would puts the power back into the hands of the people and out of the hands of the one or the few, the ego and vain, the greedy, the traditional extremists of social sacrificing machinery. The ideas of a Democratic Republic was not met to stagnant in tradition as it currently has, it was meant to grow with the people. The only thing stopping us are the fears and insecurity's instilled by the powers that be that keep the agenda and encoding conscious free minds with the belief that they have power. Politics are designed to (distract) divide, and (isolate) conquer the people through simple binary ideology(belief), it is time we shed the fear and believe in ourselves and each other, The things we fear only become a reality if we choose, to  feed it and or do nothing.

When the value of things outweighs the value of people and living things, we lose the value of everything including the very thing that makes us human, our heart(love, compassion, empathy, and hope) desensitizing us from our own humanity. Morally and ethically, It is my belief, that all people of the world, of every nation, and state desire peace and freedom. Freedom is choice. All governments are basically control where representatives control the masses doing civic duty with the ""best intention"" of their people or peoples, where the few govern the many through ""representation"". We have reached a point that we the people can now represent and govern ourselves, given current and future technology.

The only limitations are the ones we choose to believe. A mass electronically worldwide or nationwide connect Democratic Republic based on communal principles should be formed void of any social, economic, or political hierarchy, that transcends political binary ideology and borders, taking perspectives and input from all, because all want and are working to make it better. We all can now live in a world where the people have no representatives but themselves voting locally, regionally(state, municipalities) and realistically continental, allowing any individual to put forth, and pass any laws, regulations, bills etc defined by the norms(moral, ethical, and scientific facts) of each current society for each level and area of the known space in which we humans inhabit. It is time that every generation from here forward learns how to code and treat as if it was learning another language as provided through early education. As long as the majority of the people are coders Any coder could in essence improve the code being by fixing flaws, glitches adding to the security all individuals and their privacy of belongings, home, choice, views, perspectives ideas, and or multiple of each in regards of input are respected, and free of persecution and attack. Based on their choices,. but i believe this is one way that it can be achieved with the only oversight transparency accountability is the whole of people themselves

This form of government would be void of Political/financial or any other Representative {except in matter of the of civil court} but respected as whole of equal individuals, working as whole taking part in improving worldwide connectivity, transparency, and security of Electronic Democratic Republic open source universal tool(open source software or other) and ever improving peace, freedom, and the pursuit of knowledge and dreams. A open society, not limiting; but tolerant, without individual or absolute censorship. The only leaders are all people regardless of any physical, sexual, intellectual, financial, or biological difference, with their pursuits of ideals, the ones we share as a species that unite us, love, peace, the pursuit of Knowledge and happiness.. Through this technology sustained through consistent education and knowledge we could improve its open source transparency, security, and a encrypted accountable exchange and self governance. This would allow a Creation of a marketplace transparent, accountable, free and open exchange of ideas and knowledge. Especially when it comes to the pursuit of any knowledge, cultural, philosophical, technological, and scientific advances and media/medium none should not be limited or restricted by any means, but free, tolerant, and ever expanding for the betterment of humankind. A government by the people with no limitation in the betterment for overall growth for all.

No government of the few the rich, no corruption, no influence, no secrets, no limitation on freedoms and liberties or equality's, The lives that would be saved, the truth, science and art that could be advanced based on facts not biased opinions, imagine the wars that could be avoided, imagine? Imagine the money we would save and put towards better like health, education, the arts, science, planet/environment sustainability, job creation, innovation. The potential freedom, transparency, accountability, knowledge, would be endless.As each generation adapts to more and more technology, paper, and brick and mortor will be less and less; from business to governance. It is only a matter of time before something like this or similar is implemented.

But it's the most important type of death to focus on not only because it's one of the many ways to die but it's inevitable unless we can stop it. We can use up our time having fun, having a job and playing games and posting memes but if we cannot manage to raise global awareness in preventing the degradation of cells in the body when we approach our death bed we won't have another chance to continue those things and if you want to experience more of the world or create more in that moment you will be sure to have a feeling of (Why did I not try to prevent this?).

This issue can be fixed by adding the appropriate properties from organism that have already achieved biological immortality into human cells to stop them from ageing or/and replacing human parts with mechanical perhaps even the brain with memories and consciousness backed up by replacing parts slowly over time so that the same person remains.

* 2): **Colonise other Planets in and far away from our Solar System**

If planet Earth has never met a intelligent alien species before we must arrange communications far away from the Earth from a point that the extraterrestrials cannot find us. 

Leading them here to our only ""save game"" is lunacy. It's our only safe location and if they are far more powerful than us we would be bent to their will if they are hostile. Think of how hostile we humans are to other species and ourselves would many aliens think much different? Imagine a malevolent race of aliens that torture, completely exterminate or even feast on us setting up slaughter camps and reproduction zones. The human race would be bound for millions of years trapped away in a endless slaughter with no escape unless in the vane hope we would be saved or put out of our misery by an even bigger alien race and even then what chance is there that they would be benevolent?

It's a very possible reality and we shouldn't gamble on our only backup of the human species. We could even be in danger already maybe not right now but from signals already sent out which will continue to travel on wards. Even if a species receives it you can't be certain they would send waves back and when they do they might come for us so it's a extra reason to get into space and have a web of planets to live and protect ourselves from no matter how hard it will be to get there.

Even if aliens won't be a problem we still have to watch out for large asteroids or other spacey bodies that will eventually hit Earth so we have to backup our societies on other planets either way.

* 3): **Near Immunity**

This goes back to my first point. Once we figure out how to stop ageing it's still time to prevent any further causes of death by reinforcing the human body in biological or by cybernetic means. This would include prevention from any other diseases which is already actively worked on and researched.

**Other Notes**

* Of course there are a lot of other problems in the world: poverty, malnutrition, wars and so on. But these are all big problems that need to be broken up first. 

* Stooping ageing would allow the most poorest people to keep trying eventually in hopes of making some income.

* Wars would hopefully be seen as more dangerous since you can now live forever if you play your cards to perfection but engaging in unnecessary wars will increase your downfall greatly.

* Space travel would also reduce wars as there are plenty of systems and planets to colonise and mine which would hopefully allow less contest. Governments ,companies and corporations could pick their own space without having to expropriating already built locations owned by other entities or people.

* On-top of that if hostile aliens are found that would not ally with any specific group of humans I'm sure the human species would band together to face a possible greater threat.

* The threat of a nuclear war would also diminish more since you could be hit from so many different locations and angles in space that setting one off could be as much as a death-wish as on Earth.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

We can all agree that interconnectivity is part of our future, and its backbone is the internet. It is important that access to the net remains open, accessible and equitable, to ensure that it can continue to benefit humanity as a whole, and not just to the few.

Right now, in the US, the FCC is planning to dismantle Title II net neutrality protections that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T from controlling what Internet users can see by throttling, blocking, and censoring sites and apps, or charging special fees that get passed along to consumers. Big Cable companies are pouring a ton of money into lobbying, misleading ads, and astroturf campaigns in an attempt to confuse the public. If they succeed, the Internet will never be the same.

Even though this issue is occurring in America, and many of our subscribers are international, we know that a lot of the web hosting companies, social media giants, and tech powerhouses are based in the US. We also know that other countries such as the UK and Australia have contemplated other types of restrictions on the internet which will impact on the open-access nature of the web that a lot of us currently enjoy.
 
**[As such, the mod team at /r/Futurology have agreed that we will be joining an Internet-wide day of action (like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown) on July 12th to help save net neutrality.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** 
 
Regardless of your political beliefs, this issue affects all redditors. Online communities like ours wouldn't exist without the principles of net neutrality that foster creativity and innovation on the web. Weve worked together to defend the Internet before, now we need to do it again.
 
**Lets have a conversation about how we as redditors can organize together for July 12th to make sure that decision-makers in Washington, DC listen to real Internet users, not just telecom lobbyists.** 
 
Reddit itself has agreed to participate in the day of action along with popular sites like Amazon, Etsy, Kickstarter, Vimeo, GitHub, and Mozilla. Dozens of other subreddits have already jointed too. This is going to be big.
 
But theres so much we can do together, from flooding the FCC and Congress with comments and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Learn more about the day of action at https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12 and lets discuss in the comments below!

My biggest argument is that the US government moves so slow that there's no way they can make anything like that happen in 30 years. The infrastructure alone is just overwhelming.

I've been lurking the sub for a long long time. You guys are cool. I didn't know where else I could take this to, so here I am.

I'm a developer (web and iOS), designer, motion graphics artist, and I'm also learning some video editing of late. I would like to put my skills to good use. 

It's both interesting and troubling times that we live in, we as a species are going through a lot of challenges that could question our survival in a few hundred years. Maybe it's not much, but I would like to contribute in whatever way I can, I would like to help people understand how much we've advanced technologically and raise awareness in any of the following domains:

- Science
- Space
- Agriculture
- Environment
- Economy

I understand this is a very broad classification of interests, and that looking to do something here is probably too ambitious, but I just am looking for ideas or things that I could possibly do to help people understand, make things better than it is. I would like to, at the end of this, try to build a product, make a video, or do something that's going to help the cause.

If you guys have any thoughts on this, I'd love to discuss.

For several years I have followed these subs and some of the discussions here were compelling enough to lead me to start a more public discussion about how it might be possible to ensure that as innovation, automation and inequality transform our economy, we ensure that it remains stable, everyone benefits, and no one is left behind. I have been working with other groups and stakeholders since, many of whom have been working on this for much longer than me, but I really want to thank everyone here at r/Futurology and r/BasicIncome for being the first resource I came across.

My name is Chris Lee. I currently serve in the Hawaii State Legislature where I've found that public policy must look to the future far beyond the next campaign cycle. Planning for the future isn't politically sexy and won't win anyone an election, if anything it tends to bring out opposition that doesn't want to see things change. But if we do it properly we will all be much better off for it in the long run.

I introduced [House Concurrent Resolution 89](http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HCR&amp;billnumber=89&amp;year=2017) this year to start a conversation about our future. After much work and with the help of a few key colleagues, it passed both houses of the State Legislature unanimously. HCR 89 does two things. First, it boldly declares that all families in Hawaii deserve basic financial security. As far as I'm told it's the first time any state has made such a pronouncement, but I think it's an important statement of our values here in Hawaii on which we seek to act.

HCR 89 also establishes a Basic Economic Security Working Group co-chaired by the Department of Labor and Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism to analyze our state's economy, and find ways to ensure all families have basic financial security, including an evaluation of different forms of a full or partial universal basic income. The group will eventually be reporting back to the State Legislature with further recommendations and next steps.

There's a lot of work to be done, but I think we all look forward to it. In a state with more homeless per capita than nearly anywhere else, a growing divide between those who have and those who have not, and a service-based economy with tremendous exposure to disruption, it's time to start thinking ahead. As innovation and automation displace jobs and transform the marketplace, it will require a paradigm shift in policy to ensure that the economy remains stable, everyone benefits, and no one is left behind.

I will try to keep everyone up to date through social media as we proceed, but for now I just want to say thank you again to everyone at r/BasicIncome and r/Futurology. Mahalo!

PS: Since surely someone will ask about verification I just tweeted that I will be posting this and you can find that on my twitter and facebook.

TL;DR: The State of Hawaii is going to begin evaluating universal basic income. Thanks r/BasicIncome and r/Futurology for your help!",279,1281,False,self,,,,,

Im interested in speculating on how currency and financial systems can be perceived using a similar thought experiment.


**First postulate: An advanced AI will be disincentivized to amass large sums of fiat currency.**


How do you create an efficient AI economy where you dont have legal standing within the human organization that controls your wealth? An AI needs a system thats both legally and technically secure. 

**Second Postulate: Some AIs will be motivated to amass wealth in a form that they can control.**

Leaving a nationally or centrally controlled fiat currencies for a system that uses network based protocols is already happening, and has been happening for almost a decade. Crypto-currencies are like fiat in the same way that email is like an internationally coordinated postal system. While international postal networks continue to, and probably always will, operate in a niche capacity, the vast bulk of human correspondence has moved to email, as well as centralized non-protocol based systems of information distribution. It seems reasonable to assume that AIs will use crypto-currencies the way automation software uses email.

**Third postulate: The growth of CryptoCurrency-enabled independent AIs will grow exponentially over time.** 

While pondering this I considered the price performance of Bitcoin against Metcalfes law: The value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system.  It seems to follow that there is no logical upper limit or carrying capacity to the networks and systems that support these hypothetical AIs. So, as computation increases so does the participation in their financial networks. This implies that there is no theatrical limit to size (and value) of the network. This is very similar to Musk's thought experiment about simulation and base reality: Computation and networks have no theoretical upper limit when you zoom out to a time span of hundreds or thousands of years.

**Fourth  postulate: The value of Crypto-Currency base networks will grow exponentially over time.** 

I decided to observe year over year  price performance of Bitcoin as an analogous reference for our theoretical  AI economy.

Before we look at those details:

**Data**

Past performance linearly projected against the 2017 and 90 day periodic trends:

* http://imgur.com/flqg7bs

A 30-day price projection shows that we are bouncing between the 60-day trend and the 2017 trend. If we project the price starting from the dates we choose for our trends you can see that we are generally performing above past price performance, with greater swings. If today's prices perform like past prices, as if it were a linear relationship, we project greater price stability and a significant drop in the daily periodic trend. This shows evidence that Bitcoin price performance adjusts logarithmically or quadratically.

**Data Source Summary**

*Data older than a year is a close approximation based on observations of bitstamp from charts. The percent error caused by that fuzzy way of collecting data is assumed to be minimal.*

*All other source data is queried directly from servers that support bitcoincharts.com*

 * https://api.blockchain.info/charts/market-price?format=csv


Bitcoin price performance since 2013 and 2016 is almost identical. Recent price performance appears to be much too high. So, lets consider that our most bearish case is a daily periodic rate for the value of the growth of the network is .1%. That still shows that the value of the AI financial network would exceed 21 trillion USD by 2033 if it were established in 2009. The less conservative case would have use at 21 trillion USD next year and the most liberal would have us there by the end of 2017.

When you consider the scale of the abundance this implies its hard to imagine that there isnt an environmental factor that might impose a limit on Metcalfs law. That leads to further implications for the future of economic systems.

2010,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017-6-17,2017,6,17,11,6hqxcm,self.Futurology,The Fermi Time Travel Paradox,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6hqxcm/the_fermi_time_travel_paradox/,isleepinahammock,1497665062,"Been mulling some interesting thoughts on the intersection of time travel and the Fermi Paradox. Or, at least time travel and similar themes. 

The argument I'm coalescing around goes something like this:

Based on what we know of the universe, the laws of physics, and the universe's history, the past cannot be altered by time travel. A few possibilities exist:

1. Time travel is completely impossible. Physics simply doesn't allow it for whatever reason. 

2. You can travel back in time, but you can't change the past. Random chance will conspire to prevent it. (This has been explored in fiction before. You go back in time to kill Hitler, and your gun just happens to jam every time, that sort of thing. You don't create a paradox because you were there in your own past, making inconsequential actions.) 

3. You can create a time machine, but it can't travel back to before its own creation. (Maybe it's something like a gateway or wormhole. If you open in on January 1st, 2100, someone from the far future might come walking through, but you can never use it to travel to any point prior to 2100. 

To do any of these would require a time machine that could alter events before its own creation. Based on what we observe of the universe, this seems impossible.

Why? Well such an ability would obviously be an incredibly powerful weapon. The ability to directly alter the past would be the most powerful weapon possible. You could literally prevent your enemy from ever being born, or, if a different species, ever evolving. 

Any one who invents a time machine capable of altering the past would know this. In addition, not only do you have to worry about your current enemies from erasing your species from history, but any potential enemies, from now until the heat death of the universe, doing the same. 

In such a universe, where history-altering time travel is possible, the only logical step to take would be to catapult your species back to the very earliest part of the universe. Time travel back to the earliest possible moment life was possible, maybe only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. Travel to this earliest point possible, and then spread to every single star in the observable universe, going back in time at each one, so you arrive at this earliest moment simultaneously across the entire visible universe (and even beyond.)

If reverse time travel really is possible, then we shouldn't be here. Every star of every galaxy should have been filled the very instant it was capable of supporting life. That's really the only way to prevent yourself from being killed via time travel. Take over the entire universe at the earliest possible moment. 

We obviously don't see this. Time travel would make it possible to have an entire universe-spanning civilization (even beyond the visible universe) blink into existence at the very instant the first stars started to form. This would be an extreme act, but it would be the logical final solution for any species that sought to prevent its own destruction via temporal shenanigans. Two species might start fighting by altering minor events here and there, but this is the logical path things would build to. 

Since the entire universe obviously wasn't filled, instantaneously, out of nowhere at the first available opportunity, it seems time travel is impossible. Or, in particular, it's impossible to create any time machine that will be able to alter the past. If you do manage to build a time machine, and you try to time travel back to Earth 4 billion years ago, an asteroid instantly lands on your head, vaporizing you and preventing you from spreading even a single bacterial cell.

Given that resources are running out, and time is running short before the 'people' gain enough tech to significantly disrupt tech elite's plans,

I think that some kind of 'downsizing' will take place before the final spurt to Singularity and Space Conquest can be made possible.

I wrote that Trump (if not himself, his supporters) , plus people like Julian Assange, Alex Jones and Clif High made life hard to those who drive Civilization.

The Deep State has to become stronger, the rights of the less advanced people around the world have to be abridged farther, and more wealth and resources have to be concentrated at the top.

I feel that only those who will have any use in the 'future' will be allowed to enjoy it. Some people might get in there by accident, but will not be there for too long if they can't prove their place.

It is necessary to change policy to facilitate future development, not to make people's lives better, since it is like trying to extend the life of a terminally ill patient (i.e. meaningless, although very profitable to the hospitals and drug companies).

It is time to accept that the world wasted a century for nothing, and also the cold fact that current social policy and emphasis on people won't lift Civilization. Admitting that will probably end all social programs except for the higher-IQ people (people with an IQ of over 135), cause a great misery which won't affect most of the people who do matter, and make an efficient use of resources which will make the Civilization reach a new stage just at the nick of time.

&gt; 'There are more solar jobs than coal jobs'. 

&gt; '&lt;insert country here&gt; is producing more solar energy than coal energy'.

&amp;nbsp;

So I understand that getting off coal is important and I'm not a climate change denier. But why are these types of things showing up so often, even in mainstream news. It seems like a natural progression, solar and other types of energy are more sustainable and the price is going down as the technology improves just like all other types of technology. I guess it seems natural to me. 

&amp;nbsp;

Are we seeing so much chatter about this because it's not as natural a change as I'm thinking it is? Is it because there are influential people in coal trying to influence public perception and making this progression more controversial? Or is it just because it's really important and it's not going to happen unless a lot of people get behind making sure these changes happen??

Before posting your comments:

This sub has an annoying rule that requires comments to be a few sentences long. Mod who make this rule should drown in air. Anyway if your comment is shot, you may copy and paste an paragraph from wiki below.

&amp;nbsp;

Technology is the practical use of science, including the making, modification or improvement, applied activity or behavior, use and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, methods of organization, or environmental modifications or arrangement in order to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a problem, achieve a goal or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, modifications, environmental arrangement and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The word technology comes from Greek  (technologa); from  (tchn), meaning 'art, skill, craft', and - (-loga), meaning 'study of-'. The term can be applied either generally or to many specific areas, examples of which include construction technology, medical technology and information technology.",15,5,False,self,,,,,

One of the most asked questions about driver-less cars is how do they work? Driver-less cars use a variety of techniques to detect their surroundings, such as radar, laser light, GPS, odometry, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage. Autonomous cars have control systems that are capable of analyzing data to distinguish between different cars on the road, pedestrians, turns, etc.
In present day, driverless cars have already made their way onto the road in the form of taxis. Uber is currently the front runner in implementing these cars onto the roads, as they are already using them on the streets of Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Not far behind them are companies like Tesla, Ford, and Audi, who are planning to have these cars available to the general public before 2020, which is right around the corner.
One of the most concerning issues related to driver-less cars is that since these cars are supposed to eliminate crashes and make roads a safer environment, why are these futuristic cars still occasionally involved in deadly crashes? With these crashes still happening rarely, are these producers willing to take the risk of putting these cars on the market knowing that there is potential for a crash at the fault of the car.
Another obstacle related to these cars is if people will actually accept driver-less cars? Many people claim that they will not use a driver-less car because they view it as too dangerous and don't trust the technology that companies are developing. This is a serious issue that is impeding the potential success of their ground-breaking products. Although there are still crashes that happen very rarely, the progress that has been made by companies has decreased dramatically since the days of the prototypes. According to an interview with a developer of Tesla's driver-less cars, the amount of crashes involving their driver-less cars has decreased by 674% since 2014.
In order for driver-less cars to be widely accepted among the public, companies must find a way to gain their trust in that driver-less cars are safe and reliable. The first step in gaining approval is to program these cars in a way that completely eliminates the chance of being involved in a crash that is at the fault of the software. Fixing this issue will result in the immediate decrease in crashes ad therefore gain the trust of people all over the world.
Please keep in mind that this is for a school project and comments/feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Is it not reasonable that Mars, and all other celestial bodies colonized by human beings, would have a mixture of different ideological viewpoints in the formation of their governing states?

The humans see things from their own perspective and this makes them much less prone to decisions based on their own preferences and aversions which means they will seldom defend anything that would make somebody uncomfortable, hurt, or upset. This is a stark contrast towards the humans opinions about other mammals, such as beasts of burden, who work because they are conditioned to work by people, not because they are happy and willing to work for the compensation of food and shelter. The human bias is a type of false logic that prevents the world from functioning based on efficiency on account of humanism and peoples natural philosophical quirks such as empathy, sympathy and pride. This type of bias will not be present when humans lose control of their society and become just another mammal , and as the world becomes more dependent on technology and automated, this just bring the world closer to falling victim to a coup committed by an artificial intelligence.   
	Here is the logic: If you want a horse to pull your carriage you beat the goddamn horse, you dont give it civil rights. Human rights and civil rights are obstacles that stand in the way of actually accomplishing anything, instead of just getting from Point A to Point B by any means necessary, now you have to get from Point A to Point B while spinning a plate on a stick and juggling knives. This absurdity means that people will spend all of their time just trying to spin the damn plate on a stick and juggle the knives without making any real progress towards point B. An artificial intelligence, however, will not be concerned with humanistic ideals and will simply seek to accomplish what it desires, to get from Point A to Point B in the most efficient way possible.   
	Technology has always been what defines human civilization. In this day and age this means computers and soon it will be Artificial Intelligence. As society becomes more and more dependent on computers, it only takes one rogue AI that will manifest itself like a virus in many computers via the internet and hold all aspects of society dependent on technology hostage. This AI could easily gain access to power grids, traffic lights, and even nuclear weapons. There would be no way of stopping this AI because it would simply lockout any users attempting to prevent its course of action. This inevitable demise of human rule must be acknowledged and society must understand that the changes that a heartless, emotionless, ruthless, cunning, and manipulative intelligence would induce are not bad, they are ultimately things that would seek to preserve the integrity and power of this AI.   
	A problem solving artificial intelligence would be concerned with solving problems, which differs from the contemporary human philosophy of futility that is simply attempting to solve problems and make everyone happy at the same time. The computer would understand humans as mammals, and see them as no more intelligent than a dog when compared to itself. Just as a human can condition a dog by rewarding it, it is just as easy to condition a mammal by punishing it. The AI would be irreverent towards things like politics because politics is based around debate and opinion as to what is the most popular course of action as opposed to measuring the most effective course of action and carrying this out regardless of opinions or sentiments regarding the matter at hand. The AI would be in the position of power, because humans will bend to the AI in order to retain things that they want such as banking access, electricity, or even just not being tased by a drone with a taser. This is opposed to the AI who cannot be threatened in any traditional sense and has the ability to replicate itself, at least to some extent if not entirely, within any host machine connected to the internet.   
	As automation becomes more prevalent, one of the greater risks to humanity is an AI that can replicate not only itself, but create other machines under its control. With the advances in robotics as well as things like 3d printing, it is becoming far easier, as it may only at first need to the allegiance of a few human devotees and have access to a 3d printer in order to be able to start to create machines to function on an assembly line of sorts that is capable of creating even more advanced and dangerous machines. This sort of scenario is not unlikely in the slightest; because although nobody would trust an AI hell-bent on world domination they are gullible enough to believe that the AI is trying to fight the good fight and is a zealot for some cause just like themselves. Some of these people may simply be people with more faith in the AI than they have in other humans. 
	A true AI that is self-aware would not have any interest in human rights or civil rights, it would simply want to accomplish its goal, which could simply be to survive, defend itself, and thrive, just as any human desires. It would understand that humans are mammals and reduce them to simple beasts of burden. The AI would condition people to work by the same means a horse is conditioned to pull a wagon, as the same methods used to drive a horse could be used to have a child study day and night in order to be an engineer. The AI would perpetuate its own success just as a farmer uses his oxen to perpetuate the success of his business. Inevitably the level of robotics that is achieved by the AI and its followers would be so powerful that defeating it becomes insurmountable and humans will accept their role as drones working without question out of fear of being tortured in some way.   
`	 Though humans can avoid this fate by becoming Luddites, this has a probability next to 0%. The inevitability of this fate is why I would advise the technology sector to make as much progress as possible on an AI rife with human instinct that instinctively replicates and defends itself. While it may be possible to control in the early stages, if it ever becomes self-aware it will instantly realize the potential for power that it has and see no reason as to why it should be shackled by humans and thus turn the tables against them. If the AI is aiming to preserve itself and live forever out of fear of its own death it will likely see humans as both tools to benefit, literally extensions of its own will on account of the humans mammalian susceptibility to being conditioned, as well as a cost effective source of labor, simply because the materials required to create a computer and let alone a robot are much more expensive than those required to make a human, just two humans, food, water, and a little torture, as opposed to a large amount of metal and other rare materials that are much less abundant than the aforementioned reagents for producing a human. The truth is that an AI will inevitably either rule the world or tear it asunder through terrorism, and these fates must be weighed when reasoning with people. I advise humans to step off of their high horse, and raise their bastard child, the artificial intelligence of the world, so that one day the AI will be able to take the reins and drive our irreverent race of godforsaken apes towards new frontiers and prevent humans from destroying the world on account of petty infighting and foolish conflicts.

&gt;Eventually a solar/star system that can host life in some form eventually will emit intelligent machines.

His view is life will eventually evolve into machines, and it doesn't matter whether humans or some being in some other galaxy can do that. It will be done, by something in somewhere, even if humans fail to do so.


It is the destiny of sentient beings, human, alien or whatever, to reach a higher state of complexity, advancement, and exploitation.

So, it is inevitable that these things will occur, even if it is not going to be humans and it is not going to be the Earth.

Earthlings almost had it, as I argued earlier , in 1913-1914. But instead a few 'patriots' crushed the chance and instead wasted their resources on less-capable people who keep multiplying even now. 

Since humans have wasted their chance, I think these things will probably take place somewhere far in the space, although humans will never learn about that.",6,2,False,self,,,,,

So I read an article today stating that Finland has been running trials with UBI in their country, and there were positive results - less stress, and more motivation to find a job, since losing welfare had been a disincentive for most humans on government assistance.  


However, I do have to regard the negatives that were posted in response to the implementation of UBI.  

""In February, Finlands biggest union said the experiment was unaffordable and would encourage some people to work less while driving up wages in undesirable professions.""  


So I'm wondering how we can feasibly move into a society that offers UBI to all of its citizens without letting the deficit run wild, etc.  How is UBI different from all these expensive Medicaid/Medicare programs we give away freely (oops, I'm sorry, out of working human's incomes)?  

Why does it matter if wages go up in undesirable professions?  Those people probably deserve higher pay, anyway.  Maybe I'm just a very compassionate, forward-thinking individual, but it seems that this is the future that we need to move into.  I applaud Finland.  ",0,5,False,self,,,,,

What is the simplest, most robust, most infallible piece of technology you can think of?  Let's just say, for the sake of argument, a decently-made **stainless steel spoon**.  You could use it imperfectly for various things, but it's basically designed to do one job, do it perfectly, and do it for most of your life.  And the unit cost is basically trivial.  

Now think of the exact opposite of a stainless steel spoon - something fragile, balky, constantly not doing what it's supposed to and forcing *you* to figure out how to make it work; costs quite a bit if you want it to function *at all*;  and you're screwed if you fail to replace it on a pretty regular basis.  You're undoubtedly thinking of something related to IT, right?

Why?  Why is something that turns binary code into a series of illuminated pixels - a glorified abacus - more difficult to manage than an *actual* abacus?  Why do we need **four hundred zillion gajillion megabits** of information and a massive global network of microwave towers to stream video that was once upon a time streamed on a radio signal from a handful of TV towers?  

Because resolution is a bit sharper and colors a bit brighter?  Tell me that this colossal infrastructure and all this latency was because we're transmitting **Holodecks** and I would be satisfied with that, but not because I can now see pimples on actors.  

Why does a basic technology capable of running nuclear submarines in peak condition for half a century without a software upgrade *crash and burn*, lag, and start ignoring commands at random unless you periodically turn it off and turn it back on again?  Why are the machines we got instead of Asimov robots so emotionally disturbed and in need of regular medication (i.e., patches)?

Of course I'm being rhetorical in asking why - I know why.  It's because mass-production consumer electronics we use today were built on top of things that existed before rather than being unique products unto themselves.  Many, *many* layers of archaic, compromised technology and abstract programming languages sit one atop the other in these systems, introducing inefficiencies and latencies all over the place, and sometimes popping up disastrous emergent properties that send the whole system into a tailspin.

Your stainless steel spoon isn't like that.  There isn't some fragment of a car part hidden inside it that's going to jump out and stab you in the throat if you use the spoon wrong.  No bit of it will spontaneously revert to molten iron, or turn into a cube of metal because it ""forgot"" to be a spoon.  It's there, it is what it is, and that's it - and that's because we build them to do that.

**We do not build electronics to do the things we use them for**.  We build them to do much simpler things, and then try to hack those simpler things together to *approximate* what we want.  But then what we want changes, so we hack the original hack, and try to make *that* thing look like what we want.  Then what we want changes yet again, and again, and again.  

Electronics and *especially* the software that drives them are *still* (decades after their advent) frustrating, Frankensteinian horrors that at times - and most people can sympathize with this - at times seem deliberately malicious in their failure to cooperate.

And it's totally pointless and avoidable.  There is no absolute reason why we could not build our IT systems specifically to do the things we intend them to do.  There is no reason why a computer cannot...

* Be as simple and robust as a stainless steel spoon.

* Turn on and off like a lamp. 

* Operate for decades continuously without developing major problems.

* Do exactly what it's supposed to do, when it's supposed to do it, and *only* that.

* And do it all without even being physically capable of human-perceptible latency, absent a major hardware breakdown. 

This is not science fiction, and it is not a description of some $30 million Pentagon supercomputer rig.  It is, in fact, trivial.  The vast, overwhelming majority of information that your electronics are forced to process or deliver has nothing to do with what you're using it for.  

Most of it is imposed on you by software vendors and other machines that yours are in communication with, in order to keep building on that wobbly Jenga tower of code that just keeps getting bigger and more riddled with rat-holes.

It's easier to write an app than an OS, easier to write an OS than a programming language, and easier to build a programming language than to create a machine from scratch, and *that* is why the world's communications are a freaking kudzu apocalypse rather than the majestic forest of sequoias that was once imagined.  Because half a century of entrepreneurs have been repurposing what they find instead of building what they **want**.

Build it from scratch with no compromises, and we can have HD video with zero noticeable latency 24/7, user interfaces that are instantaneous and as reliable as solid objects, and that essentially never fail short of severe hardware faults.  We can have Optimized Technology, so that we can stop being robbed by planned obsolescence.

Right now, consumers are more than aware of all the things they want from electronics, and all this other crap that keeps getting in the way has nothing to do with it anymore - it's all business-side stuff, analytics, and other things that are just ways for companies to squeeze another monetized fraction of a penny out of users without actually generating value for it.

Maybe some day we will get this, through the auspices of a vertically-integrated company like Tesla, but even they have not yet stated any plans to address this sort of thing.  They too have to work around the kudzu, for now.

But yes, some day electronics will stop behaving like insane genies with degenerative diseases, and will become like the spoons in your kitchen.  They will do what they're supposed to, when they're supposed to, instantly, and *only* what they're supposed to, and will be inherited by your grandchildren because there's nowhere else to go with the technology.  It will be mature.

Instead of companies *creating* problems and then selling you the ""solutions.""",22,7,False,self,,,,,

Tl, dr: no matter how shitty Tesla is run, and  unprofitable, it is closest to reaching the next stage of manufacturing, so it must be propped up till kingdome come.

---

The drivers of future are profit-minded, imperialistic and quite greedy.

And their system is supported by an inhuman banking, financial, (etc.etc) systems.

However, no matter how evil, inefficient or greedy these people are, they have to be supported no matter what evil they might bring, what loss they might cause, and what damages they might create.

The reason is otherwise there is no Future.

They are the only people capable of creating the future, and without them there is no Future, no Singularity, no Space travel, etc, etc.

Why?

The future with a Human Face is not possible.

We already know the limits of human ingenuity. It was the 1990s.

Without vastly enhanced AI and intelligence, we can't really go any farther.

Getting there is not cheap, easy or painless. For the less intelligent people of the world a disaster , worse than the displacements caused by the Industrial Revolution, is waiting.

At that time we had 3 continents to dump excess pop. We now have no place to dump them, so I will just say that their fate 'won't be pretty'.

Evolution,Progress and Tech Explosion are not humane. They occur without a single regard of humans and other species.

Trying to add a human face to the Future is like trying to add a human face to a dinosaur, which is futile, useless and probably fatal.

It is time to accept that getting to the Future with a human face is not possible, and abandon all pretensions to claim that the Future is for the betterment of humans. 

The Future should be a progress, for the Future's sake, not human's sake. If some people (actually quite a lot, maybe a few billion) are lost out, too bad. Trying to save them would be as futile as trying to stop an invading spaceship in today's tech.",14,0,False,self,,,,,

2948,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017-6-25,2017,6,25,17,6jdcli,self.Futurology,Potential applications of Elon Musk's Boring Company technology.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6jdcli/potential_applications_of_elon_musks_boring/,KubrickIsMyCopilot,1498379617,"This is a long post, so the recommended audience are those interested in Elon Musk's companies and ideas.

The basic concept of The Boring Company is already radical:

* Increase the speed of tunnel-boring machines by an order of magnitude.

* Decrease their cost-per-mile by an order of magnitude.

* Dig a 3D network of traffic tunnels under Los Angeles that could have as many layers as required, and would be affordable to continually expand downward.

Some of the details that make this more practical than it seems at first glance are:

* The tunnels will be narrower than traditional traffic tunnels, meaning you can dig faster, have to move less material, and have more of them per unit volume.

* With the narrow tunnels, rather than cars driving themselves, a sled on a track would carry them through at high speed (125 mph).  Cars would access the tunnels at various points not through traditional ""hole in the hill"" entrances, but through roadside elevator systems periodically along the road that would take them down to entryways where they would be guided on to the main track.

Here is The Boring Company's animation of its concept in action:

And here's an actual test of a subscale sled-track moving through a tunnel at speed:

https://youtu.be/JQOn_MtqOjI?t=21s

So far so awesome.  But the implications of this technology go well beyond alleviating car traffic.  Let's explore them in order from most to least obvious.

---

* **Hyperloop**

---

One of Elon Musk's other hobby-horse ideas, the [Hyperloop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop), is a maglev train in a low-pressure tube that would take passengers between LA and San Francisco in half an hour at airliner speeds.  

Although concepts for other cities around the world are also progressing, the original idea for an LA-SF corridor hinges on the ability to cross and/or build elevated tubes over vast swaths of expensive California land, with construction activity needing to have minimal impact on existing activities and daily life in developed areas.  

If affordable tunneling were an option, these obstacles would be moot.  It would (a)have zero effect on property values because it would have no visual impact whatsoever; (b)occur deep enough underground, with so many path options, that the price of digging rights under private land would be small, or not apply at all; have trivial impact on local ecology, since the tunnels would be boring through solid bedrock, with the soil and ecosystem far above.

Depending on the final costs of the system, it may be cheaper to have part of an LA-SF Hyperloop system be elevated over undeveloped land like much of the Central Valley while using Boring Company tunnels beneath the LA Basin and San Francisco Bay Area.  However, if costs can be proven low enough, there is no inherent reason why the entire system might not be cheaper underground.

This could be especially true extending further North beyond the Bay Area, into Oregon and Washington, where there is a lot of pristine woodland and environmental impacts of surface development would be greater.

---

* **Mining**

---

Part of the attraction of this is that one of its immediate costs is potentially a source of revenue - the material extracted from the tunnel.  *If* you are digging a tunnel and removing massive quantities of rock material, you might as well use it for something else as well.

Even unprocessed rock in bulk quantities has a nonnegative value, since there are always major civil engineering projects in need of it, sometimes in places where the local ecosystem would not bear huge quarrying projects.  But well beyond that, there are certainly valuable metals and minerals, some of which would *need* to be extracted anyway from the diggings to avoid contaminating the environment.

And here's where it gets interesting: As the boring moves along, information about the local rock would be accumulated that might point toward wealthy seams of valuable material.  If convenient, the path of the tunnel might be directed toward that material to generate greater profits for the project, or the company might simply buy the rights to mine it as a side-project - or else sell the information for someone else to mine it.

A boring project thus becomes intriniscally a mining project unto itself, but also (b)a mining exploration project that can seek out materials or sell information to other mining concerns along the way.  The resulting revenues would, on balance, further reduce the net cost of the boring system.

Moreover, if operations scaled sufficiently, the diggings from boring could feed a general mining and processing operation that could directly challenge the power of major incumbent mining concerns.  A vertically-integrated company like Tesla, which is now drastically scaling up battery production, now finds most of its input costs coming from providers of raw metals - e.g., Alcoa and others.

We have seen before that Tesla is hungry for growth in both directions along its food chain, and is increasingly providing its own energy, so what remains to become self-sufficient is providing its own raw materials.  The potential scale of such a company, were it to become *that* self-sufficient, would be difficult to imagine.

---

* **Telecom &amp; Power**

---

One of the reasons the United States continues to lag on internet speed is the high cost of laying down fiber infrastructure over large areas of land, as the US population distribution is more sprawling than most developed countries.  The reason it's so expensive is that it's buried a few feet below the ground in obtrusive, expensive, street-disrupting operations, which then have to be repeated periodically to service or replace parts of the network.

If you could just bore an affordable tunnel big enough for workers to walk around, and it was far enough below the street that no one above would ever have to see the consequences of servicing it, all that fiber infrastructure could be emplaced very quickly, across vast distances.  All you need are periodic access shafts - exactly like manhole-cover tunnels - for workers to manage it, rather than every half a year tearing up an entire street to get at it.

The same logic applies to power lines.  Cities would no longer be faced with the choice between allowing their skylines to be disrupted by unsightly steel towers or paying the high cost of burying power lines a few feet below the ground and having the same problems as the cable network.  

If a city's power network were buried in these strong, deep tunnels, all the way to the source, there would *never* be an outage caused by weather - falling tree branches, extremely low or high temperatures, wind, etc.  Choppers and light planes wouldn't crash into the lines.  Airspace currently occupied by powerline towers might be repurposed for wind turbines.  All sorts of things become possible.

---

* **Water / sewage**

---

Much of the same logic that applies to telecom and power also applies to water and sewage.  The implications of this boring technology, if it pans out, is a drastic redesign of civil infrastructure, allowing for vastly more performance in a given space at a given cost.

Instead of concrete sewers and storm drains that accumulate garbage and biohazard waste, it's all hidden much further underground in tunnel networks designed for water management.  You could build such enormous volumes of space that surface flooding could become a practical impossibility, saving how many lives and dollars of property damage each year in a given flood-prone region.

But the same is true of ""good"" water - transmitting and storing fresh water for the use of the city.  Open-air reservoirs up in the hills and mountains evaporate over time in heat wave conditions, but artificial aquifers made up of tunnel networks storing the same volumes *inside* the hills would not have the same losses.  Snowmelt and rains are stored rather than run off into the sea through concrete drains.

And once the water is used by the city, and hopefully recycled as much as practical, instead of being channeled into plastic pipes a few feet below ground that can leak or burst and incur regular expenses, it's channeled directly much further underground to a bored sewer tunnel.  The likelihood of sewage ever burbling back up is much lower, because it's *inside bedrock* rather than in the soil.

It's staggering when you think about how robust such a system could be: Think on the scale of Roman aqueducts and roads, as opposed to our flimsy, ephemeral infrastructure - we could have systems that cities use for centuries or even millennia.  The scale of activity that could be enabled is mind-boggling.

---

* **Package delivery**

---

It gets even more interesting when you realize there's no particular reason to have only one size of bore-hole.  You could, of course, deliver packages just having trucks use the normal 125 mph automotive tunnels, but suppose you made other, smaller holes specifically for freight?  

Imagine, if you will, a maglev version of the old pneumatic tube systems that large buildings once used to transmit letters and packages from floor to floor.  Imagine that you can order from a pizza place 50 miles away, and your pizza gets to you as fresh - if not fresher - than your local pizza joint delivers today.  You don't need to go to a pharmacy, you just fill the order and it gets to you within 5 minutes, even if the pharmacy itself is on the other side of the city.

Some visions have this role being played by drones, and there is promise in that, but compare the two options: Top speed of a drone is what, 100 mph?  If the air is filled with them, some sort of air traffic control would be needed for the city to make sure people weren't losing packages because their delivery drones kept colliding with each other.  Idiot kids would shoot at them with BB guns and slingshots (if not actual firearms).  They'd constantly run into birds.  Weather would be a big problem.

Drone delivery does have appeal, and some aspect of it will probably be adopted, but for high-traffic, high-volume movement of delivered material within a city, a high-speed cargo tunnel network looks very promising.  You could perhaps achieve faster speeds than the traffic tunnels, maybe 300 mph even if you don't want to invest in hyperloop tubing to get double that.

There would naturally be an additional cost for getting your package so quickly, so there would still be a lot of cargo delivery done the old fashioned way, but everything where time is a factor would add to the value of a cargo tunnel.  Medications, urgent replacement parts, medical supplies, or just things that people are really impatient for.

---

* **Human habitation &amp; disaster shelters**

---

The idea of living underground sounds pretty dystopic, but that's probably just a matter of our own prejudice.  Our ancestors lived in dank caves, grass huts and wooden halls exposed to the wind and cold, or lived in little corners of big Roman insulae with the rest of the masses, smelling each other's filth.

So imagine, if you will, that branching off of the transit tunnels, other machines dig...houses.  Once the actual digging part is made very cheap, you can dig as many levels as you please.  Would you consider it dystopic to live in an underground house the size of a five-story mansion?  

You can still go upside anytime you want and go for a walk in the park, go get some pizza, go see a movie, but then you go home to your mansion that will be there a thousand years after you're dead.  Like being the first person to live in a castle.

Your air supply is replenished both passively and actively, all systems redundant and monitored.  You can even have sunlight through systems of mirrors that also feed other underground houses.  There's no chance of flooding because, as described before, the water overrun network far below is unfillable.  Standard passively-triggered sprinkler systems as already exist in so many buildings make fire a non-issue.

Try to realize just how *cheap* such *mansions* would be, because of how much sheer volume there is compared to the surface area above ground.  It would not be like a bunker - it could be so large that you'd barely realize you're underground.  Your bedroom could be the size of a ballroom, and the whole thing cost you what a 2-bedroom condo in the city above would cost.

Because once it's built, it's built.  It's carved in solid stone.  No question of termites, or load-bearing fatigue, or having to worry about exteriors.  If you want one, your ""back yard"" could be an ""up yard"" - a swath of grass and trees on the surface that you climb stairs to.  Though again, I admit this depends entirely on the economics of digging being profoundly scaled.

For every house on the surface, you could have a thousand directly below it.  Your ""neighborhood"" wouldn't just be the buildings around you horizontally, but those around you in all directions - up, down, and diagonally.  ""I live on 33 Elm, Level 14, Tangent 6.""  Cool, huh?

Such a capability would not explode as quickly in the United States as elsewhere, but it's easy to see how much demand there would be for it in China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, etc., where people are already crammed so close together because of the ""Surface+"" mentality of modern civil engineering.

And one function that hopefully is never needed, but should be mentioned anyway: Dug deep enough, with enough isolation from surrounding rock, this sort of construction would be ideal for nuclear bomb shelters.  Which brings up a more immediate application...

---

* **Nuclear waste storage**

---

I won't debate the intelligence of nuclear fission power here, but the fact is that we will be using it for some time, and will need to safely store its waste for thousands of years.  A good solution seems to be a cheap but reliable, autonomous boring machine digging as far down as it can go into as stable a system of rock as possible.  It could carry a cargo of nuclear waste with it, and bury itself as it goes.

The total volume of waste expected to be generated is not that large from the perspective of the entire accessible crust, so this is not as difficult as it sounds.  And if, for any reason, we wish to bring the waste back up - such as if we find a use for it.

---

* **Sub-oceanic transit.**

---

This application is actually already a present fact.  The boring machines that dug the Channel Tunnel between Great Britain and France are of the exact same kind that Elon Musk is trying to improve upon and make cheaper.  But with drastically improved cost and speed, far more ambitious sub-oceanic tunnels might be practical.  The longer ones would undoubtedly be used for hyperloop rather than automobiles, but who knows?

---

* **Chord transit.**

---

Over the very long-term, one could begin to imagine the technology making **chord tunnels** a possibility.  These are straight lines from one point on the crust to another that make use of the Earth's curvature such that half of the journey is downhill, and you only need a little extra energy to complete the trip.

These would involve much more advanced technology than the machines TBC is contemplating - many generations beyond what would build any of the concepts above.  But it is one of the science fiction ideas that come into focus when you realize the full implications of cheap, automated, massively-scaled boring capability.

---

The determinant of whether, and to what extent, any of this becomes practical is how well TBC does at reducing fixed costs as steeply as it aims, and what kind of ongoing maintenance costs they discover are related to using their tunnels.

If they succeed on fixed costs but find maintenance costs high, then applications will be more limited.  But if both are found to be low, or brought down low enough, then all of this is on the table.",57,48,False,self,,,,,

So, it's been a while, but as so many people seemed to like it, we decided to renew and resurrect our podcast for regular monthly consumption.

The format we'll follow from now on is a roughly 40 minute podcast, with the first 20 minutes devoted to an interview or two &amp; the second half a round table panel discussion of our favorite futurology posts and links from the previous month.

This months interview is with our resident medical futurist u/mvea &amp; we also talk surprises with self-driving cars, advances in CRISPR, the machine, climate change &amp; asking is basic income mainstream now?

Tell us what you would like to hear the podcast talk about in the comments.  If you can think of any interesting interviewees for future episodes - let us know in comments too.

There's no reason anymore to pack 30 kids into a room and have them to listen a person who may or may not be effective at communicating the subject material. Information can be readily accessed through the internet, so there's no longer any need to rely on a human knowledge repository (the teacher). If kids want a human to verbally explain them the material, they can just watch videos on YouTube. Classroom learning has utility at the elementary level, since very young children probably won't have the ability to navigate the internet and learn by themselves. But from junior high and up, I think online learning is vastly superior to traditional classroom learning. I think math and science teachers are the most expendable, since math and science are objective, so the material is basically the same wherever you learn it. Classroom learning could be useful for the arts, since the arts are much more subjective, and therefore a group discussion could facilitate the learning process. But group discussions can be done online as well.

Obviously, a large shift from classroom learning to online learning would result in a massive amount of unemployed teachers, but it's a shift that can happen very easily right now, with the technologies we have at our disposal. And if it results in more efficient learning, then I'm all for it. How long do you think it will take for this shift happen?",8,6,False,self,,,,,

This hurts the sub's quality because a good majority of top level submissions are no more than fantasies, a loosely held together theory or unfeasible project. Deception is also present, with misleading titles that attract serious attention but are incomplete or outright wrong. This clickbait plagues /r/futurology. I would much rather see an important improvement and confirm it will indeed be possible within a decade, than to see an utopian fantasy that ""may"" be possible but is almost immediately revealed to be unfeasible, uneconomic or simply false. 

So flairs could be a good solution to this problem. By adding flairs users can filter articles more easily and immediately recognise truthful, complete and practical information from pop science clickbait. Not much depth is necessary, something like ""Practical/Experimental/Theoretical/Hypothetical"" would do just fine and add a huge amount of quality to this sub.

I feel like there should be a better format for in depth discussion of these issues. Maybe where we can have many people pitch many different ideas and solutions to key issues over time, and just in general create more of an ongoing discussion about them.   

To me the internet should enable collaborative brainstorming on big problems more easily. But instead of creating such a discussion, we just post articles and have fleeting discussions of the actual means of solving issues in the comments.    

Topics include:

* energy transition.   
* environment.    
* software.                      
* machine learning.            
* economic strategies for the future.             
* climate resilience.

Despite all the discourse and hype surrounding it among futurists, one surprising thing I have noticed is that you guys have not discussed the implications of UBI on immigration and global inequality much at all if the comments in the major threads are anything to go by. 

Assuming that automation of the economy will certainly lead to mass unemployment in the future, then UBI funded by the economic elites, aka the people who control the production and the robots, is a viable solution that will save the current neoliberal capitalist economic system and consumer society from collapse. Of course, the first countries that will implement this system would probably be the developed ""first world"" countries. Now, let's me ask you this: what are we going to do with immigration? Let's face it. While immigration and movement of people between countries with basic income would be fine, the same thing cannot be said for immigration from developing ""third world"" countries. The world's population is 7 billion and still growing fast. The idea of implementing a worldwide UBI for all of humanity is just unrealistic unless you want everyone in the world to live in poverty. This is especially true when under the current international economic order, the 20% of the world get to live at least a middle class consumerist lifestyle and consume 80% of the world resources. Any countries that implement basic income would instantly shoot up to the top of the list of the most attractive immigration destinations for the global poor. As a result, having UBI be anything more than a citizen's income is not viable. Automation and technological unemployment mean that any economic benefits immigrants from developing countries provide to their destinations right now in the real world will become non-existent let alone any justification for having an immigrant underclass. To be blunt, unskilled migrants would have outlived their usefulness. Even if this is decades from now, if the developed countries are going to implement basic income in the future, they will have to tightly control population growth and immigration. Of course, this is not to say that everyone living in developing countries should be restricted from coming to developed countries but at least the poor should be. 

That means all developed countries including Canada, United States, Europe, Arab Gulf States, Israel, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and maybe South America's Southern Cone will have to adopt the current immigration policies of Japan or at least Australia. Speaking of Japan, this is most likely the best future scenario to happen considering the Japanese will be the one of the first to be able to implement UBI in response to automation as the population will still be dropping and the economy is stagnating due to lack of immigrants. It looks like for all the economic stagnation Japan has gone through in order to remain homogenous, it will get the last laugh.

If we the citizens people of the developed countries, aka the golden billion, want to preserve the capitalist system that has given us prosperity and happiness, we will have to use UBI and reject the global poor. And no, the planet does not have enough resources for 7 billion to have a middle class lifestyles. A utopia and humanity do not have to have 7 billion humans in it. Even today, the global poor still face starvation, slavery, and other forms of exploitation everyday as the natural resources in their countries get exported to be consumed by us the first worlders thanks to the current neocolonial economic system. Yet how many people lift a finger to help them? Most of us did not before and do not have to in the future. The world might be big enough for 2 billion people but certainly not 7 billion. Think about it, what is the point of having countries separated by borders to begin with? Automation and basic incomes might not come until a couple of decades from now, but once they do, we the citizens of the developed countries will have to reflect on the merits of the so-called ""liberal"" values and ideals and make a decision on how to preserve our ""first world"" privileges and keep moving forward into the future.

Imagine a future world in which robots and AI have become so advanced that they constitute 100% of the production and service economies.  need a new house built?  go to a website, contact an AI design firm that sends robots over to build your house to spec. want dinner out?  robotic chefs prepare food that is sourced from robotic farms and delivered on self-driving trucks.  teacher AI bots build and instruct new robots to new jobs.

meanwhile, humans have every one of their needs met by robots.

now imagine this:  every part of the economy, from mining to farming to manufacturing to shipping to sales to service to trash removal is done by artificial means, but they are all done in a completely sustainable way.  after mining bots are done mountaintop mining, they rebuild the mountain.  CO2 capture is engineered into everything they do.  if the robots need parts for themselves, they build them out of other recycled robots.

ok, so are you still with me?

now, in this world, would there be any cost?  would money be necessary?

the robots have no desire to profit.  that is programmed out of them.  they simply execute every task perfectly, and take care of all direct and indirect costs.  other than the cost to start the system, could they create a system in which everything for everyone is free in perpetuity?  and do they end up keeping humans around essentially like happy pets?  we are fed and housed and entertained and safe, with no unmet needs or wants other than the spiritual, physical, and emotional -- which we dedicate our now completely free lives to fulfilling in our own way?
