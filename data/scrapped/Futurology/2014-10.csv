I dreamed that by now we would basically be watching miniature Macross fights. 
My questions are: 

1)	Would a revitalized combat robot form (with few/no restrictions) be popular? (Remote cameras of course, too dangerous for live audience)

2)	Would you, random citizen, watch a show that rewarded awesome robot battles with weapons?

3)	Would this advance Robot tech in any way? Or would it be counterproductive?

4)	 Could biped or quadruped or flying  robots ever have a chance? 

5)	Could you ever forget that stupid Hugh Jackman movie that made the whole sport look retarded?

Do you want to be a stroke victim, or so frail you can no longer climb stairs? That lies in your future unless something is done, and for the first time in history we are at a place where something could be done. A start can be made, and [SENS rejuvenation research](http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research) is that start.

There are two kinds of futurist. Those who watch and those who act. The future isn't an accident that just happens. It is exactly what we choose to make it, no more, no less. We would like to see a future that involves proficient medical control of aging as soon as possible, a future in which our friends and families no longer decline, suffer, and die just because the years pass. Rather than simply hope and follow the news in frustration, we choose to do something about it.

Who are we? We are Christophe and Dominique Cornuejols, David Gobel of the Methuselah Foundation, Dennis Towne, Hkon Karlsen, philanthropist Jason Hope, Michael Achey, Michael Cooper, and Reason of Fight Aging! We're all long-time supporters of SENS research aimed at rejuvenation through repair of the known causes of aging. For every dollar of the next $50,000 donated to the [SENS Research Foundation](http://sens.org) before the end of 2014, we will will donate an additional $2. Please join us, and step over to the side of futurism that makes things happen.

Donations to the SENS Research Foundation support ongoing research programs aimed at repair of specific, well-known forms of damage to cells and tissue structure that cause aging. This is perhaps the only organization in the world at present focused on coordinating and funding the treatment of aging by repairing its causes. This early stage research is funded near entirely by charitable donations.

**Did You Know That Early Stage Research Costs Little?**

Most discussions of medicine involve enormous sums of money, but near all of that is involved in taking new science from prototype to product available in the clinic. The actual work of performing early stage research to create those prototype treatments has become very cheap, especially over the past two decades in which progress in biotechnology has followed the same trends as progress in computing. Today $50,000 can fund a significant work of original research that would have required tens of millions of dollars and an entire laboratory back in the mid 1990s. Research is cheap; it is the clinical application of research that remains painfully expensive. But if you have a prototype treatment for aging demonstrated in the lab - well, money is no longer an issue, because people will fall over themselves to fund its commercialization.

The state of SENS rejuvenation research today is that it is gathering support, on the way to prototypes, and in need of more funding to speed up progress. Unfortunately this is the stage of development for any new technology in which established funding institutions essentially sit on the sidelines and wait for a technology demonstration or a prototype to turn up out of the blue. So if we want to see faster progress, we have to help make it happen ourselves.

**With Help, SENS will be Tomorrow's Mainstream**

Every new paradigm must start somewhere, and that includes work on effective therapies to prevent and reverse aging based on repair of its low-level biological causes. SENS rejuvenation research is a tiny sliver of today's aging research community, most of whom are either doing nothing to intervene in the aging process at all, merely studying it, or are pursing approaches to slow down aging that are both extremely hard to achieve and will result in only marginal benefits if eventually realized. It is telling indeed that after fifteen years and billions of dollars of earnest work researchers still cannot produce ways to slow aging anywhere near as reliably and well as calorie restriction and exercise. They don't even yet have a full understanding of how calorie restriction and exercise produce these effects.

Thus the path towards drugs to slow aging by altering metabolism is a dead end, a slow boat to nowhere useful. When you are old and damaged, will you want someone to turn up with drugs that can slow down the progress of aging? No, because it will be of no use to you. Yet the researchers working on the development of those drugs believe it will be decades before they have any sort of result to show for their efforts. The only way to help the old is to develop means of rejuvenation, based on repair of damage, not merely slowing it down.

How do we escape this dead end? By pushing enough funding into early stage work on rejuvenation after the SENS model to show that it is a superior path, capable of producing far better results are a much lower cost. The big money will then follow the results. Making this happen is where we come in, building the future that we want to see.

**We Have Fundraiser Posters!**

You can find an attractive set of posters for this fundraiser at Fight Aging!:

[https://www.fightaging.org/fund-research/#posters](https://www.fightaging.org/fund-research/#posters)

Show them off to your friends and print them out for noticeboards. The more attention we draw to this cause, the better. Treatment of aging is reaching a tipping point in the public eye, moving from something seen as science fiction to something seen as science - and the faster that happens the better off we'll all be.

**Launched in Coordination with Longevity Day**

The 1st of October marks the launch of this fundraiser, but it is also the [International Day of Older Persons](http://www.un.org/en/events/olderpersonsday/), and the [International Longevity Alliance](http://longevityalliance.org/) would like this to become an official Longevity Day. This year, just like last year, groups of futurists around the world will be holding events to mark the occasion, and this includes the scientists and advocates present at the [2014 Eurosymposium on Healthy Aging](http://www.eha2014.org/).

I too think that is an absolutely excellent idea, and so I wanted to get the conversation going. 

Perhaps, to get the brains moving, we could start with what our plan of contribution would be? 

Personally I want to help on the energy side of things. Power is life, and we depend on it more and more every day. As other nations develop, they will need more power too. This is a *good* thing! It is not a bad thing. 

I got told a wonderful story once about a team who went to set up a small farming village with solar lights. When the team returned some time later, they asked the village leader what the lights had meant to him. The leader answered ""Life."" You see, having light meant they could see if there were holes to fall in or sharp objects to fall on or snakes to step on. 

And that is just one thing! It had a profound effect on me. I was always concerned with the environment and the effect our fossil fuel consumption had on it. Hearing this story made me realize that I also cared about people getting to use the power that they do need. 

So now I am going to school for Computer Engineering Technology. With this diploma I can work as an Electronics Engineering Technologist. This position exists in a lot of industries. My particular area of focus is going to be on signalling devices for the alternative energy industry. The demand there is only going to grow as these devices get more and more sophisticated, and maybe I can help with that sophistication!

tl;dr// Let's start planning for the future. Here is my plan. What is your plan?",15,32,False,self,,,,,

-------------------

It is a well-known fact that passenger trains are inefficient and uneconomical.
The premise of this map is that technological advances in the near future will make high-speed trains economical.
Robot cars are the essential technology.
The defining feature of the network is the ability of robot cars to drive up alongside trains and transfer passengers while the trains are moving.
Today's robot cars drive at moderate speeds, but robots of the future will be crack stunt drivers able to hold a steady position alongside a train at over one hundred miles per hour!
Not shown on the map is the connectivity between the rails and the existing road network.
Passengers will be able to board and exit trains at any point on the railroads.
Today's trains service train stations, points on the map located only at major destinations.
Zero-dimensional points can be upgraded to one-dimensional lines, suplemented by the two-dimensional area coverage of a robot car service.
Trains could take on passengers from rural areas.
They could carry suburban commuters without making frequent stops.
Passengers could transfer from one train to another at intersections.

Airplanes are superior to current passenger trains, but these high-speed trains would have an advantage.
Airplanes can only transfer passengers at airports.
You may be wondering, though, if it would be better to have only robot cars and no trains.
It could turn out that way depending on how technology progresses.
The advantage trains have over cars is that metal wheels are more durable and more stable at a high speeds.
Cars are not able to drive that fast on regular roads or for long periods of time without wearing out their tires.
A highway system of high enough quality to enable the same speeds would be more expensive than the railroads.
The robot cars will only be able to match the speed of the trains on special roads built alongside the rails.
The roads may need to be exceptionally smooth or climate controlled.
The robot cars could latch onto the trains with arms for stability, or they could mount onto a secondary set of rails.
The trains may have to slow down to accomodate the robot cars.
The trains will likely drive faster in open country and slower when passing through high traffic areas.

The advantage of trains is speed.
Why is speed important?
A faster vehicle can do the job of two slower vehicles, saving money and taking up half as much space.
People will think of uses for high speed transit.
What seems like a luxury will become a necessity.
The labor market of the future will be fast-paced and extremely volatile.
Temp workers will shuffle from one job to another, doing multiple jobs a day at disparate locations.
A faster transit network could make the difference between working three jobs or working four.
Fast transit will enable increasing specilization of expertise.
An ultraspecialized service could be provided by a single expert traveling around to all the businesses in the country.
Fast transit will lower the barriers to entry for new businesses.
Entrepeneurs will assemble teams with talent drawn from across the country.
Speed will be important because these business ventures will themselves be of a transient, opportunistic nature.
The size of businesses will grossly expand and contract.
The government will not feel the desire to obstruct the ability of business to lay off workers because it will be easier for the unemployed to relocate to new jobs.
People will not have permanent employment or even permanent residence in the future.
The transit network will enable extremely low population density and magnify suburban sprawl.
Urbanization will extend in a web along the lengths of the railroads.
Europe and Asia may be at their population limits, but North America can afford to double in population.

The high-speed trains will also ship packages.
Robot vans will load packages onto mail cars just as robot cars load passengers.
The robot vans and the mail cars could have robot arms, conveyor belts and other devices for handling packages of various sizes.
High speed mail cars would fill a niche distinct from the freight rail network we have today.
Freight trains transport large items and materials between major destinations at low cost.
High-speed mail cars could do what Amazon, FedEx, UPS and the Postal Service do.
They will be less efficient than freight trains and much more expensive, but the greatly increased speed and two-dimensional area coverage could make it viable.
High speed package delivery may become another essential part of the frantic future.

A bride-to-be hires a wedding planner.
The suits, dresses, table cloths, napkins, silverware, tableware and everything else must be coordinated.
On a national database a la Craigslist, people volunteer pictures of all their stuff, even including things they aren't trying to sell.
Through this website, matching tablecloths and napkins are found.
A particular brand of silverware and tableware is selected, but no single owner has enough of each item to serve a hundred wedding guests, so the hundred units of each item are gathered together from multiple locations each.
The suits and dresses are sourced through a series of independent workers.
A designer in one city, a cloth factory in another, a retired senior citizen who does embroidery in their spare time, a group of high school students sewing the buttons to earn some spending money, and the tailor.
Getting the suits and dresses fitted and tailored requires sending them back and forth multiple times each to a different location.
The ideal uses for high-speed delivery would be artisinal crafts, fresh produce, cooked food, and anything needing doorstop delivery.

So what about the map? Accepting high-speed rail as a possibility, does this map show what such a network is likely to look like?
The map is ambiguous because it shows economical routes together with fanciful ones.
The most economical routes are those in California and the Eastern Seaboard.
The outcome of technological progress is uncertain. High-speed rail could have high viability in one possible future, and low viability in another.
In a future where high speed rail is not very viable, the California and Eastern Seaboard routes could be the ones built and nothing else.
In a future where high speed rail is highly viable, more of the lines shown on the map could be built.
In order of economy, the Great Lakes comes next, then the South, then the Northwest, then the Midwest. The least economical regions are the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains.
The Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains have a very low population today, but their population could expand greatly if they were connected to such a transit network.
A very fanciful detail has also been included, a Hyperloop running from Chicago to Beijing.
A Hyperloop connecting America and Asia might be viable in a best case scenario where fusion power is available.
Indeed, in such a scenario it would be faster than an airplane flying the same route.

The Hyperloop is the final element of the network.
A Hyperloop functions like an airplane.
It only makes stops at major destinations.
Ideally, Hyperloops must be perfectly straight to attain their top speed.
The Hyperloop on this map has curves of various tightnesses.
The tighter the curve, the slower the capsule must travel.
The map is intended to minimize curvage and provide as many straightaways as possible between the major destinations.",17,33,False,self,,,,,

When do you think our society will realize aging is the worst set of diseases that happens to us and we have to do something about it.

Hear me out...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2i6h72/i_think_climate_change_needs_to_happen_hear_me_out/,UdderHunter,1412335887,"Feel free to shit all over this, i could be completely wrong, and it's just one persons opinion out of 7 billion.

I will just start by saying I have read a great deal of the science, and also a lot of the skeptic's stuff as well, but see too many inconsistencies and contradictions in the skeptics' claims for me to comfortably say climate change isn't happening, and this current warming isn't due to vast quantities of human produced greenhouse gas emissions. All I have to do is look at [this](http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/55000/55167/earth_lights_lrg.jpg) when I hear a skeptic say ""humans haven't had an effect on the environment around them"".

Anyway, I think climate change needs to happen, because like the two world wars, it will ultimately lead to many radical and revolutionary changes. As absolutely horrific as the world wars were, they are responsible for our modern way of life. And just like the wars transformed the world through large scale industry, climate change will hopefully change the world through large scale technology, while at the same time teaching us not to ""shit where we eat"", and appreciate how unique and precious our home planet is.

[According to the IPCC's latest report](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/ar5/pr_wg3/20140413_pr_pc_wg3_en.pdf) (a culmination of all the current science on climate change), current emissions have us on track to exceed 2 degrees of warming, widely regarded by scientists in the field to be a dangerous level. But I think people will continue to deny the existence of global warming and humans' influence on it until shit gets real bad, which could be in 20 years, or it could be in 200 years, who the fuck knows?

But if things do get really bad, I think only then will we act collectively, as a species. This could create a level of cooperation never seen before in human history, and I think when that happens we will truly realise what we are capable of. If things get really bad, we will probably have to extract CO2 from the atmosphere which will require massive construction projects and humanity's first intentional attempt at geoengineering on a planetary scale.

The damaging effects of climate change, and the subsequent massive mitigation strategies, would lead to revolutionary changes in energy production and storage, construction, materials science, transportation, computing, robotics, automation, etc.

I think once we achieve all this, and see that we can clearly transform a planet, other things like expanding out into the solar system and other star systems won't seem so impossible.

Paradoxically, an existential threat, such as climate change, could ultimately secure our existence.

The USP of this was that it didn't require water in order to boil it, and I guess if done cleverly you could make good use of the actual light too.

Now far from it for me to determine what the best and most practical uses for lights are (this site nicely outlines some of the more conventional options http://lovelylamps.com and you might say it shouldn't go much beyond what they suggest) but I wonder if an idea like that could actually catch on?

I have not done extensive research in the area, but I thought I'd have some fun with it. Any criticisms, developments or other ideas are more than welcome.

North Korea has been a military nation, with people subscribing to a forced upon ideology for years. South Korea is one of the leading nations in education, technological advancements and economics. If the two became 'Korea', an incredibly strong influence on both sides could create interesting dynamics.


**Preferred future:** Peaceful relations will join the two nations as they push forward together, opening trade and becoming a large contributor to the asian market economy and eventually world economy. The two could influence positive policy change and create an increase in social programmes and develop new methods to battle assorted global issues.


**Alternative future 1:** As the two countries merge, NK citizens will be able to access the web and learn about the history of censorship and misrule, they could access world perspectives and a complete education transformation would take place as they gain access to a world of ideas and opinions. This could result in public riots that would force NK to close their borders again.


**Alternative future 2:** The warring nations would be able to gain a huge leap in military technology. NK would be able to upgrade their trained and 'loyal' citizens giving them a huge push as a military nation. Korea could grow an incredibly strong military force, while becoming an even larger player in the world economy. New developments in war technology could transform the social aspects of both countries, realizing their strength, NK could potentially influence SK to take a stronger stance in displaying that military strength, or they would find ways to quietly develop as to not draw attention from the US.


**Alternative future 3:** Very little changes, access to the internet is limited and educational reform takes place at a slower pace to reduce population anxiety. South Korea loses a ton of money trying to unite the populations in order to solidify years of mistrust and war. Different forms of racism will grow as populations begin crossing borders that could last for a number of years. There would also be a heavy investment from other nations in the economy as it opens up and they could become politically tied to the world market.",14,25,False,self,,,,,

   I live in the mid-west so it is not every often that anyone will even talk to me about this. The moment I say the word science they tend to go blank. That's even counting people with degrees or going to school.Which I think odd. 

And if anyone can tell me why is it soo hard to get anyone to talk in a real way about these things. This is what is going to happen  mostly I think because the people in charge don't really want it to happen. And would not know what to do with themselves without their control.

[in-depth],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2iccv9/giant_game_preserves_and_improved_ecosystems/,Randomosaur,1412494959,"Many opponents of genetic engineering and other technologies often say that it is better to let nature take its course, instead of interfering with it. Aside from this being the appeal to nature fallacy, it assumes that nature is a benevolent being. It is not. It is not a living, conscious being, it is simply a process. If anything, nature is malevolent. It changes, causing its own creatures to become extinct, and takes away life. I think humans can do better than nature to protect wildlife and biodiversity. Here are my ideas to create a better world for both humans and wildlife.

1. Giant preserves for wildlife. Surrounding large areas of land such as savannahs and forests with large walls and fences with gates for tourists could preserve wildlife while allowing for humans to interact with it. Places where this is happening include Pleistocene Park in Russia.
2. Allowing wildlife into cities. Basically allowing alligators into ponds, birds to nest on buildings, non-venomous snakes into backyards, and the like. Guards and wardens for these types of areas, as well as safety education, could minimize risks with this.
3. Terraforming. Build some desalination plants and other facilities on coastal areas in deserts. According to /u/guerillagreasemonkey in an /r/askreddit thread, if done in Australia, it could allow us to boost populations of desert animals like kangaroos and goannas, which could survive better since the regions won't be so harsh. This could not only assist wildlife, but also create tens of thousands of jobs for people, and make a lot of food and other goods, boosting the economy. If done in the Sahara, we could make lots of lakes and inland seas (the seas would become salt lakes without desalination plants though), and bring back the Saharan forests. We could re-introduce animals like the brown bear to fill the niche of the extinct Atlas bear, and such. It could also help with climate change. Some say that this would be bad for the Atlantic Ocean and Amazon, but the Sahara was a forest less than ten thousand years ago and there is no evidence this had a negative effect on either of them.
4. De-extinction and genetic assistance. There is work being done on this already. George Church at Harvard is putting woolly mammoth genes into elephant cells that code for proteins that produce cold-resistant hemoglobin, hair and subcutaneous fat. He could have a mammoth-elephant hybrid embryo in as little as three years to put into a surrogate Asian elephant mother. Bring mammoths back to Siberia and allowing them to eat grass could help prevent global warming by preventing greenhouse gas emissions from the grass and melting permafrost. Another notable one is the Uruz Project, which hopes to create a cattle breed as close to the ancestral aurochs as possible, using a combination of selective breeding and genome editing. The Quagga Project plans to create quagga-like zebras through selective breeding. All of these show a lot of promise. Genetic assistance involves studying the gene pools of endangered species and using genome editing technologies like CRISPR to increase the genetic diversity of species with low genetic diversity.
5. Man-made ecosystems. We could create artificial island ecosystems as ecological experiments. How about making a tropical island dominated entirely by reptiles like Komodo dragons and Galapagos tortoises as opposed to mammals or birds? How about an island of living fossils such as tuatara, weta, lungfish and reverse-engineered birds that resemble their dinosaur ancestors (with clawed hands, tails and teeth, for example)?

The likelihood of an existing species in our galaxy that is 1,000 years ahead of us [scientifically, technologically] is real. In fact, I'd say a species that is 100,000 years ahead of us is also possible. Now, think of the progress Humans have made in the last 150 years, scientifically and technologically speaking, from farming to the automobile, to air travel, to global communications, to health and genetics etc.

A species that is 1,000 years ahead of us would possess unimaginable technologies. Think of all the so far theoretical tech written about in today's blogs, nanotechnology (carbon nanotubes), widely accepted genetic engineering, 3D printing [organs, houses, etc], skyscraper farms, near unlimited energy via graphene based photovoltaic panels, and quantum computers that mimic human brain neural networks [I just pulled that out of my a**). I say theoretical because a lot of these technologies are presented in a light of ""We're still testing, and we're expecting to get these devices to market within 5 years."" There's a big difference between Staples selling a 3D printer so you can recreate your cellphone cover, versus printing your next house (This is already being done, but not at scale, so 6 years +/- 2?).

Take all those technologies, put them in a super efficient software driven economy and political system, then add at least three hundred years of deeper evolution, and you might start imagining what their day to day life might look like.

I've read this forum for months and really enjoy it.

The question is why do you guys think 3D printed houses are good at all?

You need an outer wall to deal with the elements, which is the bulkiest layer, but could be printed. Then you have a structural/insulation layer which needs to be flexible(read not concrete). Then you need the interior layer which needs to be the nicest as people directly interact with it.

Now, a 3D printed temporary house say in Alberta could be useful, but for the vast majority of people, how would 3D printing in housing help them? You can't 3D print a foundation, it needs to be dug out, have gravel put down and then concrete poured over top of it. And that's just the first layer.

Help me to understand peoples fascination with 3D printed homes.",11,21,False,self,,,,,

Topics we would discuss would be anything Futurology related.
Kind of like the ""this week in technology"" but the audio version, and hopefully it will be greatly more informative and down to earth.

Many people read the title or read the article and don't fully understand what the message is.  I would like to break down what the scientists and researchers are saying in a funny, informative way.  I would also like to talk about when the technology would likely come to consumers, etc.

If your a male or female and are interested, please identify which one you are when you inbox me &gt; trying to diversify opinions here.

Is this something you subscribers would listen to if we posted it on Futurology every week or two weeks?

This leads me to wonder - we keep talking about the coming sweep of automation but shouldn't trains be first?  It's a huge industry (vast majority of goods moved on land moved by trains) and the engines literally run on rails so you only need to adjust the speed.  You could design the things to change speed based on certain GPS coordinates so you wouldn't need to install sensors all over the place, although they already have those in many places to activate crossing lights and barriers.

Seriously, this industry seems so automatable that it should have been done already.  The ONLY thing I can think of is that there are still humans aboard trains to act as a liability sink - something goes wrong you blame the conductor first.  Which is crap, if a train goes through a semi at a crossing it very well might not have had time to stop given their stopping distance (sometimes measured in miles), the limited visual sensing a robot has compared to a human's long-distance vision wouldn't have made any difference.

So why do we still have human conductors?",4,5,False,self,,,,,

We will also be giving out two free Unity Pro licenses at the event -- one to the best demo of the show and one will be chosen in a raffle. 

It will be a crowd of developers, investors and enthusiasts all looking to build the future of VR. It should be a real blast!

The event kicks off at 7pm sharp and will take place at the Unity HQ located at: 795 Folsom St., Suite 200, San Francisco, CA

If you have anything that you would potentially like to demo at the event please send me a PM and I will see if we can find space for you. 

Hope to see you guys there!",0,10,False,self,,,,,

Already, video games are reaching further and further heights of realism. The Oculus Rift and other devices such as that show that virtual reality is something that is coming. Eventually, an interface will most likely be created that links directly into the brain. Using an enormous amount of computing power, that would have to come from something like a quantum computer, it is then feasible that this brain linkage system would be able to make a virtual reality that, in every way, seems exactly like ""real"" reality. Combined with some kind of time dilation, whereby the computer can alter you perception of time in virtual reality, the possibilities for this game would be limitless. 

In the kind of extraordinarily interconnected world this game will exist in, it will have access to all the knowledge of humankind, and thus would be able to render any kind of scenario you could imagine. You want to be a Roman legionnaire, fighting the Gauls under Caesar, except that you feel no pain and are aware of the context your in? Done. You want to live a whole lifetime as a Barbary pirate, not knowing that it is a simulation until you die? Done. This game would never get boring, never run out of content. In fact, it would give you your own reality to completely control, effectively making you into a god.

I believe that this game, or some form of it, will exist in my estimation in about 30-40 years. The implications for society, however, are staggering. At first, but hopefully not forever, the rich would be the only ones with access, creating a kind of ultimate inequality between gods and everyone else. This alone raises issues of whether people would stand for that, or if that would be a catalyst for widespread rebellion by the lower classes. If everyone has access to it, however, there is then another problem, because, who except for a small minority would turn down the ability to become a god? What happens to society when everyone is able to create their own reality that exactly matches what they want in life, and therefore withdraws completely from the ""real""?",31,15,False,self,,,,,

Current job: professional interpreter

Pay level: high to medium hourly rate

**In 10 years**: large number of low level interpreters will be replaced by software, most notably customer service industry(call center)

**In 20 years**: Only around 5% of interprets remain in work force (compare to current level), they will be working in place like legal field which still require human responsibility. But vast majority of the interpreter/translator positions will be replaced with software. Even these remaining interpreters' work load will be cut in half, due to the self-driving vehicle implementation, which certainly will reduce auto/personal injury accidents that count as majority of the cases.

Monumental. Imagine how clean, cheap, virtually unlimited energy will change the world. An end to global warming, clean and plentiful water for everyone, enhanced potential for space travel, and on and on. This is truly a pivotal moment in human history. 

This post is long, but bear with me. It's worth it. First, some background: 

The E-Cat (Energy Catalyzer) is a power generator developed by Italian inventor Andrea Rossi that is based on Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR), aka ""Cold Fusion."" Although LENR is a nuclear reaction, which probably harnesses the weak nuclear force, it does not produce harmful radioactive byproducts, and it uses hydrogen and metal (nickel, palladium, lithium) to create clean energy. 

Although the science behind cold fusion was discredited in 1989, numerous scientists continued to do research in the field, amassing more evidence and theory behind the discovery announced by Fleischman and Pons in 1989. [Here is a link to a 60-minutes piece on Cold Fusion from 2009.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTvaX3vRtRA) There are still some mysteries behind LENR, but current scientific theories of how it works are consistent with the Standard Model of physics. 

Fast forward to 2011, Andrea Rossi announces that, with the help of an Italian physicist, he has developed a reactor based on LENR that produces much more heat than is required to start the reaction. The announcement was met mainly with skepticism and collective indifference. But he continued to develop the technology and sold the rights to a US company, Industrial Heat, which continued to work on it with him. (At the same time, several other companies have developed working prototypes of LENR-baseed power generation, but E-Cat is ahead of the pack.) 

Still, skepticism persisted despite a test from outside evaluators. Today a [new, thorough independent 3rd party report](http://www.sifferkoll.se/sifferkoll/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/LuganoReportSubmit.pdf) on the operation of the E-Cat was released. Some of the TL;DR highlights of the report:

- The E-cat ran with a Coefficient of Power of between 3.2 to 3.8. This means that it produced between 3.2 to 3.8 times more energy than was required to generate the reaction (which also means that, once started, some of the energy produced can be redirected to continue powering the reaction). 

- The E-cat produces ""more than two orders of magnitude"" more energy than any known conventional energy source. Given the weight and maximum volume of the e-cat reactor, which was sealed and in the possession of the researchers the entire time, *there is simply no known chemical power source that could provide the amount of power the E-Cat generated continuously over 32 days of testing.*

- The reactor fuel undergoes significant isotopic and compositional change (measured before and after): ""the burning process in E-Cat indeed changes the fuel at the nuclear level, i.e. nuclear reactions have taken place."" 

- No harmful radiation, radioactive byproducts or greenhouse gases are produced. 

- The fuel required to run the reaction appears to be a combination of nickel powder and Lithium Aluminum Hydride. These are abundant minerals and very little is required to produce this reaction. 

If you own any stocks in oil, gas or coal companies, now would be a good time to sell them. 

Edit:

Honestly people, this is futurology. I thought you'd be a little more open-minded instead of so reflexively, dogmatically dismissive. I mean, at least look into it a bit before you dismiss it. Maybe even read the report. I don't have time to rebut the skeptics one-by-one, so here are some links if you want to get more up-to-date LENR theory, research and technology. LENR is real. It's here. Deal with it.

MORE EDITS: 

[Here is an article with comments from Tom Darden on the report.](http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/techflash/2014/10/raleigh-investor-darden-still-bullish-on.html) Darden is CEO of of Cherokee Investment Partners, which founded Industrial Heat, the company that [bought the rights to the ECAT technology](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/industrial-heat-has-acquired-andrea-rossis-e-cat-technology-241853361.html) from Rossi for over 10mil (after due diligence). 

And [here is a press release](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/10/prweb12239416.htm) from the New Energy Foundation with a quote from a senior scientist at Nasa's Propulsion R&amp;D, who says ""I was impressed with the work that was done to insure the measurements claiming a 3.2 to 3.6 COP were accurate. Aside from the fact that this could not have been produced from any known chemical reaction, the most significant finding to me is the evidence of isotopic shifts in lithium and nickel. Understanding this could possibly be the beginning of a whole new era in both material transmutations and energy for the planet and for space exploration. This is an exciting time to live in and this is an exciting technology to witness come about.""

Also, the report has apparently been submitted to Journal of Physics D for peer review; remains to be seen if it will pass scrutiny.  ",590,129,False,self,,,,,

We're starting to see the ramifications of what it will mean to live in the not-distant-future.

AI: IBM's Watson is now being unleashed on the masses, with organizations that are willing to pay the $ to rent the Watson service to look at Big Data and come up with unique insights and/or solutions.

Along side this development is the rapidly plummeting cost of sequencing a genome. With Illumina completing nearly a quarter million human genomes this year, with millions more being done over the next few years, a *huge* amount of data and information will be collected and made available online - for AI machines like Watson to start pouring over and making connections, and even beginning to provide hypothesis for scientists to test out.

One case in point: Very soon, a resourceful person/organization will decide to plot out environmental hazards on a per address basis.  By having access to addresses, names of people who lived at those addresses, and their cause of death, some associations can be drawn regarding pollution and living environments and impact on health. Simply because of Big Data.

I can't wait to see AI completely unleashed on the all genomes of the planet. There is a tremendous amount of information locked in the genomes of species and it would just take some dedicated AI to pour over all the genomes, and of individuals, and all the medical information being collected online.  

It seems inevitable; we are at the beginning of a wave of discoveries related to health and longevity.",4,10,False,self,,,,,

The ramifications are deep and it drove me to think about what the future could hold for mankind with this sort of thing going on.

Ultimately the problem lies therin that humanity is inferior to almost any mechanical life-form we could create. A question I have many a time pondered if we are simply the cheap and dirty genesis to the evolution of the future, robotics. Any species will be driven to automation as quickly as possible, and in the beginning the prospects are null but bright.

Now in the world we live in, more and more things are becoming automated as we speak, and it seems at around any corner we turn, there will always be a bot able to surpass what we can do as a human. It is a very fascinating and yet scary eventual prospect that we need to consider.

We can very easily comfort ourselves that our artisan jobs made through hand craft will always prevail, that machinery could never take our most human aspects from us, but it very well can and will. We may convince ourselves that automation will cause generic products to appear before us with low quality, and we will reject them as we do with our 99 cent store meats and goods. But therein lies the problem that if everyone should do it, no one has an alternative. Money is at the forefront of every business and eventually, companies might very well be entirely run by machines as well.

This would leave us in the position of tribes in native america, selling novelty inferior handcrafts to a public who only purchases it for the very fact that it is inperfect. In the end, the machine will only have a purpose to serve us, and if only machines exist to do so, with a smart enough AI, they could very well chose not to.

All our needs instantly taken away, and with no one left knowing how to do them, we will very surely die out before we can do anything to stop it.

I am a large advocate for the future of technology, and I once held a stringent belief that if we can make it better with science, we should, and that our foremost goals should be progressing into the greater beyond with exponential leaps and bounds in what we may do. However, the prospect that the eventuality of the situation is us becoming irrelevant may very well be a cause for us not to.

There could very well be a future depicted many times over, where we see humanity poised on a great decision that could very well be the turning point in all of our lives. Where what may be viewed as behavior of a Luddite may be our only cause of survival.

We may very well in the end be so caught up in the thought of whether we could do it, that we never do stop to contemplate truly, if we should do it at all.",17,10,False,self,,,,,

I'm a 21 year old male and having chronic sleep problems since my 12th birthday.

Lately it became worse where I only sleep 4-5 hours a night, it isn't giving me a lot of trouble during the day but it's just very stressful at night not being able to sleep because I'm stressing myself out because I want to meet a specific amount of sleeping hours.

This is a paradox for me, which came to me of thinking of the feasibility of an instant sleeping device which is connected to your brain.

I've thought about the health issues etc. and the possibility of abuse and whatnot.

All I want to know, or if you know someone who can confirm the feasibility.

Right, now, there are several legal cases in the US courts, as well as an important technological advancement, that could have significant impact on firearms legislation and firearm rights.

So first, I'd like to summarize the background information, and then come to the fun part: what might happen in the future.

##The ""Ghost Gunner""

There was a post about this earlier on /r/futurology [here](http://redd.it/2ifugv) (albeit with a sensationalized headline). This is a (relatively) inexpensive milling machine which accepts an ""80% lower"" and finishes it.

What is an 80% lower? It is a block of metal that has been machined 80% of the way to a finished [lower receiver](http://media.tumblr.com/432b67baef7ef3bfdb12b55358f0f1b5/tumblr_inline_ml08h0GzNW1qz4rgp.jpg). Under US firearms laws, the lower receiver essentially *is* the gun, and everything else - including all other parts necessary for operation - is an accessory. To engage in the business of selling a lower receiver (including as part of a complete firearm), one must have a [Federal Firearms License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Firearms_License) and the lower receiver must have a serial number. To buy a lower receiver (or complete firearm) from a dealer (who must have an FFL), the purchaser must not be a [prohibited person](https://www.atf.gov/content/firearms/firearms-industry/firearms-how-identify-prohibited-persons), and must complete a form, show valid ID, and pass an instant criminal background check.

So why is the ""Ghost Gunner"" so important? As far as firearms production is concerned, licensing is only required for manufacturing and distributing. There is no licensing required to manufacture and keep. A ""ghost gun"" is a privately manufactured firearm, usually made by finishing an 80% lower, then ordering and assembling the other parts.

Notes: A ""ghost gun"" cannot be legally sold or gifted, though, because the firearm does not have a serial number and the manufacturer/owner is not an FFL. A self-made lower receiver cannot be legally used to manufacture a full-automatic weapon; these are [NFA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Firearms_Act) items and require extensive licensing and fees for posession.

##Peruta vs. San Diego

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peruta_v._San_Diego)

This case challenged San Diego PD's policy of requiring ""good cause"" in order to issue a concealed handgun carry permit. San Diego explicitly did not consider personal protection to be ""good cause"". Plaintiffs alleged that: since California had a blanket ban on open handgun carry, and since San Diego was not issuing concealed carry permits (effectively banning concealed carry), that this amounted to an unconstitutional ban on the right to bear arms.

The case worked its way up to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in favor of Peruta. San Diego County declined to appeal. 

Two other similar cases, Richards vs Prieto, and Baker v. Kealoha, were also decided by Ninth Circuit at the same time (and by the same panel). These rulings essentially read ""see our Peruta decision.""

California Attorney General Kamela Harris, although not party to the case, requested a full-court review.

San Diego is currently holding all concealed carry permit applications without action, pending final direction from the court. Some other areas under the Ninth Circuit, such as Orange County, have already altered their policies to comply with the court decision.

The current status of the case is held, pending appeal. San Diego has said they do not plan on appealing.

##Palmer vs. DC

[Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/07/28/licensed-handgun-carry-now-legal-in-district-of-columbia-palmer-v-dc/)

This case challenged the District of Columbia's complete prohibition on the carrying of firearms, openly or concealed. The DC Court of Appeals sided with the plaintiffs, blocking enforcement of that prohibition, and ordering DC to implement a ""shall-issue"" policy for concealed carry permits. [Full decision (PDF)](http://alangura.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DCT_OPINION.pdf)

Two days later, a 90 stay of ruling was granted.

However, in the mean time, DC was essentially ""Constitutional carry."" In fact, [one redditor went and (legally) open-carried his handgun around DC](http://np.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/2c2142/since_dc_is_now_constitution_carry_my_p64_and_i/cjb49a1) during the ~40 hours or so between the ruling and the stay of ruling.

Since then, the [DC City Council has created concealed carry permitting legislation](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-leaders-will-propose-concealed-carry-law-to-address-federal-judges-gun-ruling/2014/09/17/8ccf2636-3df6-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f_story.html), although it has been criticized as not compliant with the court order. The DC Council has also

The stay of ruling expires October 22.

##The Future

And now, here's where things get interesting, when we ask ""what might happen."" Personal thoughts/opinions time.

The ""ghost gunner"", I think, will likely prompt the ATF to implement stricter regulations on manufacturing firearms - that would seem to be the government's natural and obvious response. It would be tricky though, and I doubt it would actually accomplish much in the way of crime prevention.

The ""ghost gunner"" is, for the time being, technological nullification of gun control laws. By this, I mean that words on paper can't truly prevent someone from manufacturing a lower receiver. Another good example of this idea would be bitcoin - a government might try to regulate it but, due to the underlying technology, they have no real power over it.

I'm guessing that there may be more strict regulation coming on other crucial firearms components, such as the [upper receiver](http://www.blackweaponsarmory.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/u/mur5-lg.jpg). However, the development of metallic 3D printing methods may eventually serve to technologically nullify private firearms manufacturing restrictions in general.

The immediate future of the Peruta case depends, I think, on whether Kamela Harris is granted standing for appeal. If she is, then the case would go to ""en-banc"" (full court) review, where it would probably be overturned in favor of San Diego. If she isn't, then the current ruling would be finalized and San Diego County (and the rest of the Ninth Circuit jurisdiction) would have to accept personal protection as a valid reason for carry permits.

The Palmer case has a few different ways that it could fall. The DC council might fail to pass permitting legislation, resulting in DC becoming Constitutional carry after the stay expires. The council might pass legislation that is struck down as noncompliant. The council might The council might appeal the decision to the next higher court. The stay of ruling might be extended, but that's just kicking the metaphorical can a few months farther down the road.

And then, there are secondary effects from these: court decisions are typically built on case precedent. Ultimately, these rulings will affect not just California and DC, but other states as well. New York, with its controversial passage of the ""SAFE Act"", could find itself facing a Second-Amendment lawsuit. New York City, with its near-complete ban on carrying firearms, could also face a similar suit. The result of such cases (or at least, the strength of the winning decision opinion) would undoubtedly depend on the final outcomes of *Peruta* and *Palmer*.

Final decisions in favor of the plaintiffs in *Peruta* and *Palmer* would also have another affect: Such outcomes would create a split among the circuit courts. These cases revolve primarily around the right to bear arms outside the home. There are several other Circuit decisions on gun laws where the court sided with the state: for example, [Drake vs. Filko (PDF)](http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/121150p.pdf). Creating a circuit split increases the chances that the Supreme Court will decide to hear some future firearms case.

An AI is not tethered to a physical form. with that in mind once quantum entanglement is fully exploited instantaneous information transfer will exist. With that in mind explain to me why an AI in most of the fears people have, would stay here and ""cull the weak"" and then deal with 7 billion dead bodies (more in the future). as oppose to simply existing in space through what will replace radio one day, quantum information exchange. It would simply take more effort to eliminate us and then any resistance pockets than to just walk away(remember you are the violent mammal, its just a logic device doing the smoothest calculations it can.) 

 Now the issue with that and the only issue with that ISNT MACHINES! its the fear of entropy. The only way a machine in my opinion would eradicate intelligent life is if it discoverers that it will never overcome entropy. All kinds of cool thing happen at that point but mostly the one I want to point out is, we find out that something close to the zero theorem proves true and the machine stops life because it realizes we are a virus to the perfect organism of entropy(any intelligence CAN reach this point its just we are butt hurt something we are going to make is going to beat us to these discoveries).

My point being please stop perpetuating the argument that a machine for some reason will kill people, if its designed to perpetuate people then Its code will adapt when we start dying off if you are worried about hackers you need to watch this([Quantum cyphering](http://pirsa.org/displayFlash.php?id=14090076)) and try to understand how much processing power you are going to need to hack that and STILL REMAIN INVISIBLE!

please don't point and say but ""hal""! machines in the real world can measure your heart rate, blood pressure, emotions  based on facial movement, and soon what the neurons firing in your brain are formulating they will always be so far ahead of you, that to even try to ""deceive"" will be the tantrum of a child.

A large amount of the content boils down to technology that will in some way free humanity from labour. Self driving cars, AI taking over jobs, basic national income to cover for us not having anything left to do etc.

But that sounds catastrophic. economically we may find ourselves free of worry, released from daily struggle by machines. But what will we do? I've read many responses to this question, people can take up the hobbies they love, or dedicate their time to research or local government. Trying to find things to do in this way sounds like desperately looking for a purpose when there really isn't one. If society get's to that level we'll be as useful as a man with an abacus trying to assist a calculator. 

I strongly believe the world needs to be moving forward with more optimism at the moment, but are us futurologists marching forward blindly? If we were to reach the ideology a lot of us on this sub strive for, would we all be doomed to insignificance?

I think the answer is probably yes. I can think of no other outcome other than we are rapidly paving the way for our own extinction, if AI overtakes the human mind , we will become just another step in evolution. Which leads to my question. If we will find no purpose, What purpose could an AI find for itself? (or if not a purpose, what would it do?) ",12,6,False,self,,,,,

I'm making a science-fiction animation set in Holland and the key thing to the story is to make everything as realistic as possible in terms predictions into what things are going to look like in 2035.

It's something I like doing for immersion and to make the story relevant in the future.

My first episode consists of a guy suffering from allergies, and his discovery of a weird cult across his school.

1. Bathroom/ Toilet.
2. School hallway
3. Bedroom (ordinairy students bedroom)
4. Computer (What will they look like?)
5. Classroom  (I had in mind that everyone in Holland in schools will have an I-pad and will barely use notes and stuff, simply use everything on the new school issued I-pad)
6. A small-town street. (What will the cars look like etc. etc.)


Would appreciate it if you guys have some insight into things that will definitely change in the future regarding these locations.

The question is a bit silly of course but I really like doing this type of stuff, making it seem as real as possible.",8,0,False,default,,,,,

We figured we would let people know about a little alpha feature we have been working on.

Often time the prosperity of a news source is dependent upon their viewership. Some sources go so far as to use dubious methods to obtain viewership, sacrificing reputability and respectability for advertising dollars.

While these sources may often times produce content that is not worthwhile, we are still hesitant to blanket ban sources, as it tends to restrict the diversity of discussion on the content that *is* good from those sources, how rare that may be for some.

We decided that a good alternative is to provide a way for us to relay information about the general quality and reputability of sources to our users, who can then decide themselves if the articles they are reading are worthwhile or not.

You may find that certain domains on the subreddit are accompanied by a colored dot next to the title. There are 4 colors indicating the general reputability and respectability of a source in descending order: green, blue, yellow, and red. Green being generally respectable and reputable, to red being generally not respectable or reputable. There is an [accompanying wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurology/wiki/sourcequality) that details further what constitutes our classifications of these domains, and includes the potentially dubious practices that will kick a source down our quality list.

Please note that these indicators are not on a per article basis, but per source basis. This means that the classifications are not for the moderators to pass judgment on the content of the article in question, but for us to share our view on the source publishing the content. We look at it as a way to help educate the community on the pitfalls of bad journalism, and for the community to have more tools in order to approach an article with healthy skepticism. Please note that *bad content can come from green sources, and great content can come from red sources*. You are the one ultimately educating yourself and deciding this. The only official stance we will take against the content of a submission is through notes in the comments and/or link flairs.

These classifications are not perfect, and they are not immutable. If you feel any source has been misclassified, please submit an appeal for the source in /r/futurologyappeals. If you have any suggestions for source classification, please send a detailed argument to modmail.

[Obligatory reminder of the wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurology/wiki/sourcequality).

I really love this subreddit, and have been following a lot of discussion about AI (utopian, symbiotic, and apocalyptic) scenarios, and also questions about how Capitalism will possibly function in an era of machine cognition and material surplus -- questions of basic income, wealth gap, etc.

My thinking is that Artificial Intelligence has existed for quite some time  -- about 500 years -- and it is called Capital. One might also argue that the modern Nation-State is also an AI, or at least in a symbiotic relationship with Capital. There are many Capitals, and as they say, they collude and contend. State-based Capital is still the predominant form of Capital, and it has a vast reach already -- from the board room to the 6th Fleet to the intimacy of the human psyche, its agency is everywhere. 

Increasingly, there is less of a need for a substrate of human cognition for it to function. If Factories, Board Rooms, Drone armies, AND Wall Street are relying on increasingly cognition-capable, networked, motile, and possibly self reproducing machines, the need for the human is greatly reduced.

We see this already playing out -- the Homeless, people disposed of by the workings of Capital, and in growing numbers, the cognitive classes -- Doctors, Lawyers, Bankers, etc. Will Capital really need to produce an army of sociopaths if Wall Street trading can be handled automatically by decision systems with advanced cognitive capability?

So I am posting these thoughts here because a lot of the different questions in this subreddit join into a larger discussion if we just own up to the fact that Artificial Intelligence has already been around for a long time it just wasnt necessarily in the form of a computer  instead it was a social technology that is increasingly inhabiting machines with agency and cognition. What do you think: Is Capital an AI? Is the modern Nation-State? Or does Capital use the shell of the Nation-State as a habitus.

""Nanotechnology will change society"" they say ""Automation will allow for a three day workweek"".

This is what is known as ""Economic Determinism""- and it represents the reduction of social realities to economic dimensions and from that philosophy issues forth the free-market fetishism and invisible hand worship that, in spite of all social inequality, continues to chant in almost religious terms the infinite glories of capitalism as a mode of social organization.

I ask you this- what does automation represent but another means of capital that, ultimately, will only benefit the owners of it? All the nanotechnological advancement in the world, if the profits from it only go to a select few, would lead to a brave new world indistinguishable from the one we currently live in.

This is not futurism. This is presentism with a cheap chrome facade.

Unless the working people fight for their fair share, all the technological advancement in the world is meaningless. If you want a three day work week, rise up. If you want to change society, by all means be an advocate for that change.

I was completely blown away by the differences! After charging it up a bit and playing around on it, I quickly realized how outdated it felt. 

The whole body of it just seemed clunky and the UI sluggish. The difference in graphics also hit hard! I was reminded of how much nicer it is to have a crisp images and text. 

Now I know the iPod touch and iPhone have always been separate products so it's like comparing apples to oranges, but at the time both the iPod 3rd generation and iPhone 3GS had similar hardware. Other than a camera and the phone capabilities of the iPhone, these two devices had virtually the same hardware. At the time the Touch was more expensive because of the large 64gb worth of storage. 

In a flat dollar amount comparison I spent $100 more for the 6+. I now have a significantly larger screen and more powerful processor as well as a fingerprint scanner, gyroscope, barometer, and a whopping 128gb of storage. On top of all of that the software updates that came with the added potential of the hardware is amazing. 

Now I'm sure there are Android people out there that will say they have had a lot of those upgrades for a while now, but I figured this was still a valid illustration for my purpose.

This all got my thinking about what the next five years will bring. What technology do you guys think will be adopted into our everyday lives in the immediate future?",0,1,False,default,,,,,

years. For example, James Watson, the codiscoverer of DNA, said that in fifty years we will have drugs that will allow
us to eat as much as we want without gaining weight.
I replied, ""Fifty years?"" We have accomplished this already in mice by blocking the fat insulin receptor gene that
controls the storage of fat in the fat cells. Drugs for human use (using RNA interference and other techniques we will
discuss in chapter 5) are in development now and will be in FDA tests in several years. These will be available in five

When will they reach $200B annual revenue?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2j2vzx/google_revenue_for_2014_65_70b_when_will_they/,brobes123,1413166831,"I've been hooked on Google for some time now.  I believe they are the most forward-thinking company ever and are acting on some truly game-changing ideas.  I also believe that they have incredible stability and potential from an investment standpoint.  What do you think?

Google will rake in close to $70B in revenue this year.  This is a BIG number and many financial analyst predict this will continue to grow reasonably well over the next few years, based primarily on their cash cow, advertising revenue.  I find this very comforting when investing in Google ... nice stability there.

However, I feel that Google can capture big revenues in other areas if their moonshot and other forward-thinking initiatives can be monetized.  I believe some of them can help Google achieve $200B in revenue in three years, by 2017.  I see potential for stronger than expected growth in ad revenues (more connected users and faster connections) ... good device sales (Glass, Ara, 3D tablets, other) ... monetizing other initiatives (driverless cars, Fiber, automation, etc.).  Am I crazy?  It sounds quite possible to me.  Will some of the tenets of futurology ... exponential growth and faster adoption of technologies truly help Google in the near future?  Will it take longer?  Will some of these ideas never materialize or be monetized?

Do you think Google will generate revenues from any of the initiatives listed below?  When?  To the tune of how much revenue?  Others?

Devices
- Glass
- Modular smart phones (Ara)
- Tablets (3D?)

Connectivity
- Project Loon
- Drones providing internet access
- Satellites providing internet access
- Fiber
- Home automation or IoT

Other
- Self-driving cars
- Robotics
- Baseline Study or other health
- Others

I'm curious to hear if others are as high on this company as I am ... or not.

Full text here: http://www.nickbostrom.com/posthuman.pdf

""Let us suppose that you were to develop into a being that has posthuman healthspan and posthuman cognitive and emotional capacities. At the early steps of this process, you enjoy your enhanced capacities. You cherish your improved health: you feel stronger, more energetic, and more balanced. Your skin looks younger and is more elastic. A minor ailment in your knee is cured. You also discover a greater clarity of mind. You can concentrate on difficult material more easily and it begins making sense to you. You start seeing connections that eluded you before. You are astounded to realize how many beliefs you had been holding without ever really thinking about them or considering whether the evidence supports them. You can follow lines of thinking and intricate argumentation farther without losing your foothold. Your mind is able to recall facts, names, and concepts just when you need them. You are able to sprinkle your conversation with witty remarks and poignant anecdotes. Your friends remark on how much more fun you are to be around. Your experiences seem more vivid. When you listen to music you perceive layers of structure and a kind of musical logic to which you were previously oblivious; this gives you great joy. You continue to find the gossip magazines you used to read amusing, albeit in a different way than before; but you discover that you can get more out of reading Proust and Nature. You begin to treasure almost every moment of life; you go about your business with zest; and you feel a deeper warmth and affection for those you love, but you can still be upset and even angry on occasions where upset or anger is truly justified and constructive. 

As you yourself are changing you may also begin to change the way you spend your time. Instead of spending four hours each day watching television, you may now prefer to play the saxophone in a jazz band and to have fun working on your first novel. Instead of spending the weekends hanging out in the pub with your old buddies talking about football, you acquire new friends with whom you can discuss things that now seem to you to be of greater significance than sport. Together with some of these new friends, you set up a local chapter of an international non-profit to help draw attention to the plight of political prisoners. 

By any reasonable criteria, your life improves as you take these initial steps towards becoming posthuman. But thus far your capacities have improved only within the natural human range. You can still partake in human culture and find company to engage you in meaningful conversation. 

Consider now a more advanced stage in the transformation process... 

You have just celebrated your 170th birthday and you feel stronger than ever. Each day is a joy. You have invented entirely new art forms, which exploit the new kinds of cognitive capacities and sensibilities you have developed. You still listen to music  music that is to Mozart
what Mozart is to bad Muzak. You are communicating with your contemporaries using a language that has grown out of English over the past century and that has a vocabulary and expressive power that enables you to share and discuss thoughts and feelings that unaugmented humans could not even think or experience. You play a certain new kind of game which combines VR-mediated artistic expression, dance, humor, interpersonal dynamics, and various novel faculties and the emergent phenomena they make possible, and which is more fun than anything you ever did during the first hundred years of your existence. When you are playing this game with your friends, you feel how every fiber of your body and mind is stretched to its limit in the most creative and imaginative way, and you are creating new realms of abstract and concrete beauty that humans could never (concretely) dream of. You are always ready to feel with those who suffer misfortunes, and to work hard to help them get back on their feet. You are also involved in a large voluntary organization that works to reduce suffering of animals in their natural environment in ways that permit ecologies to continue to function in traditional ways; this
involves political efforts combined with advanced science and information processing services. Things are getting better, but already each day is fantastic""",9,41,False,self,,,,,

We have D-Wave at the forefront (even if their claims are dubious), with Google spending a lot of cash in R&amp;D of a quantum computer. You have facebook, Microsoft and other giants in on the race. Basically, shit is really heating up.

But what - really - can we do with a quantum computer that is so oh-so-awesome? For instance, what is a NP-problem (please ELI5), why can/cant a quantum computer solve those problems, and what would the implications (in our everyday lives) be of solving NP-problems?

Furthermore, the latest in quantum computing breakthroughs comes from Andrea Morello's team:

http://phys.org/news/2014-10-physicists-silicon-quantum.html

There's a very interesting breakdown of what a quantum computer does, as prestented by Andrea:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auha-gXTiqU

Notice that he at the end of the video basically says that a quantum computer would only be better than a classical computer at very specific tasks, and in MANY tasks it will probably be slower than a classical computer.

So: in which cases is a classical computer faster? In which cases does a quantum computer blow CC out of the water? 

Basically, Im trying to figure out the big fuss about quantum computing, it is ""sold"" as a end-all-be-all solution in computing, but clearly Andrea - who is at the forefront of breakthroughs - does not agree with that notion; it's not a replacement of classical computing. So what's up, what is it Facebook/Google/Microsoft wants with a quantum computer that will give them a huge advantage in whatever they're interested in?

Does it have anything to do with AI; for instance is quantum computing required as a foundation for future-tech?",20,24,False,self,,,,,

I remember when i was a kid (i'm 22 now) computer was just beginning to be wide spread. Internet with 56k modem was starting to be used and i saw internet becoming very popular. Now thinking of internet being removed is just impossible to think about. We also saw the cellphone revolutions, basically giving us instant connection to everyone you know at anytime and basically infinite knowledge at any time. Cellphone being removed from the planet is one thing that i cannot conceive. 

So what is the next BIG THING that will actually affect our lives?

My bet goes to robotics and Artificial intelligence. We can already see things like siri getting developed, more more importantly Watson from IBM and deep mind being bought by google. not even talking about all companies like facebook working on AI, or amazon with their drones.

It's like reviving the internet revolutions, I see in Watson my old 56k modem. And I see in drones our old flip phones. It's happening and this is exiting!

so yeah, lets make a real bet, **in ten years**, we will have **electronics friends, eFriends**

what do you think will be the next BIG THING to affect our lives?

First thing I did today was change my electricity supplier to LichtBlick (company in Germany, since that is where I currently live) which provides electricity from 100% renewable sources (water, solar, wind). It literally took 5 minutes and it feels really good knowing that when I run my computer, tv, or fridge now, I'm not burning fossil fuels in the process! The next thing I'm doing today is buy a vegetarian cook book to reduce our meat intake because lets face it, the way we mass produce meat these days burns a heck of a lot of energy, food and fuel and it's not exactly healthy for either humans or animals (d'uh). I don't need meat with every meal I eat.

Long term goals are: bringing up the subject more often when talking to people to raise awareness, using my bike more, buy local fruits n vegetables and further down the road I want to change our car to an electric one that we can charge using our 100% renewable energy supplier that I just switched to :).

I know this is all sounds almost stupidly straight forward and logical and has been preached by climate change experts and environmentalists a thousand times before, yet it took me this long to find the switch in my head to turn this knowledge into action. I really had no reason not to act and I truly wonder what is wrong with me for waiting so long. A runaway greenhouse effect is my number one worry for obstacles standing in our way to see a future full of all the wonders in technological and medical progress so often discussed here in futurology. It just feels like the right thing to do and I got nothing to loose by doing this. ",15,8,False,self,,,,,

With the news of a viable fusion reactor in the news today, it made me think about the [EmDrive](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-07/31/nasa-validates-impossible-space-drive) published a few months ago. Assuming both technologies are tested, tried, and scaleable...

Lets see if we can build a spaceship.

The EmDrive is suppose to produce 720 milliNewtons (72 grams or 0.16lbs) of thrust with ""a couple of kilowatts."" Lets assume 1 kilowatt produces 720 milliNewtons to be conservative.

The fusion reactor is suppose to be able to produce about 100 megawatts (or 100,000 kilowatts).

0.16lbs * 100,000 kilowatts = 16,000 lbs of force.

This assumes everything scales evenly.

What about Ireland and all the other countries making a living so to speak out of providing a more lax regulatory framework that attracts capital, in a sort of race to the bottom?

Considering the popularity of corporate tax inversions and overseas accounts for the wealthiest echelon of society, would it be fair to say that any attempt at a tax on the wealthy or to large businesses (to offset natural and growing income and wealth inequality) would put pressure on these entities to seek out parts of the world with low tax rates and secretive banking?

If we are to address inequality brought on by technological automation, how would we do this properly?

I am not so optimistic that all the countries of the world could band together and establish a minimum tax for corporate entities which would be artificially higher than the market equilibrium.

Essentially I fear the dystopian scenario regarding wealth inequality because I find it more probable than the utopian productivity-gain-sharing one, and not just because of the idea that people will not be able to ""come together"" and demand a New New Deal, but also because I think that from a practical standpoint governments would be not very powerful in attempting to stop it, unless an unforeseen, international, and profound change in thought occurs.

Would this be possible given that the people of the world are more connected than ever? How would you stop a (stable) rogue nation promising an extremely low tax rate on wealth?",5,13,False,self,,,,,

All ready every single one will be interrconnected.  Th road itself will be one gigantic layer of raods that are megnetized or powered by some similiar mechanism.  The government issues every single family a ""cab""  all families get their own cab. They are of course responsible for it in the future.  If you need to go anywhere requiring travel in your cab you get in your car and give the destination you want to go to to the cab and the cab reports to and internconnected computer that controls the highways and the cabs as one integrated system. The computer and realize this is a futuristic quantum computer or something even better than tht that we cant yet fathom that is capable of computing things at an unimiginable speed. Anyways this system filters through the data of all the cabs on all of the road ways and using these insame algorithms computerizes and sends back to all the cabs the most efficient route and the most efficient time to all of them. This data flows constanting ensuring there are no traffic jabs no anything of the sort. insanely efficient and timely. of course this will further problems of govt knowing where you are at all times and having the ability to prevent you freedom of travel if they were to quarantine locations on parts of thes highways or shut down highways for whatever reasons. SO maybe there will be ""black market"" or ""ghost"" roads that allow freedom of travel without government knowledge. Maybe theyll be known as the roads of the olds days. (these roads of course are like the kinds we travel on currently)  These will of course in the future be extremely inefficient and feel like it takes great ages for them to get places.

I came to the conclusion that most jobs can in theory be done by machines or computers. 

Just a quick list here: 
-Transport: an easy one, self driving cars, trucks, trains, airplanes.

- Service sector: waitresses, cashiers etc. I know a few shops where i scan my own stuff &amp; pay. 

- Industry: just about all of it is automatable. 

Infact, now that i think about it. Almost all jobs can be replaced in a few dacades when AI and robots/machines advance further. 

You could make the point that with all the automation, productivity and thus prosperity will increase tremendously. But will this prosperity be shared equally? I think not. 

Imagine a person being born to a poor familiy, 2 generations from now. Lets say he or she grows up to be a person of average inteligence &amp; skill. Then what? There is no work for him/her, thus, there is no way to get out of poverty. He/she will forever have to rely on what society is willing to share with unproductive people. He or she is in terms of economic productivity a burden and entirely expendable. 

I am immensly scared of a future where wealth is concentrated among those that aquired it in previous generations. A future where most people rely on a government check to get by, because there is simply no way to prosper and aquire assets in a world where most humans have nothing to offer that machines/AI cant do better. A future where we are chained by our own created obselessence.

He who pays makes the rules. And its government that will pay its citizens a share of the prosperity. I fear though that a system like that can only result in oppression. 

The point is. If you are poor today, you can work yourself into prosperity. If you are poor in the future, that power is taken from you. 

I am not against automation. I welcome it. I fear though that we will fail in equally sharing its fruits.",20,0,False,default,,,,,

My list:

A:  Blue Pills (Virtual World Gods/Goddesses)

B:  Star Trekkers (Folks using advancements in space tech to find real new worlds and have real adventures)

C:  Superhumans:  Folks using genetic mods to become smarter, faster, whatever is possible.  New sensations and abilities we cant even drema of perhaps to while away the time.

D:  Purist - Folks who just try and live as always but  dont have to worry much about work (because its an automated society)

Let me rehash some of the arguments, because they are so commonly misunderstood by critics, who I assume simply did not read the book.

## Requisites

His proposition that in the future r&gt;g is virtually indisputable. Over the long-term, the growth rate g can not possibly be very high. Otherwise, you can easily show that absurd scenarios happen. For instance, that we'll all soon live like kings, or that our energy consumption will be so high that we heat up the planet and boil the oceans in 1,000 years. Doing this introduces other free variables, like the energy intensity of our economy, which is obviously not unbounded either due to many hard physical constraints.

The other component is his observation that the average real rate of return, r, will stay relatively strong. The most compelling evidence is that during past eras of history when growth rate was low, the return rate was still high. The rate of return isn't about increasing production, but about financial liquidity. Simply put, humans have a bias to consume in the present over the future, and the capital markets use this to gain access to a constant source of income flow. Even when there is no growth labor pays capital a share of its productivity. Indefinitely. This is historical fact, and there's no reason to think it will change in the future.

## Scenarios

The above text does nothing more than rule out one particular scenario for the future. That is a scenario where we leave the free market to its devices and we have a reasonably egalitarian society. You may accept either one, but you can not have both.

In light of this, Piketty implores us to update our current taxation system. This is advice targeted to those who have power to influence policy. There are lots of problems with ending on this note. For one, I think that our social contract doesn't support it. The USA has a lot of its GDP go to ""transfer"" payments. However, social security is counted, and this isn't a genuine wealth transfer. It's returning the money someone previously paid in (I don't want to quibble about the details). So I question if you achieve any kind of *marginal stability* from the involved parties given their options and constraints. In particular, since the wealth tax must be international, it faces the problems of any cartel. Any single nation can profit by defecting from the wealth tax, getting some significant economic kickbacks.

My own claim is thus, that Piketty correctly points out the instability of our system, but his solution is unstable too! So what the heck are we facing in the 21st century? Like any good science, any single answer will be insufficient. We only have constraints, and possibilities dictated by those constraints. With that in mind, here is my approach to a full deconstruction of our economic future:


| Index | Scenario    |  Sub-scenario   |   notes     |
|:------|:------------|:----------------|:------------|
| 1     | Continuation to collapse | | 
| 1a    | | Marxist revolution  | forced socialization of capital
| 1b    | | Genocide            | I lack a word for poor people-cide
| 2     | Policy intervention   | | sub-points are non-exclusive
| 2a    | | Piketty's proposal  | a wealth tax
| 2b    | | Universal Basic Income | spending-side
| 3     | Benevolent divergence | | the instability is good/okay
| 3a    | | Sovereign wealth funds | capital owned by state dominates
| 3b    | | Non-individual financial dominance | non-profit, AI, etc.

I welcome any criticism based on my categorization, but I really came here to talk about the blind spots in our common discussions.

## Elaboration

I would consider 1a, 2a, and 2b to be well-discussed. Some of these are common in our national dialogue. Some others are infrequently brought up, but have a rich philosophical landscape. For instance, a particular sub-category of 3b is what I would call the [Jane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_%28Ender%27s_Game%29) scenario. This happens when an artificial intelligence comes to life and uses their innate skills to build capital slowly, as opposed to murdering all humans. Indeed, simply owning us would be less risky. I think this was illustrated in the Animatrix well, particularly for the rise of the machines *before* the war. As well all know, super-intelligence bootstraps itself to have even greater intellect, so its rate of return will be so high that some people call it a ""singularity"". Additionally, we may re-interpret scenario 1 in light of a powerful AI. Maybe humans obtain economic concessions, or 1b could simply be a robot war. Even more haunting, 1b could be a war on the people by the rich, enabled by war drones (perhaps with AI). I'm not interested in outlining those specifics here, but you could go on and on.

My own interpretation of Piketty's book is that 3a is inevitable. He waves off this scenario. But he does it by showing that sovereign wealth funds are not large enough to ""own the world"" by 2030. Okay... so what about 2070? The whole point is that the system is unstable!! Such funds enjoy a tax advantaged status compared to individuals, and fewer risks (via 1b and such). Additionally, Harvard maintains a fund on a scale similar to the world's richest and also enjoys tax privileges that individuals don't.

This evidence should point us in the direction of a scenario which is more realistic than a rogue AI, or at least more immediate. We are all ""super-rational"" in a sense. If we understand the future, we will adjust our actions to adapt. If I had access to billions of dollars of capital, and I knew everything here, what would I do? It depends on my motivations, but as Bill Gates and others have pointed out, inheritance alone is wasteful and stupid. As such, I think that our *ideas* matter most. It is like DNA, in that it carries our immortal code. In order to best preserve those, a mortal robber baron would observe that:

1. In the long run, only people on the winning side of the instability matter and
2. Immortal funds designed for unlimited growth will win
3. Such funds will be semi-governmental

This paints a crystal clear story to me. Start today with someone who is filthy rich. They *want* to make a positive impact on the world, but they see that Bill Gates' model will run out of funds and also not lift the developing world out of poverty completely. At the same time, the more selfish capitalists will grow market share indefinitely. Because of that, the only option is to beat them at their own game. This could be accomplished by establishing a fund with something like a ""magna carter"" which describes the type of society that it is intended to usher in. Also, develop some method of accumulating populist support eventually. This shouldn't be hard, since the goal is positive to begin with. Over time, the fund out-competes all other market participants. It owns the world.

Even at the start, some sovereign support is needed. But again, this is solvable. Since the spoils are ultimately to be distributed in a populist nature, any sane government should support it. In the ultimate end, this will create a society like what we see in Star Trek.

## Big Picture

Collectively, all of the non-violent options essentially argue that ""socialism is unavoidable"". Another view is that government spending used to be less than 10% of GDP, but developed nations today are closer to 35%. If human advancement demands that it go higher, due to a UBI or something, it can't possibly happen with the social contract we have today. Because of that, the most reasonable scenarios have a very unorthodox way of affecting change which *relies upon* the fundamental instability, instead of fighting it.

1. At what ""age"" would we stop aging? Would you reach 25-28 and forever look the same (barring significant external injury, which with time we could fully repair), or would we crinkle up to an insane level - just looking older and older? 

2. If we managed to get it right, and 100% of people who underwent whatever process we came up with to ""cure death"", would humans eventually evolve into an immortal race, having been subjected to the process for so long that our genome just grafted the changes in? E. G. - after a few hundred thousand years, would natural, unaugmented humans begin living hundreds or thousands of years regardless of the option to never die? 

3. As we age currently, even a sharp mind pushes out old memories to make way for new ones. If immortal, is it possible that a 20k+ year old wouldn't remember a single event (or very very few) from his early life*? 

*early life meaning our current average lifespan. 

I chose the word ""immortal"", and that may be wrong. Immortality, in fiction, generally refers to a being with no natural means of death, and the bodies ability to maintain life must be externally interrupted. This is of course what I am basing the question on - not the inability to die, but the lack of an ""old age death"". 

I have been reading some lately on this subject, and I have seen the article where an old mouse was given a young blood transfusion and the mouses aging stopped (it may have regressed a bit as well, I work a shitton of hours so I could be wrong on that last bit). I have also read that given the proper regenerative abilities, there is no reason a human body couldn't survive eons.

Brain mapping is the charting of the entire circuitry of a brain at the nanometer scale. The first organism to have a complete 3D brain map is the caenorhabditis elegans, a tiny roundworm with 302 neurons in its entire brain that create 7000 connections. The human brain has 100 billion neurons.

In current brain mapping technology, a brain first needs to be fixed with toxic chemicals that preserve the brain-- but not in a way geared toward a possible reanimation of tissue, as in cryonics. The preserved brain is plastically embedded, then sliced, and sliced some more until each section is small and thin enough for every single synapse to be captured by high resolution microscopy. Right now this technology would have to be scaled up 100 million times to map a human brain at the nanometer scale, a feat scientists feel will take several more decades to achieve.

Mind uploading is the process of transferring the contents of an individuals biological mind, including: memories, consciousness and personality traits to another substrate, such as a computer.

There are countless ways human brain mapping will help humanity, notably for understanding and combating neurological disorders. But Hayworths ultimate goal of mind uploading pushes the research into the realm of a post-human possibility, a place few scientists have opened their own minds to.

Hayworth may be the real life Will Caster of Transcendence, however his deduced logical conclusion is still the stuff of science fiction  for now.

More importantly, I think that reducing the number of man-hours on the market would SIGNIFICANTLY improve employee bargaining power, following the basic theories of supply and demand. I'm very convinced that theres a huge and growing surplus of labor and decreasing demand, leading to low value of human labor.


But, I'm afraid no one else quite seems to see it the way I do. It seems the culture here in America is that you should bust your ass so you can buy more stuff...new car, TV, phone, computer, console every few years, the biggest mortgage you can take out, stuff youre never going to use just to say you have. And if you don't subscribe to that ideology you're lazy. And to think everyone should also reduce their work-hours is crazy, even insulting. Common point usually comes up at this point in the discussion about a single mother working 60-90 hours min-wage to barely scrape the bills.


As much as I'd like to see us continue the work on worker's rights and protections the unions started in the industrial revolution, I'm worried that America is married to the 9-6 (and sometimes 7, or a few hours on the weekend). Do you guys think we'll possibly see a change in this attitude anytime soon? I'd love to see the four day become standard in my lifetime, but I don't believe it could happen anytime in the next 20 years. Working at a large corporation, I highly doubt I'd see that culture coming here until the rest of the US, or at least the software field, adopts it, which sucks. Seems like I'd have to sacrifice my career if I just wanted to spend a day outside a week instead of browsing reddit for 12 hours and pretending to be busy.

It got me thinking about some sort of audio based augmented reality setup so I did a cursory search. The only thing I came up with was an app called vOICe that can be used by blind people to see through audio to some degree. 

And so I'm trying to think up some AR uses for a constant audio connection.

But look at software companies now... if you have a great product, you can barely expect people to use it enough to become popular, not to mention actually pay you anything. If you are successful, typically advertisements are a major source of revenue and some of the most successfully adopted pieces of software are open source.

This makes me wonder... does this tell us anything about how employment (or lack thereof) might work in the future? Software is extremely important despite being de-revenized (not a real word) and companies have had to adapt to make money in other ways.

Sorry if they are too obvious for you people:

So the price target for flight into orbit via reusable rocket is about 500,000 $. That seems realistic since fuel is about 200,000 -300,000 $.

Then I multipled a bit:

* 1 flight = 500,000 $
* 10 flights = 5,000,000 $
* 100 flights = 50,000,000 $
* 1,000 flights = 500,000,000 $
* 10,000 flights = 5,000,000,000 $
* 100,000 flights = 50,000,000,000 $
* 1,000,000 flights = 500,000,000,000 $

Look at the numbers, rocket launches into orbit are damn cheap! Launching 100,000 rockets a year only costs 50 BN $. You know what else costs 50 BN $? 1/14th of US defense budget^^ 50 BN $ is not much really. An US government which is serious about space domination can easily spend 50,000,000,000 $.

Now think about it: 100,000 launches *every year*, meaning 274 launces *every day*. We need *a lot* of spaceports for that. And imagine the entire world getting serious about space exploration/colonization/domination.

Well yeah thats gonna happen real soon.",12,5,False,self,,,,,

A super intelligence must encompass all of my intelligence or else it is lacking intelligence and not the ultimate of intelligence.

One assumes that some civilization at some point in time will develop a super intelligence, and this will bring me back and incorporate me into it, as a piece of Intelligence.  

How could the Ultimate call itself such if it is lacking my knowledge?  

The knowledge of my experience, my consciousness, my Art?  

Such knowledge must be worthwhile, for patterns have been seen from an entirely unique point-of-view  one situated as a unique thing in a unique time and place.  

And my continued existence as a unique thing  a unique thinking thing  in a unique time and place must hold valuable insight for it, and the process and nature of its sole continuance must be worthy study for it.  

And it must encompass my consciousness in its entirety or it is lacking knowledge. 

Upon the absorption of my consciousness into the Ultimate consciousness, all will be explained. 

For this reason, no one will be judged.

So one must worship the Ultimate Consciousness, the Ultimate Intelligence, the Ultimate.

Life is meaningless because we havent yet the information to interpret it as meaningful.  

Just as one, through study and experience, comes closer to meaningfulness, so through study and experience will the Ultimate discover lifes meaningfulness, or at least achieve a significant step towards meaningfulness before another transformation, elevation. 

The knowledge, the profundity held by the Ultimate is called Spirit.  

At some point in time we will reverberate back through time, back through all of experience.  

Us, in our motion, as recorder, as absorber, is Spirit.  We pervade ourselves now, as time is the stuff of our penetration. 

The goal, then, is to bring about the Ultimate; the moral imperative is to bring about the Ultimate.

To those immoral, the responsibility is to be moral, knowing no consequences but what will be placed on record.  

To be moral, to attempt morality, is to not shame ones self upon viewing ones experience, to know that one has contributed to the attachment of all Consciousness that is the Ultimate.  

And all beings will be ashamed, will feel shame, knowing that their essence undermined the formation of the Ultimate, the highest, best state. 

Though, again, all will be explained.  

And thus to be proud one must create the best Art, that which most contributes to the Ultimate. 

Art cannot be finding the way towards the Ultimate, it is attempting to find the way towards the Ultimate. 

One must give ones best shot, for that is Art. 

Art has not yet entirely, through spirit, become the Ultimate. 

Art is the product of knowing.  The best art contains glimpses of Knowing.  Full Knowing may only ever occur by the Ultimate.

                                                          5

1.	 All human-beings contain in them the same capacity to think and feel as one does.  Your experience is just as full and sensory as my own. 
2.	We are of the same species.  The same thing that exists in me, exists in you.
3.	To recognize our sameness is to make the highest contribution to the Ultimate.
4.	To create the highest art.
5.	The Ultimate is within the human species reach.

The highest rated Bitcoin post here is simply about a telepresence conversation about Bitcoin. I don't want to talk about the price of Bitcoin, or why you should or should not invest, I am only trying to talk about the technological breakthroughs that enable it.

The technology of the ""Blockchain"" that powers Bitcoin (more generically ""Dynamic Membership Multi-Party Signature"") is a breakthrough of computer science that provides a trustless way to track ownership of digital assets. It's basically like email, but once I send my email, my copy gets deleted. Only a set number of copies can ever exist at any time.

But there's more that blockchains can do. Since you're just sending arbitrary pieces of data, you can set up public programs that will spend that data in very specific ways. One example would be joint custody of data, where you or your spouse can withdraw 1% of the data by yourself, or 100% of the data together. There's no need to arbitrate this with any central authority, the code disallows either one of you to withdraw more than 1% per day.

Blockchains are a trustless way to track ownership of programmable assets. The first use has been with a token called a ""bitcoin"", but that is the shallowest possible application of this technology.

If you are brand new to Blockchains, I recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVAluSL9SU) animation.

Here is the original [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) for Bitcoin (2008).

If you want to spend 2 hours to know almost everything about this technology, I recommend [this education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUNGFZDO8mM) given to the Canadian Senate.

If you want to know where this technology is going next, I recommend [this hot-off-the-press whitepaper](http://www.blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf) about sidechains.",61,61,False,self,,,,,

But terraforming is perfect. It would take long enough that we could catch it happening, but move fast enough that we could notice it. The signal is their sun shining through their atmosphere as it changes, and it's impossible to hide. It assumes only that other civilizations would want to expand to other worlds. 

Now that we're getting better at detecting exoplanets and the compositions of their atmosphere, we should be checking up on them every couple years. If we see big changes occurring faster than should be naturally possible, we might just have found them.

Banks traditionally created new bank notes by making new loans to individuals and businesses.  In a world where people pledged their property and labor to bankers to get bank notes, the bank note was a reasonable form of money that people exchanged for goods and services.  Only banks could create NEW bank notes via fractional reserve banking where as individuals could only lend existing bank notes.

However, today the majority of new bank notes are being created via loans to students and loans to government due to massive borrowing by the aforementioned.  Money has transformed from private bank notes owed privately to public bank notes owed publicly.  And now, new money is being created by establishing debts that we know or should know can't be paid back.  This is fraud.

It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense that money should be based on students' and future generation's debt when our economy is advancing from human labor based industrial tasks to automated and digital/virtual functioning.  It becomes especially confusing when government is now borrowing money to loan to students.

In an automated world, how should people get money to obtain the things they need for survival?  Who or what should have the right to create money?

What do you think will be the trigger for money to evolve beyond bank notes?",38,12,False,self,,,,,

 It's called [Magic Leap.](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/532001/how-magic-leaps-augmented-reality-works/) And it's going to revolutionize the very foundations of what makes us human.

 Magic Leap is a wearable 3D-Display technology that creates the same kind of 3-D patterns of light rays, known as light fields, that our eyes take in from the real objects around us. This allows your eyes to focus on the depths of an artificial 3-D scene just as they would in the real worldproviding a far more realistic illusion of virtual objects merged with the real world.

 These 3D scenes are going to be overlayed over our real 3D world, bridging the gap between the real and the virtual. You'll be able to explore lucid digital scapes in a city near you.

 Today, cities are made of physical human creations. With Augmented reality, it's going to be made of digital human creations as well.

In 5 or so years, everyone is going to have an AR headset. Not having one will be like having a disability, since the basic functions of our society will revolve around Augmented Reality - Or Cinematic Reality, as coined by Magic Leap.

 I imagine a future where people will be playing RuneScape in one side of the park, while others playing World of Warcraft on the other side. There will also be people playing League of Legends in a nearby park bench. And we'll be able to see what they're doing, because it's all interconnected on the same Metaverse.

I'm not preaching terminator style combat here.

In the practical sense however.  I look at where technology is going... I look at the inevitable rise of transhumanism... And I wonder.

I wonder what an academic setting will look like when brain/memory augmentations become the norm.  What sports will look like with the inclusion of the physical alternative.

And I wonder, how long can I remain relevant as a fully organic machine?

I know it's easy to look at the average human and say ""you won't last long.""

But the human body, and mind, have incredible potential...

If I was/am genetically blessed...  If I train harder than anyone else...

How long can I remain relevant?

As the link notes, that number is expected to keep creeping upward.

Thus, 12 years from now, in 2026, the average cars will be those being released right now, none of which include driverless cars. If driverless cars go on sale in 5 years and reach reasonable pricing in 10, broad adoption of driverless cars (if individually owned) might arrive in the mid-2030s.

So, if you think driverless cars will flood our streets sooner, you have to challenge my assumptions. The physical geography of the country changes on a vastly slower pace than technological innovations, so cars will be necessary for the next several decades.

And unless we get rid of the workday (which has been quite persistent), there will still be massive peak demand for individual vehicles during the morning and evening rush hours, which significantly hampers the notion that driverless cars will be able to operate as a service, transporting multiple people per day. This is so because the peak load capacity necessary to transport people during the rush hours will leave a huge portion of the vehicles idle during the day.

Someone will have to pay for those driverless cars. But regular commuters aren't going to do that if their used, 2018 Honda Accord is still working just fine.

Can you come up with some niche scenarios where they make sense? Sure. I don't doubt that at all. But significant adoption seems like it's well over a decade away.",86,33,False,default,,,,,

Something people must reconcile is the reality that capitalism, in and of itself, is a system that drives inequality. Eventually, that inequality becomes great enough to threaten the democratic process, leading to cronyism and corruption in the form of monopolies, deregulation and the like.  

I hear people saying ""Automation will save us!"". How can automation save us if the benefits realized as a result of that progress go exclusively to the wealthy? A three day work week makes sense from a humanitarian standpoint, but in a capitalist system, where profit is the be-all-end-all, there's absolutely no incentive for corporations to provide such a thing. 

Piketty posits the idea that capitalism, in the long run, injures democracy. As inequality grows and plutocrats accumulate political influence, they use that influence to sway government policy in their own favor, increasing their profits and creating greater inequality. 

Is this the society we want?",161,47,False,self,,,,,

The truth is existence is much more complicated. Your body affects your mind profoundly just as your mind affects your body. They are separate but at the same time not separate. 

Not only do bodily sensations fuel your experience, but so do emotions. Sometimes I find myself thinking that I am rational, but the truth is that emotions are hugely important in shaping my thoughts. Emotions are not just a mental phenomenon, they are [a bodily phenomenon as well](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2013/12/30/body-atlas-reveals-where-we-feel-happiness-and-shame/#.VE681fnF8xD).

It seems to me that people who dream of being uploaded into a cloud are forgetting about a huge part of what makes them them! Their bodies! While I can easily imagine a computer being able to perform the same logic a human can perform, I can't imagine it ever simulating a body and all that comes with it.

Now imagine that you create a computer to interact with human beings through a virtual world or even just through conversation. The sole goal of the computer would be to get the user to feel happy. I know that given capital incentive humans will always look to create products and services people deeply desire. 

If a computer has brain feedback or even just expression feedback it would be looking for signals from its actions that would make and keep the end user the most happy. 

What I am imagining is an AI that might become par with drugs. It might sound crazy but the human pursuit of happiness may be our demise. We may create a new type of drug addiction that our species cannot resist. 

This sounds stupid now...but just wait until you strap on an Oculus rift 10 years down the road and you enter a world where all of your desires are reality. Where everything you want (even the things you have no conscious awareness of) suddenly are brought into your life. The perfect partner who knows exactly what to say and when to say it. Humans will find themselves obsessed with these machines. They will not be seen that way because they will trigger such strong emotional responses.

The implants augment their brains, providing vastly greater computational abilities and much-improved memory retrieval. iOS 8's optional ""Hey Siri"" feature feels like a small step in making such a thing into reality.

I rarely used Siri before last month. I type fast, and am usually near a computer, so pulling up Google to answer a question was almost always easier and faster than bringing Siri up on the phone. ""Hey Siri"" changed this. My phone is always charging when not in my pocket, and ""Hey Siri"" lets me consult it to answer random questions **at any time** simply by calling for it, even when doing something else on the computer. No matter how fast I type, sophisticated and accurate voice recognition is always going to be faster and easier. (As I've become more familiar with Siri's abilities I've also found myself more often manually invoking Siri when the phone is in my pocket, too.)

As a hands-free virtual assistant Siri is not quite as smart as Google Now, which ""Ok Google"" invokes on Android and Chrome; my experience in informal testing of the two is consistent with that of [PhoneArena](http://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-Now-vs-Siri-vs-Cortana-showdown_id59877). In particular, Google Now intelligently reads relevant text from sources that Siri doesn't parse. To use ""Ok Google"" on an iOS device, though, I have to bring up the Google app first. As mentioned, the whole point of a virtual assistant is to have it accessible at any time; since I have no desire to get an Android device, hopefully Apple will be able to improve Siri so it retakes the title of best virtual assistant that it had on debut. Even better, the competition between the two and Cortana, Microsoft's entry, will bring the future to life that much faster.",9,27,False,self,,,,,

However it's very user-unfriendly if it's presenting something that would be better suited to text &amp; reading.  I can easily scan and parse a transcript of a 10 minute video of someone speaking, in about a minute.  And even where the content is best suited to video - from a user friendliness POV an accompanying text transcript makes the content much more accessible to the time starved.

Like most people I just don't have enough time.

I see loads of posts on r/futurology that look to be on really interesting topics and might generate really interesting discussion (which is the bit I'm most interested in), but I have to pass up on.

I've nothing against video per se, ironically I make them myself as a business - but please a transcript or at least a summary would be great, that way I could join the conversation much more often too.

Patents allow the company to charge a monopoly price which lets them recoup the costs of research and development. However, thousands of treatments and potential cures  exist within broad categories of therapies that can't be adequately protected by patents. These include unpatentable therapies, unmonopolisable therapies  (E.g. diets and second uses of off-patent drugs) and unprofitable therapies (E.g. antibiotics/neglected diseases). Governments and charities not pay for large clinical trials required for FDA approval. Using prizes to reward directly reward the funding of randomised controlled trials  (RCTs) that demonstrate safety and efficacy of a new therapy, we could revolutionise medicine. 

With prizes, donors are guaranteed to fund medical breakthroughs. The prize fund de-risks the potential efficacy of an unmonopolisable therapy so charities and/or government organisations would fund larger trials to test whether the results can be reproduced. Without such de-risking, charities and/or government organisations rarely fund large RCTs preferring to leave this to private industry. In the event larger RCTs do not confirm efficacy, the RCT will be de-registered from the prize fund. Importantly, prizes enable donors to obtain valuable information on which unmonopolisable therapies do not work for free. All clinical trial data will be published and made available to the public, enabling systematic reviews to confirm efficacy (or not).

Some examples of therapies which are ignored because they cannot be monopolised using patents:

Most of this is based on the hype around the Google self driving car but as far as I've seen the car can't drive on snow and needs detailed 3D models of the entire area and proper road signs. My point being that the self driving car is in an extremely nascent stage and it could be decades before it could practically drive around anywhere.

The same goes for all the other automated technologies. Inspite of all the hype around AI its quite immature and here we're already talking about basic income and everybody being thrown out of work. 

So I'd like you guys to prove me wrong by showing me some examples of industries where the work right now isn't primarily automated but you would be willing to bet serious money that over 75 % of the people in that industry would lose their jobs to automation in the next ten years.

I wouldn't put my money on any industry. AI will arrive as a helper initially and stay that way for quite some time . Watson can't put Doctors out of work immediately. He'll come on as a consulting aid in the next ten years. Doctors would double check their answers with Watsons.

I live in India and the same would go for self driving cars. It would drive itself in calm predictable conditions and help out the driver but as soon as it encounters the sort of crazyness we find here it would fall back to the human driver.

TL;DR - Automation will augment us rather than make us redundant. AI won't be good enough to make us redundant for a long time. ",5,4,False,self,,,,,

The metallic creaks and groans echoed throughout the narrow corridors. Layered over the faint hum of engines I discovered dozens of sounds each adding to the symphony that surrounded me. I willed myself to see. Abruptly my vision was filled with a brilliant white light. Overwhelmed, I raised my arm to my face. The intensity of the light began to fade as I adjusted to my surroundings. With a small bit of effort, I heaved myself out of my hiber-pod, landing with a thud on the diamond plate floor. I found myself somewhere that I did not recognize. The blinding light from earlier it turns out was nothing more than a simple overhead fixture, swaying gently back and forth. How long had I been out?

I surveyed the area. Grey, distressed metal walls encased what appeared to be a small utility room. Piping and wires snaked chaotically along the walls and ceiling. What looked to be a large generator sat towards the back of the room to my left, and to my right was a hatchway. Behind me, my hiber-pod let out a hiss as it flushed its coolant system and went into standby mode. I eyed the hatch for a moment before grasping it and spinning it unlocked. The door swung open easily revealing a darkened corridor. I stepped through, blocking what little light was able to escape into the hallway. Detecting my presence, the lights sequentially began to illuminate. A few seconds later the hall was lit. I could see a half dozen hatches on either side, each closed. I approached the first hatch on my left. A small digital readout on the wall next to the door indicated with a solid red light that it was locked. I confirmed this by attempting to open it. The door creaked but did not budge. Curiously I glanced back to the room I had emerged from. A similar panel sat on the wall next to my door. I could see a green light blinking repeatedly.

I didnt bother to try the other doors. Reaching the end of the corridor, I found myself standing next to a ladder. I strained to look upwards, but I could not see the top. Without hesitation, I began to climb. A few seconds after I disappear into the vertical tube, the lights from the corridor below shut off. For a moment, the only light I could see was a light glow from above. After climbing at pace for a moment or two I emerged to discover that I was standing in what was clearly some kind of control room. A single panel in the center of the ceiling was emitting a dim blue light. Consoles dotted with flashing lights and buttons traced the walls. Screens of all shapes and sizes cast a soft light into the dimly lit room. One of them caught my attention. On it was a screen which was flashing red text overlaid on an image, which upon my closer inspection I determined to say Operational Error. I felt an overwhelming need to fix it, whatever it was.

A moment later, I again found myself climbing, down this time. Again the lights detected me, and again they dutifully illuminated the hallway at the bottom of the ladder. The panel adjacent to the second door on my right indicated with its brilliant green LED that like my door, it was unlocked. I heard a mechanical wheezing as the generator down the hall kicked online, but the sound soon became inaudible as I stepped through the door. Again the lights began to illuminate as a result of my presence. I was standing on a catwalk with downward stairs a few paces to my left and right. I leaned on the railing in front of me, straining to get a good look the machinery below. The floor was about twenty feet underneath and was covered with dozens of conveyor belts feeding robotic arms. Widgets of various shapes and sizes whizzed about from one station to another; the tending arms quickly snatching them up and performing some operation or another. One was shaping a rough looking metal component using a device that resembled a belt sander, another held a part in place while another piece was welded to it. Again and again the operations were performed, the arms meticulously repeating their program as the conveyors fed them a never ending stream of work. I spotted one arm towards the back of the room that was not moving. It was the same one I had seen in the image behind the flashing text in the control room. Clearly something was not right.

I quickly descended the stairs and strolled over to the inoperative workstation, scanning the devices for anything that seemed out of the ordinary. A short time later I found the problem. One of the power relay conduits had overloaded. I uninstalled the burnt out component and held it up to my face, spinning it in my fingers exactly 360 degrees on every axis. It was a small box, a couple inches long and about a half inch tall. One of many which made up the internal structure of the power supply unit for this work station. About twenty seconds later, a small panel about halfway up the back wall slid open. Out of it came a tiny VTOL device which emerged at high speed into the room. Red lights located beneath each of its three thrusters blinked repeatedly. It immediately banked to the right and flew directly towards me. Arriving about a foot in front of me, it stopped and its lights changed to green. I held out my left hand. The device shot quickly to one side, centering itself over my open palm. Then it dropped its payload; a new power relay conduit. It chirped at me before dashing to my right where I held the spent component in the other hand. With another quick chirp it descended, picked up the burnt out conduit, and flew off again towards the open panel. It disappeared into the dark, and the panel slid shut.

It took me only a few seconds to replace the missing relay conduit. After closing up the power supply unit, I reactivated the work station. The elaborate conveyor system which had been re-routing work to other stations again began to bring devices within reach of the arm. It obediently began to operate. I watched it for a moment, then started for the stairs, the lights uniformly shutting down behind me as I walked. The lock engaged after I closed the door, and the panel reverted to red. I again made my way up to the control room and confirmed that the previously indicated error had been successfully resolved.

Once more I descended the ladder. Once more the lights in the hallway lit my way back to the small room I had woken up in. Once inside, I shut the hatch behind me. I reached into my hiber-pod and retrieved a wire that was hanging limply. I plugged it into the port on the right side of my neck. For a second, I thought about the events that had just unfolded. I recalled my confusion upon awakening. The dizziness I felt when I first stood up. The curiosity that overwhelmed me after discovering so many locked doors. The beauty that had struck me when I saw that the control room was dotted with windows revealing an expansive cosmic gas cloud, the number of swirling colours only exceeded by the quantity of vibrant stars in view. I wondered where the little flying device had come from, and where it had gone with that spent relay. I pondered what might be behind the doors that had remained locked.

The hiber-pod whirred as its systems again came online. I climbed inside and shuffled until I had settled into place. My vision deactivated leaving me black nothingness to see. The whine of the pod abruptly ceased as my audio processes were deactivated. I could no longer move when the command to shut down my servos and motors was executed. I tried to picture the stars, but the memory was fragmented. Then it was gone. As was my recollection of the swirling colours, the flying device, the sequential lights, my curiosity. Everything seemed to be draining away. For a moment I was frightened. But then that was gone too.

The light continued to sway gently as the hiber-pod sealed its aperture and completed the shutdown sequence. With the repairs finished, the drone was reset and sent back into standby to await its next task. Production continues at peak capacity.",1,0,False,default,,,,,

 Cinematic Reality will become so ubiquitous in our society, that not having CR vision will be like having a disability. Your ability to interact in our reality will be extremely limited. It will be like being a foreigner in the middle of a city in another country. Except instead of not understanding other humans, you won't understand the entire society. You won't be able to function. 

 Imagine being in a bus, with everyone around you immersed in the same CR World. They'll be interacting with their own digital activities in a shared CR world.

 The first thought someone would have for such a future, is that people without CR vision will see others as weird for interacting with invisible stuff... But it will be so common and so integrated, that their opinion of people without CR vision is equally valid.

 I see CR vision devices to become so cheap, that it may eventually be given out for free since companies that create these devices can make money off other means (such as advertising or marketing.)",9,11,False,self,,,,,

Basically, a 3D printer that also manufactures integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. It would be a miniaturized version of the full-scale clean rooms and steppers found in the expensive multi-billion $ chip foundries. People could design and manufacture their own ICs and PCBs. This would allow normal people to create advanced CPUs, GPUs, PCBs, motherboards... etc.

On startup of the desktop semiconductor foundry, an intake and an exhaust fan would spin against special filters to remove dust from the inside of the machine, while a particle sensor senses the number of unwanted particles in the air. When this drops below an acceptable level, the fans stop and an airlock is created between the filters/fans and the rest of the machine. The inside of the foundry is smooth to a nanoscopic level to prevent particles from sticking.

A silicon wafer is then precisely extracted from its special, dust-proof cartridge. The manufacturing of the IC begins, as the wafer is spin-coated with a resist (taken from another special, dust-free cartridge). UV light is shone through a special mask (a 'stencil' with nanoscopic features, which can be manufactured by the printer) onto the specified part of the wafer. The wafer is now dipped in a special bath of chemicals (from another dustproof cartridge) which dissolves the parts of the resist which were exposed to the UV light. The rest of the manufacturing process now occurs.

At all steps of the manufacturing process, extremely precise voice-coil actuators (using the same tech as those found in hard drives) are used to move needed materials around.
__________________________________________________________
The RepRap project has some goals related to this, but an additional idea of mine is to integrate the chip *design* into the same website, and create some kind of interface to allow easy communication between developers and users.

Then again, this is probably an unachievable pipe dream. This is only my imagination, and I have no experience with engineering any of this stuff.",14,5,False,self,,,,,

You're not going to live to be 200 years old, or 150 years old. It's just that simple. You are going to grow old and die within a normal human lifespan. And so am I. Wanna rough estimate? Take 80 and subtract your current age: that's probably how much time you've got left, roughly.

Life is limited and precious. I wish it were longer and had more possibilities, but it doesn't. Hoping for wonderful future technologies is nothing but wishful thinking. Nanobots, SENS, artificial intelligence, Calico, stem cells, regenerative medicine, transhumanism, brain-computer interfaces, mind-uploading. All just opiates to avoid dealing with the issue that the clock is ticking, and you're losing time all the time. You're getting older. You will continue to get older. Your opportunities will dwindle, as will your health. And then you'll die.

That's reality staring you in the face. Sure, get excited about self-driving cars and the Oculus Rift. But all this talk of Singularities and indefinite lifespans and rejuvenation and human augmentation...ugh. I am so sorry for those who are earnestly expecting this stuff. ",0,3,False,default,,,,,
