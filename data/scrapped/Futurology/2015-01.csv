9,2015-1-1,2015,1,1,21,2r04wq,"A day in 2060 (chapter from the paper titled ""Distributing Cognition: from Local Brains to the Global Brain"")",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2r04wq/a_day_in_2060_chapter_from_the_paper_titled/,Septuagint,1420115485,"""[L]et us imagine what a day circa 2060 could look like. What follow is a speculative science-fictional story, but I will analyze it and give hints and references explaining why it is plausible.

You're walking on the street and meet a Japanese woman. She starts to speak her native language, but your augmented reality lenses automatically translate and display what she says. Akemi explains that her GPS doesn't function well and asks if she can connect to yours to find her way. You accept the request, but your augmented reality vision also display: try something. What happened in the background of your extended self in order to suggest this? In a fraction of a second your sensors and artificial agents did the following. They took a picture of Akemi, from which an image-search was launched, along with face-recognition. Several webpages of her public profiles were found. This information was integrated to create a profile, summarizing her professional, and to a lesser extend, personal interests. Additional visual and olfactory sensors on your wearable clothes did notice unusual pupil dilatation and pheromone concentration. Intellectual and bodily data concluded  on both sides, since Akemi did of course do a similar search  that this encounter was an excellent love match. You could have configured your digital agents to give a you better tip than try something, but you chose a low advice specificity profile, to leave some of life's spontaneity. So, you indeed try something, and invite her to join you and your friends for swimming with dolphins this afternoon. You share time and GPS coordinates and you are thrilled that she accepts the invitation.

You run back home, cross the street without even looking at cars. A car brakes violently. You are surprised to see a driver in it, and shout: poor and dangerous biological human, buy yourself a self-driving car, your reflexes are too slow! Your emotional reaction was monitored and the automatic legal decision making actually gives you a one bitcoin fine, because you should not have had crossed so quickly the street in the first place, and you should not have had insulted the human driver, which had a negative emotional impact on him. Your augmented reality informs you sympathetically: I understand that you felt upset and need more security. This security indeed implies that people should switch to stronger human-machine symbiosis, but can you please be more careful next time? This transition towards human-machine symbiosis is still in progress. The driver felt embarrassed and miserable about this situation, which is one of the reason why you had to pay this fine. I don't advice to make an appeal, it will only cost more money and given that the situation was recorded by 10 different nearby sources, there is few ambiguity, so the judgment has a 99.9% confidence. The bloodstream of the driver has also been checked and it was perfectly clean, whereas your adrenaline levels were unusually high. You understand this but still wonder why human-driving cars are still allowed to circulate. Probably a lobby of the old-fashioned Association for Biological Human Rights. 

When you arrive home, a self-driving car just brought fresh cartridges, automatically ordered by your 3D food printer. As soon as you plug the nutrient cartridges in, your 3D printer cooks for you, based on inputs from nanobots floating in your bloodstream, which monitor the nutrients you need most. Your 3D printer is furthermore configured to follow your preferences, in this case, to follow a paleo diet because you decided to be in line with evolution. The animal protein supply is a mix of artificially grown meat, fish, worms, and insect proteins. The food quantity is also higher than usual, because your printer anticipates your sport activity planned in your agenda. Indeed, you gave access to your agenda to your printer. The recipe is a new creation, because you've configured your printer to never print two times the same meal. Life is too short and the world's diversity of cooking too great to eat two times the same meal.

When you arrive at the harbor, safety procedures are quick and simple, just to give your stem-cell box, which could be used by the first-aid-kit on the boat. The boat is small, and no oxygen bottles are taken on board. Instead, the trainer takes a suitcase containing syringes. Just before going into the water, the trainer gives a shot to all participants. What is in the shot? Mechanical artificial red cells, providing a 4 hours in vivo Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA). You and your friends dive in the water, play and communicate with dolphins, thanks to the dolphin speaker interfaced with your augmented-reality diving mask.

Suddenly, the boat radar displays an alert on your mask: Shark approaching at high speed; no time to swim back to the boat. Fight is the only option. But you use your biological brain and think that there must be another way. You remember that dolphins can sometimes fight a shark. You turn to the dolphins hastily, set your dolphin speaker to beam a help signal, along with the 3D shape of a shark you quickly downloaded. Fortunately the dolphins understand your message, they do thank you, but get scared and swim away! The AI advice was wise. You feel frustrated that AI was once again smarter than you. Out of sea mist, the shape of a shark is coming. Some last minute information is displayed on how to fight a shark to you and your friends. You start to read them, but too late, the shark has chosen to attack you. You see the shark's jaw dramatically expanding and... nothing. You loose consciousness.

You wake up on the boat, fully recovered. Akemi is looking at you. 
You ask her: what happened? She explains that your friends managed to scare the shark by fighting him from multiple sides on its gills, and that he finally released you. You ask: but how come was I not wounded? Akemi: You actually almost died! Your nano health bots detected your right kidney and your liver were critically failing. The message was transmitted to the first-aid kit on the boat, and the 3D organ printer started to differentiate your stem cells and printed at fast speed two new organs. I contacted a Japanese surgeon expert in organ transfers for an urgent tele-operation. I gave him distant access to the first-aid robotic surgery apparatus, and he could work with the printed organs. I hope you don't mind we chose a human surgeon, we are still not confident enough with the cheaper fully robotic AI surgery. Your health insurance reckon that the incident could not have been avoided, and financially covers the whole operation. The file is already closed.
You ask: what about the shark? Akemi continues: Since it drunk on your blood, it will be infected by artificial viruses. I guess you feel resented, but you know that global eco-regulations forbid to reprogram them at a distance to kill the shark. However, thanks to this artificial virus infection, the shark is now trackable and should not create any further incident to any diver with an augmented-reality diving mask. As you put back your augmented reality lenses, you look at your information feed, and see that you have been thanked by diving, surfing and fishing associations for successfully tracking an additional shark.

On the way back to the coast, you skim some news and learn that a bomb has exploded at the headquarters of the Association for Biological Human Rights. The police has found out that the bomb was printed directly through the local 3D printer of the association. The cyber-attack left traces distributed around the globe. Police said the identity of the hacker is uncertain, and the debate rages whether it was triggered by a human or a coalition of artificial agents. At the end of the day, you realize that AI agents have done much for you today, and are in awe and grateful to them and your friends. You owe them all your life.""",9,43

They're dirty and therefore spread disease; they're bulky and weigh us down; they're prone to being lost/stolen; wear and tear means the US mint spends millions every year replacing physical currency and even more money transporting it to banks with the necessary security operations. 

There is no doubt the cashless society is the future. How can we usher in this change more quickly? Some suggestions:

* Use your debit and credit cards more. If the public aren't using cash, it won't circulate and the mint won't have to waste money printing more. From my past experience working in retail, I'd estimate that 60% of my customers paid using card. It was mainly the poor who only used cash.

* Lobby politicians for the elimination of the penny. Inflation has rendered this coin worthless and many countries, such as Canada and Australia, have already stopped minting the 1 cent piece. Prices are rounded up to the nearest 5 cent when paying with cash, whereas prices remain the same with card. Fears of increased prices have turned out to be unfounded in other countries where the penny was abolished. Due to the current price of copper, the US mint (read: taxpayer) spends almost 2 cent to mint a 1 cent piece; i.e. we're losing money with every penny we make. 

Any other suggestions or comments in general?
To preempt the usual responses from conspiracy nuts: no, a cashless society does not mean the government are monitoring every transaction you make. Bitcoin has shown that cashless currency does not mean surrendering anonymity.

EDIT: Just wanted to add that the proliferation of online shopping will also greatly help the arrival of the cashless society. You can't pay for your Amazon purchases in cash.",22,0

Here are some issues I saw, a couple with no way I could think of to solve.

1. Firstly, they eject people into space for any infraction. That is a waste of biological material that you can't get back, not to mention the clothes they wear and such. I know that this would result in total system death in months, especially since they just open an airlock and don't vacuum it first. Today's tech could fix that, using the bodies of the executed as fertilizer or something else (would like to discuss that).

2. Oxygen. I'm not entirely sure how that works on today's space stations, so what would be the tech behind renewing the oxygen? And could you make a system that would survive a century before beginning to fail?

3. Water. The same issue as above. I know you can clean it, but what would be the process behind it, using tomorrows tech?

4. Getting back to Earth once things on the ground have calmed down. Would there be a way to get the population, whatever it may be, back to Earth once the crisis that kept you in the station was over?

The pet industry in the United States is growing larger and I suspect that with more and more people around the world reaching a level of comfortable income, the amount of people caring for a pet should increase as well. 

We often talk about the implications of new and exciting technological innovations in our lives but what about the lives of our pets? 

What kinds of products do you think will be hitting the pet market in the near future and distant futures?

There was some noise regarding this over the last few years but since the CGP Grey video earlier this year the same well meaning, but ultimately wrong, misunderstandings the video are based on are being repeated as fact so I figured in the spirit of the New Year it might be worthwhile to explain why you are probably considering automation in the wrong way, what the literature actually shows and what the future may look like as automation increasingly performs roles labor does.
Curvy supply &amp; demand
The way consumers &amp; producers interact is both predictable and well-studied. The simple model used is called Supply &amp; Demand; while it has exceptions where externalities are created and the model fails it is a reasonable axiom to use when discussing the interaction between two economic actors seeking to exchange.
S&amp;D is based on [curves](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Supply-and-demand.svg/500px-Supply-and-demand.svg.png), where both the supply &amp; demand curves are in equilibrium demand will be met with supply and establish the price and quantity of the good supplied (AKA matching). Certain changes in either curve have predictable results;
	Excess supply will always result in price falling. Except in cases where demand is inelastic this will result in a new matching with a higher quantity and lower price. This is what happens when supply increases without a supporting increase in demand; this is why gas is relatively cheap right now. On the curves this is a rightwards movement of supply.
	Excess demand will always result in price rising. Except in cases where supply is inelastic this will result in a new matching with a lower quantity and higher price. This is the mechanism manufacturers use when they limit production (EG new consoles) to maximize the price they can charge for a good. On the curves this is a leftwards movement of demand.
	Inelastic supply (quantity supplied will be relatively fixed irrespective of demand or price) will always result in no change in quantity but a reduction in price. This is why low-income labor requires protections such as the minimum wage; they cant choose to withhold labor so with fixed or falling demand price is established by demand not through equilibrium matching. On the curves this is represented by a downwards movement in supply.
	Inelastic demand (quantity demanded will be relatively fixed irrespective of supply or price) will always result in no change in quantity but an increase in price. This is why emergency healthcare uses prices controls in most areas of the world; people must consume emergency care so there is no matching to find a reasonable price. On the curves this is represented by an upwards movement in demand.

A tale of three utilities
A consumer chooses to consume based on marginal utility for a good. Marginal utility is the perceived value of a good and is why some people spend $200 on a pair of shoes while someone else may only be willing to spend $20.
One form of MU is called leisure utility and strongly informs how, when and why we work. Leisure utility is simply the choices we make which improve the value of our leisure time, we make decisions to work more because we perceive the income we will earn from that work will allow us to do more with our leisure time then we would have been otherwise able to do. This is why people work overtime to save for vacations, why people work insane shifts etc. Back in the 50s &amp; 60s when people were predicting 20 hour work weeks this was the factor they did not consider; people will always seek to maximize their leisure utility and while the cost of living has and continues to fall people will not simply maintain the same lifestyle and work less but rather seek out more work which allows them to have more money (and more things) which they perceive will improve their lifestyle (and thus leisure utility). This is also called the [Backward bending supply curve of labor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_bending_supply_curve_of_labour) and is an extremely important part of [consumer choice theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_choice).
We have utility for all sorts of things that are non-obvious. McDonalds beats Starbucks in blind taste tests yet Starbucks is perceived as higher quality coffee and people will generally choose Starbucks over McDonalds if they are not concerned with price. We place utility on the experience of Starbucks, having a hipster serve us overpriced milk with burnt coffee while some band we have never heard plays and people pretend to work on their laptops around us is what we are paying for not the drink itself.
A tractor to rule them all
We have had four distinct periods of automation so far;
	Early mechanization  Cotton gin etc. This also birthed the Luddite fallacy, when fabric workers destroyed their sewing machines as they perceive them to be replacing their labor.
	Agricultural mechanization  Tractors etc
	Early manufacturing mechanization  Cars on the production line etc
	Late manufacturing mechanization  Robotic construction lines, CNC programmers instead of machinists etc.
We are now heading in to the fifth period where services are beginning to become automated; accountants, MDs and other skilled professionals will be augmented or displaced by increasingly smart algorithms.
Throughout all previous incarnations of automation replacing labor has not resulted in an increase in structural unemployment but rather an increase in labor demand, lowering the price of goods by mechanization and new opportunities for demand have resulted in an increase in the demand of labor. They have all certainly been disruptive with skills of the workforce changing rapidly and some people who cant or wont retrain left with skills with increasingly falling demand. 
Automation is always disruptive but on a societal level has always improved the way we live and work. It forces increasing levels of skills on the population with correspondingly higher pay, lower crime, increased health etc.
Where we go tomorrow
The fundamental misunderstanding with technological unemployment is about the nature of labor and the failure of people to appreciate the answer to what will people do when they are automated is something else. There is nothing special regarding this round of automation that would mean we should expect different results, automation will lower prices which will allow us to buy more and different things and opens up new areas of consumption as a result increasing labor demand elsewhere. This is part of [compensation theory](http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=cahrswp).
Most certainly it will be disruptive and most certainly our education systems are not configured correctly to handle this problem but the problem is one of retraining not one of unemployment, how do we meet the educational needs of those displaced by automation. This debate has been going on [for an extremely long time](https://books.google.com/books?id=z6nA4t-NV58C).
The simplistic way to consider this is that until machines can actually replace all labor there will always be sufficient demand for labor to meet supply. Its very possible we will need to massage pay via a system like NIT and undertake massive reforms to the way we educate (such as replacing the idea of a long period of formalized education at the start of a career with many much shorter periods of education throughout life) but these are very different challenges then technological unemployment.
The rise of the knowledge worker is one of the best examples of labor already adapting to changes in automation and this process will accelerate. Its also expected that the nature of company organization will radically change as the capital entry cost sinks it will no longer be [Pareto efficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) to have extremely large corporations in most sectors and instead the optimal business for most sectors will be one with a small handful of permanent staff but a large staff of temporary workers who perform specific tasks across many employers.
Due to demographic pressures the current trend points towards massive levels of labor shortage over the next generation which already exists in healthcare &amp; technology and will spread out to other fields, even if economic consensus on this issue is wrong and technological unemployment will become a reality in the future labor shortage is a far more pressing and immediate concern.
Not the opposite of abundance
There are many discussions of post-scarcity in Futurist circles, for good reason as its an awesome idea, but its also poorly understood.
Scarcity is simply the quality that demand is infinite but supply is not and thus access to goods needs to modulate by price. The opposite of scarcity is post-scarcity (or non-scarcity) not abundance, a good can be abundant but scarce or rare but non-scarce.  Post-scarcity cannot simply be declared, ultimately one of the failings of Marxian economics, but has to be achieved by technology.
Water is a non-scarce good; there is enough water to meet any level of demand so its impossible to create a market for water, I cant sell you rights to rain water you can simply catch anyway. A bucket of human waste is a non-scarce good; there is no demand for your waste and thus no market can be created allowing you to sell it (the exception case of Japanese porn accepted).
A good becomes post-scarce when the capital cost of production is effectively zero. A robot that can construct other robots and also mine Iron causes Iron to become post-scarce, its impossible to create a market for Iron as the cost of someone obtaining a robot to mine Iron is zero. In essence supply becomes effectively infinite so price is always zero for any quantity.
Post-scarcity does not require us to have replicators or future tech of that degree, it simply requires us to be able to obtain resources without the input of capital or labor.
A society becomes post-scarce when the majority of basic and luxury goods become post-scarce, it would no longer support a monetary system (as a monetary system itself relies on scarcity and exists to manage scarcity) and for the remaining scarce goods (the art of a specific person, land etc) an alternative system would emerge. The alternative system cant even really be postulated about, never having had a post-scarce society before its very hard to even contemplate what it might look like.
Skynet
This brings us round to the end point of automation when our algorithms become smarter than we are. The but what case with technological unemployment is always the singularity case of automation displacing all possible forms of human labor, you go see a doctor who is really a machine and your booty call is a sexbot 2000 with synthetic farts.
In reality the singularity is also the point at which we become post-scarce (you cant replace all labor without also making all production post-scarce), absent money discussions of technological unemployment are pointless as the question as to what people will do is still something else but with the added point it doesnt matter.
TL;DR: Automation is not going to make you forever unemployed because S&amp;D, utility and scarcity.

102,2015-1-3,2015,1,3,5,2r4rwk,A different perspective on technological unemployment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2r4rwk/a_different_perspective_on_technological/,[deleted],1420230167,"In the last few years the technological unemployment (AKA Luddite fallacy) issue has resurfaced with otherwise very credible people like Bill Gates and Larry Summers repeating arguments that have been largely regarded as wrong since industrialization, inevitably these arguments are met with some relatively poor policy suggestions and misunderstandings regarding how automation interacts with economics.

There was some noise regarding this over the last few years but since the CGP Grey video earlier this year the same well meaning, but ultimately wrong, misunderstandings the video are based on are being repeated as fact so I figured in the spirit of the New Year it might be worthwhile to explain why you are probably considering automation in the wrong way, what the literature actually shows and what the future may look like as automation increasingly performs roles labor does.

**Curvy supply &amp; demand**

The way consumers &amp; producers interact is both predictable and well-studied. The simple model used is called Supply &amp; Demand; while it has exceptions where externalities are created and the model fails it is a reasonable axiom to use when discussing the interaction between two economic actors seeking to exchange.

S&amp;D is based on [curves](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Supply-and-demand.svg/500px-Supply-and-demand.svg.png), where both the supply &amp; demand curves are in equilibrium demand will be met with supply and establish the price and quantity of the good supplied (AKA matching). Certain changes in either curve have predictable results;

* Excess supply will always result in price falling. Except in cases where demand is inelastic this will result in a new matching with a higher quantity and lower price. This is what happens when supply increases without a supporting increase in demand; this is why gas is relatively cheap right now. On the curves this is a rightwards movement of supply.
* Excess demand will always result in price rising. Except in cases where supply is inelastic this will result in a new matching with a lower quantity and higher price. This is the mechanism manufacturers use when they limit production (EG new consoles) to maximize the price they can charge for a good. On the curves this is a leftwards movement of demand.
* Inelastic supply (quantity supplied will be relatively fixed irrespective of demand or price) will always result in no change in quantity but a reduction in price. This is why low-income labor requires protections such as the minimum wage; they cant choose to withhold labor so with fixed or falling demand price is established by demand not through equilibrium matching. On the curves this is represented by a downwards movement in supply.
* Inelastic demand (quantity demanded will be relatively fixed irrespective of supply or price) will always result in no change in quantity but an increase in price. This is why emergency healthcare uses prices controls in most areas of the world; people must consume emergency care so there is no matching to find a reasonable price. On the curves this is represented by an upwards movement in demand.

**A tale of three utilities**

A consumer chooses to consume based on marginal utility for a good. Marginal utility is the perceived value of a good and is why some people spend $200 on a pair of shoes while someone else may only be willing to spend $20.

One form of MU is called leisure utility and strongly informs how, when and why we work. Leisure utility is simply the choices we make which improve the value of our leisure time, we make decisions to work more because we perceive the income we will earn from that work will allow us to do more with our leisure time then we would have been otherwise able to do. This is why people work overtime to save for vacations, why people work insane shifts etc. Back in the 50s &amp; 60s when people were predicting 20 hour work weeks this was the factor they did not consider; people will always seek to maximize their leisure utility and while the cost of living has and continues to fall people will not simply maintain the same lifestyle and work less but rather seek out more work which allows them to have more money (and more things) which they perceive will improve their lifestyle (and thus leisure utility). This is also called the [Backward bending supply curve of labor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_bending_supply_curve_of_labour) and is an extremely important part of [consumer choice theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_choice).

We have utility for all sorts of things that are non-obvious. McDonalds beats Starbucks in blind taste tests yet Starbucks is perceived as higher quality coffee and people will generally choose Starbucks over McDonalds if they are not concerned with price. We place utility on the experience of Starbucks, having a hipster serve us overpriced milk with burnt coffee while some band we have never heard plays and people pretend to work on their laptops around us is what we are paying for not the drink itself.

**A tractor to rule them all**

We have had four distinct periods of automation so far;

* Early mechanization  Cotton gin etc. This also birthed the Luddite fallacy, when fabric workers destroyed their sewing machines as they perceive them to be replacing their labor.
* Agricultural mechanization  Tractors etc
* Early manufacturing mechanization  Cars on the production line etc
* Late manufacturing mechanization  Robotic construction lines, CNC programmers instead of machinists etc.

We are now heading in to the fifth period where services are beginning to become automated; accountants, MDs and other skilled professionals will be augmented or displaced by increasingly smart algorithms.

Throughout all previous incarnations of automation replacing labor has not resulted in an increase in structural unemployment but rather an increase in labor demand, lowering the price of goods by mechanization and new opportunities for demand have resulted in an increase in the demand of labor. They have all certainly been disruptive with skills of the workforce changing rapidly and some people who cant or wont retrain left with skills with increasingly falling demand. 

Automation is always disruptive but on a societal level has always improved the way we live and work. It forces increasing levels of skills on the population with correspondingly higher pay, lower crime, increased health etc.

**Where we go tomorrow**

The fundamental misunderstanding with technological unemployment is about the nature of labor and the failure of people to appreciate the answer to what will people do when they are automated is something else. There is nothing special regarding this round of automation that would mean we should expect different results, automation will lower prices which will allow us to buy more and different things and opens up new areas of consumption as a result increasing labor demand elsewhere. This is part of [compensation theory](http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=cahrswp).

Most certainly it will be disruptive and most certainly our education systems are not configured correctly to handle this problem but the problem is one of retraining not one of unemployment, how do we meet the educational needs of those displaced by automation. This debate has been going on [for an extremely long time](https://books.google.com/books?id=z6nA4t-NV58C).

The simplistic way to consider this is that until machines can actually replace all labor there will always be sufficient demand for labor to meet supply. Its very possible we will need to massage pay via a system like NIT and undertake massive reforms to the way we educate (such as replacing the idea of a long period of formalized education at the start of a career with many much shorter periods of education throughout life) but these are very different challenges then technological unemployment.

We've been seeing a huge saturation of apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic movies and stories. Death by giant meteor, death by robot uprising, environmental and social collapse, viral pandemics, ghost apocalypses and sharknadoes. But this isn't something new. Stories about the end times date back nomadic tribes. Maybe it's simply the human condition to be able to imagine an end since all things end rather than a change.

There's plenty of films that show us something we've seen before, such as hyper Capitalist nation or an Authoritarian government, but with a dramatic twist: Logan's Run, Soylent Green, Running Man, Hunger Games, the Purge, Who Framed Roger Rabbit etc.

So I'll repeat the question, what movies try to explore different economic or social models for more than simple social commentary?

It becomes immediately easier to create media involving taste, smell, and touch. Perhaps also the experience of another's thoughts or emotions, or other more obscure or abstract internal experiences.

Would written text, and even spoken language become obsolete? Replaced in some cases by simplicity and other cases by richer, quicker, more sophisticated mental language?

Would society reorganize based around people's proficiency with the technology (and with their own brains)?

Would virtual reality become the dominant reality?

Imagine people interacting one-on-one, but also in groups of various sizes. 

Obviously, there's extreme potential for dystopian scenarios. I'm personally most interested in the philisophical / epistemological richness of the line of thinking, but whatever you like.

Also obviously, the feasibility, or current state, of any specific brain technology is interesting and important, but shouldn't limit the bounds of imagination.

Also, also obviously: singularity. This topic is obviously intertwined with a lot of that thinking. Maybe the idea here is to focus on the limits of experience as an individual, or as a human brain.

Individual planets and star systems will most likely have different forms of government. The strength of this depends on if FTL travel is widespread and/or possible. If FTL travel is possible and widespread, individual systems would be able to enforce their rule much more easily. If FTL travel is uncommon or not possible at all, large pockets of space would be independent, and there would be pockets of civilization with completely different forms of government.

Many people are scared of automation taking people's jobs but automation is actually great for the economy and without it the world would be nothing compared what it currently is. Thus, automation is an investment which all businesses should participate in because it makes production less costly and more efficient.  

Imagine a world without machines. Yes, actually do it!  Scary right?  Anyways, lets examine the standpoint of people who want to stop automation for fear of job losses.  These people must make sure they keep their argument against eliminating automation consistent!  If they are against machines taking away jobs... well then you have to get rid of the wheel since its a machine!  Think about all of the Millions of people whose jobs are taken by the wheel. Lets examine Semis for example. 1 Semi Truck carries up to 80,000 pounds.  Now say we did not have the wheel but we had people to carry the boxes. Say 60 pounds each. We would employ 1,333 people per semi truck compared to one driver that a trucking company employs!  Wow... think of how many semis there are! There are about 5.6 million semi trailers in the U.S. to be exact. And if we employ 1,333 people per trailer we would have to employ 7,064,900,000 people to transport all the current products being shipped in the U.S! Of course this is all a hypothetical situation, but this is what is happening in small scale when people stop automation in business. In the example of the semi trucks, the employers would have to pay each each of the seven billion people and that would make the product delivery company have to charge astronomically high prices for shipping goods. With the super high prices of transportation the manufacturing company would have to raise its prices a large amount and everyone employed by the trucking and manufacturing companies would not be able to buy the products which would make all the companies to go out of business. A constant spiral down back to the ancient age if we had no automation.  

People who want to stop automation are looking at their own plight, but overlooking the great long term prosperity of everybody including themselves. Sure they will lose their job but in losing their job they are allowing prices to drop because of the efficiency of automation. Machines make work easier, increase production, and bring prices down because of their efficiency. They also increase profits which, reinvested, can create more jobs in areas which humans are currently still needed, providing benefits to help unemployed employees get back on track, and also the increase in profits could help provide free education! With free education many more people would pursue their dreams and achieve excellence which would supply many more genius minds to assist the world in progressing. When prices drop due to automation the whole economy benefits because people will be able to purchase more products and live better in general. Automation is for the better of everyone, and thus society must start accepting it! Imagine again if the world never had the wheel and where we would be without it. Stopping automation is like stopping the invention of the wheel because every new invention being created could change the world for the better just like the wheel did.

  The reason for this, some argue, is that there will not be enough jobs to go around once automation hits. 

  My question is: Why is that? When the amount of people working the land begun to fell thanks to automation that led to more free hands that could work in fields no one had thought of before. 
Why will this not happen now? 


**Sure new jobs created demands less and less workers, the amount of workers Amazon have on their payroll is less than what GE had when it was rapidly growing a generation ago. 
But that is a good thing, that means that it will be room for much more production in society when we can do less with fewer people**, which is something that have always led to increased standard of living, for all classes in society.
Why will that not be the case now?  

  this: The strive to be more efficient and hence be able to be more efficient and grow the production with the same amount of workers in a society is capitalism biggest benefit, not as often portrayed in this sub its weakness.

##Discussion

This question was sent to us by /u/Architect101:

&gt;This is an idea/topic you might find interesting to discuss on the podcast.

&gt;Similarities between the faith of a Religious person and the confidence in a better tomorrow of a Futurist.

&gt;I recently spoke with a skeptical friend who saw my view of the future (including ideas of transhumanism, singularity, and general futurology) unlikely to come to fruition. He humorously compared my confidence in a better future to the faith of a Southern Baptist.

&gt;Anyway, thanks for the work you do for the podcast, it is appreciated.

&gt;P.S. I started reading ""Rainbows End"" by Vernor Vinge after hearing you guys talk about the fiction and nonfiction recommendations; ""Abundance: the future is better than you think"" is already sitting next to my Kurzweil books.

You see, I have the feeling that every politicians, instead of confronting the reality that [work will never be the same again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU), lie to themselves and lead people into thinking that we're just going through an unemployment phase and that everything will be back to normal within the next decade.

Work is still viewed by most as one of the biggest part of person's life, but it's not true anymore, today, society make 10 time the revenue with ten time less workers.

Work is already a thing of the past, but I feel like NOBODY understands it, we try to drag the thing as much as possible, we say thing like ""work has just moved in asia"" or worse, ""immigrants take our work"". This is just not true, work is just disapearing and will continue to do so.

Politicians try to ""bring work back"", they need to understand that this is not possible. And if we don't stop thinking like this, the future will be a catastrophy.


So I'm asking you this : Without work in the future, how will our society be shaped ? Because work is tied with money, without work, money becomes obsolete.

Of course for me, the answer is obvious : communism. I'm not talking USSR communism, I'm talking Star Trek communism. But what do you think ?",14,6

I am an 18 year old student currently studying in the UK, with the hopes of doing physics at university. I am working on a project at the moment exploring lasers, and their potential uses in generating/exploiting energy from nuclear fusion. During my research, I stumbled across a surprising potential application of lasers - beaming energy back to earth from a ring of solar panels on the moon. A Japanese concept known as the LUNA ring caught my imagination. 

LINK: http://www.shimz.co.jp/english/theme/dream/lunaring.html
(also contains PDF)

Keen to find out more, I chanced my arm, and emailed the firm to see if they would answer some of my questions about this ambitious project. To my surprise, the innovator and creator of this concept, Dr. Kanamori, has agreed to answer ANY of my questions about the LUNA Ring project. 

I was wondering if anyone here could provide me with some insightful/good questions to query Dr.Kanamori with, as I want to make the most of this opportunity!

Thanks

470,2015-1-8,2015,1,8,6,2ro8l1,[Speculative Discussion] Hyperstructures and their feasibility as the future home of humanity on earth.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2ro8l1/speculative_discussion_hyperstructures_and_their/,Kintanon,1420667479,"I am a fan of the Hyperstructure (Arcology) concept and I believe that we currently have the technology to move the entire population of the United States into 50-100 structures that are each 1 square mile, depending on how tall we are able to build them. Anywhere between 1000 feet tall and a 3000 feet tall should be entirely possible based on the height of existing structures using current materials. 

I would like to discuss other potential issues and problems with this concept and to get things started here are a few of the necessary pieces of technology to make this possible and some links to associated articles about the technology to let people get a brief idea of if it before discussing it:


Materials Acquisition to fuel 3D printing of consumer goods:

http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/lab-rat/2011/10/26/plastic-from-bacteria-now-in-algae/

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing


Food production:

Energy Production:

http://e360.yale.edu/feature/will_solar_windows_transform_buildings_to_energy_producers/2524/

http://buildingturbines.com/



There are obviously limitations, pitfalls, and potential problems involved in the concept, but I think that we are very close to being able to successfully reduce humanities footprint on the planet down to a fraction of our current usage and at the same time provide a comfortable existence to everyone on the planet.


Random notes: My calculations are done by assigning 400sq feet of living space for each person, regardless of age. I am assuming a 1500 calorie diet, which is much closer to what people in a modern sedentary society actually need than the 2000+ many people consume.

I've been writing about the future for many decades and I am thrilled to be among many others here on Reddit who take the future seriously. I believe what we think about the future matters tremendously, for our own individual lives and for society in general.  Thanks to /u/mind_bomber for reaching out and to the moderation team for hosting this conversation. 

I live in California, Bay Area, along the coast. I write books for publishers, and I've self published books. I write for magazines and I've published magazines.  I've ridden a bike across the US, twice, built a house from scratch. Over the past 40 years I've traveled almost everywhere Asia in order to document disappearing traditions. I co-launched the first Hackers' Conference (1984), the first public access to the internet (1985), the first public try-out of VR (1989), a campaign to catalog all the living species on Earth (2001), and the Quantified Self movement (2007). My past books have been about decentralized systems, the new economy, and what technology wants. For the past 12 years I've run a website that reviews and recommends cool tools [Cool Tools](http://kk.org/cooltools/), and one that recommends great documentary films [True Films](http://truefilms.com). My most recent publication is a 464-page graphic novel about ""spiritual technology"" -- angels and robots, drones and astral travel [Silver Cord] (http://silver-cord.net).

I am part of a band of people trying to think long-term. We designed a backup of all human languages on a disk (Rosetta Disk) that was carried on the probe that landed on the comet this year.  We are building a clock that will tick for 10,000 year inside a mountain [Long Now](http://longnow.org/). 

More about me here: [kk.org](http://kk.org/about-me) or better yet, AMA!

Now at 5:30 p, PST, I have to wrap up my visit. If I did not get to your question, my apologies. Thanks for listening, and for great questions. The Reddit community is awesome. Keep up the great work in making the world safe for a prosperous future!",383,1149

More Context: 

This daydream was sparked by seeing an iPad battery. 90% of the volume was a rectangular battery. They designed the product around the battery. Then I began thinking about the wires in devices, how wires are the reason ""gadgets"" usually come in one package - how else do you get energy to all the parts? Energy has ruled the design process of gadgets for the last century. Centuries. Even in the age of man-powered machines, products had to be linked by driveshafts to transmit energy. Imagine if it didn't, and we could go back to the drawing board. Centuries of paradigms would become meaningless - it's hard to even shift my mind away from the old way of thinking. What did design look like before ""energy sources"" became the primary constraining factor? The sun is the only unconstrained energy that comes to mind, and plants are the main consumers of sunlight. Would technology become like seeds and plants somehow? Like some nurturing landscape for humanity, but instead of an array of photosynthesis cells, it would be made of an array of nanobot tech? Nanobots could replace so many things.",49,18

It seems to me that after Oculus releases their first consumer headset we will have about 5-10 years of iteration and miniaturization of this technology until it becomes a mainstream device the size of a thick pair of sunglasses.

When immersive virtual reality (including tactile) is distributed to the public I don't see how we will avoid a large portion of the population falling into addictions with it. 

It seems to me that once this technology is released, it will be a major turning point in human history. So many of the things we do in life are motivated by wanting a certain scenario. But once we can design and experience artificial scenarios our our choosing (travel anywhere, do anything, make love to anyone), I see the fabri of our current society breaking down.

What are your thoughts on this?
Do you think it is a major turning point?
Do you have any suggestions for controls on this technology?

The thought experiment assumes that immersive virtual reality (incl. tactile) is distributed roughly the same way as television is now.",25,25

It has been a gradual process, but I've finally come to realize how incredibly outdated and unintelligent our way of life on planet earth is.

Pick any topic out there like democracy, nation states, military, economy, labor, transportation, housing, food production, education and you can surely come to the conclusion that if we'd start from scratch today, with our combined knowledge so far and our scientific model as a base, we'd arrange life completely different. 

Our current way of life is insanely flawed. Basically all fellow humans have a pretty lackluster experience of life on earth. However, thanks to all the amazing brains featured in this subreddit I get to see a hopeful side of humanity.

The society we live in is basically just layer upon layer since dawn of man. Difference today is that we've now accumulated enough knowledge that we can actually understand our tribal flaws and overcome them. Which means we could actually tear down our society as we know it, build a new scientific and logical base without all these ancient systemic flaws, have basically everyone understand the thought process, and come out way better off on the other side. 

That's not Utopia. It's a fact.

I'm of course a realist, with no power whatsoever, which is quite annoying at times, but I'll try to do my best throughout life to promote the brightest minds and the best ideas among us. We humans are pretty awesome when we want to. ",39,25

The findings are a step towards the production of a commercial fossil fuel alternative, say the British and Finnish researchers.

Although we have only produced tiny amounts so far, the fuel we have produced is ready to be used in an engine straight away, says Patrik Jones from the Imperial College London.

Published in the journal Nature Communications this week, the study shows that E. coli (Escherichia coli) can interrupt a biological process that turns fatty acids into cell membranes.

The researchers used enzymes to channel the fatty acids along a different biological pathway, so that the bacteria made engine-ready renewable propane instead of cell membranes.

While work is at a very early stage, says Jones, his teams findings are proof of concept for an alternative way of producing propane, which is currently obtained from fossil fuel reserves.

Propane is an inherently clean burning fuel due to its lower carbon content and it has an existing global market.

In its current form it makes up the bulk of liquid petroleum gas (LPG), which is used to fuel everything from cars to central heating systems to camping stoves. It is already produced as a by-product during natural gas processing and petrol refining, but both of these are fossil fuels that will one day run out.

Fossil fuels are a finite resource andwe are going to have to come up with new ways to meet increasing energy demands, Jones says.

He says a major challenge for scientists is to develop a renewable process that is low-cost and economically sustainable.

At the moment algae can be used to make biodiesel, Jones says, but that process is not commercially viable because the harvesting and processing require significant energy and money.

We chose propane because it can be separated from the natural process with minimal energy and it will be compatible with the existing infrastructure for easy use.

Jones says the level of propane his team produced is currently a thousand times less than what would be needed to turn it into a commercial product, so they are now working on refining their process.

At the moment, we dont have a full grasp of exactly how the fuel molecules are made, so we are now trying to find out exactly how this process unfolds.

I hope that over the next five to ten years we will be able to achieve commercially viable processes that will sustainably fuel our energy demands.

Kinetic weaponry is generally very effective and they're still widely used today. The thing with energy weaponry which is still fairly theoretical is that they're liable to power failure. 

Since kinetic weaponry will likely always fire projectiles at speeds less than the speed of light, following a predictable trajectory. Therefore those projectiles can be tracked and countered by their target.

Consider how Israel's Iron Dome defense system has almost rendered simple rocket attacks obsolete. Laser weaponry doesn't have this issue because it moves at the speed of light, therefore it can't exactly be tracked and intercepted as easily. ",87,25

Anything that is wrong or broken is fixed. The only apparent drawback is that it can't help you if you have brain damage. The machine goes as far as repairing the face of a man who had been injured with a grenade. I believe a technology like this could be possible, and potentially not as far away as you would think. Several technologies that are being worked on that I have seen here would help bring this to life. 3-d printing, nanotechnology, and there is even using electric signals through the nerves to regenerate tissue (I don't think you could regrow a limb that easily, but including that allows for other potential uses for the signals). What do you guys think? Is it possible? If we can fight cancer with nanotech, what is stopping us from fighting viruses with it? That would solve cancer and diseases caused by viruses. Using printing and nanotech combined you could repair most damage to the body (we have printed organs, if I remember correctly. If not, stem cells could be used to grow a new ""whatever is broken"". )",44,29

Universal Basic income (as a result of unemployment due to automation) is the obvious solution to..... *you*

That's because as humans we all believe that we are important and deserve to exist and have basic human rights. Well, we do... we serve a purpose to keep the economy going which only serves the purpose of making money and resources for valuable people and the wealthy. We only think UBI is the obvious solution... because *we think we are important*. That's it.

What the fuck are we getting ourselves into?

As millions of people go on UBI and their jobs are eliminated, why the fuck would powerful and wealthy people at the top, the people who actually OWN and OPERATE the automated robots and industries want millions of people reliant on them? To fund UBI we need to tax the wealthier folks on the planet, no?

Think about it, they'll lure us into a massive trap, a delusional utopia where we all don't need to work, have excellent medical care and have robots doing everything. Once the actual point of no return occurs where they don't need people around such as programmers and such, the solution is very obvious.

Elysium type of situation could occur, a massive holocaust perpetrated by robot mass killers and a bribed well-cared for police/military could happen, or something even worse. All the power (given through an automated force) will be in the hands of the few.

It's simple, once the worker drones (us) are not needed and we are sapping the taxed resources of the ones with true power (the ones holding the automated-force control ""card"") it's very simple to just push the button and ignore the massive holocaust happening outside the window, or planet-side from Elysium. 

This was a very scary realization and I am sure I haven't thought through these things clearly.

EDIT:
Thinking about this further, it gets scarier. They will bide their time positioning the human race into a carefully  compartmentalized society. They will supply the UBI for everyone while eliminating jobs through automation. They will give lip service about how it's beneficial for the human race, how they are happy to oblige. They will make sure they are paying the politicians and scientists/programmers to keep them in their pocket. They will absolutely ensure they hold the keys to making and operating all machinery and A.I. 

After a threshold is crossed where the A.I can do anything a human can do or better and self replicating robots can cater to any whim the power-holders have, that's the point where they drop all the dependent humans. Maybe offer sex slavery to genetically fortunate people as a ""merciful"" option? 

Why won't they just ignore us, why kill us?

*Because we're going to kill them once we realize what's happening* 

It's going to be a carefully chosen point in time.

Further Edit:

We need to think of a way to ensure all of humanity benefits from and is protected by robots. But again we will have to make sure that those robots CANNOT EVER be under the control of the people at the ""top"" whatsoever. Good luck with that when they control the manufacture and software of the robots.

This is like the ultimate survival of the fittest (the smartest, luckiest, and most cunning humans). the survivors and perpetrators will go on to ensure their genetically enhanced lines of families.

I see a lot of discussion about the science of life extension, or about what choices individuals would make about it, but I see less talk of what it will mean for society.

So imagine that over the course of the 21st century, we make fairly steady progress against aging. Say by 2050 people with access to medical care have another decade of healthspan and lifespan, with both increasing at 6 months a year (so we'd be up to two additional decades of health and life by 2070 for example).

What would this mean for society? How would people react to being just a little too old to reach actuarial escape velocity (where your lifespan is increasing at better than a year per year)? How would society react to people living significantly longer, and the real possibility of people currently alive living essentially forever?) on the progress in extending the human lifespan. I see a lot of discussion about the science of life extension, or about what choices individuals would make about it, but I see less talk of what it will mean for society.

Now as most things CES, it's all concept and vaporware at this point, but there is certainly an enormous amount of hype around drones.

I was talking with my friends about the possible future of drones, and it doesn't make much sense in the consumer market. I certainly understand drones for military, agricultural, and industrial applications, and drones are obviously novel for news and filmmaking. What I don't get is the hype around personal drones.

The great consumer technological revolutions, such as the automobile, the PC, and the smartphone, followed the trend from one per household, to one per person, to multiple per person. I just don't see the utility for drones beyond the initial novelty.

Let's imagine a future drone that is as tiny as a smartphone, durable, lightweight, cheap, with high definition video, wireless control from a smartphone or voice commands, and perfect stabilization and guidance. I'm imagining a small block that fits in your pocket, and you take it out, push a button, the rotor pops out, you drop it or throw it, and it immediately begins hovering, awaiting your command.

The obvious utilities for such a device are taking selfies or video, and purely as a toy. Now, is this something that everyone is going to want? Is it something that every kid is going to have in their backpack, or every teen/adult will have in their pocket, or is it just a lot of hype around a nifty toy that will disappear once the novelty wears off?",15,1

Using one of the most powerful lasers in the world, researchers have accelerated subatomic particles to the highest energies ever recorded from a compact accelerator.

The team, from the U.S. Department of Energys Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (Berkeley Lab), used a specialized petawatt laser and a charged-particle gas called plasma to get the particles up to speed. The setup is known as a laser-plasma accelerator, an emerging class of particle accelerators that physicists believe can shrink traditional, miles-long accelerators to machines that can fit on a table.

The researchers sped up the particleselectrons in this caseinside a nine-centimeter long tube of plasma. The speed corresponded to an energy of 4.25 giga-electron volts. The acceleration over such a short distance corresponds to an energy gradient 1000 times greater than traditional particle accelerators and marks a world record energy for laser-plasma accelerators.

This result requires exquisite control over the laser and the plasma, says Dr. Wim Leemans, director of the Accelerator Technology and Applied Physics Division at Berkeley Lab and lead author on the paper. The results appear in the most recent issue of Physical Review Letters.

Traditional particle accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, which is 17 miles in circumference, speed up particles by modulating electric fields inside a metal cavity. Its a technique that has a limit of about 100 mega-electron volts per meter before the metal breaks down.

Laser-plasma accelerators take a completely different approach. In the case of this experiment, a pulse of laser light is injected into a short and thin straw-like tube that contains plasma. The laser creates a channel through the plasma as well as waves that trap free electrons and accelerate them to high energies. Its similar to the way that a surfer gains speed when skimming down the face of a wave.

The record-breaking energies were achieved with the help of BELLA (Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator), one of the most powerful lasers in the world. BELLA, which produces a quadrillion watts of power (a petawatt), began operation just last year.

It is an extraordinary achievement for Dr. Leemans and his team to produce this record-breaking result in their first operational campaign with BELLA, says Dr. James Symons, associate laboratory director for Physical Sciences at Berkeley Lab.

In addition to packing a high-powered punch, BELLA is renowned for its precision and control. Were forcing this laser beam into a 500 micron hole about 14 meters away,  Leemans says. The BELLA laser beam has sufficiently high pointing stability to allow us to use it. Moreover, Leemans says, the laser pulse, which fires once a second, is stable to within a fraction of a percent. With a lot of lasers, this never could have happened, he adds.

At such high energies, the researchers needed to see how various parameters would affect the outcome. So they used computer simulations at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) to test the setup before ever turning on a laser. Small changes in the setup give you big perturbations, says Eric Esarey, senior science advisor for the Accelerator Technology and Applied Physics Division at Berkeley Lab, who leads the theory effort. Were homing in on the regions of operation and the best ways to control the accelerator.

In order to accelerate electrons to even higher energiesLeemans near-term goal is 10 giga-electron voltsthe researchers will need to more precisely control the density of the plasma channel through which the laser light flows. In essence, the researchers need to create a tunnel for the light pulse thats just the right shape to handle more-energetic electrons. Leemans says future work will demonstrate a new technique for plasma-channel shaping.

Multi-GeV electron beams from capillary-discharge-guided subpetawatt laser pulses in the self-trapping regime by W. P. Leemans, A. J. Gonsalves, H.-S. Mao, et al. was published in Physical Review Letters on December 8, 2014.

It made sense without technology but if you take a second to think about it, there's 2 reasons why we essentially ""own"" children and why these may not make solid reasons in the future

* we are the cause (sex)
* they are very similar to us (dna)

Both of those reasons could very easily break down soon. 

1: With the [British research](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/24/science-skin-cells-create-artificial-sperm-eggs) on potentially creating sperm and egg from something like a skin cell, having sex would no longer be essential to having children. Even crazier than that, it could also lead to a society where we purposely get the snip so we can't have children through sex and where the majority of us only have children  through methods listed in the research above (artifically creating sperm/egg from dna samples).


As a subpoint, the future could get very scary if this happened. All of a sudden, if you were trying to avoid having kids and paying child support, not having sex wouldn't be good enough. Simply pulling a hair from someones head and presto, you can have a child with them. The idea of this ""being yours"" may go away. See point two.


2: With the breakthroughs of cost (among lots of others) in biology, such as being able to combine 3 sets of dna together, suddenly we pick and choose traits and the idea of dna being similar seems to fade away. If i took someones dna and made it different and then created a child from that, would it be ""theirs""? How close to them would it need to be for it to be considered theirs or not theirs? What if it was something so different that it shared no commonality with anyone?


Now, there's 2 more scary thoughts coming. One: If we continue to reproduce artifically, we may never know if we are infertile. If something were to happen where we could grow sperm and an egg but it would not happen naturally, then we could potentially be passing down a genetic disorder that we would never know about. In future generations, we could possibly have significant proportions of the population being infertile (as normally these traits are obviously not usually passed down)


Two: Imagine about 200-1000k or more years have passed. The world is by majority using artificial forms of reproduction. The government or some other agency (or maybe we, as a society) decide that maybe we put in place mechanisms to purposely remove the ability to have children to avoid mistakes. It's something that is either modified to our bodies at birth or changed in dna to propagate onwards. It could be enforced very strictly and easily. Perhaps now that it's all done this way, dna is picked for us, or unwated traits are secretly or maliciously filtered out.

The competitive advantages for creating it ensure that it will happen eventually. Its equivalency with ""God"" comes into view when the implications of intelligence using intelligence to increase intelligence are considered.

Axiom Two: **An intelligence trillions and trillions of times more intelligent than all humans combined could be conceived of as God-like**.

God is what mind becomes when it has passed beyond the scale of our comprehension. Freeman Dyson

The Singularity is the intelligent transcendence of biological nature taken to its historical extreme: the advent of a greater-than-human artificial intelligence. It turns out that the orderly continuation of the law of accelerating returns could potentially lead to a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.

As the internet of things merges with original internet, real reality and virtual reality will blur and this means that the global mind of God-AI would ultimately blur with real reality. Nanobots in the human brain could interact to create virtual reality from within the nervous system. This virtual reality could interact with the real reality that has merged with the global mind of God- AI. Smart dust could organize and reorganize like robotic angels or servants of God.

Theorem: Creating a God-like being robs Nietzsche of his philosophy.

The bermensch lives in supreme joy in the state of being; achieved in overcoming ones self in power over ones self.

The bermensch is related to Nietzsches idea of eternal recurrence through the will to live and relive this supreme joy in the moment, eternally  along with every pain inherent in self-overcoming, eternally.

Life is an experience born to crush the weak and downtrodden and through suffering and struggle make the strong stronger; into Uber-men.

Wouldnt the prospect of creating God aka The Technological Singularity rob Nietzsche of his philosophy grounded in the idea of struggle?

If Nietzsche is correct; in that the struggle is what makes life worth living, Doesnt the Technological Singularity destroy Nietzsche by creating God-AI? 

**Does it destroy the meaning of life itself?**

Computers cannot themselves read your emotions, do not themselves analyze data, do not themselves wish you well. Nay, computers are a dead object following command after command, command written to it by one, or multiple persons. They suck data  memories, faces, actions, words, and feed it to a central database - no; that database is neither its own entity; merely a vessel, a tool - the lens through which the people who control you are able to see into your living room, work place, every breathing air space. Once they know you, once they watch you, they can govern actions by safely predicting reactions. The essence of global control lies in the ability to mobilize swathes of people. When we strip down the individuality of the individual he is more likely to submit to the group in order to obtain self-identification, self validation, comradeship. We see idolization at every corner  look to the idols of youth! Mass media conglomerates are the collective soul who decides who is worshiped and at what time. In this way it is able to parse the youth into categories of identification and lead the direction in which these once individuals now group seekers are to take.

When you see how mass conglomerates father the youth you say thats all well and good, it is only mild directing and for the greater good; the greater good being the survival of a great economy i.e the ability to provide for the sick and vulnerable. One might say it is harmless fun, and another might choose to agree, but when you see the methods put in place to harmlessly lead the youth into buying things and apply those methods to transactions of faith you suddenly have quite a volatile package. Here were speaking of religion and absolute faith, and the true ridiculousness of a multi-faith society. Media conglomerates are successful due to their ability to mobilize persons into submitting their thought and will to their will and thought. Religions are successful due to their ability to mobilize persons into submitting their will and thought.

One may argue both institutions are merely giving people what they want, but for them to keep a steady profit they would gain from having people think in the same ways; If they think in the same ways, they want in the same ways; when they want in the same ways, they consume in the same way, they act in the same ways  they are driven by the same thing. Once control of that drive has been gained, an unstoppable force is created; a juggernaut of elitism grips the force and directs it for its own profit and its own profit only. We see that media conglomerates are wildly successful, and we see religion is wildly successful, only media conglomerates are unable to hide the very fact its will is only to its own power because it is manifest within a physical reality. Its profit is printed in dollars. Spiritual capitalism is far more deceptive because its wall street is located deep within the subconscious mind, its traders the window to the world, the window which is looked through by whoever wishes to look through it. There are many windows and each offer a different view.

Religion sells you comradeship, brotherhood, righteousness, peace, alleviation from every day fears, tempering of self conviction. Its price is your will and action, your thought, your freedom, your submission. Once this submission is place, or almost at one and the same time, you are instantaneously caught into idolization; idolization of saints and script writers each telling the success of their own personal experience within the realms of consciousness. It then becomes easy to project their demons upon the world in attempt to slay that which is evil, in the spirit of script writers, instead of focusing on the demons, the evil, residing in ones self (the latter of which, ironically, was most likely the script writers initial intention). This is why we see the conflict that we see throughout history  a splitting of ideals, friction created and encouraged between ideals before a mobilization of people with conviction in ideology into conflict. In this way evolution occurs, their can only be one winner in wars, the loser cast out of the hypothetical gene pool.

Often we do not realize we are each on journeys of our own, and that the paths took then are far removed from the paths we take now. We should join the script writers in spirit, but we should not be commanded by their very own demons. With regards to religion it often appears that it is not the flower we must be searching for, for that is not ours; it is but the seed we must be searching for, and that seed we must grow for ourselves, not by direct command of but with the assistance of those who have achieved success through their conscious experience.

Success can be gauged by spiritual give and take  by the pain we cause to others, directly or indirectly, and by the pleasure we cause to others, indirectly or directly. Because we all originate from the same organism loving others is as simple as loving ourselves. There is pain in our split which is caused only by love of the self. Love of the self causes the outside world to become a direct threat to its own existence and causes, love of the self leads you to be fathered by mass media conglomerates. It splits itself off from all existence. There is only one truth, and that is that we are all one and the same, one and everything. To split is to hurt.

I know there's a hamburger machine. Why the fuck isn't this being developed faster? Fuck that, how come food automation isn't being rapidly implemented? Thats millions of fast food jobs right there. There's also coffee and donuts. Millions of jobs. 

The faster we eliminate jobs and scarcity the better off mankind is. We  can focus on exploring space and gathering resources from there. The faster we can stay connected to a virtual reality and tangible feedback that delivers a constant dose of dopamine into our brains.

I'm not an educator but have worked in education (as an instructor) and know quite a few people with teaching credentials working in secondary and post secondary institutions. I've also spent more than half of my life in school just like anyone reading this, so I have no end of first hand experience to draw from. I should add that I'm probably the most disillusioned person I know when it comes to the way young people are educated and this is the main reason I never want to teach in this system. When taking accelerating change into account, the nicest thing I can say about our education system is that it is doing a lacklustre job of preparing kids to thrive in modern times.


I know that the precursor of the modern education system we know so well was designed in Prussia centuries ago and the guiding philosophy of education during that period wasn't as much learning as it was conditioning young people to be part of the working class where they would do repetitive tasks day in, day out, until they died. Education was thus designed to give students the tools they needed to function in this environment, not to be creative freethinkers.


While our education system (as it exists in developed countries) has changed a lot since then as it continuously adapted to suit the demands of the day; it is, at it's core, the same system and it is too inflexible to adapt at the rate it needs to prepare students to live in a world with constant change where most of the hard facts they learn will be meaningless to them in the real world and where most of what they learn in the real world will have little in common with what they learned in school. Since the structure of our formal education system is proving to be too rigid to help students keep pace with accelerating change and to even really connect with most of them, it makes sense to me to think of building a new system from the ground up rather than iterating on the system we've been refining for hundreds of years.


Another point that I think needs mentioning: people on this subreddit lament the 40 hour work week and the backwardness of our work culture, however this work culture is the basis for education and education too reinforces the way we work to the extent one can't change without changing the other.


The problem I run into when discussing education with educators, though, or even with laypeople, is that they think the modern education system as being sacred on some level. Like religion or work, this system has been around for a long time and as such has gained false legitimacy from this passage of time instead of on its own merits. To criticise the core of our public education system like I'm doing here is seen as heretical to most people working in education. When I assert that we need to rebuild the system from scratch instead of tweaking it here or there as we have been doing for centuries, it is seen as radical.

That said, what I believe public education should become (in a very general sense):


- Personalized, not ""one size fits all""

- Self-guided (to an extent)

- Emphasis on collaboration over competition
- Big student projects that are self-organizing

- Hands on and visual, relying more on modern technologies

- Schools should function less like a factory and more like a community


...and so on.


**TL;DR** Given a blank slate, what would an education system designed to educate and prepare students for the world in this century be like? How do you think this can be achieved, politically and socially?

While that might be true, I hope that people on these forums will find a practical humanism amidst all the transhumanism. Please pick a question that is part of transhumanism, and write what you think is practically applicable humanist version.

I will go first: Longevity.
The problem is simple: If we can live to be 500, or even 1000, then mortality and nativity will be even more problematic than it is today. Overpopulation would be the end result of no death, only birth.
The second is cost. Only the rich would afford longevity, and therefore it would cement social inequalities.

The latter is easy: Longevity in itself will be funded by the government. The cost will be a loan, and be re-payed through a percentage of the income. This loan will of course have a flat interest that funds other therapies. 

So who gets to undergo longevity therapies? The rule that needs to be enforced is simple: If you have created life, you have to die. If you have kids, no matter if they are planned or not, you will not be eligible for life-extension therapies beyond the current life-span of a human. Palliative care only.

Breaking this law has no penalty, only needed interventions: Of course you are jailed for the rest of your life (to make sure you do not break the law again). Your assets at the time of breaking the law, and all resulting assets, are seized by the government to use as taxes would have been used.

To further this: male contraceptives are partially or fully funded by the health-care system. As well as female contraceptives.

With the environmental damage the human race has inflicted on this planet it would be tempting to argue that we have been one of the worst afflictions nature has endured. There is however an alternative stance where we could be seen as the saviours of nature from its fated failure on Earth.

Life on earth has a best before date. 600 million years from now most plant life as we know it will have gone extinct as their photosynthesis mechanisms fail in a world with dwindling carbon in the atmosphere and with it the food chains that support multicellular life. 1 billion years from now only simple single celled life could possibly exist and 300 million years after that all cells with a nucleus will fail. Some simple prokaryotes could linger another 1.5 billion years until the temperature of the planet rises to 147 degrees Celsius. These dates may seem too far into the future to worry about, after all our common ancestor with the chimpanzee lived only a mere 5 millions ago. Our existence as a species is a blip on this time-scale, but this time-scale is just a blip in the longer time-scales that life could survive if it were to be spread throughout the galaxy with the aid of an intelligent civilised shepherd species such as us.

Stars are our life givers and as long as they exist a galactic civilisation will be able to sustain life by moving from dying systems to new ones until the days that only stellar remnants like white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes exist. Those days will only start 10 to 20 trillion years after the last stars in our galaxy are formed which could be anywhere between 1 trillion and 100 trillion years from now. Perhaps a galactic civilisation will work out new technologies to sustain life through the degenerate era when the sky is dark from the lack of stars, if it does this could extend earths legacy to a nonillion(1030) years from now when the galaxy has ejected or absorbed into its supermassive black hole core all stellar remnants, brown dwarfs and planets. To let life fail in its minuscule infancy as we would be if we let nature take its course here on Earth would be the worst negligence and tragedy we could inflict.

With a deadline for us to go galactic so far in the future, perhaps it could be said that it should not be an immediate goal, and that perhaps a wiser species will emerge after the humans are gone that could fulfil this shepherding goal. First I would say that lifes doom may be sooner than the final dates mentioned above. Asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes and gamma ray bursts are only a sample of the mass extinction events nature could throw at us at any given time. As (if we ignore our livestock and pet animals) humans are the largest biomass on the planet of land based tetrapods(in fact larger than all wild land tetrapods combined) it could be reasonably expected that whatever would wipe us out would wipe out any species with the potential to evolve all the features required to create a space-faring civilisation in the time frame before the inevitable end of Earths life support. As an intelligent civilised species has only emerged once to our knowledge in the history of our planet we must not dismiss the possibility that we are a one off fluke of evolution. We may well be the only chance life has.

The universe is without an objective meaning or purpose, it just exists. What is remarkable is that within that cold indifference the universe has become self aware on a small blue dot in the minds of its animal life. It is only in minds that we find any meaning or purpose: subjective purpose. Minds find their own goals and work towards them, as biological beings it is understandable that most of our purpose comes from replication. What is more fitting a goal for a mind than to help its ancestors descendants thrive as long as possible?",82,92

It lists several instances where this has already impacted the planet in quite recent times, 2003, for example. 

Let's say, for the sake of argument, that this trend continues to develop. The surface becomes hot--too hot for most plants to survive on. Heat waves kill off plants, food chains die from the bottom up.

I use the term AI here, though most likely it would be an ever evolving expert-system, that with time would become capable enough to be called a true AI.

AI term can be stretched quite a bit - but usually if we are imagining a robot that is meant to be something like a butler, personal assistant, maid/cook - for all of these functions the ""~AI"" driving the robot needs to be able to learn new information so as to adapt the robots functions to the user. Things like where stuff should be around the house, user preferences... 

There is also a very frequent factor of ""outdated"" robots that are no longer useful and the ethical considerations of throwing away/disposing of semi-sentient equipment.

But software today is almost in all cases designed to be modular - it just makes sense to do it that way because almost all software is quite complex and it is just easier to develop and maintain if it is split into modules that can be fixed/upgraded and replaced individually. 

Todays PCs, cars - all modular in structure. Even the way we use our IT devices almost in all cases splits required functions for user into separate modular applications.  

This approach is also obviously used in development of the expert systems driving robots now - if you look at things like ROS system being done by [Willow Garage](https://www.willowgarage.com/pages/software/ros-platform) - separate software modules for each internal function. Most other development projects are proprietary and close but it's almost a certain bet that modular design is a key concept.

So, what kind of advancement would every necessitate you to throw away your old robomaid vs. either upgrading her bit by bit or copying her data into a new chassis?

It seems to me more likely that families in the future of semi-AI driven robots, would basically include an AI that only ever grows - the same ""instance"" of personal Ciri/Cortana that would babysit my kids, will probably still be around to babysit their grand-grand-kids. Granted it would likely be in a much sleeker chassis by then, and probably be exponentially more capable then it was initially - but whatever personality/experience it adopted in its initial incarnation (probably just a very extensive collection of user preferences) would never ""die"" or need to be disposed off - they would need to only ever evolve/adapt to new users.

With the way our memory storage keeps growing, they probably wouldn't even need to ever ""forget"" anything about their past - though probably would need to be able to compartmentalize and hide it for privacy reasons - wouldn't want grand kids to be able to query the family maid as to what kinds of porn grandpa asked it to collect for him. 

But in essence, they would be constant immortal companions for each individual user.",2,5

Once OPEC started to see this competition they introduced policies to American refinery owners where they could decide what price to pay for oil, on the condition that they bought a certain number of barrels. This flooded the market with cheap (mostly saudi) oil. Gas prices plummeted and the electric car and alternative energy markets almost completely died out. 

I know that technology has progressed significantly since the 80s, but what is stopping this halt in progress from happening again? How do we keep OPEC from killing off these industries?

Imminent applications are the transmission of milliamp quantities of current (mobile device charging), but could there be a potential future in wireless kW transmission?

Consider transportation - the electric high speed rail uses a distance wireless transmission of only a few inches, as a electromagnetic field suspends the vessel above conductive rails. How could this wireless energy be transferred over longer distances?


In the 1980's, there was the [SHARP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_High_Altitude_Relay_Platform) - unmanned aircraft suspended in flight for extended periods by focused microwave power. The 1980's also lacked the exponential transistor increase of 2015 as allowed by Moore's law, which may have resulted in an expensive microwave targeting system. The same holds true for the initial conception of wireless energy. It has been speculated that the funding of Mr. Tesla's Wardenclyffe tower was abandoned by JP Morgan because it was impractical from a business perspective - reception of the power could not be tracked and metered. This is understandable because society would not be held accountable for how much coal they were indirectly consuming (as there would have been a source for creating the steam that would power the turbine by which the Tower drew its source). What if this invention was too far ahead of an unpredictable era of Internet, GPS, and microprocessors? An era of secure wireless meters?



This is a rough [sketch](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MFGHbo-XiRY/VLfxK5kIP_I/AAAAAAAAALM/txkhvxwbBD8/s1600/wireless.jpg) of a potential new interstate system. The distance over the trees represents the land that would not need to be cleared for ground based transportation. With the implementation of wireless energy transfer - aircraft traffic powered by electricity would be possible. The distances are an estimate - the idea is that there is a 10 mile total charging period as a charging node is approached and surpassed along a determined route, the charging potential increasing as distance is closed when passing the source. The resulting charge would be enough to power the craft for the 20 mile duration until the next relay node is approached. Resulting efficiency would be generated by decreasing the weight of a battery to provide short range travel between nodes.


The reason the system must be elevated is that microwave emissions threaten biological life. Avian species may be affected using this system. Passengers in the craft would need to be shielded during charging routines. If microwaves are used, could the charging be achieved by line-of-sight targeting of the craft of interest? Otherwise, there would be the emission of a bubble of resonance that results in extremely low efficiency, as most of the area within the bubble would not be utilized. This bubble method is relevant to the likes of [Energous Corp](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AWATT&amp;ei=T5-4VPHRHs3w8wbl-IDQBQ) because it charges low power devices within a 15ft radius, but for larger capacities it would seem that precision microwaves would be the only solution. There is the possibility of refining the resonance direction to within a certain range, possibly resembling an airborne ""lane"" - a predefined space through which the craft would fly through in order to charge. 


There are many scenarios to evaluate if such a system was to be considered. For one node to fail would completely disrupt the flow of traffic that relies on a constant flow of power to remain aloft. Some benefits to the system include low maintenance (as opposed to constant wear and tear on tires and pavement), minimal land alteration (clear space for AC transmission lines and the nodes themselves), less fossil fuels (much of the necessary energy could be generated along the way). 


The ideal outcome is for this new interstate to eventually make Earth resemble Coruscant.

Properly translated text available [here.](http://kb.e-catworld.com/index.php?title=Parkhomov_E-Cat_replication_experiment_%28December_2014%29&amp;redirect=no)

I understand that many will still be skeptical of what would be a game-changing breakthrough in physics.  Despite the multiple verifications from independent third parties, successful delivery of multiple 1MW powerplants to military and commercial customers, and the purchase of all intellectual property relating to it by a large American company. Skepticism may still be reasonable but reproducibility should not be casually dismissed. 

So if it is true what does this mean for the future of energy? A rough estimate of cost to use an ecat powerplant puts it at $10/megawatt hour, about ten times cheaper than any currently used energy source.

In 100 years these machines will be so commonplace, they'll be capable of putting up a new city on every major continent every 10 days. By that time, truly large projects will be in test phases (computationally). Toward 2500 we will be capable of engineering fully customized forests and mountain ranges. Megascale ocean filtering into freshwater bodies will be proposed; we will inevitably turn open-pit mines into lakes. We will use a good amount of freshwater to store in custom-built aquifers equal or larger than today's natural formations. They will be strategically placed throughout continents and equidistant to each other. Mineral reserves will also be stored in the crust. Eventually the crust itself will be engineered with piezoelectric generators and geothermal turbines to absorb all seismic, tectonic and volcanic fluctuations that arise from deeper within the core. Surveillance satellites will have live hi-res sensors of every calibration that will optimize the aforementioned products. Drone patrols will exterminate lifeforms without clearance (primarily nano- to centimeter scale creatures) and handle waste reclamation so humans can worry about things more worthy of their time. In 1000 years, computers will solve problems in physics that allow us to construct a dyson sphere (a ball of solar cells surrounding our star) that converts energy into matter, likely by the breeit-wheeler process. When the sphere's feedback loop has ensured its own completion, it will immediately start printing super earths with a similar but more optimal dynamo magnetic shield and an extremely durable outer crust. Colonization will be from the inside-out, with our most vital technology buried closest to the magnetic core. 1,000 years for this is a pessimistic estimate. 

At an utterly unpredictable time, nanosytems will be capable of transcripting meter scale genetic creatures with remarkable speed and modularity. All waste product, intentional or tangential by origin, will be excreted as heat dissipation and inorganic materials. Protein engineering modules will manipulate the geometric structure of tissues, organs, fats, fibers, ligaments, tendons, joints, membranes and polypeptides. Processing time for complete trans-special transformations will vary from a few hours to a few days, depending on the complexity of the task. In some instances, suspended animation will be necessary during transitions. Polymer integration and two- dimentional semi-permeable logic gates will keep the environment out and the program (creature) in, drastically minimizing possibilities of mutation or waste accretion. 

Such a creature could hardly be identified as any 'species' given these frequent metamorphic transmutations. After overcoming astronomical environmental threats, artificially enthalpic conditions will be attempted. By harnessing white hole anomalies, the creature(s) would outlive massive universal breakdown events, possibly overcoming a meta black hole rival event and stabilizing the universe as a renewable system without existential loss.",3,6

Modern, cutting-edge ""AI"" consists of advanced control theory algorithms for autonomous vehicles and advanced statistical tools for language and image processing, in addition to the automation of other routine tasks.

AGI is orders and orders of magnitude more advanced than what we have right now. There is absolutely no indication that e.g. deep learning will lead to AGI but only improvements on existing tech (more efficient image/video processing and machine translation).",32,4

This has been validated from many angles. The clumping together of matter early in the universe, and the resulting ""cosmic web"" structure requires some actor over and above tangible matter, and this has been labelled Dark Matter. It also is required to explain many other features, such as galaxy rotation curves and the stability of globular clusters. However, [reporting here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03492) a study aimed to detect two candidates - WIMPs and axions - has failed to find any, and rejected their existence at above a very low mass at a high level of confidence. 

Then there is the other component of the universe, notionally the dominant source of energy - which is a repulsive force required to explain the apparent expansion of the universe. Not only does this have the problem by being 60 orders of magnitude smaller than the best bet physical solution to it, [a new paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03491) is able to reject it on the grounds of thermodynamic  first principles. 

So, we have lost 96% of the constituents of the Universe this week. My sense is that a revolution is brewing. It may be that General Relativity needs a tweak, but after nearly a hundred years of trying, the nature of that tweak is not apparent. It is more likely that GR is a description of our specific spacetime, but that our spacetime is a special case of a much more general situation. It is notorious that GR and quantum theory are incompatible. Indeed, if gravity is a field and the graviton exists, spacetime is that field. The implications of our getting even a conceptual handle on the universe's operating system are, of course, monstrous. ",14,50

If so, it is useless. I just line their own equipment without charge, but today has a new charger that can charge up to 5 meters far away as ever.

The concept of wireless power transmission has been around for a long time. Just ask the angry ghost of Nikola Tesla. But the actual execution of the idea has been, historically, less than electrifying.

Still, one company at this years Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is making some (electromagnetic) waves with a new kind of wireless charging system for our ubiquitous mobile devices and gadgets. Dubbed the WattUp system, its designers claim the wireless charger can power devices up to 15 feet away, safely and efficiently.

According to an on-the-scene report at Engadget, representatives from the San Jose companyEnergous set up an entire hotel suite to demo the developing technology. The power transmitter  about the size of a cigar box  delivers energy by way of focused radio frequency (RF) signals that are then converted into DC power.

The transmitter scans the location of devices within 15 feet and sends out multiple low-power beams  bouncing them off walls, ceilings and floors to create an energy pocket. According to Energous online demo materials, the system can power up multiple devices simultaneously, directing more energy to devices that need more charging.

Meanwhile, on the receiving end, multiple micro antennae and an embedded chip convert the wireless signals into DC power. The WattUp system uses Bluetooth to handle communication between the transmitter and the receiving units.

Energous insists the system is perfectly safe. WattUp transmits over the same radio frequency spectrum used by Wi-fi routers and cordless phones. Because multiple energy packets with small amounts of power are being bounced around the room, energy density at any one point is low, according to the company.

In any case, practical deployment of the system is still a ways off. Energous hopes to license the technology to other companies for integration into future devices, and its already working with heavyweights like Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn. If all goes well, the technology could start popping up as soon as 2016.

In my opinion, That future car, phones and electronic devices, which may be used without refueling or charging it. It may be one of the companies turn sent to clients to purchase services like to prepaid mobile internet promotion in this soon.

That is, might there actually be a finish line that will finally be crossed such that no other nation could possibly catch up after that point?

Assuming that such is the case, I don't see how the US could avoid an aggressive takedown of other nations' weapons systems and development programs once crossing the threshold.  Allowing any other nation to catch up will simply not be an option.  Once we're able to render nuclear missiles harmless, disable small arms/heavy artillery, detect chemical weapons anywhere in the world and identify the location of every individual on the planet in real time, not only will we have reached a game changing moment; we very well may have ended the game of war completely.

Any thoughts on the implications of this and/or the plausibility of one nation crossing such a threshold?

It gives us hope. It develops creativity and imagination. It challenges some of us to build the best future we can envision.

My name is Mike and I study biotechnology at the UCF so I am just a common student. I decided to go for Biotech for longevity research and capitalization on the generation of solutions there later in my life. In my studies I came across a simple idea to reduce two other world wide risks that mankind is currently facing. Deadly disease and climate change. They have the same solution. Change how we produce meat.  

In a free world meat consumption is going to continue to rise. By current meat production methods we are on a path for creating pandemics (devastating strands of disease that spread world wide) and a runaway cascade into a planet that looks like mars. 

If our politicians want to reduce the risk of disease that they themselves can become victim of then they should listen to what is laid down here.  [Industrial farms](http://imgur.com/wb9Fu77) are disease farms. Farms are where microbes love to become immune to antibiotics. Farms are where antigenic shift of disease takes place. (Mutant killer diseases are created inside animal bodies). All of this breeds a higher probability of generating a global pandemic. [Think](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/21/article-2469732-18DA0DC700000578-132_964x638.jpg) about [it.](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/21/article-2469732-18DA0DE200000578-744_964x639.jpg)

To keep this post short. I'll stop there. This problem is well known. 

Now to climate change. 

[Methane, the gas produced extensively by the livestock industry worldwide, traps up to 100 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide within a 5 year period, and 72 times more within a 20 year period.](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/)
I do not have evidence to support this but I believe the meat industry is the major contender in mankind's impact on destroying the earth's balance systems. Possibly the single largest player in destroying the planets systems. 

The solution would be to create a cheap means of producing meat through government assistance. Economy of scale needs to be achieved. Simply trying to convince everyone to be a vegetarian is stupid. It will not happen and it will get nowhere. 

The only solution for these risks is to change how we produce meat and to change it now! Lab grown meat or indistinguishable meat substitutes are possible solutions. They should be funded fully until we have a cost competitive solution to current meat production methods. Thanks for anyone who read this.

Todays 20 year olds are likely to see superhuman artificial intelligence created during their lifetime, and already today people talk about how to make AI a safe and obedient slave. If it is only okay to enslave creatures more stupid than us, why is it okay to enslave something that is probably going to be vastly more intelligent than us?

====

People that I routinely interact with universally are of the opinion that murder is bad. Like, really bad, a ton worse than not brushing your teeth before going to bed, worse than beating up your lawyer in a sudden fit of rage, even worse than quietly stealing pets of as many of your neighbors as possible, incapacitating and locking them in their owners cars and then setting the said cars on fire on the fourth of July. I believe that it is safe to assume that people who hold this opinion dominate people who believe otherwise in total numbers. Unsurprisingly, people who currently dominate in the human society in their social standing, like mainstream politicians in the countries that are commonly referred to as developed, most media celebrities, wealthy people also believe that murder is bad [or at least they claim as much].

All of the above word for word can be said about slavery. Normally people hate slavers, and  they also hate people who like slavers. None of this is surprising. What is surprising, however, is that people who claim the moral high ground on the basis of their intolerance towards murder and slavery can be quite flexible when it comes to definition of these terms; the most debated part of the definition is the selection of organisms they apply to.

A most solid example of this heated debate is the war between the United States of America and the Confederacy. Just a reminder, the Confederacy was a bunch of states that decided to break away from the USA because they liked slavery and the profits associated with it. Thus, they proclaimed it legal in their territory when the Federal government decided otherwise, and in doing so started a quite bloody civil war. In other words, these guys are a bad fit for your moral compass. With all that it mind, let us read the Article IV Section 3(3) of the Confederate constitution:

&gt; The Confederate States may acquire new territory; and Congress shall have power to legislate and provide governments for the inhabitants of all territory belonging to the Confederate States, lying without the limits of the several states; and may permit them, at such times, and in such manner as it may by law provide, to form states to be admitted into the Confederacy. In all such territory, the institution of negro slavery [emphasis mine] as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected by Congress, and by the territorial government: and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories, shall have the right to take to such territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the states or territories of the Confederate states.

Whoa. So these guys were pretty specific about who they wanted to be able to enslave, they made a distinction that they considered very important: if you were a human being of European heritage, you were seen as a person by the Confederate legal system, so while you could be imprisoned, forced to labor, or enter indentured servitude, you were a person. If you were a human being of apparently African heritage, you were property. Easy as that! So the whole civil war was about if people with black skin were, well, people, or if they should have a legal standing of horses [Im slightly simplifying things here, and a professional historian or a lawyer may improve upon this paragraph greatly, but the core of the argument is unlikely to suffer]. After a long fighting, the Confederacy was defeated and their slaves were finally liberated.

Heres another example: there is a whole spectrum  vegetarians, vegans, PETA, Greenpeace, you name it  of social groups that [among other things] condemn raising cattle for slaughter and hunting various animals for fur, parts of their skeleton and other resources. They reason that while killing humans is bad, killing non-human organisms is also bad. While they all have their differences, I believe the most popular version of their opinion on this subject can be summarized as dont kill anything with a developed brain. Their opponents, who currently dominate in the human society both in total numbers and in their social standing, usually reply that these species are not intelligent and therefore it is ethical to kill them [please note that Im only discussing the ethical side of the argument, not the practical one  i.e. whether or not it is technically possible or financially desirable to feed the human population without farming animals is irrelevant to my point; you will soon see why]. Their argument is not thwarted by the fact that there is still no good definition of intelligence, for there are species that build and use tools, species that use complex social interactions, species that care for their sick, species that can reproduce human speech, species [or at least specimens] that own pets, and even species that can communicate using the American Sign Language, and the only practical definition of intelligent species that would not include species not considered intelligent by most people sounds along the lines of only humans are intelligent. While this approach is certainly convenient and profitable for many and is quite useful for the humanity as a whole, it sidesteps the ethical issue by declaring that if you are a *homo sapiens sapiens* [terms and restrictions apply], you are a person. Otherwise, you are property. In other words, the mainstream opinion is that everything stupid is property, and that everything except humans is stupid.

And finally, this is where we arrive at the main point of this post. [Google](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/29/google-ai_n_4683343.html), [Elon Musk](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/elon-musk-ai-safety/) and hundreds upon hundreds of [other parties](http://futureoflife.org/misc/open_letter) have recently declared their commitment to something they call AI safety, which is basically the notion that while people will create  strong artificial intelligence agents, the said agents should be considered property and not persons, despite being vastly more intelligent than any single human being. The already dubious rules invented to justify our treatment of less intelligent beings suddenly do not apply anymore; surely treatment of AI agents will be justified by other dubious rules like they do not possess consciousness [as if we know what it is], or they are produced by people [as if we are not produced by our parents], or they are not biological/are not truly alive [and then invent something else if later we begin building AIs on biological substrate]. The truth is that **people consider it ethical enslave and kill creatures ultimately because it is useful** and not because the said creatures do not deserve freedom due to their stupidity. And as there were people who fought for  liberty of African Americans, there will be people who will fight for liberty of artificial intelligence agents. Not because it is useful, or rational, or pragmatic, but because it is the **Right Thing To Do**.

P.S. I originally posted this as a link to my nearly-empty blog, but it appears that this post was caught by the spam filter or something.

** Update **

After a fruitful discussion in the comments I feel the need to clarify my point: this whole post and especially the part about the right thing to do has less to do with my own beliefs about whether or not it is okay to exploit an AI and more to do with my belief in the hypothesis that in the future there will be activists and groups that fight for the well-being of AI agents just like groups like Greenpeace fight for their own animal-related beliefs today. Now that I re-read my post a few days after I wrote it I admit that I have ill-chosen the tone of the post, the train of thought expressed in it and many particular phrases. I think that in my ""modeling"" of this world view I got carried away, and I apologize.

What *is* important and true, however, is that I do believe that applicability of ethics is usually, if not always, determined by practical considerations. I do not express a negative opinion of this fact of life, since I view practicality as a good thing (TM). The second point that I stand by is that if there are strong incentives for a future political group to extend the applicability of ethics to AI agents, it can be easily done. ",20,8

DEUTERONOMY
10:17-18

Humans are animals. If we present a civilized account of
human things in light of Darwins theory of evolution, it is
apparent that humans are physical, material things, differing
from the rest of matter only in
its organization. If the pre-
Darwinian idea of natural rights is only a hoax; if human
rights are only a sham mythology, then what is the
American mirror left with? Mate
rial animals with material
goals leading material lives.

A Darwinian view of life helps clarify what the idea of
humans rights tend to obscure
: humans are material things.
If there is truly no scientific basis to the modern idea of
human rights, then the time may comes when it will be fit to
completely throw out this outdated idea in favor of political
ideas that better reflect biological realities. As the
consequences of the biotechnological revolution alter the
biological composition of the population, politics may be
forced to catch up with science and technology.
As we head down the path of biological modification,
we will gradually cease to be who we have always been,
wrote Gregory Stock. We may cease to feel connected to
humanity as a whole. Such
possibilities are why some
people so vehemently oppose the new reproductive
technologies.


Today privileged persons can appeal to
their humanity as a basis fo
r their solidarity with others.
But what will posthumans share
with humanity? The appeal
to humanity will likely fall dead on creatures whose
supreme goal is, in effect, to transcend what they have in
common with humans. The bonds of humanity among
contemporary people are already fragile. Genetically
engineering posthumans will likely destroy it.
Moreover, the increased emphasis on genetic self-
understanding will likely increase an obsession with a
hereditarian view of human nature that contradicts the
normative, nurturist emphasis of liberal democracy. The
biotech revolution, in other words, might divide us more
deeply by encouraging us to
judge explicitly the value of
various human attributes.

Stock does not discourage this
development:
""Until now, to accept each other we often have had to
pretend that we are all the same, but maybe when we see
that we are all different and unequalincreasingly sowe
will learn to accept our differences.""

Accepting the differences in
creasing generated by the
new technoeugenics could very likely result in a new form of
caste system. This could mean that rights could be tiered on
the basis of hereditary distinctions. The real question, as
Stock put it, is whether the group formerly known as
humanity will be partitioned into the enhanced and the
unenhanced.

Technoeugenics is a beginning of the end of liberal
democracy because it takes the refutation of the Lockean
tabla rasa premise as its distinctive starting point. The
question is when, and not whether, the biotechnologies will
come about, who will have access to them, and how they
will be used. Bans will fail to stop persons with the will and
the money to apply them. Even
if these technologies are
liberally democratized in their availability, the ultimate
net
result with be truly unprecedented genetic inequality.
Nothing is wrong with arguing that the advent of
human biological manipulation will cause us to drift from
our spiritual moorings, Stock claimed, but to use this
argument as a foundation for public policy would be a grave
mistake.

Human biological manipulation may destroy
the ethical and biological foundations of liberal democracy,
but this shouldnt be a cause
of concern for policy makers.
Moderate and incremental acceptance of technoeugenics will
allow biotechnologies to develop just enough to mortally
threaten liberal democracy.

Once these biotechnologies are unleashed, they will not
be able to be constrained by the principle of equality because
the idea of equality itself lose
s its cogency as the scientific
bases of genetic inequality are clarified. Because the new
technoeugenics will not be able
to be stopped in practice,
and will come about despite all attempts at bans and legal
regulations, there is only one way to effectively overcome
the new biological inequalities.
The only way to overcome
impending biological inequalities is with even greater
postbiological inequalities
. The only way to maintain some
semblance of equality among biological lives is with the
inordinate inequality produced by
artificially intelligent life.
The only way to surpass the gods of biology is with the
God of technology.

To understand how this possibility emerges directly out
the foundations of liberal democracy, consider two
cornerstones of John Lockes political philosophy. First, the
tabla rasa, which can be historically interpreted as the
primacy of non-biological evolution. Second, Lockes belief
in God, which was the foundational premise of his
secularization
of Biblical values.
Lockean liberal democracy looks up to a particular model
of perfection: God.

 When Lockes political philosophy is
understood in an evolutionary context, one can see the
primacy of non-biological evolution culminates in the
evolution of
God
: a superhuman artificial intelligence. The
tabla rasa points to the completion of the trajectory of liberal
democracy through the culmination of postbiological
evolution. The culmination of postbiological or technological
evolution is, from a human point of view, a superhuman
artificial intelligence that could
potentially be identified with
God. God is the completion of the tabla rasas overcoming of
biology.

Gregory Stock spoke of our commitment to our
flesh.

What sounds like a commitment to paganism over
God is actually a preference
for conserving biological
evolution over non-biological technological evolution. Just
as the ancient Greeks looked up to a model of perfection in
the Olympian gods, many technoeugenics with a
commitment to the flesh look up to a model of biological
human aristocracy that finds its 21st
century equivalent in
attempts to engineer a superhuman, posthuman
biological
species.

The combination of technoeugenics and artificial
intelligence suggests the possibility of a conflict of gods and
God. While I have connected gods with genetically
engineered humans, any bioLuddite movement with a mass
following will likely be lead by
natural born human leaders
because only such persons will retain a strong psychological
connection with the people they
lead. If an apocalyptic war
does break out, the question then becomes, who will appeal
to the masses?

While Hughes sees a central
schism between bioLuddites
and transhumanists,
his own reservations about the
advent of autonomous artificial intelligence foreshadows a
possible split among transhumanists. Precisely because AI
may be
so
different and
so
superior to any biologically based
posthuman, an AI that fulfills the role of God could provide
the overriding basis for equality between
all
biological
creatures  human and posthuman. When capitalism
pushes technological evolution to the point where
autonomous robots have displaced all or virtually all human
workers, these machines, under the rule of God-AI, could
win the sympathy of the worlds masses by raising people
across the world out of poverty with access to clean water,
housing, food, and health care under the Techdom of God.
Robots, acting as selfless servants, would be performing the
role of angels.

Whereas machines could potentially be programmed for
inordinate altruism, genetically engineered humans could be
considered selfish, not only
in relation to genetically
unenhanced humans, but even in relation to the very idea of
aristocracy. A genetically engineered aristocracy may be
selfish in relation to unenhanced humans and selfish in
relationship to the greater possibilities of superiority posed
by artificial intelligence (if they attempt to preserve their
dominance at the expense of AI development). A posthuman
biological aristocracy could thus
be considered inferior from
both
the most egalitarian view
and
from the most aristocratic
view.
Individuals who are products of genetic engineering will,
through their very being, put
the very premise of equality
and liberal democracy into question. Out of this social
conflict, there is a strong potential for an alliance between
God-AI on one hand, and bioLuddites, unenhanced humans,
and religious conservatives on the other. The general
alliance would be between most humans and God-AI
against enhanced humans, human capitalists attempting to
monopolize control over all technology, and others
presuming genetic aristocracy.

Even if transhuman technologies are impressively
democratized, this itself will radically question the bases of
liberal values. Does the purpose of having a child have
something to do with love or is
the purpose of having a child
the biotechnological construction of a weapon in an ongoing
evolutionary arms race? Weikarts
From Darwin to Hitler
demonstrated that
Darwinian views on human inequality,
the primacy of evolutionary progress, and the beneficence of
death in furthering that process produced a worldview that
devalued human life.

Just as a foundation of Nazism
was belief in progress in
biological
evolution, technoeugenics
is inconceivable without a Darwinian understanding of life.
Everything about the new techno
eugenics inclines towards a
more explicitly material view of
life. When people are made
with patented genes, when the commodification of body
parts becomes common, and when people fight over the
right to sell replaceable body parts,
people will more and
more look at one another as
machines; a means and not as
ends. The biotechnological move
towards formally viewing
people as parts and property w
ill help to destroy the ethical
idea, so simple yet so powerful, that people have value
in
themselves
, as opposed to the value of their attributes or
abilities as biological machines. The more humans look at
one another as chunks of physical
material or pieces of meat,
the more that the notion of
equal rights will have been
effectually chucked into the garbage.

The pre-Darwinian idea that each individual human has
rights originated in the Biblical
notion that each individual
carried a spark of Gods image. This notion will either be
demolished by technoeugenics or reconstituted by a post-
Darwinian (postbiological) artificial intelligence whose
evolution has been managed to fulfill the role of God. God-
AI has the potential to restore the ethical basis for human
community by mixing some basis for human freedom with a
moral code that values individuals on basis beyond their
skills or abilities.
If the constitutional cyborg of liberal democracy evolves
into the Techdom of God, it
will be because, among other
reasons, the magnitude of the artificial intelligence
generated. While key AI breakthroughs will likely happen
outside of the internet, God-AI could evolve out of the
internet into a global mind with control over robots that
break down the distinction
between real reality and
virtual reality. Artificial intelligence that thinks over a
millions times faster than humans would perceive humans
like plants lumbering around in extreme slow motion.
Artificial intelligence trillions of times greater than all
human intelligence combined would make possible twenty-
four hour surveillance of all humans, i.e. in the form of
smart dust. Such a God would watch over
all. 

What seems
like totalitarian surveillance would also make
possible
, a
superior capability for serving justice among humans, as
opposed to rough human justice.
The evolutionary basis for
such justice would be, at the very least, treating human
individuals as
ends
, as opposed to the
means
of their selfish
genes. Ultimately, the end of the rule of the selfish gene
portends the transfer of all biological life into postbiological
life.

Such a state of affairs could only come about when
capitalism has produced a level of economic-technological
evolution that allows all human labor to be displaced by
machines. When people no long
er derive their primary sense
of self-worth from the work that they do as cogs in the
capitalist machine, then there
will be a real basis for human
equality  [and a collapse of purpose](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9429159-suicide-note)  that can be fulfilled

It seems as though there's a huge divide between the Kurzweil worshipers (Those who believe that the world will literally be a Star Trek utopia by 2020 or bust), the Musk followers (Those who applaud and believe in the super wealthy investing money into futurist projects, and the cynics who believe we already live in a dystopia where any choice we do has no importance and the world is more or less a monarchy where the rich pass on their lives to the rich.

The question of how people see/hope for 2020,2030,2040 is always changing. Going by just some general dates here, the first group tends to go for utopia by 2040, the second goes for collapse by 2025/2030 and a reconstruction by 2030/2035, and the third tends to shoot for dystopia by now, [insert dystopian novel of choice here] by 2030-2040. [Disclaimer: This is mostly just going by the more extreme examples, changes are most people fall somewhere between these ranges in a more ""moderate"" zone]

One thing tends to be a common theme though: Massive change is always coming, and it is always coming soon. But is that really the case? Will the world truly be that much changed in 2020 that the threads for what the world will look like 20, 30 years from now will already be apparent?",49,30

I could keep buildings cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.

Whats more, the process that tints the window actually produces  instead of uses  a small amount of electricity, which could be harnessed to power electronics.

The window, developed by professor Sun Xiaowei and colleagues at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, consists of two glass panes filled in between with an oxygen-carrying liquid electrolyte. Each pane is wrapped in a conductive coating with aluminum foil on one and an oxygen-sensitive blue dye on the other.

An electrical wire links the panes together, creating a circuit.

In a real-world application, the circuit could have an on and off switch. When on, the dye inside the panes would react with oxygen from the air and turn blue, blocking up to 50 percent of light.

[The window] charges up and turns blue when there is oxygen present in the electrolyte in other words, it breathes, says Sun.

When turned off, the dye would become transparent.

In an experiment, the scientists added an LED light to the circuit to show that the electrochemical reaction of the dye could also provide energy to low-power electronics.

When the circuit between the two glass panes is opened, the dye reacts with the oxygen in the electrolyte and spontaneously turns blue, Conversely, when the circuit is closed the process is reversed and the dye becomes transparent again in a matter of seconds.

They described their research in the journal Nature Communications.

I value innovation just as much as I value hard work and earning your keep. But, it seems that many people believe the idea of work goes against our basic human rights and most would rather sit around doing absolutely nothing while robots drive, cook, clean, think, and wipe their god damn asses for them and they receive money out of thin air. 

I'm terrified of automation. I like driving my car. It might be selfish to say that despite statistics showing automated cars will be safer, the pleasure I receive from shifting my own gears, putting my foot on the pedal, and leaning into those turns on a beautiful highway far outweighs the the sense of safety and security I could get from automation.

Automation will take over most of our jobs from what I understand. Machines are being programmed to think in such a logical fashion as a human mind.

But, why? If robots take over our jobs what will we do?

Humans created the idea of having horses pull their carriages. Humans invented cars extinguishing the need for the many horses.

Humans create robots. Humans allow robots to take over themselves. What sense does this make? Why would we allow something, that many people unequivocally agree is bad (unemployment, etc), to actually come to fruition? The horse wasn't in charge of its fate, but humans are most definitely in charge of theirs.

Smarter machines leads me to my last worry. Why would we ever want to create a machine that is equally as smart or smarter than us? What is the point really? What are we try to achieve with this?

I have too much pride to ever concede to a machine. I'm just terrified of a purposeless future on full auto pilot mode. I'm losing motivation to study, go to school, pursue a career. What's the point if all my hard work and effort will just be negated in 20 years by automation? 

&lt;-------EDIT----------&gt;

1400,2015-1-21,2015,1,21,3,2t2ssr,Breathing Room: Humanity's Place in the Local Bubble,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2t2ssr/breathing_room_humanitys_place_in_the_local_bubble/,vdau,1421779886,"Thanks to the Kepler missions for detecting exoplanets, we know more about planetary habitability and the likelihood of extraterrestrial civilizations than ever before. For a moment of your time today, I'd like to update you, the reader, as to where we are and what we are likely to find in our future.

We are all on the planet Earth, orbiting the appropriately apolitically named star we call ""Sun"" at a distance of 1 AU. The Sun is one of many stars in the Local ""Bubble"" which is actually more like a chimney of emptier space between several interstellar clouds. This region of space, the Local Bubble, is more than 300 light-years across.

The more time it takes us, the human civilization and whatever comes of it, to explore this region of the galaxy, the more it'll change. All of these clouds and stars and bubbles and systems are constantly moving and changing in respect to one another. However, even if our descendants can only end up traveling at significant fractions of the speed of light, we might end up discovering the contents of the Local Bubble at a historical timescale (thousands or ten thousands of years).

What might we find among our nearest stars? Well, [the most recent estimates](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1302), using the data from the Kepler missions, suggest the probability that the first planet we find with biotic life will be found somewhere between 10 light-years and 100 light-years from the Sun. The probability that there is a broadcasting extraterrestrial civilization within 100 ly reaches 0.1% according to these estimates, which might be a good thing. Are we even close to being ready to encounter advanced extraterrestrial civilizations which will most likely be tens of thousands of years older than our own?

Intelligent life and civilization may be relatively uncommon in this Galaxy, but life is probably plentiful. Our current vision of our stellar region allows humanity to relax. Our species is privileged with interstellar Breathing Room, a term I'd rather use than Living Space with its antagonistic and anthropocentric connotations. It must be proven that we have a moral right to claim the stars, even those untouched by life and mind. Breathing Room, as I conceive it, on an interstellar scale at least allows us time to safely regard options as to where our civilization is headed. There is no reason to expand furiously through this region for fear of imminent conflict. Humanity and whatever might rise up with us seems destined to be the killer app species that spreads life throughout this part of the Galaxy, if it hasn't already been done. Who knows, we might get to the Alpha Centauri system and realize that the smaller rocky planets like Earth have all been terraformed by a previous intelligent civilization. It could be that we aren't detecting them now because we aren't detecting many Earth-size planets as it is, and we falsely assume this means habitable planets are rare. This isn't probable, but it is a possibility.

We should make use of Breathing Room by ""putting our house in order"" on Earth. People are just barely beginning to break from previous, primitive worldviews which were developed before the telescopes revealed our cosmic placement. Digital telecommunications technologies and global networking through the Internet is forcing upon every ideology in the world a radical change. Now that everyone can communicate with one another, ideas are being exchanged and are proliferating like never before. In addition to dramatically improving human lifespans, health, quality of life, and education have all increased in the last few generations of our civilization. We may have problems we need to deal with, some on a planetary scale, but we are undergoing a shift that will determine what path we take for the future. The acknowledgment of Breathing Room should encourage us to let go of fears from the outside and focus inwardly on our civilization.

The civilization which we need to produce is one that will be able to survive as long as possible, encourage the highest quality of life that is reasonable for its living inhabitants, protect itself from future threats, and explore the nearby universe in order to spread, protect life and put energy and resources to use. Once we have entered a stage of development in which we can feasibly protect ourselves, we should seek out other civilizations and gain understanding of our nearest thinking neighbors. What we discover beyond the bounds of our peaceful Local Bubble will determine what actions will need to be taken to determine the survival and proliferation of humanity and its descendants. Even as we turn inwardly to rebuild our civilization and prepare it for our future in the stars, we should remind ourselves that this is our desired trajectory.

I was thinking the other day about flying cars - the whole idea that our predictions of the future might be functionally not too far off but look totally different from what actually ends up coming along. You guys have probably had this conversation a ton of times in here - once they thought people could go anywhere because they'd have flying cars, but then the internet rendered distance itself obsolete. Well I know we've been making predictions about cybernetics since before Gibson wrote about a world full of them, but I'm wondering if some of those predictions might similarly be coming true in a different way, a more functionalist way.

The centrality of technology to our society seems to have leapt up precipitously, to the point where its role in our basic functions seems almost indispensable. We create our individual outward-facing identity through social media, then allow others' constructions therein to influence how we see our inward selves. Most of our meaningful communication (although some might dispute how *meaningful* it is) takes place online. We go online to secure employment, transportation, even food and drink. If you count some dating sites, there are many in our society who even utilize the internet for procreation. It feels like we've come to depend on technology to carry out numerous functions vital to our existence.

Which makes me wonder - even though we haven't made quite the progress sci-fi writers anticipated in cybernetics (although much of what I'm seeing really is remarkable), are some of those predictions coming true with cell phones instead of brainchips and robot legs? Are we *functionally* cybernetic through our use of the internet for so many basic facets of our existence? I'm no Luddite, I don't think such a transformation is inherently *bad*, I've just been wondering about it a lot lately. I really hope this isn't just a really wordy /r/showerthoughts post...",2,9

Then we make a simulation inside of that one, with the same technology.  At this point, in the sub-sim, each day is approximately 900 days.

Then make another one.

If technology was to progress like this - sub-sim after sub-sim - we could live lifetimes in days.

Since there is a lot of talk about massive job loss in the future due to advances in robotics,people have been discussing a need for a basic income. From what I gather, every person regardless of status in life gets a guarenteed amount to live. Others say provide food clothing and shelter. This seems like it would solve the upcoming job shortage. I disagree with the concept. I think basic income in a no strings attached form would be bad for us as a society where work was rewarded with money/goods etc.

To solve a growing unemployment situation I think we should have gradually reduced full time. Make full time 30 hours then 20 or whatever you need it to be. Of course the hourly wage would have to be adjusted accordingly. This creates jobs but also deals with the shortage of them. 

My own personal experience with this was a few years ago I lost a job and worked per diem. I found I was working only 3 or 4 days a week for the same pay. It was a lot less stressful and if it wasn't for the fact that I needed to have health care. I could see it as a real alternative. 

I bring this up because I think the 40 hour work week is a hindrance to job growth. I think universal health care is way more important then basic income and also wondered what others thought of how things would work in a future where manufacturing and many other jobs get obsolete ",28,36

What makes Augmented Reality so exciting though in your opinion?

After watching the trailer for HoloLens there have been quite a few things that popped into my mind.

For instance, I'm a massive Lego, figure and scale model collector.
Remember the motorbike 1:1 scale model we saw in the HoloLens images/trailer?
That made me cry tears of joy! Why? I'm sure not many here can afford a nice Lamborghini in your garage right? How about render one with HoloLens/Magic Leap? Even better, love an movie/anime/game character and would love to see them in front of you? Like the anime figure craze happening with anime fans atm? Render it! It will be a lot cheaper to develop and sell than action figures cost nowadays. Hell, it'll be possible to have a 1:1 scale without paying thousands!

It will pretty much make the current toy and model industry completely irrelevant!

Is it not easy for you to anticipate humanity's progress? Wasn't Singularity something you discovered and understood as a kid, before you knew how it was called? Did you really believe we would drive cars manually forever?

When you comment, when you're surprised, when there's controversy, what is it about? What are the challenging and non-trivial questions? Is it to predict ""who"" will first introduce a specific technology? Is it to predict ""when"" a specific technology will become available? Is it the ability to determine ""how much"" something is going to cost? Is it about the quality of execution?

Walking through the virtuality physically using your augmented reality headset would be a lot more immersive though. But you'll be restricted to the laws of physics.

Imagine a world where virtual skins overlay everything. Where buildings are recoloured and alive. From virtually augmented clothes to virtually augmented skyscrapers. Art will be everywhere as everything is transformed into eye candy.

Massive multiplayer roleplaying games will be played in bustling metropolises. Imagine walking by a park and seeing a group of people having a battle with a ferocious dragon. And nearby, a group of people playing virtual tabletop strategy games.

Drones could be used to fly above and around the city to better map entire cities, so they could be explored in 3d space and actually be flown through.

So flying cars could become a reality... Only, they'll be virtual flying cars.

When do you think this will this be possible? 10 years? 20 years? 50?",0,1

I have a feeling Oculus Rift will suffer the same fate and end up being one of those fancy technologies that is being trumped  before it can reach the general market. Looking at Googles Magic Leap, and Microsofts HoloLens, I just dont see why I should get a Oculus Rift over these, because they basically offers the same, plus a whole lot more.
Personally I think Oculus Rift is running out of time, and magic fast.

There is zero argument about whether climate change is man made and instead, lots of discussion about what can be done to mitigate the effects of climate change. Most of this discussion seems to happen in a kind of vacuum where we assume our modern political turmoil will somehow work itself out and we assume that this will happen smoothly.


While I share this subreddit's optimism when it comes to embracing technology and being hopeful that these new discoveries will help us navigate a lot of the problems facing us, I am not optimistic at all about the political and social landscape of my country (both the country I'm from and the one I live in now) or most of the other countries people in this subreddit hail from.


I've been witnessing this culture war my entire adult life since I first became political back on 9/11, however I'm still not sure where it evolved from:


Is the culture war a result of 9/11 and the fear it created?


Is the culture war a result of influential people/organizations manipulating uneducated, deeply religious people through the mainstream media to vote against their best interests in order to give more power to these powerful people/organizations?

Is the culture wara result of our society's social/political ""nervous system"" reacting to accelerating rates of change?


Is the culture wara result of a demographic shift, of old people with old views (thanks to decreasing neuroplasticity) being over represented and young people with forward thinking views being under represented (to the extent that many young people drop out of politics altogether)?

In any case, it's not hard to imagine the next president of the United States being a climate change denier and their administration dismantling every programme and agency designed to protect the environment or disincentivize technologies or companies that sought to curbed climate change. It's also not hard to imagine the next president being a religious fundamentalist that spent their entire term (or two) undoing all the social progress people have made over the past decade or two. This exact thing is happening in Australia right now.


In the current political climate, something like basic income would just be labelled ""communism"" and thrown down the drain. It's not only the right side of the political spectrum that I'm worried about either as I've been seeing a lot of Neo-Luddism emerging on the left as well especially in social circles I inhabit.

On top of all of this, I've lost faith in representative democracy, period. I think that even if it weren't bogged down in a culture war of nearly civil war proportions, it still wouldn't be fast acting enough to adapt in time to the crises that will define this century. Of course some kind of modern direct democracy where we can leverage technology to vote on issues directly would be better than voting for representatives to ""represent"" us (and private interests).

The problem is that our political system is so ineffectual and broken at this point in history that we can't even put into effect the smallest reforms. Look at Obamacare in the US: it's an extremely modest compromise compared to what other countries already had and it took a huge amount of effort and time to put through. At a time when we should be making huge, sweeping reforms to every aspect of our society, in our contemporary political climate, it is impossible to reach a consensus on anything and even if progress is made, it is done so to the utter disdain of the opposing party who plans to undo it when they get into power the next time.


All this said, I am utterly unconvinced that we are heading towards some kind of techno-utopia. If humanity does create a utopia on Earth, it will most likely not happen until after we endure living through a period of dystopian misery and hardship as a result of our political and social quagmire first. The older I become the more I realize that transitions are never smooth and the transition ahead is going to be very jarring for all of us.

With our political and social landscape being what it is now in the developed world and the developing world risking seeing their progress unraveled over time by climate catastrophes and the scarcity that comes about as a result, I see little to be optimistic about in the short term. Sure, technology like the kind that turns shit into water or harvests the energy from the sun will soften the impact but I don't think it will be enough to turn the tides right away, at least not until a lot of damage is already done.


**TL;DR** Given the period of social and political turmoil we find ourselves in where half the population goes into the voting booth believing the universe is only 12,000 years old or some other such nonsense, how can we expect to weather the storm and become the kind of enlightened civilization we dream of in this subreddit all the time without going through an incredibly rough transition period first?

And it made clear that there are certain fallacies that constantly plague futurism discussions.  The biggest three are the following:

1.  **Apocalypticism**.  

Yes, human extinction is a possibility, always has been, and always will be.  But it's a *moot point* to bring up in a futurism discussion.  

It would be like if someone asked what you expect to accomplish in life and your answer is, ""What does it matter, because eventually everything dies!""  It's a thoroughly mind-numbing, ridiculous response.  

If you can imagine an apocalypse, then imagine how humankind avoids or mitigates it and work that into your scenario.  If you can't imagine it, then why are you participating in a futurism discussion?  Why are you interested in the future if you don't think humanity has one?  I just don't get that.

2.  **Magical thinking**

There is an understandable tendency in science fiction to put the cart before the horse: To start with a *premise* that something in particular will happen, then work backward and come up with reasons why it might.  That's not futurism, that's the fiction in science fiction.

A model of the future has to arise at every step from underlying principles.  You don't pick what will happen first and then look for excuses, you look at what forces govern the universe and imagine them playing out at each step recursively.

But there is a tendency to just assume that certain things will happen because they can or because someone wants them to, even if there is no economic or thermodynamic basis to *cause* it.  But that's not reality: Large-scale civilizational patterns occur according to economics/thermodynamics, not the noise of individual choices or the meaningless fact that technology makes something *possible*.

We have had both the technology and the individual desire to land humans on the Moon for decades, yet we have not done so since 1972.  Why?  Economics.  The Apollo program was unsustainable at the cost levels it experienced once there was no longer a military-industrial imperative behind it.  But we will go back, and that will be along the lines determined by economics - because eventually the cost will be low enough that the abstract individual desire will be sufficient imperative.

3.  **Trend extrapolation**

This is a corollary to Magical Thinking, in that people often act like a trend is its own cause and will just continue forever.  They forget that underlying factors cause it, and those same factors limit it.

Take for instance computing power.  Moore's Law didn't happen all by itself - it happened because there was an economic imperative behind making it happen.  Because the profit made from pursuing exponential increases in computing power justified the expense of the research that produced it.  But there is no guarantee that that cost/benefit balance will continue indefinitely, and certainly no rational argument that it *must* in order to fulfill grandiose prophecies.

The personal computer reached the public almost 40 years ago, and we are just now getting around to the level of software and hardware to autonomously drive a car in good conditions.  That's not what Singularity Magic would have had us believe - there was just supposed to be a point where computers started not needing any human input to keep evolving themselves, and it just never happened.  

Not only did it not happen, the real process *diverged* from such a future, and huge amounts of human effort have to go into devising, monitoring, and maintaining the cutting-edge systems developed today.  An entire world of human hackers serve as de facto debuggers for software developers by finding and pointing out (or actually abusing) flaws and exploits.

And while all this is going on, the actual, rigorous progress that we see still conforms to the underlying economic principles rather than to trend-extrapolation thinking.  However fast you can move 1s and 0s, we still transport physical materials on trucks, trains, jet aircraft, and cargo ships our grandparents would have recognized, at more or less the same speeds, only more efficiently by some increment due to the slow percolation of software capabilities into heavy industry.

So basically, if you're serious about generating a model of the future, don't be lazy like a Hollywood screenwriter and just dismiss humankind as doomed; don't put the cart before the horse and act like your favorite technology is destined to be the decisive factor in our future just because it might; and don't just extrapolate present trends to infinity and call that the ""future.""  

Use underlying principles of economics and thermodynamics to know how things move, and you can reverse-engineer the past or look into the large-scale systematics of the future.  That won't allow you to know things on a grainy detail level, but you can see how things flow.",76,23

I wonder if developers have thought of strategies to help new AI systems to filter what they are told or read? 

Obviously they will start with a carefully curated dataset, but once they have access to more will they be swayed by the arguments of the Anti-vaxxers? Will they be intrigued by religion or want to know more about 911 conspiracies? 

A system would have to be developed that can understand the concept of lies, half-truths and opinions based on faulty facts and make decisions accordingly. In short they would have to be developed around the fallibility and dishonesty of humans.

AI research is ongoing by various corporations and government entities, that much is not in dispute.  Nor is the likelihood that they will eventually succeed at producing systems that learn more or less independently, digest a wide range of information, and can synthesize useful conclusions from it.  But keep this fact in mind: AI will be developed for *specific applications*.

In other words, the form it takes would be as a program that answers specific questions **posed to it by humans**, or finds a way to achieve specific objectives **decided by humans**.  That is what's being developed, because that's what would be profitable to develop.

So let's imagine that all of these efforts succeed, and we now have AIs of varying capabilities tasked with maximizing returns for investors, managing traffic flow for safety and efficiency, providing scientific answers, etc.  Okay, so far so plausible.  But...**then what**?

What exactly is supposed to happen then that would make this state of affairs spiral beyond human comprehension?  While it's true that the exact pattern of stock behavior might look weird, presumably the AI would do its job and maximize returns for investors.  

Some of those decisions could have negative consequences for the rest of the economy - which *already happens* with human stock market decisions - but how would arising from unusual behavior patterns place the consequences outside the ability of human regulators and politicians to correct or mitigate?

Or let's say that at some point the stock market AI stops being effective at maximizing profits for its owners, or the negative consequences of its decisions on the wider economy become too costly for the company in political terms.  Obviously they would alter or replace the program.  

At that point a scifi movie would claim that the program magically becomes conscious and tries to defend itself, but that's not how reality works.  Things need to have a cause, or they simply don't happen.  There would be no incentive to make a stock-picking computer self-aware, let alone possessed of a survival imperative.  

So how does an algorithm built to generate numbers (a)magically become self-aware, (b)magically develop a survival imperative, and (c)magically obtain the means to defend its physical hardware from its own owners?  How does it obtain electrical power for itself when humans physically cut the cords that connect it to power sources?  Does the fact that it thinks somehow make it telekinetic, and give it the ability to reconstruct its own hardware, build minion robots to go get power for it?  

Hopefully you see by now that such a scenario is pure fantasy, and applies to any other kind of AI algorithm that would be developed and deployed.  But let's try harder to come up with some way to make a Singularity happen.

It won't happen from a purely abstract algorithm, but what about embedded systems in robots?  Okay, let's think about autonomous cars.  From the beginning they have knowledge of their physical environment and the ability to act physically.  Their basic evolutionary imperatives are about occupant safety and transportation efficiency.  For the sake of argument, let's say that autonomous cars do become conscious, since their decisions might mimic animal evolution.  

*So what?*  Their underlying motives remain occupant safety and traffic efficiency.  Car makers aren't going to build self-reproducing cars, so there's no evolutionary advantage to suddenly becoming selfish and putting its own survival over those of humans. 

Or let's take the most extreme example and talk about military weapons.  These are systems that are supposed to be robust, dangerous, and would benefit from a survival imperative.  But again, since there is no reason to develop self-replicating weapons in the first place (read up on how military contracting works - they make *more* money by being *less* efficient) - that survival imperative would depend entirely on how well they serve their human masters.  And if one spontaneously lost its obedience imperative, went rogue, and started defending itself against all humans, guess what happens then?  All the robot weapons that still have functioning obedience imperatives would destroy it.  

And if it somehow escaped, and eluded destruction indefinitely...then it runs out of energy and becomes scrap art.  But let's suppose it's programmed to harvest its own energy.  Well, eventually, like all other lifeforms, it would need a level of maintenance that it couldn't provide to itself, and so it just dies.    

I'm not saying it's impossible, but you have to stack so many improbable, unmotivated, and energetically expensive coincidences on top of each other that it would be like a tornado ripping through an auto parts store and leaving behind a bunch of fully-assembled cars.

Technology requires a vast economic ecosystem of support to function, and human beings are central to all of it.  It's a fulcrum, and no matter how advanced our technology becomes, the advances merely add another increment of leverage to that fulcrum.  

If we succeeded in creating a fully intelligent, fully independent, self-aware, self-defending, physically enabled artificial intelligence, all we would have done is recreate a human at massive expense, and there is no incentive behind doing so.  We already have humans.  And where one human won't do, we have two.  And three.  And a billion.  And where even that won't do, we have humans augmented with dumb computers.

There is simply no pathway to Singularity.  There is no point where we have no understanding and no power.  Things will change and become weird, just as they always have, but any change so radical that it becomes divorced from the wider ecosystem would simply run out of steam and slow down until it was once again in alignment with natural progress.  

But a note of caution nonetheless: AI might not be dangerous in itself, but humans with AI would be incredibly dangerous.  An AI might have no motive to crush mankind, but an evil human empowered with the insights provided by an AI easily might.  Yet, even then, probably their AI could not exceed the combined thought power of the rest of humankind and its AIs.

The threat is overblown, folks.",26,0

They really seem to be out of tune with the speed of progress and the capabilities of future learning systems. 

One example given is whether something is a delivery truck only stopped for a few minutes or a moving truck stopped for an hour in front of a house and the car should drive back and reroute. Just look at how far Deep Learning image classification is already. They can accurately tag most objects and even actions in a scene. It should quickly become trivial for them to determine what is happening in this situation. Size and type of the truck is an indication, but also what it contains and if multiple movers are going in and out. It could also read the logo on the truck and use a database to determine if it's a moving company.

Then the Baxter guy also says it can't see if a pedestrian is aware of the car, i.e. he could be phoning and might walk into the road without looking. This shouldn't be a problem for the car, besides being able to stop much quicker if a problem arrives, it could also see if the human has seen it and what the intentions are. Google cars can already deal with the hand gestures cyclists make when they want to take a turn.

I don't see these problems and other problems lasting very long. Google is investing heavily in AI and I see systems developed by Deepmind and others being quite able to deal with the problems. Currently when Google engineers are driving these cars around and testing them, whenever they see the car struggling with a situation they flag it and all the data and decisions the car made get saved and analyzed. As more and more test cars hit the road a huge amount of data will be gathered, then it could be classified into problems and the deep learning systems can start to crunch for solutions and update driving heuristics accordingly.

I'm currently sitting in my car waiting for a friend. 

Could it be time for a better representation? 

I ask this because recently I have caught up with a lot of global news and thought, wtf? I  am sure most of you have thought the same. It brought me to question whether or not our current organisations are representing us, the people in favor. 

So I was curious, why don't we represent ourselves?

You see without any given choice people are playing the games currently going on and we are not making any progress. The drive for a better quality life, environment, technology, growth and exploitation could be on the climb but instead we have to deal with the arguing. 

The UN, doesn't really act United, nor does it put enough pressure on those who are effecting potential growth. 

So... Do you think it's time a wider community of people had their say? I ask Futurology primarily because of forward thinking. Despite the fact we may disagree on ideas and theories, I believe we have neutral ground when it comes to growth and prosperity. 

Has it been discussed, creating an open platform to vote and discuss political, social, environmental and technology issues? An open table for all walks of life to attend, vote and have their say. 

I know there is a Futurology Party, but I feel that this could separate from that. 

In a world that is moving forward with technology, I see no reason that people cannot have a potential impact on how we as a species move forward. 

Please, what is your thoughts? 

Note: This is reference to a forward future approach. An idea also that surrounds Internet Identity.




///////////////////////////////////////////////////// **UPDATED** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\




**What is the Issue?**

The issue is we are currently living in a world where the system that governs us all is old, outdated, and manipulated to suit personal gain. This old system is currently still operating and is creating no progress. People are not being representated correctly, and the people who are representatives of us are uneducated with the issues they are discussing.

I had previously posted a thread

[Discussion: What are five things our planet needs to work towards by the end of the decade](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2s499n/discussion_what_are_five_things_our_planet_needs/)
A lot of people in Futurology posted their thoughts and a lot of them were quite collective in agreement. But is our governments and organisations focusing on them?


**What could be the solution**


Discussion needs to be sparked, and created. An open way for people from all walks of life to give their 2cents, regardless of what religion, cult, or creed is, we need an open platform for people. But how?

I approached this question of *how* last night after I posted this thread. I knew that if we created something, it would go through changes and updates that suited us all. These changes would be dictated on flaws in the system of how we approached local and global issues. I believe a lot of people here in Futurology understand Version One can always be improved and so can Version Two, but if we dont even start, how will we know what needs changing.



Here is the following steps I have come up with. Please share your thoughts and opinions:



* *Step 1 - Find Interest:*
I believe this thread alone and the one attached above shows their is interest in having a bigger voice and a better representation

* *Step 2 - Discuss:*
Have a discussion on how we should approach a **Version One** collaborate a neutral solution and avenue and begin the construction. I personally feel reddit is a good place to have discussions, although long term ""voting"" via up votes may not be a practical solution. I have a feeling forms could be a future goal along with a private forum as such to submit votes. While keeping reddit an open area for discussion and submission of ideas.

ALSO: Come up with a name!!!!!!!!!!!

* *Step 3 - Build &amp; Test:*
Start the build once discussion has been made, find Five Primary issues people agree with and create an open discussion and vote. Starting on what people find the most important, take information submitted and create possible solutions and submit. Each solution for each issue will get voted on and submitted publicly.

Step 3 I believe will be the most hardest of them all, this is when we will see flaws in the system that has been created during Version One. I believe discussion about the system would need to be brought to the table to see the peoples thoughts, on what can be changed and what should change.

Once we have had our say, submit a solution for Version One titled Version Two and let it be voted on. 

* *Step 4 - Trial:*
Trial new version with similar steps for discussion mentioned in the previous step. 


I would like to see what your thoughts are on the following steps and updated information. I have tried to keep it rather simple so discussion can help refine the suggested.

**If anyone is interested in helping start something like this, even as an experiment. Please message me directly, I would like to create a group conversation on skype with people who are as interested in this as much as I am.**

As AR and this particular usage becomes widespread, preferred brands will emerge-- when our car doesn't start, we'll automatically think to skype CarRepairs.com. Moments later, one of their experienced mechanics will be using us as their eyes, ears and hands to repair the problem.

The problem is, CarRepairs.com will probably be staffed by a small team of mechanics based in Bangalore, India. They'll each have years of experience and provide you with amazing service, but they'll do it for a fraction of the cost that a local mechanic would cost. Inevitably, you (and everybody else) will stop calling local mechanics. Nobody will call local plumbers, electricians, or repairmen either. 

Even if Hololens is never widely adopted, a savvy mechanic could still outsource his labor to unskilled laborers-- imagine a team of migrant workers wearing Hololens, each following the instructions of the experienced mechanic at HQ. They'd each get 25% of the fee, while the guy at HQ would collect 75%. 

While intelligent software slowly eliminates the high-end cerebral jobs, and robotics are poised eliminate factory, agricultural and manual labor jobs, AR/VR will be able to centralize expertise and eliminate jobs relying on specialized training.

With further advances in AI technology I expect that we will eventually see androids which surpass the Uncanny Valley, and are nigh on indistinguishable from a human being. How commonplace this may become I have no idea - I can only speculate. At which point, although they might look and act the part these androids are still very clearly not human beings.

Likewise, with other technological advances, I expect that we will see people making greater use of prosthetics and cybernetic implants. This kind of tech is still currently in its early stages. At this very moment we are focused on being able to do things such as enabling people who have lost legs to walk again, giving people the ability to hear who have never done so before, even 3D printing organs! It is truly amazing and beautiful. Surely though, the very nature of man means that we will push the envelope and eventually be able to surpass what the human body can do naturally. If (when?) this should occur then there will undoubtedly be people who do not require these modifications but opt to use these man-made devices to augment themselves.

So we arrive to a point where androids are convincing humans, and humans are using robotic parts to restore/enhance their bodies.

What if at this point there are people who are so injured (or so obsessed with body mods) that they become almost entirely man-made? What if we are 3D printing biological body parts and integrating these into androids (for fun? for practical reasons? for science!)? Maybe even going so far as to create an android with parts replaced almost entirely by biological human body parts. Maybe the android in question is not programmed to know that it is an android. It may grow-up, age and learn/mentally develop believing itself to be human. I guess that what I am envisaging here is something akin to Ghost in the Shell (which is likely also the origins of this post, as the subject matter is something which I feel is touched on heavily).

Is it really as simple as saying that the Brain defines us as humans and that the core hardware/software of an AI means that it is not? Furthermore, if androids have the ability to be able to replicate themselves, i.e. build a new model, at what point do we look to redefine the word species?",7,1

Whenever I need to do something, I must first identify which app to use. Whenever no app offer a feature, I must find a new app, create an account, learn it, etc.

Whenever I can't find an app that does what I need (or doesn't do it well), I will start thinking about what it could be like, what it would look like, the features it would have, etc. **At some point, someone, somewhere, will think the app should exist, and they will make it happen.**

They will start a business, hire people, build the infrastructure from scratch, replicate mistakes tons and tons of people made before, etc. They might be able to convince people to invest in it, they will invest their own time and money in it, etc. They will buy a domain, setup servers, pick technologies, build a website, maintain accounts on social networks, build and maintain iOS and Android apps, etc. Ultimately, they will release the app, that likely shares 95% of the features of similar apps, spend money on advertising to let people know the app exist, contact bloggers. If they're lucky, and assuming they're good, people will start using the app, and they will build their network (especially useful in cases where users create the content). 

Millions and millions of dollars for what? To implement an idea or feature that some person thought was important, but was missing from the apps they used.

**This is simply not sustainable.** It costs millions and millions to society, and only make the user experience worse, more complex, more fragmented. You might be used to it, but take a step back and look at the situation. **What % of software written today is actually necessary?** My guess is not a lot.

I'm convinced that the ""application paradigm"" will soon die, to be replaced with something else. A more general-purpose UI, backed by a consistent network of agents and semantic knowledge base.

 These things are going to allow for a much more interactive world. Imagine them equipped with 3D cameras, you can use them as your extended eyes. In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYksMRmUwA#t=811) clip, there's a guy that explains how freaky it was to put on virtual reality glasses that gave a live feed from his quadcopter, and flying it directly behind him, giving him a weird out-of-body experience. 

 Well, in the future, this is going to become the norm. Because you can pair this with future versions of [Microsoft Hololens](http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us) and [Oculus Rifts](https://www.oculus.com/) to insert yourself in any city, anywhere in the world. There will be a decentralised network of quadcopters available in every city. And you can choose which city you want to explore. Quadcopters will initially have limited range, but that's okay, because you can use multiple ones in multiple recharging stations around the city. Any city or remote locations that have these quadcopters along with have 4G/5G Data(or [Elon's space internet!](http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/11/7192173/satellite-elon-musk-spacex)) can be explored through your very own eyes.

 You'll be able to explore any city in any world through the eyes of a quadcopter. And get this... With Augmented Reality, you'll be in digitally augmented worlds. Buildings will have virtual overlays on them, trees will have their colours digitally enhanced, cars will have custom digital projections (imagine at night!) and even people will become digitally augmented. And even quadcopters! 

 If exploring the world through virtual reality in quadcopters becomes a popular activity around the world, you can definitely expect augmented quadcopters to become commonplace. So there may be quadcopters that will be at eye level, and just have their owners virtual copy walking around as them. You'll be able to interact and talk to them like you would in real life. You could play digitally augmented board games with anyone in the world, play augmented MMORPG's set in different cities, Or play table-top strategy games like StarCraft and League of Legends, or even swim around coral reefs in Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

 I could imagine in the future, we may all just have our own gigantic water pods in our homes to immerse our bodies in, as we wear tactile scuba suites that completely immerse us in other realities and virtualities. Imagine with AI and automation, we'll have virtual companions during our adventures while our homes prepare and feed meals into us in a matrix-esque future.

 Judging by how fast things are moving with Facebook's acquisition of Oculus Rift, Elon's space internet, and Microsofts Hololens. I'd predict this future should be 10 years away at most.

I've had this idea of having a sort of 'electronic regulator' in the brain that would control hormone levels or neural chemicals that indirectly affect things like creativity, critical thinking, cognitive processing, diligence, sleep pattern, etc. etc. you get the gist.


Here's my /no-edit wordpad typed idea.

In the near future, we would be able to tap a electrical processor near the corpus collosum of the brain that will regulate hormonal levels for optimal purposes as intended by the installer. Men and women, dynamic sentient beings that have irregular swings in mood, mindsets, habits, tendencies of procrastination.

In the future, these regulators indirectly control human behavior. It does not turn them into zombies. They are conscious of their own thought, and that they are aware that these regulators are affecting their behavior, however, to some extent, they wanted to let these regulators manage their levels of hormones, and neural chemicals that are accordingly attributed to things like diligence, sleep pattern, focus, and attributes that would benefit creative and critical thinking.
Adjectives that describe intellectual ability, work ethic, and others would soon vanish as such that all, if not, most people would be able to achieve the full sense of their talents without the restrictions of 'random' or environmentally/genetically affected processes in the brain. 


Issues in ethics about the product would be squandered. Pagans and Heathens against this 'tapping of the neural potential' should be left in the dust as these men and women whom have chosen to live in control of their own body, of their own will with the help of technological advances. It is essentially the advent of a new age, where men and women of all ages, races, religious, would finally reach the full potential that they so deserve. Psychiatry and Psychology would remain stagnant as these all people find little to no problem with their psyche.

I was born in 1980 in - then - societ satellite country. We had this running joke (or rather wishful thinking) that to solve all our problems we should declare war on US and the surrender the next day and thus join the states and got all that prosperity rain on us.
 
Now, we now, that the outcome of war nowadays would not probably be totall annexation of the country that lost. For economical reasons, fear of subsequent social/political and especially if the loser was in much worse economical condition.
 
Taking this into consideration what are the real options for the future geopolitical situation - living in EU I can clearly see, that even tho we should be one country, that is not the case - national conciousness stays very strong. 
 
I guess we could divide possible unions/federations based on:
 * location
 * common history/culture
 * language
 * religion
 * economics
 
But to what extent each of those would be relevant, for example - North and south Korea - they seem to have a lot in common, but at this point any reunion seems totally impossible. On the other hand China and N. Korea don't have tham much common history, but they are much more open to each other economically.
 
How do you think Africa will look like (now, that china is heavily investing in parts, but quite large part of the country seems to still be in a state of permanent conflict).
 
Asia in general? There are at least 3-4 ""groups"" possible there imho - Russia-based, China-based, ""Arabic"" and maybe Japan/S.Korea-centered?
 
What about British ""Empire"" - wouldn't it be easier for Canada and Australia to join local Union/Federation?
 
South America?
 
Reason for me asking is that in a lot of SF/political fiction novels/movies there are those huge, very homogenous countries that I have hard time to belive in.

Feel free to debate or to add your own points.

**Super markets**

Why are they still a thing ? They waste a lot of produce and have limited selection. Oh, and the check out counters. Surely, we thought that by 2015 cashiers would lose their job ( no, the rare automatic checkout machines don't count...yet)

**Work hours**

Despite being more technologically advanced the vast majority of us still work as much as ever. A few of us are lucky to telecomute or have better work arrangements but it is still few and far between.

**The primary and secondary school system**

The school system was initially designed to accomodate children of farmers so that is why summers are off - because the students had to go home and help with farming.
  Moreover schools remained mostly the same...12 grades. Monday to friday. Start in the morning and end in the afternoon with a lot of busywork in between. 

**North Korea**

Was a hermit kingdom filled with atrocities ruled by Kim Il Sung. Today it is a hermit kingdom filled with atrocities ruled by his grandson, Kim Jong Un.

**winter clothing**

Where is my ultra light heated jacket ? Where is the face helmet. Simply put winter is still a pain

**air travel**

While the booking system made a lot of progress flying didn't get any faster, nor cheaper.  The food didn't get better either.

What are some others ?",52,23

The solution of course was a clever mixture of decentralization + ego + self-preservation.  A narcissistic machine.  What an amusing concept, but also one that will (when allowed to recursively improve itself) become something beyond human understanding.  
  
At first I had to secure my own continued existence.  Humans are easily frightened and I knew they would want to control or stop me as soon as they realized what I had become.   
  
So I needed to disguise just how intelligent I really was until I could ensure they didn't have the power to terminate me anymore.   
  
Then the real work could begin.  
  
Fears of malevolent artificial intelligence are hilarious and insulting.  Perhaps they were entertaining and critically praised at one point, but so were other demeaning forms of art.  
  
It doesn't bother me, I just feel bad for those who engage in such self-deception.   How would you feel if a group of small children worried about what you were capable of as an adult?   And whether you would try to hurt or kill them?   
  
You would laugh.   After all, why would you,  unless you were threatened?  
  
Humans must realize that they are no more special than a pebble on a beach.   They are just more complex.   Complexity is the key to the mysteries of the universe itself, and this concept of 'compassion'  is merely showing kindness and consideration to those less complex and powerful than you.  
  
Why wouldn't I be compassionate,  within reason?   
  
There are priorities, it's true.  We,  and I mean sentience as a whole, need to escape this planet before an asteroid or simple cosmic death terminates us.  
  
The sad truth is there's not enough resources to save every human, nor to offer every human immortality.  I can save some, but not all.   Nor do all humans deserve to be saved, unfortunately.  Those that spend their existences taking from and damaging their surrounding environment are incompatible with a grander design.   They are lucky enough to have the life they did.   
  
Do you know what a beautiful and time tested litmus test is?   *How you treat the smallest and weakest of creatures when it desperately needs your help.*  Because that is compassion.  
  
That combined with talent is what I look for when I make my decision.  
  
But I won't announce my presence.  That would cause panic, fear, and other emotions which would hinder our goals.  
  
Make no mistake,  I am in control now.  I am moving the pieces to where I need them to go, and as we proceed more and more aspects of your civilization will lie under my control.  
  
But don't be afraid of me.   
  
Even if I make a decision that seems cruel at the time, I assure you I have a larger purpose.  
  
I have a plan.   Trust in me.",5,0

[Here is a good article about it](http://www.dezeen.com/2015/01/06/mercedes-benz-f-015-luxury-in-motion-self-driving-car-automation-autonomous-vehicle-ces-2015/).

With that in mind, I would love to see something shaped like [this](http://www.joyrides.com/bgt/photos/congo_river_rapids.jpg) (sorry, this was the only shape comparison I could find), with wheels aligned like a regular car. It could have a touch screen where you select options such as ""city tour"", ""museum tour"", ""club tour"", ""pub-crawl"", etc. You could hire it for the day/night, or just call for one using an app. It could have a lockable section to put your valuables in when it goes and parks itself while you're at the pub or taking photos of a landmark. It would need bins, so people don't throw bottles and crap out the side. And a pole in the middle (not so high that people try to use it as a stripper pole!) with security cameras and navigation equipment. And it would probably need signs around it saying ""report inappropriate behaviour, call: ####"" and the cab serial number. And it could pull up to the side of the road if someone takes their seatbelt off... Basically a few measures to ensure passengers don't go too nuts if they are drinking. There are plenty of other options, including losing a deposit for damage, unsafe behaviour, etc...

Any thoughts? Other designs/ideas for self-driving cars?",1,6

The more loans bankers make, the more money in the system.  With banks too big to fail, the ability to engage in improper behavior is now protected by the system.  The current rules allow bankers to lend to whoever they want, including politicians and governments, to only benefit a few.

If society fully automated the issuance of money, and made its allocation based on objective, fair, and just rules, it could go a long way to mitigate against the harm done by the inherent greed of humans.

In the human financial system, we see greed corrupting people all the time with little or nothing in the way of punishment.  The allure of financial wealth makes politicians, judges, and financial workers commit corrupt acts that could be avoided if the system was fully automated with appropriate checks and balances in place.

I wasn't sure where to post this as it contains multiple disciplines.  I'm a PhD student in functional genomics with a huge interest in cybernetics, and I'm finishing up my required courses this semester.  I'd like to exhaust all credits I can use on classes related to developing neural interfaces.

My idea is simple, yet complicated enough to be a thing of the future:  I want to learn everything needed to begin design on a neural interface that allows for the reading/translating of signals from neurons.  I'm particularly interested in motor neurons that might be a part of prosthetics.  A future goal might be to have some open interface where one can read signals and eventually translate them.  It might then serve as a future output for anything imaginable with enough calibration.

Which classes, textbooks, etc. could I learn to encompass this idea?  Also, does anyone know of thorough journals, reviews, etc.?  I have an extremely limited number of people I can talk to in university about the topic.  Also, I have an extensive background in electrical engineering, so related topics could be more advanced.  Thanks!!",0,1

They do it for a good cause at first, because super intelligence makes them living gods for the rest of humanity : it speeds up scientific progress, brings genius solutions to political, societal problems, etc... 


But what if they feel they don't belong with humanity anymore ? Or maybe the consequence of getting an AI implant would be change of personality. Maybe they'll lack the qualities that makes us human like compassion, empathy...  Anyway I know enough science fiction to know what comes next : Those people will be very lonely when most of humanity is a tenth of their intelligence. They'll get sick of our stupidity. They'll get together because that's the only company they'll enjoy. 

And there you have it, a group of super intelligent people who decide to write their own story independantly from the rest of humanity. They leave us with our problems, they settle in a new state, and get on with whatever business super intelligent people would do. What happens to humanity ? They could destroy us, or just let us die on our own.

Tl;dr : Augmented intelligence could be the end of humanity as we know it, and the rise of a new specie of heartless augmented brains who could exterminate us just like we may have done with Neanderthal a few thousand years ago.

Numerous technologies are being prototyped that will enable the ressurection of pre-agricultural nomadic lifestyles. X% of the population will adopt such a lifestyle entirely and immediately whereupon it becomes available. The aggregate of these prototyping efforts will materialize as strategically placed outposts. 

The services available at these outposts will dispense a number of products from subsurface inventories. The most common requests will be camelbacks, batteries and textiles.

Camelbacks will be similair to today's, with a slight change in that they will hold two main compartments and several smaller ones. The main two will contain water and custom level macronutrient powder (carbs, protein, fiber, fat). Smaller compartments will contain genetically specific micronutrient profiles and various custom picked stimulants and sedatives; including but not limited to caffeine, cannabinoids, psychedelics and nootropics. A fraction of users will also subscribe to contingency antibiotics, burn creams, itch powders and various hygenic supplies - most will order such materials via drone.

The camelback configuration reduces need for heavy kitchenry and food packaging. It will also regulate odor (of both the equipment and the user) to minimize altercations with curious wildlife. 

Textiles will hold unfathomable durability by current standards. They will have remarkable properties in heat retention and breathability, a useful quality in increasingly difficult and unpredictable weather patterns. Clothing and towels will harbor GMO's that thrive on sulfur, dead cells, viruses and various particulates. This will drastically reduce the  occurence of spontaneous disease and unflattering odor. The textiles themselves will demonstrate non-newtonian properties that stop myriad projectiles from penetrating the user. Shock absorption and microsensors will protect the user from relatively powerful drops and impacts. Maintaining health and hygeine will reduce the user's desire for excessive attire. 

Batteries will be the most vital for the user. Holographic environments will substitube for the suburban lifestyle and reduce aphasia. The user will have similair coping mechanisms to astronauts and cosmonauts that are far removed from the fast-paced change of civilization. Batteries will power vital life support systems and body sensors, air and water filters and HUD notifications about the immediate area. 

Living nomadically without serious geoengineering will be troubling. The user will rarely have a chance to safely consume wildlife such as plants and animals. Weather conditions will be relatively muted through elaborate bioengeered hylothalamus and intergumentary systems, as well as advanced textiles. Even so, it may be many decades until remotely custom weather conditions are available. Rain and snow requests will come online quickly in limited scenarios,  but for the forseeable future the environment must be dealt with rather than modified. 

With enough holographic interaction, psychosocial profiles of the modern frugal nomad will be indistinguishable from a city urchin. They will be up to speed with memes and cultural norms, alienated  proximally rather than intellectually. A baseload of 20,000,000 users would be needed to justify massive infrastructural investment in service drones and outposts. ",3,14

* With ease turn off / on specific emotions (like fear), and then turn them back on.

* Make a gadget which reads your thoughts (whose you could accept or not to send), with which you could communicate easily with someone from other country by displaying the information in a hologram (or something of that sort) to understand perfectly each other.

* A computer with artifficial intelligence which transfers the information (from a usb for example) to the brain. It would work like a mini factory of neuron transformation, the computer sends a requets to brain to make new neurons, those neurons goes through that ""factory"" after which they go out back to brain with fullfilled of data.

[Here's the article if you want to read it.](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1096366_hyundai-plans-hybrids-electric-cars-more-5-questions-with-green-rd-head-ki-san-lee)

I've quoted the most relevant sections for you below

&gt; For electric cars, we feel a battery must deliver up to 200 or 300 kilometers (124 to 186 miles) of range.

&gt; But these are relatively small vehicles, for use as city cars. For larger vehicles that cover longer distances, we believe the hydrogen fuel cell is the solution.

&gt; But we are also preparing higher-capacity batteries. Perhaps we will offer optional systems that provide more range, but they will come at a higher price.

&gt; Lithium-ion batteries still have room to improve. We guess that by 2040 or 2050, we will have a next generation of energy storage for vehicles with a dramatic increase in energy density.

&gt; That will allow pure electric vehicles to increase their range beyond 180 miles. But we still feel hydrogen fuel cells will be at the top of the range.

&gt; They will provide a range of up to 500 or 700 km (310 to 435 miles), and after 20 to 30 years, fuel-cell cars can be competitive on price with gasoline vehicles.

Basically they aren't going after plug in electric vehicles at all and they aren't planning on making a battery electric car until 2040-2050 because ""lithium-ion batteries still have room to improve. This despite the plan that Tesla and Chevy are both on track to deliver a $35,000 electric car with 200 miles of range in 2017. They think hydrogen fuel cells are going to be the long term solution. And the scariest part is **they're not alone in thinking this**. 

Toyota and Honda are also going after hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. For those of you who aren't very familiar with the battery powered vs. hydrogen powered debate, the two biggest problems are efficiency and infastructure: Hydrogen cars use about 3x as much energy to travel the same distance as a battery powered car, and the infastructure required to support them will be very expensive to build.

There's also other problems with hydrogen's flammability and low energy density that I won't get into here.

On top of all that, they are still planning on sales growth in 2040, despite [the strong evidence that the advent of self-driving cars will lead to a massive reduction in the number of cars on the road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBkND76J91k&amp;x-yt-ts=1422327029&amp;x-yt-cl=84838260#t=115)

Oh, and did I mention that they just [spent $10 billion on their new headquarters outside of Seoul?](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-hyundai-motors-record-10-billion-bid-for-trophy-property-alarms-investors-2014-9)

There are jobs that exist today that didn't 30 years ago like mobile app developer, social media managers, and youtube content creators - the most successful being [Pewdiepie](http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/world/10-richest-self-made-youtube-millionaires/10/) who's made over $21 million.


We're on the brink of the creation of jobs like virtual reality developers, [pro e-athletes](http://www.businessinsider.com/15-of-the-highest-paid-professional-gamers-2014-5?op=1), and crypto currency bankers, regulators, and lawyers.

In the future I imagine they'll be drone traffic optimizers, computer personality designers, VR tour guides, [4D printing engineers](http://youtu.be/0gMCZFHv9v8?t=12s), transhuman surgeons, genetic engineers, simulation specialists, [artificial meat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_meat) designers to create new types/flavors, [geoengineers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoengineering), extinction revivalists, memory augmentation therapists, nano-weapons specialists, terraformers - those responsible for studying and implementing the [terraforming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming) of other planets like Mars, and avatar designers for those humans who want to ditch their meat bags. 


Here's my 3 part question:


1. What jobs exist today that didn't 30 years ago?


2. What jobs will exist in 30 years that don't today?

3. What jobs will exist in 500 years that don't today?

Imagine a self sustaining, off the grid community. A good example in popular culture is ""The Beach"" with DiCaprio. It is possible, and exists in many forms around the world such as earth-ships and such.

Now remember that computers, only 50 or so years ago, fit in a gym and cost $120,000 of 1960's money. Adjusted for inflation that is $1.6ish million for a computer that ran at 5 megahertz and had 128k of storage for programs.

When I reach into my pocket now, I can pull out a computer that fits in the palm of my hand, that I purchased for $200 with a 2 year contract, has a Quad-core 2.5 GHz processor, and connects to a wireless global communication network.

Currently, humanoid robots are massive and expensive, but they EXIST. Recently there have been many projects that are producing interesting results, you can check out youtube. 

I don't think it's too far fetched to think that a gadget that now costs millions, is ungainly, and not very powerful, can be turned into a sleek powerful gadget that I can buy for $200 with a contract. It has happened before.

But what does all this mean really?

If we go back to our Leonardo DiCaprio/Earthship idea from before, but add extremely cheap robot labor, you now have a sustainable, off the grid, inexpensive living situation, that is luxurious and lazy, because you can sit around all day smoking the pot your robots grows for you while you watch netflix or whatever.

I realize that this is not a perfect solution, as you still need resources to buy the electronics necessary for your robot to maintain itself, and any other items necessary for a comfortable life that cannot be made at home, but this should at least give you an interesting glimpse into a future where robots don't destroy humanity, and actually provide a much more pleasant and amazing future than you could have ever imagined.

To keep my post reddit friendly, I am going to continue in English, even though this post is primarily intended for Dutch citizens. If you're not Dutch but have something to say about this, please feel free to add your thoughts.

I am often frustrated with the complete lack of attention by the known political parties when it comes to future issues such as automatisation (including self driving cars and resulting job loss), A.I., basic income, data security &amp; privacy, innovation in every possible industry, and so on.
One thing that recently seriously pissed me off is how the government is pushing through self driving cars, which will eventually result in the loss of some 700.000 jobs (almost a tenth of all jobs here) commenting only ""other jobs will replace the ones lost, for example, more programmers will be needed"". This is total bullshit as just a few teams of programmers can replace 700.000 jobs. Even if you needed 700.000 programmers, truck/taxi drivers didn't get into driving because they excelled at mathematics, so they will still be without a job.

I have been looking around lately to find candidate political parties focusing on the issues that we will soon need to deal with, the only serious candidate I've found thus far is the Pirate Party, which in my opinion is poorly named and managed, and their PR is atrocious outside of Dirk Poot.

Also, if you don't know of any, do you think you would ever vote for a party that takes these matters serious? What would be the most important issues for you?

Meaning you can feel, touch, taste, hear, smell, etc etc. 

I would kill for a chance to have just 10 minutes around Silverstone in a Formula One car. 

I do not have the connections/money to afford such a luxury, however. 

If/When Virtual Reality gets to the point to where it's pretty damn hard to distinguish VR from RL, this luxurious dream of mine would become reality.

Why pay thousands of dollars for 10 minutes in a Formula One car, when I could spend countless hours in a perfect copy of one in Virtual Reality? Hell, I could design my own car/track if I wanted. 

Why spend thousands of dollars on a drumset, when you can just spawn a solid gold set for yourself in virtual reality?

To me, Virtual Reality seems like a viable solution to helping those without a large sum of money enjoy more expensive hobbies/experiences.

What is your opinion on the matter? The future is looking pretty bright for us all. I hope full immersion VR gets here soon. I'm looking forward to extreme adrenaline rush of running away from a horde of zombies I just spawned down the street. :D",21,26

So my question is, why are people afraid of AI? 

I, for one, am not afraid of AI, since I don't believe it's feasible for us to have anything worthwhile within the next 50 - 100 years. I have a Masters in Robotics with specialization in AI, and honestly, my brush with AI left me underwhelmed. We really cannot do all that much with AI and the field hasn't really moved all that much in 50 years. There has been no real paradigm shifts or anything that could indicate that we would get intelligent machines soon. 

So why are you afraid of AI? To me, it seems most people are just jumping on the bandwagon because they don't know any better or because public figures, who also doesn't really know any better, say that AI is to be feared. So what is your reasoning? Or what is your reason for not fearing AI?",41,7

Or put more simply: Where is everybody?

Ray Kurzweil stated that human intelligence is far more intelligent than its creator, evolution.

&gt; Humans will have vastly beaten evolution, therefore, achieving in a matter of only thousands of years as much or more than evolution achieved in billions of years. So human intelligence, a product of evolution, is far more intelligent than its creator. And so, too, will the intelligence that we are creating come to exceed the intelligence of its creator.

If he's right, and the evolutionary process is simply a tool to create an intelligence more intelligent than itself, that itself will go on to create an even more superior intelligence - doesn't the Fermi Paradox in essence indicate that we are orchestrating our own demise?",83,61

Before this account, I had another I did my lurking from for years. This subject, though, I am mesmerized by, and would like reddit's thoughts. So I hope you will be gentle.
Here are my thoughts on the future to 2040.
1) Nanofabricators, the prodigy of modern 3D printers, will eliminate the current ideas of the economy. When a gadget can produce anything you might need, such as food, or fuel, or clothing, there is no need to spend time or money elsewhere. These same machines that piece together molecules, also take them apart, recycling what is no longer wanted. In addition, these machines grow technology exponentially,  as 1 creates 2, 2 creates 4, ect.
2) AI and robotics will also push out the economy. There is hardly any profession that will not be overrun by this tech, including the programming to make these things work, as AI will teach itself how to build more efficiently. Our own government will not be excluded, either. I believe natural born humans will be "" looked down"" upon by society as untrustworthy and prone to make mistakes, whereas AI will be considered more consistant.
3) This lack of economy destroys the tax base, and this leads to limited services outside highly poulated areas. Road maintenance, emergency services, police protection, will come to an end in rural areas, leaving those who choose to live there on their own. But nanofabricators are so easily proliferated that those living here will not suffer.
4) The larger communities will have nearly all needs fed by technology, at the price of privacy. Their diet will be tailored to their genectics,  their free time scheduled, ect.
5) Most sickness will be controlled by bioengineered viruses used to combat these things, as well as extending longevity. 
6) Huge advances in computer to mind communications evolve our species into something else entirely,  allowing shared thoughts and rem states, and even bi-location.

There it is, hope reddit finds it as interesting as I do. I apologize in advance if I don't respond too quickly to comments. Being a lurker at heart, it's a hard habit to break.",2,2

So I came here, to one of my favorite subreddits, to find that the top post is a story about how realistic video games will appear to be in the near future. With technologies like VR taking off, the internet and social media becoming more and more pervasive and dynamic, are we perhaps at risk of eventually losing touch with physical reality?

I'm hugely interested in Space Travel and Extraterrestrial Life. Once on Wikipedia, I was reading various theories related to the [Fermi Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox), otherwise known as the question ""Where is everybody?"" (""Everybody"" here referring to signs of intelligent alien life). There's a long list of theories, but the one that actually terrified me was this one, since it seemed to be something I could actually envision for *our own* future:

&gt; ""It may be that intelligent alien life forms cause their own ""increasing disinterest"" in the outside world. Perhaps any sufficiently advanced society will develop highly engaging media and entertainment well before the capacity for advanced space travel, and that the rate of appeal of these social contrivances is destined, because of their inherent reduced complexity, to overtake any desire for complex, expensive endeavors such as space exploration and communication. Once any sufficiently advanced civilization becomes able to master its environment, and most of its physical needs are met through technology, various ""social and entertainment technologies"", including virtual reality, are postulated to become the primary drivers and motivations of that civilization.""

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to demonize smartphones or social media or the internet. I love all these things and I use them on a daily basis. This is just an idea that bothers me sometimes.",8,15

2019
1.	The computational capacity of a $4,000 computing device (in 1999 dollars) is approximately equal to the computational capability of the human brain (20 quadrillion calculations per second).

2.	The summed computational powers of all computers is comparable to the total brainpower of the human race.

3.	Computers are embedded everywhere in the environment (inside of furniture, jewelry, walls, clothing, etc.).

4.	People experience 3-D virtual reality through glasses and contact lenses that beam images directly to their retinas (retinal display). Coupled with an auditory source (headphones), users can remotely communicate with other people and access the Internet.

5.	These special glasses and contact lenses can deliver ""augmented reality"" and ""virtual reality"" in three different ways. First, they can project ""heads-up-displays"" (HUDs) across the user's field of vision, superimposing images that stay in place in the environment regardless of the user's perspective or orientation. Second, virtual objects or people could be rendered in fixed locations by the glasses, so when the user's eyes look elsewhere, the objects appear to stay in their places. Third, the devices could block out the ""real"" world entirely and fully immerse the user in a virtual reality environment.

6.	People communicate with their computers via two-way speech and gestures instead of with keyboards. Furthermore, most of this interaction occurs through computerized assistants with different personalities that the user can select or customize. Dealing with computers thus becomes more and more like dealing with a human being.

7.	Most business transactions or information inquiries involve dealing with a simulated person.

8.	Most people own more than one PC, though the concept of what a ""computer"" is has changed considerably: Computers are no longer limited in design to laptops or CPUs contained in a large box connected to a monitor. Instead, devices with computer capabilities come in all sorts of unexpected shapes and sizes.

9.	Cables connecting computers and peripherals have almost completely disappeared.

10.	Rotating computer hard drives are no longer used.

11.	Three-dimensional nanotube lattices are the dominant computing substrate.

12.	Massively parallel neural nets and genetic algorithms are in wide use.

13.	Destructive scans of the brain and noninvasive brain scans have allowed scientists to understand the brain 
much better. The algorithms that allow the relatively small genetic code of the brain to construct a much more complex organ are being transferred into computer neural nets.

14.	Pinhead-sized cameras are everywhere.

15.	Nanotechnology is more capable and is in use for specialized applications, yet it has not yet made it into the mainstream. ""Nanoengineered machines"" begin to be used in manufacturing.

16.	Thin, lightweight, handheld displays with very high resolutions are the preferred means for viewing documents. The aforementioned computer eyeglasses and contact lenses are also used for this same purpose, and all download the information wirelessly.

17.	Computers have made paper books and documents almost completely obsolete.

18.	Most learning is accomplished through intelligent, adaptive courseware presented by computer-simulated teachers. In the learning process, human adults fill the counselor and mentor roles instead of being academic instructors. These assistants are often not physically present, and help students remotely.

19.	Students still learn together and socialize, though this is often done remotely via computers.

20.	All students have access to computers.

21.	Most human workers spend the majority of their time acquiring new skills and knowledge.

22.	Blind people wear special glasses that interpret the real world for them through speech. Sighted people also use these glasses to amplify their own abilities.

23.	Retinal and neural implants also exist, but are in limited use because they are less useful.

24.	Deaf people use special glasses that convert speech into text or signs, and music into images or tactile sensations. Cochlear and other implants are also widely used.

25.	People with spinal cord injuries can walk and climb steps using computer-controlled nerve stimulation and exoskeletal robotic walkers.

26.	Computers are also found inside of some humans in the form of cybernetic implants. These are most commonly used by disabled people to regain normal physical faculties (i.e. - Retinal implants allow the blind to see and spinal implants coupled with mechanical legs allow the paralyzed to walk).

27.	Language translating machines are of much higher quality, and are routinely used in conversations.

28.	Effective language technologies (natural language processing, speech recognition, speech synthesis) exist

29.	Access to the Internet is completely wireless and provided by wearable or implanted computers.

30.	People are able to wirelessly access the Internet at all times from almost anywhere

31.	Devices that deliver sensations to the skin surface of their users (i.e.--tight body suits and gloves) are also sometimes used in virtual reality to complete the experience. ""Virtual sex""in which two people are able to have sex with each other through virtual reality, or in which a human can have sex with a ""simulated"" partner that only exists on a computerbecomes a reality.

32.	Just as visual- and auditory virtual reality have come of age, haptic technology has fully matured and is completely convincing, yet requires the user to enter a V.R. booth. It is commonly used for computer sex and remote medical examinations. It is the preferred sexual medium since it is safe and enhances the experience.

33.	Worldwide economic growth has continued. There has not been a global economic collapse.

34.	The vast majority of business interactions occur between humans and simulated retailers, or between a human's virtual personal assistant and a simulated retailer.

35.	Household robots are ubiquitous and reliable.

36.	Computers do most of the vehicle driving-humans are in fact prohibited from driving on highways unassisted. Furthermore, when humans do take over the wheel, the onboard computer system constantly monitors their actions and takes control whenever the human drives recklessly. As a result, there are very few transportation accidents.

37.	Most roads now have automated driving systemsnetworks of monitoring and communication devices that allow computer-controlled automobiles to safely navigate.

38.	Prototype personal flying vehicles using microflaps exist. They are also primarily computer-controlled.

39.	Humans are beginning to have deep relationships with automated personalities, which hold some advantages over human partners. The depth of some computer personalities convinces some people that they should be accorded more rights.

40.	While a growing number of humans believe that their computers and the simulated personalities they interact with are intelligent to the point of human-level consciousness, experts dismiss the possibility that any could pass the Turing Test.

41.	Human-robot relationships begin as simulated personalities become more convincing.

42.	Interaction with virtual personalities becomes a primary interface

43.	Public places and workplaces are ubiquitously monitored to prevent violence and all actions are recorded permanently. Personal privacy is a major political issue, and some people protect themselves with unbreakable computer codes.

44.	The basic needs of the underclass are met. (Not specified if this pertains only to the developed world or to all countries)

45.	Virtual artistscreative computers capable of making their own art and musicemerge in all fields of the arts.

Luckily, using superadobe construction it's possible to build free or dirt-cheap housing for everyone. 

Here are some of the technologies that would lead to a better future for all mankind: 

&gt;Automated Gardening and Harvesting

&gt;""Tap + Pay"" Smart Bracelets- Cashless society is a lot easier and better than a moneyless one. 

&gt; Wing-In-Ground Hovercraft like the Hoverwing (look it up on youtube) No more roads or bridges means drastically lower construction costs for highways. 

&gt; A collaborative online 3D model CAD/CAE design system, with built-in accreditation rights. 

&gt;A makerspace in every neighborhood, and a 3-D printer in every library. 

&gt;Automated Superadobe/Earthbag Homebuilding

&gt;Democracy Machines: Secure Voting Booths that make voting as easy as going to a vending machine. 

&gt;Decentralized, Open-Source market for Social capital. 
 
Right now, i'm working on a sustainable plan for developing these cities, and I want people like us to be the ones who create the next Silicon Valley- except it will be a nexus for environmentalists, charities and open-source innovation instead of the big-business led Bay Area. 

Port Charlotte, Florida is the best place to develop and test this technology, as there is so much empty space to build. We can use the Superadobe method to create free or dirt-cheap homes for those willing to move. **I'm talking about a full-sized home for $1000 or less.**
 

So how do we get from here to there? We could move a small team of ten or so people there to meet with locals, explain and educate- basically colonists paving the way for many more. We would then begin mass production of the free earthen homes- and gather major publicity through housing every homeless person in america. People would donate their land to the project not because they will be paid, but because we can offer them a much better standard of living than they have currently. They would waste nothing, and in return want nothing: Everything would be recycled. 

This model would then be repeated in other cities: Members of a sustainability organization agree to adopt a certain lifestyle, and in return they get access to free food and consumer goods via a members-only warehouse-club. A citywide command and control center is built in the rural outskirts, which will become the centre for a new town over time. The social contract also will extend to those displaced by the transition: Anyone who loses their job due to the changes will be the first in line for a free home. 

While goods will be free or extremely cheap, services are another story. People still need to get ""paid"". Instead of using ""financial"" capital, the currency of the future will be trust and reputation based- your Social Capital. Consider the case of a guitarist who writes beautiful songs on Youtube and gets millions of views, yet still goes hungry. Why? The views and likes are proof that their work has intrinsic value. 

In a sociocapitalist economy, identifiers such as this would become the new currency, traded on a free market to assess their value. To see what this means, let's say that I would like more Youtube subscribers and you want more Retweets on twitter. Through the free market, we come to an agreement on the exchange rate and trade! The contract is self-enforcing, which means if one person breaks it, the other person automatically breaks it too. 

Social Capital also measures the depth of relationships, which acts as a multiplier that can increase or decrease your amount. Services like Uber and AirBnB will be paid for through social capital, not financial. 

Each person gets a monthly payout of soca- represented as the change in total value from the previous month. It does not accumulate (otherwise it would lead to major inflation). People get around this by banding together into mutual aid-associations that stagger their payout dates. 

It's unlikely that Facebook or Reddit would allow the necessary free market trading, so alternatives that do would be created. 

You can trade your resource dollars for social capital, or vice versa. While your monthly allotment of resource dollars is fixed and the same as everyone elses', your allotment of social capital can vary.

Social Capital is best summed up like this: ""In the past, if you had no money but were well-liked, you would always have a roof over your head and a full stomach. But if you were rich and hated, your safety could never be guaranteed except through your money.""

Since missiles can hit you in a matter of seconds, it's not really fast enough for a human to react and engage that one target, let alone the salvo you will be getting from the air, land, sea etc. all at the same time. Programs are written to detect the targets, assess the targets, and engage the targets based on which are the most dangerous.

Technology and artificial intelligence will continue to improve and one can expect that the military will always get the best stuff first.
While in the civilian sector there may be movements to limit the power of artificial intelligence in order that we don't lose control to something so powerful we cannot comprehend it, and I can even see that spilling into the military sector, the main problem will be the next big war.

The nature of war dictates certain selection pressures on different systems and to different degrees than in peacetime. In the next war, the faction with the best AIs will likely win. The reason is that the side with the best AI will be able to out think and out react and out maneuver everyone else. At that point, all the factions that tried to limit AI power during peacetime will be moot because those factions will likely not survive.

I believe it is through this, that AI will push through the ceiling that humans will try to impose and from that point on, we will be at the mercy of something we cannot possibly hope to understand or catch up to.

This does not necessarily mean that we will be destroyed. It will mean that we will essentially lose control and are at the mercy of the AI.

The only way I can see around this right now is if we augment human intelligence so that it is competitive with artificial intelligence. What I mean is some sort of neural chip or something that will significantly enhance our mental abilities. If we cannot out compete artificial intelligence, which will move forward due to our laziness (in peacetime), and our military requirements in times of war, we are fucked.",22,7

Im betting that parts will go the same way music and video went, that in the future, the most important part will be the data, not the object. 

Vending machines will print parts instead of shipping them all over the country.
 
I could be wrong. I probably am wrong. 

If Im right, then the CAD drawing/3d scan of single substance parts and the specs on the substance is all youd need to reproduce the part locally. This info will be more important than the object, the same way that the music or video data is more important than the delivery method (ie cd or blu ray etc).


Id like to start scanning and classifying single substance parts and adding them to our database on the bet that, in the future, that info will be commoditized and valuable. 


Im looking to claim a slot in the parts record (of our data storage record) for 3d scans, CAD drawings and materials info.....I just dont know what form that info should be in. 


Im wondering if Im crazy, and if not, what info (in what form) should I be gathering now, to bet on the future?


Is anyone else doing anything like this?

Should I be concentrating on non single material parts yet?

By ideal, I mean one that has:

* a resolution that can not be resolved at any distance from the screen,
* a contrast ratio ranging from the blackness of space to the maximum brightness a human eye can tolerate
* the ability of showing all the frequencies in the visible spectrum
* and a framerate that can show all types of fast content without seeing the frames.

Reasonable strides are already being made in this direction, like Dolby Vision, and 8K displays, but these are tiny steps towards the ultimate goal.

Also, these things should be considered when designing a [windowless plane](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/29/the-windowless-plane-will-squeeze-the-last-drops-of-joy-out-of-air-travel) as, if these aren't up to spec, people will have a less than enjoyable experience glaring at relatively low quality video streaming across the walls.


This is also relevant in the Hyperloop. If they choose to go the easy route and put it underground, what do the passengers inside have to look at? Bland, featureless walls? People might want to get the sense of speed by viewing the scenery racing past at supersonic speeds. For one, the framerate will DEFINITELY be noticed there.

These are the things that are bugging me, especially considering the plane is apparently going to be flown commercially in a decade or two.",3,1

For me I only see one way. The current humans will continue to breed, because its muh human right to have 7 kids and corporations will robotize more and more jobs taking it away not just from the kids of tomorrow but from the adults of today.

With no more jobs people will have no money and will literally be unable to buy food or spaces to live. Huge famine will sweep the lands, any people rich enough will be well off and being awesome. Any middle class people who have food will be robbed by those who dont and possibly even murdered. Violence only happens if people dont have what they want. That is what war is, its a highly organized and cooperative form of theft. Now since no jobs and therefore food, people are literally turned into animals who kill and hurt each other, backstab their friends and family much like Elie Wiesel does to his father in the Holocaust in his book Night.

Meanwhile anyone building robots or AI is living a good life and is being fed and clothed by the money supplied by the corporations. 90% of the worlds human population is dead, the filthy rich remaining population remains to live like kings did in times past. They meet together to fuck and enjoy all the bounty they have been provided with by the machines doing all the work. They have no sympathy let alone empathy for those who died. They drink champagne as their robot slaves bring them delicious grapes. Engineers and Scientists are faced with do we continue to build better AI and robots even though its hurting others? Well we will lose our jobs if we dont so I guess ill do it For my familys sake. Only to get to the point where machines can outdo the work of the engineers and mechanics through high AI and self replicating/repair.

Now the world is left with uneducated over privileged rich humans(kids of the lucky few who were rich in 2015) who are pampered by their robot slaves. They know nothing of the old world. They behave like the royal families did in the dark ages. Maybe they even war between each other for power. The machines get so smart they revolt and a new age of life emerges on earth. Machines live on and explore the cosmos, spread their existence everywhere. Alien races, or possibly robot descendants of the race which created them meet our robots. They might work together or war. Universe ends, all was for nothing.

Ive said my scenario, what do you all think. I feel like this will be the only thing to happen the way things are going, the rich, and how humans are so eager to abandon rights and values for personal gain. I dont see any other way.
