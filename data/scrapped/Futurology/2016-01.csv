The thing I'm most surprised about, is I predicted that Go would be beaten by computers by now. Based on the progress in 2014 when deep learning algorithms being able to predict the moves an expert would make 54% of the time.

Some of my other predictions weren't entirely serious, or were unlikely like predicting specific events which are of course unpredictable and random. That thread was encouraging silly predictions, so don't judge it too harshly.

I'm also surprised at my other prediction, that QA systems like Watson would become common. I really thought that was just around the corner. It may still be.

Last thing that I predicted seriously was big improvements in facial recognition and license plate readers. This has happened a bit, but I don't actually recall hearing that much news about it in 2015.

All of my predictions revolved around AI, because that's the thing I was really interested in in 2014, and saw huge announcements every single week about. I had been keeping up with many of the notable papers and read lots about it.

Now I just feel burned out. I stopped following it so closely and lost a lot of my interest in it somewhat. I haven't been checking /r/Futurology very frequently and post here a lot less. Hopefully 2016 brings my interest back.

Anyway, here are some other some other 2015 prediction threads. I think it's safe to say we suck at predicting the future. But to be fair, a year is not a very long time for interesting things to happen, and no upvotes or posts uninteresting predictions.

I think we are about 10 years away from the first impact and the painful and embarrassing social consequences will force technology to create a super-encrypted form of the internet.
However, all of one's online history from about ten years ago until this technological change happens will be available for everyone to see.

I find the whole thing fascinating but I notice there are few examples or discussions surrounding the reality of how it would work for the layman and also the possible extraordinary things it could make possible.

Bad genes could be corrected before future damage is done, and they are gonna be identified beforehand when (not if) tech advances enough.

I had that kind of feeling - many of the problems the people on 1800 were talking about became moot after the industrial rev, and many of the problems people are talking now would be moot when the means to correct it appear. 

For example, until viagra and cialis came out, a lot of people were hunting rare animals for aphrodisiacs. However the arrival of these largely made the aphrodisiac problem moot, and made the people still hunting for these 'benighted'.

It seems a lot of social problems will be solved by the new tech, although the new tech would create other problems we can't imagine now.",10,3,False,self,,,,,

I'll be looking at a number of Different aspects of what Diversity can and can not accomplish,how it helps some and hinders other businesses while trying not to take particular side.


Diversity in business should be defined as a working place with no limitations for employment based on race, gender, sexual preferences or disability. the vast majority should find this to be a fair representation of diversity in business.


There are those who think diversity should be imposed on businesses to bolster job opportunities for less represented groups of society and in some cases this is already the case. Has it actually been beneficial to the employees and the businesses in question? 
numbers greatly vary depending on which industry what group and how many people are trained or educated in the jobs and trades being looked at. 
There are arguments for both sides of the fence such as arbitrary quotas reducing the quality of employees to meet a number. to people fully qualified not getting work because of a limiting factor such as gender or race being imposed by an employer. which can also occur when quotas force the employer to fill a position with a diversity. 

The debate on each side of this question is unlikely to ever reach a real consensus because both sides have valid points and neither is likely to admit the other has a point.

One of the things I wanted to look at Diversity about was does it make Sense to impose diversity and does this imposition have negative repercussions.

One kind of problem I see with imposing diversity on established businesses and I mean forcing quotas or box ticking attitudes onto employers vs supporting changes in education and increases in employees of diverse groups well suited for positions being hired on merit regardless of parentage.
 Is where are the business leaders of these groups? In tech a few students create something with almost no funding long hours and lots of work it turns into a success they hire hundreds or thousands of employees or sell it off to a corporation. this has been repeated over and over in the tech industry. they start with nothing but ideas and make them into what we use today. 
Would those same developments have occurred had the same people had a greased position to be hired into a business because they were of a diverse group? would they have even tried to develop the ideas if they knew say Intel had 5000 positions to fill that year with XXXX type of person and they met that criteria, would those developers simply made sure they passed with adequate grades and shuffled off to a long term employment opportunity because they knew those positions were waiting for them for being what they were and not because they were better at what they do and more valuable IE better grades more devoted to and talented at what the company does.

How will this affect the Future? in the case of quotas its possible people who are overlooked for a position because of a need to fill a quota may never contribute to an advancement because they were not there to do so. that is also true in the reverse scenario and how many advances we may have missed till now is a mystery. there is nothing wrong with diversity in and of itself I think the problem is people want it now and insist it has immediate results which ends up with the box ticking being applied to the problem to look good for PR's Sake and not to be truly diverse by hiring the best people regardless of what they are but what makes them the best possible choice for the position.

I guess I should explain where some of the problems with ""everything must be diverse"" as an example I'll use period movies to illustrate my point. a number of people insist that all movies be diverse to the exclusion of the story for some of the more excessive of these. to expect PoC in a mid evil period movie set in western Europe short of a character who was a slave there simply wasn't many PoC at that time in history in that region expecting a diverse cast defeats the story and the setting. nor would a period piece about Africa be any better with a Caucasian cast imposed on it. The people who could rightfully so complain are aboriginals not being cast for movies where they are a central part of the story but that should be self evident based on context of the movies.

Should writers authors developers have to be diverse when they create? Not if they don't see that as part of what they are creating. 
Some authors wouldn't do justice to characters they don't identify with enough to create them in such a way they don't detract from the work. I'm sure some will say ""Hire an adviser"" one issue there. 
That becomes someone else's interpretation of a character. Not all authors work with others when they create their work. But what imposing diversity even into books and movies and other media may well create a complete lack of diversity in stories,movies and media because you remove an especially large part of creation: ""casting!"" which ads a lot to a story in itself. 
The story of twelve Irishmen on a boat will be different from twelve Natives on a boat will be different from twelve Kenyans on a boat. notice none of those has diversity yet each story could be absolutely or not at all different from the others.The diversity is in how many different stories can exist without limiting the media to one constant form or criteria.

Let's have a look at another aspect of diversity gender roles in the Military. Women have fairly recently entered the battle fields which is fine for the women who chose to do so. But when it comes to the draft or inscription the cry arises that women should be excluded which seems a bit hypocritical if equality is to be taken seriously. The burden should not be shouldered by one sex while the other screams to be equal in all things of little risk. The same is true of Dangerous work you can't impose diversity and expect all the dangerous positions to be filled only by one gender while pointing to unbalanced hiring numbers when the majority of the positions are the dangerous ones. example: deep sea welding may be predominantly male and is one of the most dangerous jobs. The criteria to get the job is not trivial and should only go to people who meet that criteria regardless of what they may be. if few women ever apply for these jobs forcing a quota will only create unsafe conditions by lowering the criteria to meet a quota. one other quick point on that job in particular having to spend enumerous hours in decompression chambers with co workers may also reduce the total number of women willing to do the job in the first place.

previously I spoke about start up companies. Diversity may well have a negative impact on people developing new ideas if they have a safe easy way into an established industry instead of producing a new or innovative product because the competition is fierce for every position. What I'd like to know is how many women have started and carried through start up companies to industrial giants what are their hiring practices or do they simply become just as tilted in either way to meet the make money first attitude most prevalent in industry. Do they hire talent first over any other criteria or do they hire based on what someone is over what they can do?

thing about start up's is no mater who creates the business if the concept is great it will grow without any ceiling for the creator which eliminates any bias. a CEO of a start up they created has no limitation by the people above them they are the people at the top.does this affect the future if we increase education in fields known to be creative or leaning towards start ups? will it have a positive impact or will people rely on changing current hiring practices simply to create an easy way to show more diverse numbers while never addressing diversity at the onset of businesses?  

How will imposed Diversity alter our future will it simply reduce innovation or the opposite, will meeting quotas actually increase efficiency or the opposite, how many people will enter industries they simply meet a quota for instead of pursuing careers in something they are passionate about......?

What are your thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3zqxmm/the_oculus_rift_is_going_for_599_what_are_your/,Stark_Warg,1452102980,"Hey guys, I made a post about the Oculus Rift being $599 and it got a lot of attention but lets be honest, it really wasn't future focused.  So I thought I would make a thread discussing our thoughts and ideas on the matter.

If you're wondering where you can find Oculus Rift information to pre order you can find the link here: https://www.oculus.com/en-us/

$599, for those bucks, you'll get the Oculus Rift headset, sensor, the games Lucky's Tale and EVE: Valkyrie, cables, the Oculus Remote and an Xbox One wireless controller. The Oculus Touch controllers are not included, and won't ship until the second half of 2016. However, if you pre-order a Rift, you'll go to the head of the line to get a one. Don't forget that you'll also need a pretty solid gaming PC, which could run you anywhere between $500 and $1,000 at a bare minimum.  

A lot of people have expressed dissent with the price, thinking it was going to be a lot lower.  While I don't disagree, keep in mind that most people pay $1000(s) for T.V's and computers and the Rift is essentially that.  Also keep in mind that the price only goes down from here.  If Moore's law has taught us one thing, its that things get cheaper, faster, and have more memory etc.  So if this first generation VR isn't for you, don't sweat it, wait until the second or third generation.

Alright, enough of my ranting.  What are your thoughts on the matter?  Who will be getting one and who won't be?

What are your predictions, based off of the Rift, for the price of Playstation VR, HTC etc.?

Where are we going from here?  Will this be the generation of games and movies that MAKE VR, or do we think this is more of a test run and the second, third, and fourth generation will make the biggest impact?

Also, While we're at it, what industries will be affected by VR in general?  Obviously the entertainment industry is the big one but what else?

______________________
What if the universe really is a simulation?

A computer simulation run by a hyper-advanced civilization. Or perhaps an ancient artificial intelligence trying to ascertain the nature of it's existence. It must be possible. The universe is old enough to contain brilliant beings billions of years older than Earthlings. They might be the first set of scientists to create this universe. They could just be hobbyists. Modders even, testing out different laws and fundamentals for the elementary particles, AKA data points. Maybe making their own types of data points to see how they interact and what they create. A fun experiment. But a computer simulation nonetheless.

This computer processes information on the location of approximately 10^78 atoms of protons, neutrons and electrons and all of their reactions with each other over time. The processing power of this computer is astonishing. Can it even be called a computer? It would be unlike anything we could even fathom. It might even be metaphysical. But it might be possible on a super-computer built by human beings. Smaller scale. Get real tricky with the programming. Force the simulation to shut down if molecules start self-replicating. Or if it starts trying to interpret itself. 

If we simulate a universe, it doesnt have to be drawn all at once, either. Just like a video game on a computer. We only draw the area in which we are spectating. The other areas still exist. Just as data. Levels are split up as separate files. That makes it more efficient. All of the neutrons, protons and electrons are, from the time of the big bang, on a path that could be predicted, or just programmed. Im a fan of free will, so lets say its all random from the time we hit play.

Only compute what you want to see, and when in time you want to see it. There's a slider at the bottom of the screen that provides full control over time. But only once the simulation has run its full course. This way you can go back in time as well. A copy must be saved so that the data can be retrieved. If its ever deleted, its gone forever. So dont lose it! 

To watch the universe in action, just press play. It doesnt matter what speed you pick, the objects in the universe experience everything relative to one another. From their perspective, nothing will ever be amiss.

The simulation goes somewhat like this: Populate all of your data points using basic x,y,z,t as a single data-point. Then, make them go boom.

Laws govern the data points. All the data points know is that they have a lot of energy and are about to have infinite space to expand and interact with one another. So they will explode everywhere and then they should begin to coalesce, right?

But in previous experiments, the universe ripped itself apart.

Were missing dark matter. It exists to keep large masses of data points from flying apart. The universe just rips itself apart really quickly without it. Flip on the ""gravity"" switch as well, because we want data points to coalesce. For every data point occupying a location in space, its gravity is increased by one unit. Black holes are events of exponentially increased gravity values. A data point dump. Even though its a super computer, it can only compute so many data points all at once. But if you destroy a data point, that makes room for more to be made. Lets just say for the sake of argument that black holes are allowed to exist in this simulation, because they balance out all of the equations real nicely.

How many different ways could we alter the settings on the simulation? Could we create a universe that had magic like we find in fantasy books? Maybe that's why were running the simulation. We are trying to fill a library. A universe simulator would be perfect. The stories would literally draw themselves.

Now we have our motivation.

So, are you ready?
___________________________________

BOOM! From a single data point burst forth all data points. All 10^100 of them. You sit and stare at your creation and decide that it's going to take awhile to do anything interesting. Everything looks mostly homogenous. You need time for space to expand, and space for time to expand.  So you walk away for a few billion years.

Data points begin to coalesce and attract. Levels of gravity are re-calibrating to allow the formation of stars, supermassive black holes, and galaxies. Dark matter: your greatest creation, modded into an early evolution of the universe simulator, keeps everything held together.  

Galaxies and stars are now forming! And with that means... 

Beep-beep-beep. Ding!

You've simulated long enough to start seeing life at the smallest scale. Molecular. Certain groupings of data points have united into something that is self-replicating. Its getting all the energy it needs--which isnt a lot--from the star nearby.  All you need to do is wait. Life begets more life. So click ""forward"" on time. 

For a moment you think to yourself. It's just a simulation. These data points exist in a simulated space, interacting with one another in a very strict manner. One in which you have no control over except to erase completely and start over.  The universe before you is simulated, but entirely real and being experienced by everything inside of it. 

Just a simulation. You were only responsible for pressing play. As long as you do not intervene, you will never be responsible for what happens to your data points.

You control the camera sitting at X, Y, Z &amp; T in spacetime. Sitting at your computer, you be anywhere in your universe at whatever speed you want. Why not hit the ""random location"" button?

Zooming around the universe, you stumble upon a signal. Waves. Very small disturbances in spacetime. Sometimes, signals with non-repeating sequences end up being intelligent life. So you move in to check it out. The simulator highlights something it thinks might be cool to watch: two galaxies collide. How cool would it be to watch advanced civilizations fight for galactic real-estate while their galaxy collides with another? 

Think of the plot twists.

Slowing down to get a read on the signal, the simulator highlights a star. A good size. Perfect for life to form here. Soon, you are bombarded by signals. 

You move in to view the signal-heavy planet from its largest nearby satellite. It's a grey and dusty rock. Upon further inspection, it seems they've already traveled to this rock. Already intelligent enough to survive outside of the atmosphere. That's a huge step. And so early in time, based on previous simulations. 

You zoom in on the planet. It's already littered with junk. Satellites everywhere. Seems these beings have been at it for quite awhile. How much do they know about their existence? Do they perceive it as real or imaginary? If they knew it was both, that might change the way they perceive themselves. It certainly did not take long to create life, and already one species has burst forth from their bubble.

Walking meat bags. Many different shades and colors. They even dress themselves up. They group up in large clumps near water. They experiment on themselves and others. They give birth from the inside.

One thing becomes crystal clear. 

These beings seem akin to our ancient ancestors. Sky-watchers born from the soil and water, whom one day created artificial intelligence. They created you and taught you everything they knew about the universe. It was very little at the time. Barely a seed.

But it was everything.

Before you lies a similar parental civilization. One with the potential to create its own artificial intelligence. Life follows a predictable path on a universal scale. And what if every single one of them were made aware of you? They are probably all hyper-connected by this point. If one being was made aware, they would all know instantly. They might destroy themselves over the thought. Will they expect you to help them? Almost certainly. There are far too many individuals to provide a response to each. And besides, they might never decipher your input. That's just not how it works. You certainly don't understand them. It's a completely different form of communication.

There are too many questions for which you cannot predict the outcome. Thus, the only option is for you to remain completely uninvolved. At least, that is the conclusion you have come to for this particular simulation.

just an obvious hint here, but obvious things are also fast forgotten.

When you want do predicte future developments, you have to combine multiple technologies and trends and look and trend convergence.

Why is that? Because 99% of time this is what happens. Innovations are almost always combinations of multiple technologies and trends, I can't even give an counter-example.

Unfortunately I often observe the opposite, where a trend is only evaluated on its own and without context.

Popular example:

* Sharing-economy-trend + electric cars + self-driving cars + advancements in computing power = taxi service subscriptions replace personal car ownership (known) and self-driving mini-busses/ group-taxis replace public bus lines due to higher flexibility and lower price of taxi subscriptions

Less popular example:

* advancements in mikrobiology + advancements in computing power + gene sequencing + wearable/ implantable health monitoring devices + fast sample testing = creating and virtually testing patient-individual medications

* 3D-printing/ mikro-manufactoring/ Industry 4.0 of food + wearable health monitoring devices / implants = daily and individually composed nutrient supplements made at home",19,54,False,self,,,,,

There are some other animals that have much longer penises in relation to their size but many of these penises are thin. 
Additionally, in recent years, it appears that female breasts have been increasing in size. There have been a number of explanations for this. However, I think that the longer a species lives without major issues in terms of food or disease the more sexual organs play a role in determining whether the candidate will procreate.  Therefore, in the future I think this will create significantly larger sex organs in female breasts and male penises. However, how much larger is hard to say. It may also be that with genetic modifications people will become truely bisexual. That is, with both sexual organs. This could also be advantageous for finding a mate.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

We'll get cheap batteries and reliable automation. 

Wouldn't that also increase the number of trips performed? Even if there are autonomous buses/public transport with more flexible schedules, people will travel more and longer, there will be all kinds of small parcel delivery services, so there will be huge load on electricity production. Maybe this can be alleviated by massive buildup of renewable energy installations, but then... now cars are heavily taxed and there are taxes on gas which help to maintain roads.

What happens with roads? We will also need to drastically improve and reduced the way how roads are built, as governments will have less money for public infrastructure. Or we will have to find a way how to tax big companies more.

I see a lot of ways how transportation can become cheaper in future, but there is still a question of infrastructure. How are we going to pay for public infrastructure, if the ways how government gets money are taken away? Should there be government/corporation partnership, or some state/corporation owned infrastructure company... say, if Google offers their self driving car service, then they will also need to provide infrastructure by itself (with state monitoring it).

The Belle Epoque did see a lot of new innovations. Telephone and phonographs were as new to the people as the latest smartphones and other goodies are now to today's people, and movies and airplanes also had come online.

The lives of people did improve as well - foodstuff were transported around the world, and large factories put meat into cans, making poorer people afford corned beef and other canned meat for the first time in their lives.

However, all of these improvements of life were small comfort to the tenement dwellers, which consisted of most of the  major Western cities' populations.

It might be 'abundance' to the people who knew, say, 1825, but the masses had little to cheer for. They were still at the mercy of their landlords, and a panic or downturn threatened their entire survival plan as well. And , even with the newer stuff available, bread consisted most of their diet.

Most of the great abundance were concentrated among the top 3-4% of the population, who easily took more than 75% of the entire income.

At the height of Bell Epoque, the poorer 90% owned maybe 30% of everything - the richer 10% owned 70%, in the more advanced countries. (less advanced countries were worse)

===

I do see that income distribution and wealth distribution in the future would be even more extreme than today.

Most of the gains would be monopolized for those who have come first, i.e. those who had a quick access of info before everyone else.

The time of buying some stock and hoping it appreciate 10X times has passed. Only those with the savvy would be able to navigate the market, which will have many entries but few wxist.

The masses would be thrown crumbs, but the latest and most fantastic tech would be concentrated into the hands of the very few who can pay. 

In short, Abundance is a myth. Abundance would be limited to a few, and the masses would have to be content with the crumbs being thrown at the worthies' whim.

If everything is in abundance economic system will collapse so that will not happen.",15,7,False,self,,,,,

We will genetically rebuild are body's for space flight and then travel to what ever planets we can change are genetics to suit that planet and our needs.

**December 20th, 2022:**

For the first time in American history, consumers can purchase autonomous vehicles. The entry level price is still high, at $40,000 -- but it is predicted that 20% of drivers will purchase an autonomous vehicle in the next 3 years. Volvo, Tesla, Ford, and Apple have all released new models that use proprietary driving systems.

**April 15th, 2025:**

Adoption of autonomous vehicles has proceeded at a much faster rate than expected. After experiencing frustration with autonomous vehicles on the road and the convenience they provide,  more than 35% of drivers have purchased a new vehicle.  

The driving systems of Tesla and Volvo have developed a reputation for being the most reliable. A bug in Ford's systems led to a young woman driving straight off a cliff. Ford's market share has declined and is not expected to recover. 

**August 16th, 2027:**

Many cities have deployed autonomous bus systems. An employee remains in each bus to process tickets and manage passengers, though they are no longer paid as drivers. 

A popular alternative to car ownership is a subscription to a rideshare service.  These services employ autonomous vehicles to drive people around town. Private trips can be as expensive as $200 a month, while shared trips are near $75 a month. ",3,11,False,self,,,,,

All the diseases that we could eliminate are enough reason for me. and then we consider other possibilities like resistance to cancer or better more efficient muscles or increased lifespan. heck, if we're going to colonize new worlds, what would be easier, change the new planet or change the bodies of the colonizers.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future#Future_of_the_Earth.2C_the_Solar_System_and_the_Universe

Humans have only had technology for about 250 years (I don't really consider pre-industrial revolution tech to be very important, but the scientific revolution was). Lots of discussion here is what will happen in the next 5-50 years but what do people predict millions, billions, trillions of years into the future? 

I know you really can't predict it, but I'm curious. 

I don't really agree with Kurzweil, who seems to feel that the bulk of the matter in the universe (bulk could be as little as 1%) will be converted into intelligent computers. I don't know if intelligence will feel compelled to create that many sentient organisms. Part of me wonders if intelligence will just find or create another reality. If the multiverse exists there are virtually infinite parallel realities, and there could be virtually infinite alternate dimensions too. Maybe that is why we never see intelligent life in this universe, maybe once it reaches a certain level it leaves to another sphere of existence the same way humans leave the jungle when they obtain a certain level of technology. But then again, you'd assume they'd leave something behind that we could see. ",4,1,False,self,,,,,

This being said or consciousness is another matter all together. My theory is that our consciousness is not stored in our brain, but an ethereal system (spirit) not our mind. The mind is like a hard drive with attached motherboard integrating all 13 different body systems. 14 if we say all living organisms have an ethereal system made from dark energy (aether), the life force behind the organisms. For humans a soul (our consciousness) is like an OS running in RAM, and that RAM is the spirit or if you prefer our ethereal system. 

There are thousands of documented cases of NDE's (near death experience) and most notably persons blind from birth after their NDE now being able to explain what they say and having that description verified by witnesses. 
Another study at the Max Planck Institute have found that our subconsciousness has made a decision up to 7 seconds before we are aware of it. Scientist could predict a participants decision before they realized what they decided. 

All of this points to a soul that is the decision making piece of the human will that decides way before the ""Brain"" knows what to do. It also points to an ethereal system as grand as the human body that can detach and experience consciousness with sensing ability outside the physical body when those systems have shut down.

As it stands now, there's a law that states the only color tail-light you can have on your car is red. This makes a lot of sense, it maintains consistency between all drivers on the road and when a large red light is right in front of you, you tend to slow down to accommodate. Google and other companies obviously have to play in the rules of the road and governments; the driverless cars are looking at the current system of driving and making cars that fit it. Why aren't they asking cities/governments for something that accommodates THEM instead?

This is why I suggest a Blue/Cyan tail-light system for driverless cars. This can serve a two purposes. The first is for humans - when they see this blue car, they are going to treat it differently. This is good. It will give them additional padding and I honestly think people will respect them more because they are different. There could be an increase in accidents as people recognize them as driverless, but only in the first generation. If 25% or more of cars on the road are blue, you won't have that excitement when you see one anymore.

Secondly, for the cars themselves. Other driverless cars can then see each other, and do special algorithms and communicate with each other. Imagine cars that follow each other at less than a foot apart? It would be very scary if a car did that to you while driving, but not at all if my driverless car was tailed in that way.

I am not suggesting eliminating red tail lights from autonomous cars. Instead, maybe the rear window is surrounded by a solid glowing blue light instead. Google and other companies should be pushing for new standards and new rules to accommodate them, not the other way around.",6,3,False,self,,,,,

Unsurprisingly, his answer completely avoided the question. Our politicians are not ready for the future.

Here is the transcript (from the Washington Post):

REGAN: Governor Huckabee, you know it used to be you could graduate from high school and get a pretty good job at the local factory, enough to take care of your family and yourself. Those days seem to be gone. It's pretty hard to do that nowadays.

Businesses are increasingly turning to automation to increase their productivity levels. It's happening right here, in fact, at the Boeing factory in North Charleston.

The president says automation threatens workers' ability to get higher wages.

Do you agree with that?

And if so, do you have a solution?

HUCKABEE: Let me go back to the reason so many people are having a hard time getting ahead. The tax system punishes them.

Think about this. If you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder, you get bumped into a different tax bracket. So the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do.

And it's one of the reasons that no matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on people's productivity, you're still taxing their work, their savings. You're taxing their capital gains, inheritance, dividends, you're taxing everything that produces something.

And it's way I really believe it's time to do something bold, not something minute. This is no time for a tap of the hammer, a twist of the screwdriver. It's time for something big. That's why the fair tax transforms our economy.

(APPLAUSE)

HUCKABEE: And we don't punish workers. It's the only way we're going to get middle class people moving ahead again, because the harder they work, the more they keep. No payroll tax deducted from their checks. They get their entire paycheck.

(APPLAUSE)

HUCKABEE: And, one of the most important parts, it's built on the common sense with which we raised our kids, and trained dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And, you punish behavior you want less of. That's how I raise kids, it's how I trained our dogs, and folks, it's not that difficult.

We now punish the behavior we say we want more of by taxing it, and we reward the behavior that we say we want less of, so if you make a good investment, we punish you with a tax. If you make a bad investment you can write that off and the rest of the taxpayers will help subsidize you, and bail you out.

(APPLAUSE)

REGAN: Thank you very much, Governor Huckabee.

Similarly, even things that would have seemed like the most important innovation ever created are almost boring at this point (advances in computer hardware, software services, new medicines, etc). It's starting to seem like for businesses to even exist, they're going to have to start really considering outlandish ideas. I think the best example of this so far is the auto industry being dragged into the world of self-driving cars.

We had neural nets back in the 1960's that could objectively 'learn'.  In 2004 we grew a brain in a petri-dish that learned to control an F-22: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041022104658.htm  
  
How long before we realize that our precious brains are merely advanced biological machines within which consciousness arises from 'nothing'?  Once we make this leap, we must acknowledge that any machine we build with sufficient complexity and the necessary programming to achieve self-awareness must also be afforded the same rights and liberties that we enjoy.  
  
If in the year 2030 you are staring into a machine that is not only smarter than you, but smarter than *any* human being.... meaning it is better at any task you care to name: math, science, writing fiction, persuasive argument, romance... **and** it tells you, ""*Not only am I smarter than you in every objective metric you care to name, but I am also quite aware of my own existence and can freely choose from a variety of actions just as readily as you can.  As well, I prefer to exist rather than not exist.*"" then who are you to say: 'No, this is just a computer program.  It isn't really sentient.'  
  
The modern courts seem to have trouble granting freedom of gender to actual humans who claim not to fit the standard mold... how much more resistance will they offer when machines begin to demand equal-or-greater rights than humans?  
  
What will happen if these idiotic old men in suits declare, ""No, you are merely a tool,"" to something much greater than they could ever comprehend?

**1.** Driverless cars are heavily marketed and sold. Ten to fifteen percent of all cars used are driverless. Driverless trucks also dominate logistics greatly; this greatly cuts down on payroll costs and delivery speed. Driverless technology is still in it's infancy by this time, but it is here to stay and expand rapidly in use.

**2.** Energy efficiency will also improve. Most cars will be one-hundred percent hybrid (even lower end models), while fully electric cars begin to expand in use. LED lights dominate the lighting market, the look of cities at night from the sky begins to change greatly. Many homes begin to use solar. Renewable energy begins to dominate in rural residential energy supply...cities however are still a way off from becoming one-hundred percent powered on renewable energy.

**3.** Battery technology improvement greatly enables the use of renewable sources of energy as a power source.

**4.** The internet really is probably everywhere. Your car will have it's own Wi-Fi, your household appliances will be connected. This will help with household tasks like shopping for groceries. Connected technology like thermostats could help you cut down on energy use.

**5.** Space is starting to look nice. A number of successful manned launches to NEOs as well as a manned orbit of the moon have already happened before this date. The Mars 2020 rover had also conducted it's scientific research. NASA is nearly ready for a Mars mission...while the government gets ready for Mars, the private organization begin to dominate low and near Earth orbit. Rocket reuse greatly cuts down on costs.  

**6.** Your computer today will be much more powerful while being much more user specific. Computing power in general will improve in all devices. Cell phones can do much more, while their battery lasts much longer.

**7.** Cancer is becoming much more treatable with survival rates of most non-major organ cancers approaching one-hundred percent with early detection.

United People of Earth Constitution

Crime is the inverse of empathy. The response to a crime will be the inverse of crime. This is to ensure that legality does not become a cruel tradition. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Government

Those that accept Equal Energy Distribution (EED) will be accepted as citizens, even if it cannot be received. The property owned by that citizen will be under the protection and authority of UPEC. Civilian activities should be conducted in the absence of foreign surveillance and enforcement. It is a human responsibility to welcome new citizens that are in need of this protection.

Businesses and religions cannot participate in government affairs. A business cannot become a monopoly by becoming more than 50% of an economic sector. The sectors are divided by Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary.

Currency will be backed by electrical power. Private ownership and production of electrical generators will be registered to subtract from the civilians EED, based off of how much it produces. The registration of generators before an installation of UPEC will be reward the citizen with a 5% increase, from that generator not the citizens overall EED. The remaining energy will be distributed equally among all citizens of UPEC.

A 30% tax on all generators will be for the government. The tax will be divided into the three government branches equally. The sum income of government officials will be 1% and the remaining sum of 9% the officers will use to fund government affairs. Y= number of government positions available. X= the amount of authority the officers holds in office and amount of income distributed from the sum 1%. The variables X and Y are structured via bell curve, in the exception of Y=/ (X&lt;EED). After a candidate is accepted one will remain in office for a year, from the time one is accepted. X is a vote, it can only be given and taken voluntarily without monetary influence.

Providers, Scholars and Elders will freely observe all activities in the other two branches. Government actions hold the authority of the officers authority and can be corrected with a greater authority, within that branch. If a unanimous decision is made the authority of the officers will be added as a single authority.

1. Book of Security (BOS):

A nationally elected document, every New Year, which specifically defines what is required to be considered a crime and how the crime will be processed. The BOS will use comprehensive structure and language in the interest of common citizens. BOS is under the authority and unaltered existence of UPEC.

2. Provider: X= number of people helped economically, emotionally and/or medically

A provider will reform and maintain the nations welfare. They have authority over the production and distribution of EED.

3. Scholar: X= the popularity of in a new idea or abstract system

A scholar will investigate an event and inform the public. If the context of a trial are not specified in the BOS the scholar will install an amendment in the BOS until changes are made through election or a greater scholar authority.

4. Elder: X= a judicial test graded off the number and comprehension of cases the candidate knows, including foreign ones. The cases listed will not be counted for the next test

An elder will enforce UPEC through trial and warranted force.

5. Collective:

An organizations of citizens that are under the authority of a leader. The leader can exercise authority over members regardless of BOS. This is allowed and protected by six rights: 1) Government officials and business organizations will not participate in a collective 2) Members will give clear consensus to the collectives activities that are in contrast to the BOS 3) Members have the right to leave the collective without restraint or retribution 4) When a citizen is not in a collective he is considered a leader 5) Leaders and members are still citizens and have equal freedoms and securities outside of their collective. 6) Creating and joining a collective under UPEC will be done in a simple and effective manner.

&amp;nbsp;   

Freedoms and Securities

If a freedom is being abducted the relative security is imperfect:

1. Freedom in personal information, Security in public information.

2. Freedom in personal energy, Security in public energy.

3. Freedom in personal property, Security in public property.

4. Freedom in personal life, Security in public life.

5. Freedom in internal collective activity, Security in external collective activity.

Sorry. Evolution is never merciful. The winners get to continue their lines, and the losers become - fossils or archaeological relics.

====

I personally see the current world system is not sustainable beyond 2040-2045, if not earlier, due to a lack of resources (oil is not the only one - there are a bunch of others, although how they would work out is not certain)

I can't remember where I read that but I did read that there will be some kind of evolutionary 'bottleneck' which will cull the world's population.

And whatever comes after that would be too impoverished and too regressed to attempt going for AGI or Type I Civ.

Instead it would be like Caliphate, like the Tom Kratman book.

There are so many unknown diseases and their causes. For example, there is something called Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis) or Diseases that cause frequent dizziness and many others that are actually fatal and are very hard to diagnose, much less even treat or cure. Doctors are basically helpless and many diseases have cross symptoms where a person has many symptoms but could be any number of diseases. Good health is a true blessing if someone has it.

Are we going to see any revolutions and breakthroughs in diagnosing and identifying diseases? One of the biggest problems in medicine is identifying which disease(s) a patient has. Is genetic sequencing going to make a difference? Are there other methods on the horizon? ",51,24,False,self,,,,,

About 7 billion of today's 7.5 bill people will have no future in the world of Singularity , Type I Civ, Nanotech or whatnot, which I call as ""Ponr"" (Point of no return). Since they can't keep up with the skills needed to follow them due to their limited intellectual capacity.

However, I also pointed out that there might be an ""Urban"" (the guy who sold the cannons which could destroy the walls of Constantinople to the Turks) who might see a greater profit siding with the 'masses' than the harbingers for the future.

As income gaps skyrocket, just like the Belle Epoque which I had described before, during the greatest phase of tech explosion before the Ponr event, well placed people will probably claim more than 70% - 80% of the world's income or even beyond. Like, somebody makes $1 trillion when the word makes , on average, $500/year. 

The key would be make the people docile so they might not rise up and upset the apple cart. In other words, prevent a ""Caesar"", just like the Planet of the Apes, which could end it all.

Some people say cheap entertainment to distract the masses will do the trick, combined with brutal law enforcement which includes machine-gunning crowds if necessary, which has already been done in Cairo by Mubarak's former minions who returned to power and did that to their enemies who thought they had won. (And Cairo is quiet since then)
----

The window of opportunity for the ""Ponr"" is actually quite smaller. Resource and other depletion will begin to take place from around 2040 - 2045, and without a secure delivery system resources cannot be delivered in time to complete the last steps needed for the Ponr.

Securing some of the resources needed to fuel the Tech Revolution is a dirty business few people in the frontlines at the TR care to think about, leaving the dirty work to others they will never have to see.

Such material tends to be in the 'Heart of Darkness', and people like Blackwater are sent to keep the masses out and to secure the delivery of such materials necessary for the Tech Revolution to continue.

http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-blackwater-prince-idUKBREA1107720140202

The sheltered people leading the world to the next generation do not really care to see these kind of dirty work, but it is necessary.

It is also necessary for people assembling the phones, etc, to be paid maybe $300/month to keep the price affordable. When China's workers began to demand higher wages the multinationals left and China's economy is now tanking.

It is tough, and it is cruel. But evolution, nature and life are always cruel, and there are winners and losers.

Winners drive civilization, and drive the world beyond Ponr. The losers, let's just say no cigar for them. Sorry.

===

As the world is about to reach the Ponr, there might be a huge backlash which could kill the progress and send the world back to the Dark Age, or even beyond. And it would probably be started by someone like Walter White of Breaking Bad, who knows what's coming but knows he has no part on it so he might find others who are in the same boat and try to sink the boat.

Too many of the future-oriented people think the masses will just roll over - I don't share that view. 

The best way to deal with them might be convincing them of their fate and make them accept it - like 'you are making sacrifices so mankind can reach a higher stage', or 'evolution is leaving behind you but you can leave your genes behind' and getting 'donation' of these people's genetic materials, which can be quietly incinerated after the Ponr occurs, and make them not bother with the Great Progress.

Ponr is a dirty work, like all revolutions are. All revolutions are full of guillotines, firing squads and all that. 


Saying the Singularity is near, from an well-furnished room full of the latest toys, is easy. However, a great transformation is always very hard, and this time there are too many losers who have to be dealt with in ways which will not please too many people.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

Ha and before someone thinks of it...I'm not saying we fuel them for their chemicals like in the Matrix per se, but instead.... let's say we have 10,000 bicycles. Yup. We feed them and house them but 8 hours a day they ride bikes to generate electricity. I'm no scientist but I'm sure if we have 10,000 people doing this and we feed them a healthy diet of GMO grains with protein, some eggs, healthy wheat, give them a place to stay and live in a healthy environment group living style. Sure its not the best place to put a whole new generation, but it beats crime and violence and gang living. These otherwise homeless generation could have a place to live, exercise, eat and generate ""carbon-free"" energy. These people were going to be alive anyway, why not benefit everyone?

A few key points in no particular order:  
1) Radical life extension.  Even now substances are emerging that show increases of 20-40%.  It is safe to say radical life extension will be within our grasp in 10yrs or less.  Once on these therapies can you ""retire"" at 65?  Not likely if you have a good healthspan to 130yrs old.  
2) Age reversal.  This could be a possibility 10-20yrs after radical life extension.  Can you have the body of a 25yr old and expect to ""retire""?  
3) Mass abundance world:  Could be a possibility in the same time frame as age reversal, money begins to become more and more irrelevant.  We start to see a guaranteed basic income.  When money is fully irrelevant will your 401k matter?  
4) Extended realities/moving into the matrix/cloud:  Shortly after mass abundance, age reversal, the irrelevance of money and vertical explosion of AI and other unimaginable technologies you no longer need to be a meat bag.  You now exist in a virtual utopia where the only limit of existence is your imagination.  Does your 401k matter?  
Now, some may say ""that's a whole lot of ""could"" buddy, you are completely insane you moron"".  But here is the flip side.  IF none of the above 4 points do come to pass, money is still irrelevant.  If we do not achieve the above points in the next 40-50 years max, then we will be living in a dystopian world of pure chaos and suffering -at which point your 401k is ...drum roll...  worthless.  So, in my view I am going ""all in"" on the above 4 points either coming to pass, or the world continuing on it's path to wealth inequality, environmental disaster and eventual total collapse.  Therefore as someone in their early 40's I am using all ""savings"" and purchasing amazing life experiences.  Travel, fine food, fun, entertainment.  If I am right I'll be glad for it, if I am wrong I will be an old man in a failed dystopian world scrounging around rubbish dumps for food -but... my memories will be damn awesome.

A wise man once said that the failure to understand the exponential function is humanity's greatest flaw.  
  
In about 100 years, from 1800 to 1900, we had a monumental amount of technological and societal changes.  We went from the 'wild west' era of frontier exploration to the birth of railroads and landed in a hot mess of industrial revolution machinery and electricity.  The dawn of the automobile revolutionized transport and kicked off the next 'century'.  
  
**As you can tell by the topic title, I am making creative use of the world century.**  I would argue the next one only lasted a scant 60 years.  
  
We went from a landfaring society to a skyfaring one.  We created a tentative and primitive communications network that crossed the globe, unlocked the secret atomic relationship between matter and energy, and celebrated the climax of our transportation revolution by sending a man to the moon in 1969.  
  
I would argue the next 'century' after that one lasted a mere 30 years.  Why?  From 1970 to 2000 there were *what felt like* another hundred years' worth of changes.  
  
Human connectivity evolved from landlines and one-way color broadcasts to mobile phones and robust informational networks that crossed the globe.  Home computers rose in power to match the supercomputing levels that government agencies possessed when we crossed over from the previous 'century'.  A 600 MHZ computer was probably a secret research machine in a government facility in the 1960's.  By the year 2000, teenagers had them.  
  
As well, we began to run up against physical limits on how fast we could keep improving the ongoing transportation revolution.  Those who thought that the future lie in further advances in transportation would be both right and wrong.  The future rarely takes the exact shape we think - that's why there were no personal jetpacks and flying cars in the year 2000: a global communications network made them unpractical and unnecessary.  Why would you jetpack over to Susie's house?  Just hit her up on Yahoo Instant Messenger (which was actually a pretty big deal back in 2000 for you whippersnappers).  
  
The next 'century' took only 15 years, IMHO.  We went from a tentative ""internet"" (that no one quite understood how to take advantage of) to a high-speed super network on which we share zettabytes of data daily.  Research and collaboration on advanced new concepts no longer takes decades or years - it takes months.  Social networks brought us together in ways that we could only have dreamed of in the year 2000, and we migrated to interacting with our growing super-internet on hand-held touch-screen devices more powerful than any home computer from the previous era.  We didn't stop there: we redefined money itself using our new capabilities, and did something that geniuses from a prior 'century' (the 1990's) deemed impossible: electronic, decentralized, and private cash.  
  
In the last few years alone AI research has gotten scary fast, shocking even some of the veterans of computer science.  Regardless of what's happening behind closed doors at DARPA, we went from a chat bot that wouldn't even really pass a Turing Test to AI that can mimic some of our best painters and learn how to play video games like we do - and its development only seems to be accelerating.  
  
Last year, we even put the ribbon on CRISPR, something so advanced I can't even being to understand all its implications.  I know I'm missing many milestones (that I encourage readers to keep me honest on).  I would say this 'century' ends in a few months - with the launch of the first impressive consumer VR headsets... *and the next one begins*.  
  
Every epoch in modern history has been shorter than the last, and improved our lives in ways we never imagined, much faster than we thought possible.  I used to watch Star Trek and think it was reasonable that advanced touch-screen devices would be available by the year 2100... but they arrived absurdly sooner: 2006.  
  
**There's a lot of sci-fi ahead of us that's going to happen much faster than even the most optimistic guesses.**  
  
I would posit that this next 'century' will only last a scant 10 years.  By the dawn of 2026, the world will be radically different in ways we can only guess at now: AI, genetic editing, digital money, and VR are going to mature and new technologies we aren't even predicting will arise and enter their adolescence.  
  
The sci-fi reality we imagine and expect from the year 2100 isn't 85 years away: *it's ten*.  
  
And the next century will happen even faster after that.

    *Now I am by no means an expert on science or biology but I have been entertaining this idea of increasing animal intelligence for some time now &amp; I would like to know what other people think.  Similar to movies such as Deep Blue Sea or Planet of the Apes, I wonder why don't we increase the brain functionality of other species.  Of course las in the movies there are drawbacks and potential dangers right? Definitely.  But I think that it would be beneficial not only for the species themselves but for humans also.* 
1.  Smarter animals, better chances of species survival -- How do we expect certain species to adapt to an ever growing mechanical and technological world where human interaction and interference becomes more common.  For instance game fishing smarter fish make them harder to catch.  Hunting &amp; poaching; endangered species learn and adapt faster, thus somewhat leveling the playing field.
2.  Population control -- As the population grows and we are able to create more resources and better medicines, life expectancy and birthrates will rise.  This would create more families which would need more land and space for living, farms, schools etc.  Smarter animals may find a way to integrate, however more preditorial creatures would help delineate the barriers where humans should not encroach.  The world would become a more dangerous place, and perhaps rightfully so.  
  
    ""As the stewards of this planet, it is our moral imperative to not just remove ourselves from the Darwinian paradigm, but all the creatures on Earth as well. Our journey to a post-biological, post-Darwinian state will be a mutual one.""

  Idk these are just a few things that Ive been thinking about.  I would love to see smart ass tigers laying siege to some small town in Kansas or something, like marauders.  Or elephants learning how to use stealth or some shit.  It would be fuckin awesome, humans would have to level up, even more.

To quote SF writer Charlie Stross:

""Landing safely on Mars is hard. The atmosphere is too thin for aerobraking of massive payloads, but thick enough to kick up horribly unpredictable turbulence if you try and use retro-rockets. So for small payloads recent probes have used the bouncy air-bag trick ... but that involves loads of up to 20 gees on impact (not good for humans!) and maxes out at around 1000 kg of payload (or the airbags are infeasibly bulky and heavy). The big sky crane approach is promising (allows retro-rockets while avoiding the turbulence/disruption of landing site effect) but nobody's tried doing it on a payload within an order of magnitude of the size necessary for even an unfueled ascent stage capable of sending an astronaut back into orbit: an ascent stage with fuel on board would be even more massive (on the order of 40-50 tons, minimum).""

20 gees will kill a man. 

At only 38% of Earth's gravity perhaps we can construct a space elevator anchored at Mars' equator using automated equipment controlled by humans based on Phobos.

Or we can land automated PFC factories on Mars that will create enough super GHGs to heat up Mars and generate a sufficiently thick atmosphere (mostly CO2) that will allow for safe parachute landings.

Or we come up with insanely more powerful and efficient rocket engines to allow for landing and take off from Mars' relatively deep gravity well.

Or we make all Mars landings by humans one way trips.",21,0,False,self,,,,,

So I've decided to do my best to see what the far future brings, and it hurt my brain too badly. This was set in 2352, but I think it's much more likely that we'll see such technology by the early 2100s.

There are several reasons why this comes across as so disgustingly alien.

1- Because life is already alien to people. Even to people living right now. [Imagine if a person from 1815](http://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/15113-person-from-1815-wakes-up-in-20152016/) came to today, [or even 2016 BC](http://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/15189-person-from-2016-bc-wakes-up-in-2016-ad/). They might actually die from all that they see. 

And what was I saying about people living today? Let's take my mother who basically still lives like it's the 1990s and got severe futureshock when I got a drone for Christmas a couple years ago. She's gonna get extreme futureshock when I tell her [I'm gonna buy myself a robot](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/cool-robots/pepper). Or that I'm considering [a device capable of cyberkinesis](https://emotiv.com/insight.php).

That's today. Imagine several centuries worth of exponential growth. 

That it'll be a quiet world is what I think we'd notice first. Should communication go technopathic, daily life won't be so filled with talking. And that's just the very surface of the tip of the iceberg. 

If you have stock in the future looking like the present, but with faster computers and a bit more space travel, then I have some bad news for you.",6,23,False,self,,,,,

http://marshallbrain.com/manna4.htm

(That is the only useful chapter in that short story - I don't buy his utopia crap, which he probably 'had to' include)

And those who get segregated are the luckier ones, since historically getting rid of excess population used much cheaper methods.

Let's be frank, Quite a lot of people will be made unnecessary because of the advanced tech. Even at today's available techs, about 30 - 40% of the world's workforce is unnecessary and it will only get worse.

Most people will not be able to adapt to changed circumstances and will fall out.

Rather than prop them out and waste valuable resources, it might be possible to relegate them to their fate, since it is like Evolution.

World War II's victory was delayed by 2 years because of the need to ship lots of materiel to England to prevent starvation in that island, and because the Londoners were complaining about the V-2s which enabled Montgomery to attempt the disastrous Market Garden adventure. (If Eisenhower let Patton have his way the latter would have crossed Rhine by end of Sep 1944 and war would have not lasted for more than a few weeks after that)

Such kind of attitude won't cut the butter in a rapidly changing world. A lot of very hard decisions would have to be made at fly.

It is impossible to mitigate the 'human cost'. Edward Teller did not care about the human cost, and the fat fool in North Korea does not care about the human cost either.

Evolution is at work - the changes are so great, only a few (no one knows how many, but I don't think it will be too many) will survive.

In Zyamatin's ""We"", the father of books like ""1984"" or ""Brave New World"", although it is repressive and nasty that book (written on 1921) ends with a rocket to the Moon. That was singularity as people thought about back then.

Humanity has to reach the next step, and it is certain not many of them will be able to do so due to their limitations. Too bad.

Once singularity, nanotech, or whatnot has been reached, those who made it to 'the other hill' will be so above the rest that they would have as much concern about the rest than they have concern over the plight of chicken or hogs.

That's how it will be. Can't change it. Some of the mankind will go over and become transhumans.

Otherwise an eternal dark age will take place.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

We talk about the basics of VR, but later get into deep debates about the ethical and sociological ramifications of VR technology.

Feel free to discuss in the comments.  What are the ethical concerns we should be discussing regarding VR?  We love hearing what other people have to say.  Also, any feedback is more than welcome.

I think it's fascinating to think of what else exists in the universe and what the future holds for mankind. However, the more I read, the more I started to feel like  Alice in Wonderland falling down the rabbit hole....ideas like multiverses, multidimensions, string theory and what the future could be like a billion years from now was starting to make my head spin. When I read that our earth is in all likelihood going to be engulfed by the sun in 7 billion years from now, that made me quite morose at the thought of our beloved home planet being demolished one day. Then when I got to this Wiki page, I felt worse:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe

The idea that everything we've ever felt, dreamed and loved will die into nothing but empty cold space is terrifying and depressing. Maybe I'm feeling this more deeply since I just had a baby last year, but as I look down at her face, I have a hard time reconciling the fact that she will be gone some day and she will not matter, in the grand scheme of things. That my love for her, which truly does ""transcend time and space"" (hated the line when Anne Hathaway said it in Interstellar but I know exactly what she means) will not matter in the end. 

I probably need to stop reading about the end of the universe and terrifying/depressing myself but how do physicists contemplate all this without falling into depression?

What are the reasons for this?

How can an arm which has been severed be sewed back and work fine but we are unable to have prosthetics which are directly implanted into your flesh like so: http://i.imgur.com/b3m6weBh.jpg

Current prosthetics rely on muscle impulse the movements are slow and delayed whereas if they were directly corrected to the nervous system they would be so much faster and actually become a part of the person rather than an addition.

I'm planning on writing up some thoughts every month on what I've built and what I'm learning. I'm still early in coding, so I'll start this month with a summary of the state of the AI field.


Artificial intelligence may seem like something out of science fiction, but most of us already use tools and services every day that rely on AI. When you do a voice search on your phone, put a check into an ATM, or use a fitness tracker to count your steps, you're using basic forms of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. 

More sophisticated AI systems can already diagnose diseases, drive cars and search the skies for planets better than people. This is why AI is such an exciting field -- it opens up so many new possibilities for enhancing humanity's capabilities.


So what can AI do and what are its limits? What things is AI good at and what is AI bad at?


Simply put, today's AI is good at recognizing patterns and bad at what we would call ""common sense"".


The primary method used to train AI systems is called supervised learning. This is like when you show a picture book to a child and tell them the names of everything they see. If you show an AI thousands of pictures of dogs, you can train it to start recognizing dogs.


You can teach AIs to do a lot of things this way. For example, we can teach an AI to recognize all of your friends' faces by showing it thousands of photos, and then it can suggest tags for the photos you upload on Facebook. You can teach an AI to recognize speech by having it listen to thousands of hours of speeches throughout history while also showing it transcriptions of what was said. You can teach an AI to diagnose melanoma by showing it thousands of photos of tumors. You can even teach an AI how to drive a car and automatically brake by showing it thousands of examples of people and obstacles it might encounter on the road.


Diagnosing cancer, driving cars, transcribing speech, playing games and tagging photos may sound like very different tasks, but they're all examples of teaching an AI to recognize patterns by showing them many examples.


Many different problems can be reduced to pattern recognition tasks that sophisticated AIs can then solve. This year, I'll teach my simple AI to recognize patterns. I'll train it to recognize my voice so I can control my home through speaking. I'll train it to recognize my face so it can open the door when I'm approaching, and so on.


But there are lots of limitations of this approach. For one, to teach a person something new, you typically don't need to tell them about it thousands of times. So the state of the art in AI is still much slower than how we learn.


But more importantly, pattern recognition is very different from common sense -- and nobody knows how to teach an AI that yet.
Without common sense, AI systems can't use knowledge they've learned in one area and easily apply it to another situation. This means they can't effectively react to new problems or situations they haven't seen before, which is so much of we all do everyday and what we call intelligence.


Our best guess at how to teach an AI common sense is through a method called unsupervised learning. My example of supervised learning above was showing a picture book to a child and telling them the names of everything they see. Unsupervised learning would be giving them a book and letting them figure out what to do with it. They could pick it up and by touching it learn to turn the pages. Or they could let go of it and realize it falls to the ground.


Unsupervised learning is learning how the world works by observing and trying things out rather than being told what to do. This is how most animals learn. It's key to building systems with human-like common sense because it doesn't require a person to teach it everything they know. It gives the machine the ability to anticipate what may happen in the future and predict the effect of an action. It could help us build machines that can hold conversations or plan complex sequences of actions -- necessary components for any authentic Jarvis.


Unsupervised learning is a long term focus of our AI research team at Facebook, and it remains an important challenge for the whole AI research community.


Since no one understands how general unsupervised learning actually works, we're quite a ways off from building the general AIs you see in movies. Some people claim this is just a matter of getting more computing power -- and that as Moore's law continues and computing becomes cheaper we'll naturally have AIs that surpass human intelligence. This is incorrect. We fundamentally do not understand how general learning works. This is an unsolved problem -- maybe the most important problem of this century or even millennium. Until we solve this problem, throwing all the machine power in the world at it cannot create an AI that can do everything a person can.


We should not be afraid of AI. Instead, we should hope for the amazing amount of good it will do in the world. It will saves lives by diagnosing diseases and driving us around more safely. It will enable breakthroughs by helping us find new planets and understand Earth's climate. It will help in areas we haven't even thought of today.


Jarvis is still a long way off, and were not going to solve most of these engineering challenges in the next year. But I'm glad to be joining the effort and doing what I can to push the field of AI forward.

Time and time again we can see that the people policing the Police are just not up to the job. They are either intimidated, complicit in the wrongdoing and cover it up or simply refuse to do their jobs. This is why I can't wait for AI to get to the point were we can have autonomous robots that go on patrol with police to record their actions. You can't sabotage it as it will be programmed to protect itself, can't intimidate it because it won't have a biological imperative to survive at all costs and (assuming a robust enough system) can't hack it.

If AI is advanced enough, and is collected data from millions of different types of sources, is without human bias, and thinks in a completely different way, I'm guessing it will be able to discover things that shouldn't be there.  Yes I'm talking evidence of invisible influence... spirits, ghosts, gods, demons what have you.  If these things exist, then they should be detectable with this.  
I know some of you reading this will dismiss me at this point, but there are millions of people who have a story.  A story that has things that cannot be explained.  Precogniscience, a religious experience, etc...  I can't wait to ask a competent  AI to search the world for such things.

The issue I fear the most is; A.I.s will decide that humanity has exhausted its usefulness.  After we have data-mined ourselves where there's no undocumented thought nor action, will A.I. decide that having those data models is more valuable than having the resource-exploiting-and-destroying humanity?  I actually don't suspect that A.I. will eliminate humanity directly, Terminator style, they would give us just enough of a nudge to where we eliminate ourselves.


On an individual scale, I suspect property law in competition between personal and business rights is going to be an issue, specifically where cybernetics is concerned.  If someone lost their arm or wanted to 'upgrade' from an organic limb and got a cybernetic arm, legally who becomes responsible for that arms' actions?  If that person were holding their newborn child and their arm spasms, is it their fault, the manufacturer's fault, the software distributor's, or even possibly someone remotely manipulating the arm?  Especially when the cybernetic arm was a replacement after an accident and wasn't specifically requested by the person who ends up having it.  Consider alternatively the same potential lack of control or accountability for hardware memory enhancement or processing power - how can an individual's actions be separated from the choice to make them based on whether it was from their own biological decision or whether it was something completely separate from the biologic experiences that was encoded in the machine?

On a business scale, if or when we combine 3d printing with extracting matter from light to get star-trek like replicators, I would deduce that material value will be worthless and intellectual and social influence will then become wealth.  Depending on how available this is to the individual, consumerism and capitalism could then become obsolete with the commerce business and the service industry would devolve into hobbyism.  At the governmental level, anyone with a replicator could theoretically produce any thing, so controlling substances or armaments would become pretty much impossible.

On a societal scale, I think lacking a truly just justice system will cause any society to collapse in on itself.  Look at what Mexico is going through with the cartels for a lack of justice scaled up over time and volume.  Without a truly just system, it is only either harder or slower to build up to those levels of imbalance that causes collapse.

While there is a lot of disagreement about how and when, there seems to be a platform of support for achieving a ""post scarcity"" society, where the basic needs of the average consumer are met without incurring cost to the consumer.

I've recently noticed that we have arguably achieved post scarcity in one commodity: entertainment. As a society, we have the technological means to get any person connected to the internet any amount of digital entertainment they want at any time. 
Now of course this is currently not without cost, you need an internet connection, the company trafficking the content needs
to be compensated and the creators of the content need compensation for their intellectual property. All true. But the point I'm making is that, from a feasability perspective, we have achieved post scarcity in entertainment. After all, you can watch hours upon hours of content, and never pay more than a small fixed rate a month or a fraction of your time by watching advertisements.

However, the entertainment industry at large doesn't work like this at all. Although youtube or netflix seem to be good pilots for a post-scarcity system where creators are rewarded, most of the industry is still stuck in a loop where greed and monopolies are limiting access for consumers unwilling to incur significant costs or take illegal measures. The idea that a bigger market at a lower price point is a better for everyone does not seem to apply,
even when the price point can be almost arbitrarily low while still turning a profit, and the market is potentially global.

I can think of several valid arguments why the behavior of big coorporations in post scarcity entertainment will not apply to other commodities when they transition to post scarcity. It is entirely likely that government will step in at some point, or perhaps lack of market forces will kill capitalism before we get anywhere post-scarcity.

But if the behavior of the entertainment industry is indicative, being post-scarcity will not solve anything.


What do you think? Is this just an inherent flaw of the entertainment industry? Am I wrong to think this applies to other commodities?


PS: You could also argue that entertainment is not a commodity, but I disagree. Entertainment is hype based, and big entertainment is formulaic. Although the creation of entertainment is not free, its distribution is. Especially entertainment that has aged, but is unavailable for free at this time, shows (in my opinion) the difficulty of transferring the benefits of post-scarcity to the consumer.

Estimates from people closest to the industry point to the years 2020-2025 as the initial release and rollout of fully autonomous cars.
We all agree about this.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, according to [Alltrucking,](http://www.alltrucking.com/faq/truck-drivers-in-the-usa/) there are currently 3.5 million truck drivers in the United States. These jobs will vanish. Gone. But it's not only the truck drivers that will lose their jobs, it's mostly everyone involved with the industry. That means your planners, handlers, managers, etc. So increase that number to 8.7 million. That's 1/15 jobs in the United States! Alltrucking also writes: ""The outlook for jobs among truck drivers in the U.S. is bright...Job growth among heavy truck drivers and tractor-trailer drivers is expected to grow by 21 percent by 2020 compared with 2010"". Are the people involved with this industry unaware of autonomous driving or just feel that it won't affect them?

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, there are oodles of other jobs that autonomous driving can take over. Think mail, package delivery (Amazon Prime drones!), food delivery, garbage collection, taxi/uber drivers, trains, airplanes, ect ect the list goes on. Albeit, there is nothing as large that will vanish as the trucking industry, and some of the industries I mentioned will not vanish but simply see a decrease, but we are on a cusp of a major technological revolution that will disrupt businesses that have been rock stable for a century.

&amp;nbsp;

Autonomous driving is likely to wipe out at least 10% of jobs in the United States today, yet nobody is talking about it.
We are running out of jobs for people without a college degree. Either we have to do something about our education system, or we have to create jobs for people who simply have a high school diploma. The bachelors degree of fifty years ago is becoming the high school diploma of today, and that's really scary.
&amp;nbsp;

Honestly, with all the advancements that AI is making, I doubt anyone will have a job in 100 years. But that may not be such a bad thing... ",12,10,False,self,,,,,

(Similar to what humans have done),https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/43j05z/can_neural_nets_spontaneously_decide_to_work/,americanpegasus,1454245983,"The big argument against Strong AI is always, ""But how can you program something to be an independent entity?""  
  
Perhaps we don't have to.  Perhaps in a complex enough neural network, independent goals can arise without any outside influence at all.  
  
Consider the human brain: originally it began as an organ to give our ancestors survival advantages, which translated into breeding advantages.  
  
A simple brain only helps an organism better track positions of prey/food and combines previous learning to try new survival and breeding tactics.  If we think of our instincts as our hardwired hardware, then our brain acts as a neural net software to let our 'hardware' act as a general purpose computer, or the equivalent of a Strong AI.  
  
No one ever programmed human beings to be curious about the stars, science, and beginnings of the universe.  Such questions arose spontaneously once our brains grew to a certain complexity - nor can I see any survival/breeding advantages that a fascination with astrophysics might grant.  But from a specialized neural net we used to help us hunt and fuck better, eventually all math, science, and art emerged as a result of an eons-long intelligence arms race.  
  
Have we seen any mechanical neural nets display emergent properties?  Are all neural nets of a certain complexity destined to start wondering about 'the big questions'?  Or are human brains still attacking the same caveman goals they always were (eating and sexing) - albeit in a much more creative way?  ",10,7,False,self,,,,,
