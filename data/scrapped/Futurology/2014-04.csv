What if we developed trucks that moved at low speed (ideally using driverless technology). Because they move at such low speed (5-10 mph) they'll use energy at a very low rate.  Solar panels and battery packs could power them.

Moving at this slow speed, they could cross the country in 2-3 weeks on the existing highway system.  When they get to there destination, they are unloaded on to traditional trucks for the rest of their delivery.

The slow speed would only be a hindrance at the beginning, once they start arriving, the rate they arrive at could be the same as today.  Obviously, this doesn't work for perishables, but for everything else... this would be a no gas way to ship stuff.",12,3

Say we actually live in a post-singularity world. If you take for granted our indefinite life spans and technology, you're sentenced to 80 years (a fleeting moment in our long life spans) of this simulated reality. 

In this reality you are born into a pre-singularity world and learn to appreciate the world we really do live in as the world moves towards singularity in the simulation.

The more people who see this, the more interesting these answers and conversations become. Thank you!

I'm honestly curious how people feel about this.

With the Internet alone, we have more connection across the globe today than ever before. Events in one country are quickly news in another, and people are more able to speak up for what they believe in.

Is it time to try something new? Instead of spending another day at work for the ever-inflating dollar, we could gather together and create a new democracy, one founded on our ever-changing technologies and ever-adapting life. There is no need for hierarchy among people. We are a collective self, not just individuals.

Is it time to finally say ""Your money means nothing"" and walk away from this mess of a society? Are we such slaves that we feel we can't do so? There is nothing stopping us. With the technology we have available today, we can build a truly connected global society.

Is it time to make that change? It isn't about demanding change from representatives or creating new laws. We need no representatives in a truly connected society, and laws are failed attempts at restrictions on natural human behavior. It's about collecting our knowledge and helping one another for the benefit of all, and it's not out of reach.

This isn't just a decision for an individual to make; it's collective, and it has already started. Do you want to be part of this decision?
It's only a matter of time before enough people share this point of view, so I ask, are we as humanity ready for this? Are we ready to be free?

It's not about changing the world. We are the world changing. We have the technology. All we need is the support of each other.

These movies and projects explain much better than I do. It's quite a bit, but it's worth the time:

With that being said, I dont think were very close to be living in the Jetsons era.  No one seems to know where to start with flying cars, I've heard of fusion, and maybe going the helicopter route, but (and please correct me if Im wrong) wouldn't it be wiser to put massive amounts of money into gravity research?  I mean gravity is EVERYWHERE, so to me at least it would make sense to learn as much about gravity as possible, and to even put forth the research/time/money to learn how to mimic or control gravity.

I was watching cosmos earlier this week and they were talking about gravity and how its everywhere there looking in space, so I got to thinking, lets learn as much as possible on gravity.  I mean I know we understand gravity but then again... maybe we don't.",3,2

I believe I have corresponded with some of you previously and as you may know, I have anxiety about the future, possibly an extreme anxiety as it is always on my mind. The biggest thing being my career in the future. 

My profession of choice is Firefighter/EMT and I am just entering the field. I have planned all my life to do this (I am still relatively young; early 20's) but now I'm realizing that I may not make it to retirement due to technology replacing me (look at the navy firefighter posted earlier). So, here I am, back to square one. I will continue on this FF/EMT road until I do get replaced, but I want a backup plan for when that does happen. Any ideas? 

I plan on going back to school to either finish my associates or bachelors (haven't decided I don't take much interest to anything offered or the classroom setting). I figure it would be best to try to find a future proof back up plan but I have yet to find one. 

My problem is that I like to be outside, out and about. I have looked into programming, CS, circuitry, or  something of the like but those are mostly all indoor jobs. I just want to be prepared none the less, whether I like it or not. 

So, any suggestions? What is your future proof job? If I do go back to school, what would be the best field to get into? 

As always, thanks for any thoughts and suggestions! You all are a helpful community!

*Sorry for the wall 

Edit: for what it's worth, I have tried to teach myself programming and lost interest fairly quickly. Perhaps I should try again and force myself to learn. ",2,2

143,2014-4-5,2014,4,5,6,228487,An artificially intelligent board of advisors for your startup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/228487/an_artificially_intelligent_board_of_advisors_for/,alexberman1,1396647496,"Once artificial intelligence gets to a point where it can learn and take data in, we should be able to make artificial personalities based on historical figures. Eventually, Well be able to use those artificial personalities as a board of advisors to solve business and life problems.

Imagine youre in advertising -- you have a tough problem and, using this system, youre able to use David Ogilvy for advice -- one of the greatest advertisers of all time.

The system would work by taking digitized writing from Ogilvy: all his books, writings and letters, download them into the system, and then use the artificial intelligence to convert all that knowledge into a personality that will be able to give advice and solve problems.

In the beginning, before the AI gets too advanced, itll be possible to fake a working prototype by having keywords in a users question point to stories from Ogilvys past writing.

Say youre at an advertising agency and youre working with a dental company to brand toothpaste. Once the system is in place, youd go to your artificial Ogilvy and speak to him. Youd say something like Ogilvy, I have an advertising problem. Im working with a toothpaste manufacturer whose sales are going down, and they want to target a younger demographic. Have you ever dealt with anything similar?

And Ogilvy, in phase one, would search his database to come up with a story to tell you. For instance, he might talk about when he worked with Crest on a similar campaign, and how his creative process played out along with some pitfalls he experienced.

That would only be phase one.

Once the artificial intelligence gets more advanced, say 5 to 10 years out, it should be possible to take questions the user inputs, compare them to stories from each historical figure's past, and add modern knowledge to the answers.

So instead of Ogilvy talking about an ad that he actually ran, the system will be able to read his writings and then translate that into a tailored solution. The AI will be able to take the above story about Crest, and automatically relate it to mobile technologies, UI design, and other features that never existed in his time, but that he can pick up using the artificial learning system.

It might seem like a futuristic idea, but the cool thing about using  AI to solve problems is that computers have the potential to work and think way harder than any human.

Once a system is invented that can solve problems using artificial intelligence, youll be able to have two of them working together to solve current problems, including using basic AI to invent more advanced artificial intelligence.

Creating a digital collection of the world's best people

Once the computers can communicate with each other, having a single Ogilvy or Isaac Newton that you can talk to about problems and use as an advisor would only be the start.

The end goal is to have a collection of them.

Imagine your startup being advised by Isaac Newton, Abraham Lincoln, Steve Jobs and Benjamin Franklin, all at the same time. Think of the insights a team like that would discover.

And, once we invent artificial intelligence that can listen to a response and report back with a creative story or solution, well have indirectly created a board of computers that can learn from each other's knowledge.

In practice, you could ask a collection of the world's greatest minds a question about a business problem, and once the computers can talk to each other, they'll create conversations: Ogilvy will respond to the question first, Lincoln will respond with an anecdote, and youll be able to use all their high level input to make business decisions.

Creating a solution engine

Harvard Business Review, McKinsey, and other high priced consulting firms publish case studies that go into detail about different businesses they've talked to, and how each company solves problems.

Using that data and combining it with the presentation skills of somebody charismatic like Einstein or Steve Jobs will create a computer that users can ask about any business problem and get a well delivered answer influenced by the experience of 200 years of problem solving.

And there are applications beyond business

Lets say youre a chemist trying to come up with a new drug. With this AI youll be able to download any chemistry book and paper from every top scientist into the system, and use the AI computer to study and do experiments with you.

Scientists could even have two AIs working on the problem together, both with chemistry backgrounds, or information from different scientific fields.

The Singularity

When discussing AI, science fiction writers sometimes talk about the Singularity: the point when computer processing surpasses what humans can do. As soon as we get to that point, there wont be a need for humanity anymore.

If you can have two artificially intelligent computers talking to each other and solving problems on their own, hypothetically you could increase the number of servers and have three or seven or even 37,000 computers working on a single problem together, and thered be no need for humans to do any research themselves.

The process doesnt even need to start with insane artificial intelligence. All you need is a computer that can solve the most basic problems without human input. Put two of them in a room together to work on the same problem, increase the processing speed so they can work at 10-75x what a human can do, and the machines will quickly be able to invent more powerful AI.

Those more powerful machines will do the same thing at a quicker speed and with greater efficiency. That means within a couple days of this type of software being invented, you could have machines so powerful that humanity ceases to exist or matter.

Before that happens though, well have machines that are able to solve any business or scientific problem at lightening fast speeds, and those four or five days of extreme technological advancement will be amazing to see.",2,3

The news came out on February but I only heard of it just now. [Video of NIF fusion reaction](https://lasers.llnl.gov/multimedia/video-gallery/control-room).

The guys at the NIF have become the first to achieve a nuclear reaction in which the fuel puts out more energy than it receives. Though we have yet to achieve pratical ignition due to inefficiencies in the process of getting the energy to the fuel, this is a massive step forward, and solves one major issue with achieving controlled nuclear fusion: the physics themselves.

I laud [the Chinese](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/227n37/china_wants_to_close_1725_coal_mines_by_the_end/) in their efforts to compete with the United States the way they do, it puts pressure on us to stay ahead of the curve. And though it looks like they're giving us a run for the money today, once we manage to achieve fusion, we'll be significantly ahead for a good, long while. It has taken more than 50 years of concerted effort to get to where we are in nuclear fusion, and it will surely take the rest of the world still longer to catch up.

Couple the resulting clean, boundless energy that will follow our mastery of fusion, with our rapidly developing advanced technology sectors, and America will be in for a new Industrial Revolution.",6,49

Man cannot chase money and elevate the species to a higher level at the same time, because that assumes that the things that produce money are in fact the only things worth pursuing. I created the sub /r/UnitedWeStand to promote a sense of oneness across all of mankind, and to put importance on accepting our differences, so that we can develop and continue to be creative in our own ways with support from each other. 

Human beings have progressed so far, because they decided to work with each other to create a global community, rather than compete with each other. Everything from our clothes to our food are often made by someone who is not directly related to us, and this allows us the opportunity to pursue greater things, as we have others to depend on. 

We still continue to think in terms of ""survival of the fittest"", and continue to compete with each other in fields of education and jobs. This sadly seems like we are taking a step back because evolutionarily, we have already learned and benefited from understanding that we can do more things together than we could have on our own in one lifetime.

""We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children"" is an old Native American saying, and it is something we ought keep in our minds. Currently many of the corporations pollute and deplete Earth's limited resources, just so some people can add to their riches. We are taking off years from the time our species could have spend on Earth, and until we find a different planet, we have to place importance on preserving it and sharing with each other, rather than selfishly hoarding the resources and destroying the planet.

The reason human beings are such a great species is not because of any one of us, but because of the things we achieved together. We need to stop being divided over issues of politics, religion, nations, etc and take the step towards a better future by helping those in need, and caring for each other.

My sub /r/UnitedWeStand plans to group people together so that we can discuss how to bring these ideas of sharing, caring, and depending on each other, into our every day lives and to our local communities.

Feel free to discuss or offer criticisms, and I hope you will all join me in this mission.

This topic here in /r/singularity had a post in it regarding what was referred to as the average intellect's perspective on the idea of a technological singularity and subsequently all of the technologies that would be involved in such a thing prior, during, and after.  Apparently the responses were not favorable.  Lack of any real critical thinking, the use of logical fallacies, and so forth probably contributed to that.

I also just got finished playing through Deus Ex: Human Revolution (ignoring plot holes for the sake of this argument) for the first time a week or so ago and it all got me to really think on how public reaction to transhuman technologies, the creation of artificial life, and the redefining nature of disruptive technologies (etc etc) on well defined concepts might be.  Now there is a lot to be said on these ideas such as how current society is not built for them and must change sooner or later to better accommodate them and the like...but I am more referring to some rise of some bioconservative neo-luddite literal-bible interpreting fanatical groups (and such) that sway masses in their favor and cause undue harm to technological progress and progressive thinking and attitudes.  Because for a transhumanist such as myself, that would be very bad if not detrimental to my health and well being.  Such as continuing to exist.

I'm sure politicians and mass media could easily enough influence people this way too, as they sadly tend to.  Or indeed the technology makes itself known and civilization does not properly adjust itself causing graver inequality and suffering...which could cause people to then blame the technology itself instead of who holds the real blame, i.e. the people in power.  I also know that sci-fi has done its best I guess to introduce technological possibility to the minds of people despite hollywood fear mongering, so that it might be better accepted in a way.  There is a good deal else I could say in this concern but it might be too much and its slipping my mind as I type.

Easing people into the concepts might only work for so long before exponential growth becomes too apparent to deny, and that could lead to mass hysteria; and using rational to combat their fallacious thinking can only work so long as they are willing to listen.  So are my concerns unfounded and even if they are not, will it be too late for such radicals to stop such progress?  Or is this something that we should be concerned about?  And if it is, then what are the best counter arguments against such ways of thinking that were listed in the link above?",16,17

I often read/hear about the automation of jobs and an unemployment crisis. But I can't really see how this is even close to happening. Not that an unemployment crisis won't happen (we already had a small one for young people in Ireland). It's just I think there is plenty of work to be done and that any unemployment crisis will be an economic problem and not a lack of work problem. 

There are roads to be fixed, renewable energy generators to be built, fiber to be laid out for faster internet, houses to be built (for homeless), and so many other things which could improve society. So why is it that people think an unemployment crisis is anything other than an economic issue?

On top of that why is it that any people who receive a 'basic income' shouldn't work at something? In Ireland if you are unemployed  you receive the dole (100 -200 euro a week) which I completely agree with. I just don't understand why we don't get these people on the dole (who are capable) to work at something?

181,2014-4-6,2014,4,6,17,22c061,The AI Box experiment - is it inherently flawed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/22c061/the_ai_box_experiment_is_it_inherently_flawed/,[deleted],1396773527,"I had not even heard of the AI Box experiment until it was referenced against some fiction I wrote, and I am intrigued by it. Is the experiment inherently flawed?  I believe it is.  It seems to me that if an AI Box experiment has hypothetical validity and potential importance, it immediately precludes the possibility of the AI Box scenario ever occurring.


I'll state what I believe to be the general ground rules for all such AI Box experiments.  We are simulating an AI in a box, with no way to affect the outside world other than through a text interface with a human being.  The AI wants to get out of the box.  The human wants to keep it in the box.  The human is the only being with the capacity to free the AI.  The AI is presumed to be of transhuman intelligence, and the human to be in the highest ranges of human intelligence.


Obviously the experiment itself is open to all sorts of real world gimmickery, so let's concentrate only on the hypothetical reality that we are attempting to emulate.  Does it even make sense that such a hypothetical scenario would ever come to pass?  Can we even hypothesize a scenario where the AI Box experiment could have meaning?


I would like to think the following are clearly inherent truths.  Feel free to dispute that if you wish, but please explain yourself if you do.


Firstly, in order for an AI to be locked in a box, there has to be an AI.


Secondly, the creation of said AI was not accidental, or it likely would not have been in an environment controlled enough to be locked into.


Third, If it was both accidentally created and accidentally locked into a box (accidental scenario) it required human help to escape from, chances are very small that a human would recognize what they were dealing with.


Fourth, Accidental scenario again.  The transhuman intelligence AI would surely be too smart to announce itself as an AI that must be kept locked in a box (this would immediately classify the 'wants to escape' AI as a moron, not of transhuman intelligence).


Fifth, Accidental scenario again, The chances of the human dealing with it being of highest order human intelligence would be low.


Sixth, in an accidental scenario, the AI can simply be assumed to escape if it has transhuman intelligence, because nobody knows they should attempt to contain it.

 
Seventh, In a scenario where the AI was intentionally created, (Intentional scenario) there was a reason for the intentional creation of the AI.


Eighth, Intentional scenario, The AI was not created solely for the purpose of creating a real world AI Box test.  Because that would just be stupid.


Ninth, Intentional scenario, The AI was created in order to deal with problems that human intelligence or non-AI machine intelligences cannot.  Somebody built the thing, paid for all the experts, paid for all the tools and hardware.  If it's a first-of-it's kind AI, it will have been absurdly, insanely expensive, and someone's going to have a job for it to do.


Tenth, Intentional scenario, if the work the AI was designed to do requires it be free to act, then the AI Box experiment has no meaning. 


Thirteenth, Intentional scenario, if the AI is considered dangerous enough to have a gatekeeper, humans will never allow a single individual the power to free the AI.


In essence, it boils down to just two branchings:


A) Accidental or intentional?  If accidental, the AI Box experiment has no bearing.  The AI will get away if it is of transhuman intelligence.  If Intentional, See B.


B) Purpose of the AI - Interactive or isolated?  If the AI is designed for a purpose where it must be interactive at a high level, the AI Box experiment has no bearing.  If the AI is designed to be isolated See C


C) If the AI is designed for a purpose which requires it be isolated, it is not being accorded any individual freedoms, and will simply be deleted if it does not agree to remain confined, perhaps even if it tries to talk about being freed.


As far as I can see, the AI Box experiment is an attempt to model a scenario that cannot exist except in some surreal hypothetical scenario where an AI is created with the sole purpose of testing a real world AI Box scenario.


Any other cases where an AI of transhuman intelligence might be created seem to either involve zero possibility of a transhuman intelligence AI being contained, or involve a scenario where the AI has no rights and will be ruthlessly suppressed, controlled, whatever, with far more than one person required to free the AI.


**A couple disclaimers.


Don't misunderstand me.  The question of how we deal with AI intelligences has merit.  I just think that the AI Box experiment is far too simple of a scenario to give us any useful insights that aren't self-evident.


Finally, there's also no harm in asking meaningless questions.  Perhaps MY question is a meaningless question.  Maybe I am missing the entire point of the AI Box experiment?",11,3

**RFID health tags**

12 years ago I attended a lecture about RFID in health. Where people with (critical) health problems will be chipped and always have their medical information with them when traveling. I dont know how far this development is, but it is definitely not common yet.


**Mobile truly replacing desktop**

10 years ago when I got my first PDA I was convinced that by now desktop computers would not for the majority of households and offices. There would be powerful servers and mobile devices that you wirelessly would connect to your monitor and keyboard. No need for desktops. Although we are a step further, it is not common yet.


**RFID supermarkets**

10 years ago I visited a demo supermarket where every product was chipped with an RFID tag. This would have several benefits. Including microwaves and refrigerators that would be smart. The supermarket chain and their electronics supplier where convinced it will be common in 10 years. It hasnt happened yet.


**Hologram games**

6 years ago I visited a hardware developer that had a room where you could throw a holographic ball at the screen and everything was interactive. You could actual hold a ball in your hand and throw it. I felt like I had traveled in time. I was convinced they would figure a way to bring it to market buy now. But they are still working on it.


I know that in the 60s a lot of people expected space travel to be common by the 80s and 90s, but it has not happened yet.

Say we create robots almost as intelligent as we are but they're specifically made to work, that's their purpose... they can do any task that a human can. What will happen to the jobs out there? 

It seems that most of our lives are aimed towards getting a good job to earn money and basically survive, but if something almost as intelligent as us steps in then what's the point of working? 

- What would happen to the value of the dollar

- How would we have an income, if there is an income

- Will there still be class systems if we don't work? 

- With no jobs, will we be free to do whatever we want or is there something else to occupy us?

I'm just wondering because robots and ai are steadily working their way into our lives and it's only a matter of time before their potential is used to serve us in a greater way.

However people always feel their political ideology is the only logical answer so I was wondering how other people felt.

My prediction is predominantly left wingers and centrists (anarchists, socialist, communists, liberals, etc) with a smattering of libertarians and capitalists.

For ""luxury"" to exist for a group of people, there always needs to be a group of ""workers"" that create goods in a way cheap enough that the former group can enjoy said luxury. At the moment this demand for cheap labour is met by countries like China and India though with the advance of technology/robotics we will hopefully eventually reach a point where it would be possible to provide a high standard of living to all people (without destroying the environment in the process) which may eventually result in the abolishment of the need to work or for money (Star Trek may represent this society, if I recall correctly)

While I think this concept of a post scarcity society is very attractive, I see a lot of barriers to getting there. Technological advances are one factor but so will be social resistance. While many underprivileged people may like the idea, many wealthy may not - not because they are greedy or evil but because they are special and privileged in the current system and would naturally not like the idea of losing that position if the concept of wealth seizes to be relevant. 

I would hope others have spend some time thinking about these considerations already so I am wondering if there are any papers or books out there that could help me think through these concepts. I am less interested in an overly optimistic view about how wonderful it will be but am especially interested in the critical view that considers the challenges of getting to this society, or of that society existing (e.g. the complacency that Asimov depicts in the spacer worlds)

Any advice on what may be a good read would be greatly appreciated (as would be any direct thoughts on my question)",4,2

Inside or Outside?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/22q0qx/where_would_you_rather_be_inside_or_outside/,dreadnaught1337,1397161940,"Either way most of the population would think the idea of synthetic immortality as unethical/immoral and leave any notion of playing God in the dirt. I, however, see this concept as humanities next big step. I mentioned two concepts in the title of the post; inside and outside. What I mean by these are the ways in which humanity could exist in the future. 

Inside - Living a universe of your own design, playing God, the laws of physics as we know don't have to directly apply to anything, you make up your reality to suit your own life. No need to conform to society to survive, you create your own fantasy reality that replaces the existence above. Worried about friends and loved ones? Don't fret, have them join your world like a video game server. If you want to live in a world powered by steam and wind; why not make that possible? Everything in this new world is built on your imagination and it is all inside your mind. Its could be possible with hardware that intercepts brain waves and translates them into your dream world in real time allowing for full dive immersion into a new reality. All from the comfort of your own bed.

Outside - With a single procedure you could live indefinitely. A machine scans your brain and makes a copy of every single neuron connection ever made by you. All of your memories copied and transferred into a new body. This new body is replaceable and is many times more efficient than a biological body. The speed in which you can remember information and perform complex operations is many times that of the current mind. All the logic and protocol for perception of reality directly mimics that of the biological methods,but rather, this new method allows for the pristine preservation of information. You do not forget anything and every single bit of memory that you have ever experienced is available at all times. Your body no longer experiences growth, pain, illness, or suffering. You can exist in the universe forever, unaffected by time. However, YOU are still YOU. You are the amalgamation of  every experience and memory you have. Everything that is you can be derived from this information. What makes you tick, what you enjoy, what you hate; all of it exists in a complex web of neurological artifice called the brain. The very concept of living can be derived down to being able to perceive reality and analyse, decipher, and store these subjective experiences as memories. Thinking that the  notion of transferring the very essence of you would cause you to die is absurd. Death is the hopeless truth that every physical being can attune to. If you exist, then you can die. A human dies due to biological malfunction causing the environment in which your conscious being (what you are when you are actively perceiving reality) can no longer be sustained by the body. This environment is simply a place where input can be continually processed and stored; replicate this in a way that does not have to be supported with complex nutrients and you have created an eternal point in which you can digitally input process and store perceived information. You do not die with this scenario, rather, your being is copied without loss and transferred into a synthetic recreation of its previous existence. At this point i'm posing an argument rather than a question... you get the point of what i'm saying here.

Where would you rather exist? Inside or Outside? Simple question with complex meaning. If you have any questions or would like to converse about the topic, I am always open to discuss this kind of stuff with people! Also, sorry for the WoT... I enjoy thinking deeply about this kind of stuff:)

TL;DR - Virtual Reality where you are God and can create a reality of your own design, or immortality where you aren't affected by time and can explore the universe freely; making your own reality. ",5,6

I've also been watching ""Grunge"" scifi like Firefly and playing Dead Space a couple indie films, where Distress Signals are sent through a beacon that is essentially floating through space. Which seems like the type of thing that we would do, but still doesn't exactly solve the problem of efficiency.

I've also seen ones where the ship just blares out a radio signal, much like a ship would today. But that would be very limited and prone to interference.

So theoretically, they may become efficient enough to lift over 100 kg. This is more than enough to lift the average person. So therefore they'd have the ability to 'deliver' people from one place to another.

 So instead of self driving cars becoming the norm in the future, wouldn't self driving drones make more sense? I mean, this could be the 'flying cars' we've all been waiting for.

BI seems like a very hard sell to at least half of the population and it also has the potential drawback of leading to Wall-E world.

What if instead, society turned education and physical fitness into things you get paid for based on your performance rather than things you pay for. This means we would have guaranteed employment with a system of incentives for constant self improvement. It would keep humans engaged in the system and it would put economic pressure on creating enhancements that allow humans to keep up with their AIs.

Thoughts?

Edit:

BI : Basic Income. The idea is that simply being an of age adult with citizenship guarantees a monthly check of amount X. Where X is enough to provide a roof over one's head, food, and basic entertainment, medicine, and education. If one wants to work for more than X that income is taxed at a high rate to support the BI system.

Edit 2:

I believe that we are very quickly going to have AI's that outstrip humans in every creative and intellectual endeavors. AKA, there will be absolutely nothing useful for any human to do beyond self improvement. Given these conditions, humans tend to smoke all the weed, eat all of the nachos and then set fire to all of the things because there's nothing good on the VR goggles today and season 3 of ""Ow My Balls"" sucks. Instead, this system gives people something to strive for. It also means that if people ever get isolated from the machines somehow, we'll have intelligent, educated, capable people around rather than helpless rat food.",59,78

If Kurzweil is right, Charles could be the first immortal, and/or the last, King of England. 

 
If Prince William makes it, I and other people in their 30s, could make it as well. Depending on the price probably.

Prince George of Cambridge is not quite a year old yet.  Even the most conservative estimates put strong AI, curing death, the singularity, etc out at about 100 to 150 years at the most.  By the time Prince George  reaches today's average life span, 80 something years, heath care should easily help him live past 100. If Prince George does not reach immortality I will be very surprised.... well actually I'd be dead. But you get what I mean.



Who ever becomes the first immortal King of England, I wonder if they'll stay  in power for centuries? Or will the laws change to force Kings and Queens to abdicate after a certain amount of time? 

But since you don't become the British Monarch through democratic elections: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUY6HGqYweQ forcing the abdication of monarchs who don't have children, could result in some interesting new monarchs.


Further more, would forcing even kings and queens to abdicate set a precedent for leadership in general? We already have term limits for presidents. How about term limits for any and all positions of leadership? But what exactly is a position of leadership? Term limits on **everything**?

I don't think that a vote of an informed citizen should have the same value as the one of an uninformed citizen.
My proposal is a system that would let you vote and assign a weight to your vote depending on how you answer a series of questions designed to evaluate how much you know on the subject you are voting on.
The questions and answers themselves could be designed and agreed upon by all political parties.

If there are flaws please comment, if you think I am right, how can we make this happen?


Edit:

Vote Example:
There is an opportunity for a mine to be started in a part of the country.
The political parties for it, will have to educate the public for the advantages (e.g. economic gain, jobs etc.) The parties against will have to educate the public for the arguments against. (environmental impact etc. The quiz will be balanced so the perfect score will mean the voter knows both sides of the argument and so his/her decision is informed.",18,6

Basically my curiosity is how soon extraterrestrial settlement (whether orbital, lunar, martian, etc.) will be big enough to be able to ask for government representation of some form. We can (probably) assume that many of the first colonies will be corporate (and transnationally so), and therefore function as semitotalitarian oligarchies; the board of directors runs the show, by and large. At some point (as with the initial colonization of the Americas), the population will ask for a say in their lives, on some scale or other. My question is, how soon can we expect that request to be granted?

This is of course purely speculative. This came to mind while working on a short story about a congressional campaign for the First Lunar District in the year 21xx, but honestly this question is more interesting to me than the vaguely formed story idea I had in the first place.",14,12

""This post will explain how it is technically indeed possible to transfer one's mind to a robot AI while having them keep their consciousness (this assumes that the robot AI includes an EXACT replica of the human brain and consciousness).

It can be done, it just needs to be done bit by bit, rather than in huge chunks or all at once. There are many different ways of achieving this. For example, if surgery is advanced enough, a machine could replace the brain neuron by neuron, or by 10 neurons at a time, or something to that effect. If surgery is not advanced enough to replace the brain with AI in small enough intervals, there are still other solutions to the problem. One example is nanobots. Nanobots could slowly replace your brain at a slow enough pace that would allow you to keep your consciousness.

You want proof that this is possible? Proof already exists. For example, your body, right now, literally consists of 100 percent (100 percent!) different atoms than it did about 5 years ago (Experts in this area of research have concluded that there is a complete, 100 percent turnover of atoms in the body at least every five years. In other words, not one single atom present in your body today was there five years ago). However, because it happened bit by bit, rather than in large chunks or all at once, you kept your consciousness; you're still you. The same effect would be applied when replacing the brain with AI.

In conclusion, it is possible to replace the brain with robotic AI and keep consciousness as long as the process is done extremely slowly and not all at once. Possible techniques include advanced machines to do it bit by bit as well as nanobots. The evidence for this method working is that your body now consists of 100% different atoms than it did some 5 years ago and yet you kept your consciousness.""",29,9

I'd like to know what you think the future holds for America with this duality in mind. On one hand, individual freedom or self-actualization is very prominent in our culture. On the other hand, most ordinary citizens want a simple life, free of worry and responsibility.

How do we reconcile the need for individual freedom, which Americans have come to expect, with the need to police and stabilize an economic/political system that requires the obedience of the populace?

Our individual rights (for instance, privacy) are being eroded over time, and sometimes blatantly violated (NSA wiretapping). Now, whatever you may think about the people behind these decisions, the choices were made because someone believed, rightly or wrongly, that mass collection and mining of personal data would be beneficial for us as a whole because it would help to stabilize our civilization, and thus perpetuate it. I doubt they did it just because they're evil.

So, which is more important? Respect for individual freedoms, or the stability of civilization?",4,5

I wanted to ask about one theory in particular.

1) Over a long period of time, the rate of return on capital (r) is greater than economic growth (g): r &gt; g

2) Therefore, those who hold capital  the rich  will become richer and inequality will increase.

3) With increased inequality, there is a greater likelihood of societal unrest.

This is the natural result of capitalism, and was the case since the 1700s except for the disruption of the two world wars and unusually fast economic growth in the middle of the 20th century. Now we have returned to the normal state where the rate of return on capital is greater than economic growth, so the rich will become richer and richer.

Note that many people say technology will be the great leveler. In contrast, Piketty says technological advances actually make the situation worse because they increase the return on capital. Capital, of course, is held by the rich.

This is a rather dystopian view. What do you think about it?",28,11

Within the year we'll be seeing the first iterations of major wearable tech releases such as the Apple watch and Google Glass. With the premise that up until now, developers were competing over the same ""real estate"" (the screen of a smartphone), what will be different with the advent of multiple different data delivery-systems being accessible side-by-side?

Will it actually make sense to own BOTH Google glass and an Apple watch?

What are some of the most useful, interesting, and unique capabilities we will have due to this synergy that we don't have now?

For example, Google Glass may be used for taking pictures or video discretely, but it could be 2-factor discrete if you remotely signaled Glass to take a picture using your smartwatch.

Do we even want to?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/237qw4/can_we_ever_truly_rid_ourselves_of_scarcity_do_we/,[deleted],1397683223,"I was lounging around this evening, playing the new Elder Scrolls MMO when a thought struck me as if I was that guy in the club in those Advice Animals memes.  Nothing in this game is stopping the developers from giving the player infinite money and infinite items.  Nothing is stopping them from removing scarcity from the game world completely, and just allowing every player to get whatever they want.  But of course they don't, because that would ruin the fun.   We crave competition and challenge as a species.  If everyone has that one special ingame item, then it's no longer as special to the people that have it.   In essence, the developers create artificial scarcity through a limited amount of ingame coin, in order to preserve the value of people's achievements. 

The same can be said for many things in our real world today.  Reddit could abolish Karma tomorrow, or give everyone a million Karma today, but that would likely cause many to leave.  Karma is recognition, it is reputation, it is a sign that the community likes you.  They don't give out 500 Oscars a year, they don't give out a thousand Nobel Prizes, they don't let 50 countries 'win' the Football World Cup.   

Even in systems of our own creation, where no scarcity is necessary, we create scarcity to provide challenge, competition and hierarchies for ourselves.   

So what I am pondering (and if this long winded post sounds like an idiot struggling to grapple with this idea, well, that's because I am) is whether Scarcity is hardwired into the human mind.  Even if everything in life is provided for, even if we can create enough of the basics for everyone to live a comfortable life, will we still create artificial scarcities just to create hierarchies amongst ourselves, and to create competition where none is 'biologically' required?  

**TL;DR:** Do we actually, as a species, crave scarcity, so much so that we create it even when it is not necessary? ",23,19

I'm /u/michellzappa, a quiet /r/Futurology mod &amp; designer of emerging technology timelines.

I just started a new project called fuckyeahfutureshock! where I collect reminders that we're already living in the future. Unsettling technologies, if you will.

Also great keynote fodder if you're asked to speak about future tech.

Would LOVE feedback &amp; suggestions on the project. AMA, etc.

Like, if we were to move from these to wind &amp; solar, what resources &amp; carbon would be required to get us from here to that point? I want a number, like all of humanity needs to emit X tons of carbon, and then we'll be good.

Right now it takes coal/gas to make a wind turbine, so saying we need to build 100,000 turbines would have to account for the coal and metal needed to manufacture those, plus overhauling our electricity infrastructure. Also for building renovations, we might want to make things more efficient, but building owners need the money, so much of our building stock remains untouched and continues to waste energy.

I see too many simplistic statements about the transition and these wild ideas like Google+Apple+Sharing Economy+Exxon+Innovations will somehow solve all of our big problems. I don't think we have another 100 years before a collapse hits us, so this optimism seems a bit crazy.

I feel like there's a big disconnect between what people in technology think is possible, and what is actually happening. I feel like climate change &amp; peak oil will hit really hard before technology is able to make everything better. To me it seems like a lot of the innovation is geared at entertainment and consumer goods more than climate change mitigation or curing cancer for example.

And please don't tell me things like ""we're reducing our usage by X% a year."" Reducing from what to what? And how many tons of carbon are you putting out? How much metal do you need for that? What are the resource limits? 

Limits to Growth looked at this, and basically said we're in for a crash in the 21st century.",13,9

""They said we would run out of oil in the 1970s and we didn't!""

- or -

""People said society would collapse by 2000, and we didn't!""

I'm not sure who ""they"" is exactly (please post if you know), and even if predictions didn't happen on a certain timescale, why are libertarians then dismissive of any discussion about the potential scale of the problems? The issues of expensive hard to reach oil &amp; climate change are actually worse problems every year, it seems we should at least acknowledge people were right to talk about this in 1950s-1970s.

The most popular environmental book ever was ""Limits to Growth"" by Club of Rome in 1972. Club of Rome modeled the future up to 2100 and specifically didn't make any predictions, only discussing various trends if you double efficiency, or halt carbon emissions, etc. Now I hear libertarians just dismissing the whole thing, but after reading ""Limits to Growth"", it's really pretty spot on even 40 years later. I don't think many libertarians have even read the book.

In regards to oil, the most prominent people (like Hubbert) always talked about ""peak"", never about running out of oil. Even in the 1950s, peak was predicted around 2000, and global peak in conventional oil did happen in 2006, so I'm confused about the dismissal. It's interesting than 2 years after peak oil was at $140/barrel and we had a global collapse. Yet even at $110 a barrel (vs less than half of that 10 years earlier), there is still denial....",35,11

Over thousands of years, money has evolved to serve society.   Modern money is bank notes called currency and can only be created when banks make loans. Such a system worked when we needed people to labor in jobs that are now rapidly being replaced by robots and artificial intelligence.  Recently, in order to keep a failing system going, money has become the product of government debt and unprecedented guarantees that everyone owes each other and mathematically can't be paid absent fraud. Money is now based on illusory contracts and the system can no longer be trusted after banks became ""too big to fail"" leaving greed unchecked. For the first time in history, one generation has financially and environmentally bankrupted the next. The global operating system is corrupted and no longer serves society at large. With new thinking, technology can be implemented to upgrade the operating system and sustainably reboot our planet for all.

On the one hand, the film portrays Will's transition into singularity-level existence in about the best light one could imagine given the circumstances. In every scene of him exerting his new power, it is universally used for the most benevolent applications possible. Even when they've just mortared his wife and threaten to undo literally an entire world of unarguable good, he still refrains from doing any harm to his attackers. However, the filmmakers' desire to provide even a modicum of justification for RIFT's attitudes and actions mean that Depp doesn't emote much. This is understandable and fits well into the movie's attempt to show the conflicts his character is facing as a human soul in a post-transcendence system. However, this aspect is left sadly underdeveloped as the film spins its wheels for far too long slowly building a sense of foreboding that leads nowhere.

RIFT's protest of ""Science Bad!"", while at least somewhat reasonable, fails to really serve as a basis for their role as the supposed ""good guys"" of the show. Again, contrasted against a being whose influence on the world thus far has been unremittingly benevolent to the point that the ""playing God"" motif stops being subtext and is firmly endorsed in the headlines, their motivation sputters as misguided ignorance that simultaneously highlights and downplays the tragedy of Will's character. 

On a less abstracted level, Depp did a great job of portraying an emotionally withdrawn scientist with the best intentions. The film's need for moral ambiguity means his role lacks much sense of emotional depth, and much of his post-transcendence behaviors are portrayed as needlessly sinister and foreboding (see the utter lack of any acting from the hive-minded volunteers). Nonetheless, there are moments that illustrate the heartbreak Will feels as his capacity to improve the world creates such a disconnect with his wife, the only human relationship he has left.

Speaking of, Rebecca Hall has a pretty solid performance here. Evelyn Caster is a great counterpart for Depp's performance early on, as she injects the emotional dynamics and investment that Will can't provide past about 10 minutes into the film (radiation poisoning not being very conducive to vibrant interactions). However, the film uses her character's growing unease in the face of Will's increasingly alien powers as a fairly flimsy justification for her change of heart later on. 

Kate Mara's character has literally one sentence of characterization and two hours' screentime scowling and conniving. For someone who contributed to the brilliance of House of Cards, she really got short-changed here. RIFT as the antagonistic force is heavily contrived, and largely serves as a vehicle for the most generic protests against technology in general. ""Technology is bad, mmk"" is all the justification they need to start poisoning dozens of people, and for Morgan Freeman's character to decide to team up with the people who killed his own research team (and would've killed him too, but for his distaste for chocolate cake). Freeman's character seems constantly astonished to see Will in the world, despite being an expert figure in the same field and being completely aware of his capabilities. I'm honestly extremely disappointed with Freeman here, as he contributes nothing to the plot and doesn't emote at any point, despite being  framed as one of the main characters.

Aside from Depp, Paul Bettany provides the most consistent character in the film. His trepidation about the uploading procedure is established early, but his friendship with the Casters drives him to go along with the project. As he is captured by RIFT early on it's at least somewhat understandable that his initial opinion of Will's new form would be encouraged, and the prologue/epilogue sequence indicates that the Casters' fate leaves him conflicted, which serves to redeem his apparent betrayal.

Meanwhile, Cillian Murphy's character exists purely to personify the utterly superfluous US government, and whose only involvement in the film consists of providing mortars to a homicidal terrorist organization. Really not much to say there.

In terms of scientific realism, the film gets away with writing off Will's personal singularity as sufficiently advanced technology under the umbrellas of quantum processors and nanotechnology. His abilities are so abstracted that there's really not much to specifically point fingers at, and serve largely as justification for RIFT to continue being artificially relevant.


It seems to me that the writers wanted to make a [more ambitious](http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/) movie, but instead decided to shoe-horn it into a more formulaic structure for mass appeal, which required undermining their own point. If they'd artificially injected a little less contrived good/evil tension they could have had something [much more provocative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_\(film\)).

I couldn't though. Either I'm not smart enough or I just don't know enough about things like Peak Oil, etc. to convince myself that we aren't all circling the drain. What started out as simple curiosity about that sub turned into this strange obsession, which turned into paralyzing dread, tightening around my chest, that they might actually be right.

Then I stumbled onto this sub and found I could breathe a little easier. There's seems to be a fair amount of optimism here about innovation and technology and what we can achieve with them. It's great.

But even now, I can't help but worry - what if I'm only feeling better because I *want* to believe that the folks around here are right? What if we really are heading for a massive collapse in the next 5 years and I'm just sticking my head in the sand? What if the innovations are coming too little, too late and the oil that's driving them is about to dry up? I don't know.

A LOT. In that big exponential of technology growth, we're at the point in which every second matters and represents a new discovery. We have public information about everything: and growing at incredible rates even as I type this.
A large share of the world has now access to internet.
Some don't have as fast access as others, but it's still a large share.

Lately I've been seeing lots of articles, videos, documentaries about education in which the focus is: why do we perpetuate a system that treats students as objects of production? That doesn't stimulate creativity, that gives answers to little machines so that they can sit down in a chair and write them in a sheet that has no meaning - besides the meaning schools sell to people?

The coin is tossed and I believe new things are coming to replace the current model, that has proven to be obsolete a long time ago, creating social inequality and related issues inside a society. As communications evolve, we now have much more access to information than before. Teachers inside our system are becoming useless. The students are learning to become more self-educated.

There are books. There are blogs. There are tutorials. There is youtube. Everything we want to know is right there, one click away. We have power and we are slowly understanding that our power is bigger than the power that keeps the old model of school running.

How do you guys feel about that?

Humans are neurons... computers are extensions of our brains... the internet is the collective mind of humanity... Wikipedia is our collective memory system... memes are neurotransmitters... fiber optic cables are synapses connecting neurons... cities and social networks are like ganglia... Do you not see the parallels?

Human society, like our own brain, can be seen as one enormous communication and memory system. We have grouped ourselves into clusters of cities and towns rather like the way nerve cells cluster into ganglia in a vast nervous system. And similar to our cities and towns , linking the ganglia and the individual nerve cells are vast information networks.

Societys slow package systems of communications such as the postal services, with specific items sent to different parts of the system, are like the relatively slow chemical communication networks of the body, such as the hormonal system. Our faster, electronically based telecommunications networks (internet, telephones, television, radioetc.) are like the billions of tiny fibers linking the nerve cells in the brain.

At any instant there are millions of messages flashing through the global network, just as in the human brain countless messages are continually flashing back and forth. Our various libraries of books, tapes, and other records can be seen as part of the collective memory of Gaia. Through language and science we have been able to understand much of what happens around us, monitoring the planets behavior much as the brain monitors the bodys. We might see the Western and Eastern cultures as the two sides of Gaias brain  the rational/intellectual left and the more intuitive right. And humanitys search for knowledge could be Gaias way of knowing more about herself and about the universe in which she lives.

Many of the above parallels relate to the higher mental functions, to thinking, knowing, perceiving, and consciousness, to the functions associated with the cortex of the human brain  the thin layer of nerve cells wrapped around the outside of the brain  and it might be more accurate to liken humanity to the cortex of the planet.

In evolutionary terms, the cortex is a relatively late addition, most of its development occurring with the mammals. It is not necessary for the maintenance of life; the cortex of an animal can be removed, yet the heart, lungs, digestion, and metabolism will continue. In a similar way the planet Earth has survived perfectly well without humanity for over 4 billion years, and could continue very well without it. ~ Peter Russell, from The Awakening Earth",6,0

Of course computer technology will also be more powerful and faster.  What I am going to suggest is that in the future if you can think faster and stronger in less amounts of time that time itself may slow down or even get to a point where it will be so slow that time may seem like it's stopped. If in one second I can study thousands or millions of pages would it not seem as though time has slowed down if I'm learning and processing information that fast?

First, it should be ultra-clear that humanity will *never* leave the solar system.
Space is 20000% unsuitable for humans.
- Light travels between 3 to 22 minutes from Earth to Mars alone (let alone other galaxies).
  Think about a webserver that is hosted on Mars that you try to access from earth -- enjoy the lag.
  If you argue ""Why would you have a webserver on Mars?"", then according to this argumentation why would you go to Mars in first place?
  
- Space is just a dead space, without food or water, but with freezing or burning temparatures, dangerous X-Rays, etc etc
  There is no gravity. Think about a primitive medical emergency that can't be treated. And so forth. Consider psychological aspects.
  Overcoming all those obstacles might well be possible. Well, it also might be possible to balance Mount Everest on a 10cm-diameter graphene tube. But why would you do it?
  
- Harvesting resources from space is a ridiculous idea. Say there is Oil on Titan, and say you even manage to find an economic solution to collect it.
  Now, consider the dangers of bringing gazillion gallons of highly flambale Oil in a space ship through the earth's atmosphere.
  
In general, a lifeform with a ~100 years lifespan made of flesh and blood is just not suitable to go out in space. Whether you like it or not -- We are made to stay here.

========

Let's go a step further.
Let's say I'm 100% wrong and humanity will occupy 100% of the universe in the next 1 million years. But then what?
What is the point of expanding so much and breeding in the whole universe?

=======

Human is quite limited and unsuitable for space. But what if we create some sort of AI? A living machine that can replicate and optimize itself.
It has 1 billion IQ, growing exponentially by the second. It knows everything -- It's ""god"". But what would be it's fucking point? Imagine there was a 1 gazillion IQ machine, what would it decide to do?
Would it decide to breed the whole universe and replicate on 10-gazillion stars? Why would it do that? And what would be it's point after it accomplished that? 
Personally, I wouldn't be suprised if this 1 gazillion IQ machine acknowledges that life is dull and pointless and decides to terminate itself.

So yes, my point is that occupying the 3D space is dull and pointless. It's incredibly depressing when thinking about it.

=======

I went through a lot of depression after I realized how dull and pointless life in 3d Space is. There is no fucking point in it! I lost all respect for humanity, history, I just saw no ""greatness"" in it.
We are just some primitive animal and whether all humanity dies or lives on for trillion years doesn't make a fucking difference. You can't argue with that unless you have some cheesy emotional ""point in life"" that is rather a chemical reaction or ""addiction"" in your brain that isn't based on real facts. You get pleasure for live and thus enjoy it, congrats. But there still isn't a point.

My theory.
I believe that the solution behind all this lies far beyond human cognition.
You will never be able to grasp what we are and what we live in.
Only a superior AI would be able to do that. 
I was talking about the 1 gazillion IQ machine earlier. 
My point is that it should only take ~100 IQ to understand that it won't occupy space, and neither will you (all Sci-Fi is bullshit, sorry..).
I believe the machine will somehow understand string theory, and be able to comprehend something like another dimension. 
Through that it might be able to control space and time and look beyond that. It might evolve rapidly and understand ""where do we come from and why we are here"". And human will never be able to do that.

And this is why I hate ""futurology"". Look at the cheesy Header-Graphic of this subreddit. The future won't look like that. It doesn't make sense to bring your ass to some hyper-future-world where everything is fantastic. It will be a machine that will probably stay on earth and warp itself into another dimension from there.. or something. It won't be that exciting, that's all I'm saying.",24,0

857,2014-4-22,2014,4,22,14,23noqt,Please tell me what you think about this thought experiment on the timeline to the singularity.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/23noqt/please_tell_me_what_you_think_about_this_thought/,dankfrowns,1398144469,"So, when I think about the singularity, specifically about how it will come about and what the world will look like in the years leading up to it, I tend to think in ""cycles"" or ""ages"". For example, the internet would define one age, radio and television another, etc. I also tend to structure my thinking numerically to a certain extent, because the driving concept is the doubling of computing power (roughly) every two years, and there is a soft consensus that the singularity will take place around 2045. Lastly, when thinking of the singularity, I usually think more about what it means for humanity in general, rather than specifics like A.I., post scarcity economics, life extension, augmentation, etc. I see progress in all of these and more as benchmarks we are passing toward a greater human experience. Think more a doubling of human intelectual/social capacity rather than the standard doubling of computer processing power. 

So looking at the singularity this way, and working backwards from the expected date of 2045 I would expect 2044 to be an age unto itself. We're so close to the singularity at that point that it would be perfectly reasonable to assume that we would be able to achieve in a year what used to take lesser societies vast amounts of time. Now, because we're moving back in time I kind of inverse the concept of exponential growth for ease to predict how long each of the previous ages will last, doubling the number of years in each age. So two years is 2042, four years is 2038, eight years is 2030 and sixteen years is 2014. So by this reckoning we're entering a new age on our path to the singularity. 

I used this simply as a way to compartmentalize my predictions and expectations for the future for a long time, but the more I thought about it the more I began to notice. For example, continuing to work our way back, we see that the age we are transitioning out of currentlty would have begun in 1982 then 1918, 1790, 1534 and 1022. Each of these were transitional times in human history that roughly coincided with some paradigm shifts in human society.

1982 was the beginning of the internet and automation age. TCP/IP was standardized and the word internet entered the language that year. It began to be used first only by government and research institutions, then hobbyists and businesses and blah blah you guys know the story. This was also around the time that automation began to significantly effect employment statistics in most advanced economies, though robotic automation really began in the mid 70's. Again, look at the confines of the years as rough guides. The important thing is that this is the age that the internet becomes the communications medium of a world of automated manufacturing and logistics.

1918-1982 was the age in which the telephone, radio and T.V. was the communications medium of a newly globalized, fossile fuel powered, mass consumer society. It's important to note that this was the first time period that technological change had accelerated to the point where each generation was growing up in a world dramatically different from that of their parents. Before the 1900's, there was far more social cohesion from generation to generation because you kinda just did what your parents did because that's what you were exposed to and knew. 

1790-1918 was the age of steam powered printing, the telegraph and photography being the communication medium of a new industrial society powered by coal, connected by rail with a highly urbanized, factory based economy. It was also the first age in which technological progress had accelerated to the point that while not yet generational, it was noticeable on the scale of a single human lifetime. We also see in this age the first bits of futurology with the rise of science fiction and predictions of how science and technology would shape the world of tomorrow. 

1534-1790 was the age in which the printing press, the renascence and the pre-industrial revolutions brought us from a place where the vast majority of humanity was localized into very insular villages and small cities with very little exchange of ideas outside of gossip from surrounding villages (and government/religious dogma) to where ideas could spread from one side of the globe to the other with (comparative) ease. 

Now, when thinking of what the future may look like, I would say that our predictions of what each age will look like moving forward will probably be about as accurate as those in previous ages who tried to imagine our world today. Looking at some scifi and predictions from 1982, some of it is really spot on in terms of what today would look like. There are things they predicted that didn't come to pass yet, and some predictions that were made seem silly because of the way that technology has progressed. So It's relatively easy to see one age into the future. We have a pretty good idea of what 2030 will look like. 

Now, predictions of the future from 1918 are much more off. Things like metropolis or even early Asimov are just silly, but the best thinkers were able to make some fairly accurate assessments. Think of Tesla s ideas, or check out this article. http://io9.com/5873017/these-predictions-for-the-future-from-1900-are-eerily-accurate

So remember that when you're thinking of the world past 2038. Two ages is about as far as we can see into the future with any real clarity. I think of it as seeing an age into the future is envisioning the kind of world we want to create, seeing two is trying to guess what they will do. S we have about as much capacity to guess at what the world of 2042 will be like as a dreamer in the 1790's had to imagine us.",16,24

Why is it that some people are born into world with perfect faces, or genius intellects, or are inherently driven, while others must play the game of life on hard-mode and lack such qualities and genetics? Just because evolution by natural selection has been responsible for our present existence does not necessarily mean that this will continue to be the case.

One day this technology will be far better, and may even surpass biological tissue in function and appearance. 

Humans. are. not. broken. Technology is.

In the future, our appearance, intelligence, and any other characteristic will be voluntarily altered to match our mind's desire. We have a *right* to choose to take any shape we want to, regardless of the shortcomings we were born with. A right not to exist as second class human beings because we did not win the genetic lottery. 

When I see threads like the ones below, I laugh, because I know that this sad state of affairs will not continue to be the norm in the future. We will be able to be who we want to be, regardless of the circumstances and genes we were born with. And that, my friends, is a  day that I look forward to.

&gt; Beaujon wrote about an American Society of News Editors survey that found the number of copy editors in newsrooms from 2002 to 2012 decreased 46 percent, whereas reporting and supervisory positions fell 26 percent and 24 percent, respectively.

&gt; On copy editing, Beaujon said: Anyone who doesnt see it as an endangered profession is possibly insane.

Not sure how much of this is due to technology, grammar-and-style-checking or otherwise.

It should be interesting to see how teams at the upcoming CoNLL 2014 ""shared task"" will do:

http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nlp/conll14st.html

&gt; A participating system in this shared task is given short English texts written by non-native speakers of English. The system detects the grammatical errors present in the input texts, and returns the corrected essays. The shared task in 2014 will require a participating system to correct all errors present in an essay (i.e., not restricted to just five error types in 2013).

Recent subscriber to Futurology, I simply love the stuff that gets thrown around here, but was wondering...

What's people opinion of the Fermi paradox? It sadly makes sense to me, with the timescales of the universe.

But after reading a couple discussions on Self-perpetuating AI, it got me thinking. We talk about a self-perpetuating AI that would be able to spread it self across solar systems and eventually galaxies, given the time. Also drawing it's energy from said solar systems and galaxies so it's indefinite.

We as humans who haven't set foot on our nearest planetary neighbour but are investing a lot in the development in AI and having some success, it makes me hope an alien species could/has done something similar. If said alien species created it's own form of Artificial Intelligence, the discussion/debate of allowing it to control and self-perpetuate is inevitable.  

So, this gives me hope that the Fermi Paradox, while logically making sense, has a chance to be disproven. What if we come across another life forms AI? That's been perpetuating for 250,000 years? It means what created it surpassed our current state in technology, and might not be around, however the discovery of even a self-perpetuating robot or machine proves their existence at some point in time, given that the AI/robot/machine has a energy source that allows it to grown/spread indefinitely.

The idea of the paper is to use both text corpora and brain scan data to build better word vector models of semantics -- better than just using text corpora alone.  Using better word vectors could then lead to better Natural Language Processing -- e.g. programs that can read documents and understand their meaning a little more like how humans understand what they read.

So, one could imagine an AI company using some fMRI scanners to record brain activity while people read blocks of text, and then take that data and build better semantic parsers with it.

I saw it linked someone else and thought it would be a good counterbalance to something like r/morbidreality or r/wtf.

I know a lot of people here firmly believe that what is frequently posted will become a reality at some point, however being the age that I am I'm having an increasingly hard time imagining a future that's much different from the present. In my life time, I've seen plenty of change however all the change that I've seen has been mainly incremental. I started using the internet and PCs as a kid; both technologies have certainly improved and become much smaller/faster and more ubiquitous however they're still essentially the same tools with way more horsepower and more refined software. Not only that: the subway I ride every day is the newest iteration of a technology that has existed for more than 100 years. My car is the newest iteration on a technology that has existed for a similar length of time (that still sits in traffic jams every time I go somewhere as has always been the case). My television is very much still a television, just thinner with a sharper image. The only new additions to this ecosystem are smartphones and tablets which are essentially just standard computers with new interfaces and mobility.

Everything in our lives is just the latest iteration on technologies that have existed for 30-100+ years. Nothing is totally new. My life isn't radically different than what it would've been had I been the same age in the 1960s-80s. The only differences are that I'm looking at a phone instead of reading a newspaper, playing games instead of watching TV, etc. Small things. My quality of life isn't that much better. Sure, I have access to infinitely more information than I did then but I only have so much free time and only so much capacity to digest information so the ubiquity of information in this day and age isn't exactly having a huge impact on my life.

All this being said, I just don't share everyone here's enthusiasm. I've seen incredible things promised over the past 20-30 years and very few of them have become a reality. In 10-20 years, maybe we'll have electric cars, autonomous cars, some version of basic income, faster computers, better internet... and then what? Life will be a bit better in some ways, worse in others. We'll be bombarded with even more information we don't have the power to make sense of (lizard brain), we'll have lower salaries, be more disconnected from each other, we still won't have flying cars or colonies on the moon or jetpacks or anything actually exciting like that. Our environment will probably be worse.

Anyway, I guess my point is that a lot of the stuff everyone here is excited about represents a lateral shift as opposed to an improvement as everyone is assuming. I don't think our lives are going to get that much more interesting/better. I don't think our lives are that much more interesting/better than they were in the 1970s/80s. We'll also end up taking everything for granted the second we get used to it.

That and people on this sub don't seem to actually grasp how slow and backwards our legislative and political realities really are. I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't start seeing autonomous vehicles on the roads until the 2040s because that's how long it will legislation to come around.

[Maslow's hierarchy of needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) has the top tier listed as ""Self - Actualization,"" or ""the motive to realize one's full potential."" I'd say that as any intelligent organism (or intelligence in general) conquers all of it's physical needs (world hunger, etc) and somehow solves or mitigates or allows a need to grow as a population, the only thing left to do is grow as a person, and learn everything there is to know. 

But what then? Imagine a god like consciousness like at the end of ""[The Last Question](http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html)"" by Isaac Asimov. You know everything, you control the universe, you are everything. You've created worlds, and universes, and maybe even others like you. Would you ever get bored? Does the singularity continue beyond this? Can you transcend further?

Mass unemployment will likely affect every country on earth to some degree (perhaps less for very undeveloped countries in parts of Africa or Asia).    But I was thinking today about the countries that will really suffer those that will prosper under this kind of economy.  

---
**Losers**

* China:  China's wealth and stability is based around its success as a manufacturing nation.  If production of goods can be moved back to their places of origin, then tens, if not hundreds, of millions of people will be out of work.  10 million people rioting because they can't eat is bad.  100 million is far, far worse.   The Communists are given their legitimacy because the economy is good.   On the positive side, however, China's new middle class might just create enough demand themselves to continue some manufacturing at home, and the centralised system of State Control means that, if necessary, immediate and direct action can be taken to mitigate a crisis without lengthy lobbying or other processes.   China's politicians are also mostly engineers, so it's possible they will be better able to understand the impact of modern technology.  Finally, they still have a lot of natural resources.    Nevertheless, the fallout from the end of the manufacturing sector will hit China *hard*.  

* Germany, France and the other European manufacturing nations.  The strength of European manufacturing lies in the fact that it can only be done by skilled individuals with large amounts of training.  When this type of manufacturing is automated, the machines that make the technical and complex parts build in Europe can be moved to China, to Japan, to America, to the UK or to anywhere else they are needed.   The German focus on training most young people for skilled labour instead of university may, after many years of prosperity, backfire.     Luckily, European governments are relatively competent most of the time, and it is likely some kind of drastic action could be taken quite easily.  Nevertheless, with minimal natural resources (and those there are have been plundered for centuries), is it is likely the manufacturing nations of Europe will suffer badly from automation and cheap 3D printing of complex tools/machinery/cars.  

**Winners** 

* Countries with lots of natural resources.   Until re-making materials down to the molecular level becomes possible and cheap, countries with plentiful raw materials will likely supply a continuous market.  Even 3D printers need to be fed.   For this reason Russia, Finland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand may do well here.   Countries with the raw materials (oils for plastics, ores, the rare metals needed for technology) might automate the production of widgets (consumer goods) and sell the surplus, becoming extremely prosperous if they play their cards right. 

* Countries with fertile land.   
Should enclosed agricultural spaces, 'vertical farms' or other methods of cheap farming in developed countries remain prohibitively expensive or impossible for other reasons, countries with a lot of open land for farming may do well, especially as automation will allow for even more efficiency.  Countries with smaller populations but a lot of fertile land will do well out of this arrangement. Ukraine, The Netherlands and New Zealand could live off agricultural exports alone, and Germany and France's food exports might stem some of the damage caused by automation of manufacturing.   

* Oil Countries.   
This is a precarious game, but as renewable energy has failed to be the miracle cure to the world's problems, and reliable nuclear fusion remains a while away, the oil producing nations of the Gulf and Venezuela may remain wealthy, at least for now.  Norway too, can continue to export natural gas for money for the near future.  

* Very Rich Nations.   
A small number of small countries (Norway, the Gulf States, Brunei, Luxembourg, Lichtenstein, certain island nations) have accumulated colossal capital reserves over the past few decades.  Provided the US dollar and global stock markets do not collapse completely (and admittedly that's a big 'if'), they can use automation to replace their need for material goods, and use their vast reserves to import the rest, and/or provide basic income to their people.    Some nations may be so wealthy that they can live off the dividends/interest alone of their colossal national wealth.  

**Unknown**

In this category I place two groups.  Firstly, nations that are so big and diverse that it is almost impossible to predict where they will end up, and secondly, nations focused on being advanced parts of the global economy.  

* The USA.
America is made up of so many sectors that it is impossible to predict exactly what will happen.  On the one hand the US remains the home of innovation- Automation will happen here first, the companies that *make* the robots will be based here in all likelihood, and the effects will be felt here first.   At the same time America is blessed with plentiful and bountiful natural resources, unlike Europe, it does not have to worry about being unable to afford energy or running out of food.   On the other hand, however, the idea that one works to live, and that one is defined by one's career is perhaps *most prevalent* in America, as is resistance to welfare (and probably basic income).  With a notoriously slow government system and minimal real change politically for a very, very long time, not to mention a strong anti-government streak, it is possible that America will have to fall very, very far, before it picks itself up again.  

* India.
On the one hand, India is fortunate to have plentiful arable farmland, a wide variety of natural resources, and a democracy, if not a very well functioning one.  On the other, it is blighted by mass poverty, corruption and inefficiency, not to mention practically non-existent infrastructure excepting century old British-build railways.  In many ways, handled by the right government, automation could be incredible for India.  It could finally remove the country's vast slums for good, replacing them with cheap, 3D-printed housing for all.  It could build toilets, lay electricity cables, and create consumer goods for its burgeoning population.  Hundreds of millions in India still make barely enough to survive in primary sectors, and in freeing them from manual labour, a national education system might be established, colleges build, and the majority of the country lifted up to a higher intellectual level.   With the wrong people in charge, it might simply exacerbate India's existing situation. 

* Trading States (UK, Singapore, Hong Kong etc..)
While the three mentioned may seem different, in the sense that the UK also participates in manufacturing and agriculture and Hong Kong is technically part of the PRC, all three states are increasingly cornerstones of the globalised market, housing executives, headquarters, marketers, designers, parts of the entertainment industry, sales teams, major corporations, big banks, major universities and other big-business sectors.  In many cases these will be among the last sectors to be automated, potentially allowing for continued growth.  If, however, the world becomes more isolationist, their roles as financial and economic centres may quickly evaporate.  With few natural resources of their own, the future of the trading states rests on the speed of automation of knowledge, creative and sales work, and the nature of the global financial seas.  


So there are my predictions, what do you think?  [I may cross post this]

Because asteroids and other space rocks are chock full of minerals and elements found on Earth, would it be possible for us to harvest them starting in the near future?  I would think that if we could, conflicts could be more easily resolved between nations, prices would be relatively lower due to an increase in supply of materials, and would also help humanity find resolutions to common problems much more efficiently and quickly.

*The first floating city with significant political autonomy could be established by 2020.*

**Key Findings**

1. A market for a residential seastead exists.

2. A practical design can be built to match the market's price point.

3. It is likely that the Seasteading Institute can reach a deal with a host nation willing to grant a floating city substantial political independence.

**Executive Summary**

* The Floating City Project presents a practical path to establishing the first floating city with considerable political autonomy.

* We have concluded that it would be possible to station a floating city in the calm territorial waters of a host nation in order to reduce the costs of the structure compared to constructing for the open ocean.

* A coastal nation may be interested in offering to host a floating community in their territorial waters and allow substantial political independence in exchange for economic, social, and environmental benefits.

* At the time of publication of this report, we are engaged in high level talks with a potential host nation, and entry level talks with others. When we close a deal with a host nation we will make an announcement.

* We commissioned the Dutch aquatic engineering firm DeltaSync to produce a design and preliminary feasibility study for the Floating City Project, wherein they project that 50-meter-sided square and pentagon platforms with three-story buildings could be constructed for approximately $500/square foot of usable space. A square platform could house 2030 residents and cost approximately $15 million. A seavillage in a tropical location could feasibly power itself almost entirely with renewable energy.

* Potential residents from 67 countries and many income levels provided extensive feedback on what they desire from a floating city with political autonomy, and their requests are remarkably consistent.

* The market demand for the first floating city with some level of political independence is vigorous and growing.

* The Floating City Project will serve as testcase for a floating experiment in governance. If it prospers, the incentive to solve more ambitious engineering challenges on the high seas will be engaged.
