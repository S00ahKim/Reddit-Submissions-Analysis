For instance, regardless of where they came from, groups who migrate to a desert slowly begin developing cultural adaptations that mirror the natural life around them: Prickly defensiveness  and envy being some of the most obvious.  Likewise, cultures that migrate into icy places with little sunlight tend to become morose, depressive, and philosophically inclined toward bitterly existential viewpoints.  Meanwhile, the great cultural blossomings of history have tended to happen when people migrated into climates that were (at the time, at least) mild, temperate, and forgiving. 

There are exceptions to any rule, but how can future generations avoid the rule altogether when colonizing space?  If/when Mars is colonized, will its people become what they behold - desolate, unyielding, unforgiving, and gloomy?  Will they be materialistic and cynical because they have to exercise so much forethought just to create a survivable existence for themselves?  Or will the rewards of pushing new technology, and the optimism of building a new world provide stronger countervailing influences?

The question can be made specific to any potential new environment humanity may settle, but it can also be generalized to anywhere outside of Earth.  Is the environment beyond humanity's cradle a forgiving playground that will teach us to become greater and wiser beings, or a cruel wilderness that will turn us merely into more powerful versions of beings lesser than ourselves - barbarians and tyrants with spaceships?

Science fiction is full of many scenarios in either direction, and we can be certain that all parts of the moral, political, and philosophical spectrum will recur in time somewhere.  But what will the general case be?  Will the best of humankind be accelerated to new heights of achievement, or will its diaspora become bitter as the deep web of natural connections we barely understand are severed and replaced with raw, inanimate physics?

History teaches lessons, but also teaches the lesson of surprises by its confounding examples: Scandinavia - once a land of perpetual murder and deprivation - now the height of both order, prosperity, and cultural mildness despite winter still being heinously cruel and the Sun only a seasonal guest.  

There's a lot of hope in that example, but it's impossible to not notice that it's an exception - that other nice, frigid places either have tiny populations (Iceland) or huddle as far South as they possibly can to avoid the weather in most of their territory (Canada).  And it's even more disheartening to realize there are no examples at the opposite extreme.  **None**.  The deserts of Earth are not happy, enlightened places to live, even when they're technically rich.

For all the analogies at our disposal, none are adequate.  Humans have never lived in starker deserts than are out there; never suffered deeper cold; never experienced more absolute desolation.  Whether we bring light to the darkness or are invaded by it is something we will only know by taking the leap.",50,15

This post may stray from this subreddit's purpose, but every great piece of tech was imagined at one point; movies just help feed that imagination.

NOTE: I'm not a huge fan of anime, but I did love Code Geass. I'm aiming for realistic depictions of the future, so camera filmed movies are preferred.

NEWER movies are preferred, think movies from 2000 and after. (The alien trilogy, 2001 a Space oddssey, and movies like those are totally good for this list though)

So most of us can't wait for **Internet Voiting** to arrive, or a better and more auditable technology like **VoteCoin** or **vote-coin / crypto-vote** that will allow all citizens to vote freely and more securely in their country. There are already some countries using it. The NASDAQ announced they will be using an new internet voting technology... but in Estonia. There were some big funded companies that were working on internet voting in the 90s, pre-911 shit. Ther was VoteHere that came up with this technology... but ""sold it off"" and fragmented the technology. Apparently there are 1,000 counties, and most of them were already buying DieBold (ATM makers). So VoteHere sadly never took off... their site appears to be archived here: https://web.archive.org/web/20010721213034/http://votehere.net/ basically these guys got $4,000,000 from VC to start this cryptography based voting system. If we had a site like FaceBook that allowed all 380,000,000 americans to vote online, and then we could compare it to the ""paper ballot"" or the antiquated and corrupt voting machines/people, we could then use a ""votechain"" or public ledger, to compare to the [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_News_Service) tally, which is a media owned company that ""tallies"" all the paper votes. It's pretty FUBAR to know that a U.S.A. ""media"" company is in bed with the people tallying the votes. Does anyone else here have some good internet voting stories or ideas? ",7,4

Cybermetrics in baseball was one of the beginnings of translating all the skills into numbers. 

With skills to analyze other people's mind, each person will read the other party's real mind like a book, and none of wisdom, charisma, tolerance, imagination or love will matter anymore.

Everyone will be borgs, or go the way of the passenger pigeon. 

Only intelligence, intelligence and intelligence will matter because other 'nonquantifiable' skills are going to be analyzed and put into numbers rather quickly.

That way, we can identify potential Hitlers beforehand and isolate the would-be demagogues, so the current system can work forever.

In fact I do predict sex will disappear soon , or it will be reserved to people who are not really relevant in the scheme of things. 

If some intelligent person who is not good with other sexes but has genes worthy enough to be replicated, finding a surrogate mother, or even better , an artificial womb, would not be difficult. 

In the old ages, many people with great minds could not find mates worthy for them, like Newton, Leibnitz, Kant, Adam Smith, etc, and thereby their genes died.

But in the new era it won't be necessary for great minds to waste time trying to please the opposite sex to reproduce, so skills like love, or 'the game', would be irrelevant as well.

That would save them from other unnecessary distractions like divorce, and they could follow whatever sexual inclination if necessary while guarranteed the right to reproduce.

Everything will be digitized so skills which can't be digitized will simply be swept away, like the quipu of the Incas (which did not have writing systems).",7,0

My 2 year old Macbook air has 8GB memory, 128GB SSD, and dual core CPU.  The latest laptops have the same specs.

You have to go out of your way to configure a computer with 16GB of memory, because everything off the shelf is stuck at 8GB.   CPUs are stuck at 2-4 cores and the 2-3Ghz range, although the architectures are improving incrementally to be more power efficient and have slightly more efficient instruction sets.  SSD storage has been stuck in the 128-256GB range for years.. 512 still costs a fortune and is for power users.  Display resolutions are only improving very slowly.. in fact my 2 year old macbook air has the same resolution as the latest model.

I remember back in the good old days, a 2 year old laptop would be slow compared to the latest hardware.  Why is this trend happening, and will it continue to slow down?  Will we still be using laptops with 8GB of memory in 2020?",17,6

274,2015-11-4,2015,11,4,7,3rewm7,Question: is the idea of AI self-improvement realistic? [x-post /r/ControlProblem],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3rewm7/question_is_the_idea_of_ai_selfimprovement/,TanookiMario,1446589757,"Newbie here. Had a question I originally posted in r/ControlProblem that I think applies to futurology, as well.

I'm a total layman, so forgive me if I don't state this eloquently.

One idea that I keep hearing repeated in the Superintelligent AI conversation is that a program could eventually reach a tipping point where it would be able to ""recursively improve"" it's own design.

I'm not sure I understand how this would work.

Take a specific measure of performance: speed. A program could be designed that randomly changes some of its internal configuration files that affect how fast the program is. The program could test each new configuration against a benchmark, and determine if the new configuration passes or fails (is it faster than any previous configuration, yes or no). Running this loop for an arbitrarily long time, the program could eventually find a configuration that is optimal, given the physical constraints of the system (hardware, memory, power consumption etc). Okay...

But I don't understand how this would apply to more complex goals, like becoming generally ""more intelligent"" ? Now were not measuring something simple, like speed. General intelligence is a complex measurement. Its like saying someone is clever  it implies that they are good at many different things, not just one thing.

But suppose a program could be designed that randomly changes some of its code, in the hope that it hits upon a better configuration. But what determines ""better"" in this case? It's not just faster... the program would have to perform better across an arbitrarily large number of different use cases.

Who determines those use cases? If the AI is supposed to be self-improving, than humans can't do it. Even if we provided it with an initial library of benchmarks to test against, wouldn't those benchmarks need to evolve as the program became more intelligent?

In other words the AI itself would need to identify more difficult problems so it can keep growing in intelligence... but how would it be able to identify the problems that would lead it to greater intelligence without solving them first? Its a Catch-22.

For the AI to surpass human understanding it would need to form new benchmark tests that we can't even think of. But where do those new tests come from? How would a program be able ask questions about it's own programming? Wouldnt that imply that the program would have to understand it's own programming? (What?)

In other words, wouldn't it have to ""emulate itself"" ?

But I thought that was impossible?",9,0

One the one hand, we are facing the bitter reality. Million people fleeing from war in their home countries in search for security, protection and peace - to claim their human rights -, whilst, our resources are limited. Not only, that there is no broader consensus for refugee reception, tensions are rising in society, carrying the potential to rip our society apart and change it drastically. On the other hand, we have the moral duty to help these people  to guarantee them the unalienable rights every human holds. At least: security and protection.

So what is the solution? Looking away wont fix it. Military engagement wont fix it at all. Shutting down the borders wont fix it. Receiving all refugees wont work.

The situation in the Arab world or parts of Africa wont change by tomorrow, we cant expect them to go for and through Enlightenment by weeks. It took us millennia to develop these values to the point where they are now: Enshrined in the act, as the fundament of our modern states and societies, securing peace and prosperity.

What to do? I mean, this has worked once before. People came to America for quite the same reasons back in the days. Maybe even more because of economic reasons, than because of prosecution or their endeavor for liberty. These are people, who are willing to sacrifice and scarifying their life for these endeavors  So why should this not work?

The United States had to fight for their independence against all odds. What could a country achieve, when backed with the support of the 21st centuries international community, backed with the rich and bundled wisdom, expertise and know-how of our multifarious societies.

I had a look at the globe: Unfortunately, there is no terra incognita accounted anymore. But, plenty of space.

I am no geographer or geologist, no city planner, no geostrategist. I have no expertise in agriculture, civil engineering or infrastructure. But I know a little about economics.

Alaska proofed, that it is no physical impossibility to trade huge areas of land, rather than a question of pricing.

You can do the math: 
1. Building up a country and thus a new market, which amortizes over time while stabilizing our home societies (which is, by the way, a neat economic stimulus program for the countries involved). 
2. Investing the same amount of money for either building fences or integrating people in economies, which are already saturated, and potentially risking the total breakdown of these societies, because of extremists resistance.

*Hint: You dont really need to calculate the costs, but give these two scenarios a price - asking yourself for your willingness to pay.*

Maybe this idea is foolish, but I like to think of me, not being one. So sure: Things would be challenging and problems will arise. Like the Americas are no utopia, neither this will. But maybe it is the best shot we have. Facing reality and fulfill duty.

Europe governed by rightwing extremists wont be a cozy place for anyone. And sadly, power rules out morality too often.

/I recognized, that this post turned out to be longer and more pathetic - in the old sense of the word - than expected. Sorry for that. I hope it still meets the rules of /r/Futurology. Otherwise I kindly ask you to move it to the appropriate please.

// I am looking forward to hear your thoughts on this particular idea, but also your thoughts on this topic as a whole. Do you share my concerns, that how this situation develops politically (rising extremism from, but also rising popularity of the right-wingers) could be a potential threat to our societies? 
One biscuit for the haters: People who dont see the moral duty, do not really deserve a privileged living in our modern societies, because both stem from the same principles. If you deny the one thing, you deny the other. Cheers.

There is always demand for people with the right skill set or experience, and there are always problems needing more resources or man-hours allocated to them, yet there are always millions of people unemployed or underemployed.

If the world is ever going to move into the future, we need to come up with a educational or job-training pipeline that is a hundred times more efficient than what we have now. Anyone else agree or at least wish this would come up for common discussion (as opposed to most of the BS we hear from political leaders)?

Update: Wow. I did not expect nearly this much feedback - it is nice to know other people feel the same way. I created this discussion mainly because of my own experience in the job market. I recently graduated with an chemical engineering degree (for which I worked my ass off), and, despite all of the unfilled jobs out there, I can't get hired anywhere because I have no experience.

(3D-printing),https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3rmhn2/consumer_behaviour_and_our_culture_3dprinting/,stinsvarning,1446728984,"This is a parallel thought to the thread, [Technology eliminates menial jobs, replaces them with more challenging, more productive, and better paying ones... jobs for which 99% of people are unqualified.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3rl676/technology_eliminates_menial_jobs_replaces_them/)

Another elephant in the room that I do not see much discussion about, is how technology will alter consumer behaviour and our culture. A change that will also deal a massive blow to the availability and need for jobs.

We all know about 3D-printers, but how will **you** use them? 

The designs for objects are just files that are already being shared online, similar to movies and mp3s. The open source community is strong and when a generation of kids grow up with 3D-printers and share their designs with their friends and the world, there's no turning back. We will print, use and then recycle and print again. 

This will probably also change the way we purchase things that we cannot make ourselves, and cut down on the need for options. For example, there are only that many ways to construct a phone. In order for people to be able to get in touch, the communication protocols are standardized, and most of the technology is exactly the same. When 3D-printing allow us to customize the look of things ourselves at home, we will probably see modular concepts [Project Ara](http://www.projectara.com/) style where everyone use the same endoskeleton from whichever company comes out with the best solution first. 

A real life example of what I'm talking about would be the [soles](http://www.sols.com/) in my shoes. They were created by 3 photos of each foot, inputs about size, shoe type and then an algorithm and a 3D-printer went to work. Perfect fit. Soon enough we'll have shoes the same way. That will kill off the entire shoe industry with time. Everyone will want to either create their own shoe design, or just download a design shared by someone for free online. This also extends to all clothing.

When we eat from the tree of knowledge...

I'm uneducated in economics, but my initial thought was if that were to happen, it might be a good idea for them to invest / implement tablets / self ordering kiosks instead of human cashiers. My university has began implementing machines around the food court that allow us to order something from the grill, and wait until our order number appears on a screen so we can pick it up. Overall, it has made ordering much more efficient and faster, and I feel that if Mcdonald's adopted this idea, it would allow them to make more sales. 

My hunch though, is most likely, the R&amp;D / costs of implementation nationwide would cost much more than raising minimum wage of workers. ",13,2

Edward Bellamy famous book Looking Backward from the late 19th century envisioned an America where automation has overtaken menial work, everyones basic goods are provided for, most people only work a few hours a week and cooperatives dominate the economy.
 
Alexandra Kollontai's [Soon](https://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1922/soon.htm) envisioned a world where people lived in communes and children are told strange tales about how life was in Capitalist societies and how people were driven to crime.

Post-Capitalism as an ideal largely seems dead, so in the spirit of imagination (and always likely incorrect future prediction) what form do you think a Post-Capitalist society and world would take? 

Note it doesn't have to be ""utopian"" or ""socialist"" Post-Capitalism may come about due to mass catastrophe and disaster which is very likely.",13,0

I think it was mostly for the uniqueness of the idea and how the idea seemed simple.

[here is the clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPMfrIfnl0k)

So what do you think of the overall design? It is definitely interesting but also has is obvious flaws. First off, the video says that it requires no fuel but talks about the water being pumped so that implies some sort of energy consumption. It also talks about the sea water being cool but you would have to go down deep enough to actually get the cold sea water. I guess all of this pumping energy could be supplied by wave energy since it is located next to the ocean. 

The next major problem I see is with the salt buildup on the mesh they talk about. The ideal solution would be to be able to passively remove the salts and return it to the ocean. The only idea I can think of is to replace the whole mesh thing with some sort of fabric and then get a wind turbine to power it and have the fabric rotating over two drums with the lower drum being in the ocean. As the ocean waves hit the fabric, it would remove some of the salt buildup and over time salt would never be able to build up significantly. That's just what I had on the top of my head.

So what do you all think? What are the flaws? How to solve those flaws?",15,3

You can't believe how exciting this field is now for doctors and scientists!! 

The [gene therapy that saved the little girl](https://np.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3rns3d/gene_editing_saves_girl_dying_in_uk_from/) used something called a [Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimeric_antigen_receptor).

The [little girl was saved by something called UCART19*](http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/152514-156). Basically, it is a CAR that target something called [CD19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD19). CD19 is present on B-leukemia.

There are now two major types of CAR targeting CD19. [One was invented by Dr. Michel Sadelain](http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/13/18/5426.long), [the other was invented by Dr. Dario Campana](http://www.nature.com/leu/journal/v18/n4/full/2403302a.html).

Just last year, [Dr. Stephan Grupp reported this clinical trial results](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1407222). In the study, Dr. Grupp used the CAR developed by Dr. Campana. They observed 90% of COMPLETE REMISSION among leukemia patients. Remember, they were very severe patients that had to attempt experimental therapy!

This area is now BOOMING! Let's hope more research to be funded by public, so pharmas can't get in and patent everything under their name :(

I predict the following :

- Rioting becomes more common [because of automation], and becomes more frequent.

- Anti-government protests increase further due to issues such as internet censorship.

- Poverty becomes an even larger issue.

- More individuals go off the grid.

- Protests over automation and mass unemployment, reminiscent of Ned Ludd come back, although the motives are likely to be due to automation. [Real-life example - the August 2011 riots in London, which were protests believed to be motivated by social policy in the United Kingdom at that time].

- People no longer into digital prestige [mentioned somewhere on here]

- The Internet goes back to how it was between 2001 and 2004, on a social level, where it wasn't about number of followers, social media or anything like that, but about the content and articles themselves.

- Automation stops due to a digital terrorist attack, putting things like robot factories, robot UPS delivery vans etc., SDCs [self-driving cars] out of action. 

- A ""you don't appreciate what you've got until it's gone"" attitude comes to employment in general, because of automation.

Living where I am, in a semi-rural area of the Home Counties, a fleet of driverless cars wouldn't be good, and we have a ""let's keep up with the Joneses"" attitude, it's where the London commuters live.

Here in the UK, it's impractical to ban manual-driven cars in certain places, there's a lot of sparsely-populated areas like parts of Wales, parts of Cambridgeshire etc., and even the Home Counties (well, parts of Hertfordshire, Essex etc.).

People don't want to give up ownership of a car do they, here in the UK the concept of renting a TV is more or less dead in the water, anyone remember Rumbelows or Radio Rentals?

They may be useful in cities, but elsewhere it's less useful, and there's a sort of groupthink (IIRC, mentioned on some forums) that there's a basic human psychology of ""I want to be in control"".

Driverless cars do have benefits, but in mega/hypercities, not your average small English town.

I mean, no-one would want to have a driverless Ferrari, Lamborghini etc., as isn't the point of them about driver appeal? Same could be said for a Subaru or a Chevrolet Corvette.

Plus just about any other car brand, though, too. That Google car is ugly and they could at least have made it look more like a generic sedan or something.

Driverless cars kill off the personalization aspect of it that most of us like, people like tuning the engine, engine swaps, paint colour changes, ""hooning"", racetrack days etc. and as we've seen, America has the ""rice burner"" crowd focused on Japanese cars, e.g. the Honda Civic.

Limiting manual-driven cars to a track has, well, too many limitations, things like the ""freedom of the open road"" etc. disappear.

I don't think governments would want to ban manual-driven cars based on two reasons, profit and fears of voter backlash, after all they could ban fast food if they wanted but it's people's right to decide what they eat and drink, isn't it? After all, Prohibition just caused people to want to drink more didn't it??

I'm not saying driverless cars shouldn't exist. What I am suggesting is, though, allow both manual and driverless cars to co-exist.

As for all future cars being electric, what about that news story of genetically-engineered bugs, or ""synthetic petrol"", is that a solution?

After all, you have people who eat a mainly meat-based diet, and vegetarians, but it's people's right to choose, isn't it? I know that sounds off-topic, but it's a parallel.

Anyway, back to my main point; should we really ban human-driven cars? (not trying to sound Luddite-ish here).",29,4

You also don't have the responsability to choose for everybody, the survey is just about YOU and your feelings. Just focus on how many years you think YOU will enjoy being alive.""

I have been asking this question around me for more than 3 years. The answer are often fun and interesting. I would like to ask the question to a wider audience. I made this google form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16s2OSBGJOHH-13aCjw3NXepHNnAsETir9WjpWl05ScI/viewform . How do you think I can share it efficiently so that many different people with different backgrounds can answer it ? 

Also which question would you change ?

[Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3c/Real_gdp_per_capita.png) is the Real GDP per capital for the USA. So beautiful, and very useful to show how much wealth is created by each citizen (GDP/Population). I hope you get the joke here ;) Well, this means that we produce more without needing to increase the total population, yeah, called it productivity: even if it's not limited to labour.

********

2 Less work per capita:

Then we have [this](http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/520f835b6bb3f7730d00002f-800-600/usworkweek.png) marvelous data (yeah, I love charts). What we are seeing here is that each employed citizen works less and less... Great news isn't it? Well, it should be.

*******

3 More jobs With less hours and less income:

Look at [this](http://www.pocketfullofliberty.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Total-Jobs.png)! Jobs and more jobs! But, take it easy, [here](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/EMRATIO_Max_630_378.png) you can see that almost the same percentage of US population works. Maybe politicians are doing the right thing! They create new jobs to keep the people busy and with an income... [Not exactly.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SxAcOBKQ2MM/UVSyeDgH9EI/AAAAAAAADD8/rtypZE8w0Nw/s1600/family_income_median_income_growth_productivity1.png) Damn, GDP per capita grows but our earnings not? (Actually I'm from Spain, but it's the same for us).

*********

What's happening? How the hell are we producing each of us more and more (here comes the joke again, this time I'll let you play with your thoughts:..) but the wealth created is not in our pockets?!

Well, you can imagine that the rich guys are taking almost all the pie and that's not incorrect but, tell me please, how the hell the productivity raises? Ok, let's redistribute again the jobs, let's even correlate productivity and wages augmenting the citizen's income (minimun wage, basic income); then what? Where are the magical new jobs appearing thanks to technology?! Less and less hours worked, let's create 1 hour a week jobs and well paid! Maybe this could ""work"" (I love words) and be efficient for some time, but then what?

I will finish this long article sharing with you this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE04_s9Bd5Q). Thanks to Google Translator and my former english teachers, forgive me if I've commited mistakes :)

Before leaving this post, what do you think about this? Have you some predictions about where's the limit of ""redistributing work""? And how could we redistribute wealth better? Thanks for reading!",19,61

This argument is bullshit, and I think anyone who takes the time to think about it will realize why it is bullshit.

Transhuman technologies are very desirable to most people. If there existed e.g. rejuvenation technology that would take you back to the biological age of 20, most people, whether Indian, Chinese, American or whatever, would be willing to spend at least a year's wages on that.

That is a businessman's wet dream. You have a massive market, billions of people, willing to spend a huge chunk of their income on this tech. Do you really believe that no entrepreneur is going to want to go after that? A trillion-dollar market will be ignored? 

There is nothing inherent in the technology that makes it expensive. It does not rely on rare metals or energy-intensive processes. Similar to how computer chips can be made at consumer-friendly prices. This is true of theorized transhuman technologies that rely on interfacing biological and mechanical systems (like computer chips in the brain) and even more so for those that are strictly biological (like genetic engineering with viral vectors, which could be cultured for mere pennies per dose).",82,49

Humanity faces a huge challenge - the unwashed masses, at least 6 billion strong, about to overwhelm the civilized world.

Type I or Singularity are the only ways to keep them out from civ and maintain human progress.

If neither of them are achieved within a generation, the masses will catch up with the First World and overwhelm it, ending the progress altogether and sending the world back to barbarism.

Type I or Singularity will build an insurmountable wall between those who get to enjoy it and those who want to enjoy it, making those who can make the difference safe, away from the masses who want a piece of it.

However, if neither has been achieved, the Masses , or at least some part of it, will be able to match the tech of the First World, and will use it to take a slice of power from the aforementioned.

The world is too small for everyone to enjoy a ""First World"" lifestyle, and it is inevitable that most of the world should remain subsistence, and well away from those who can advance some of the world's pop to a new stage of civ.

In a world where Type I or Singularity were not achieved, I do see something like Dien Bien Phu, or the final chopper flight from Saigon, happening in First World cities which will fall to the masses one by one.

Such event means the end of mankind's progress and challenge to conquer the universe.

I'm a psychotherapist and I work with people who have severe mental illnesses, addictions, and also just run of the mill life obstacles. 
 
What occurred to me recently is that all mental illness (the severe kind, the personality kind, and the mild kind) all lie on a spectrum that exists as a result of intelligence. Fish don't get depressed. Chimpanzees probably don't hear voices. Mental illness is a feature of intelligence: it is an outlier variation from the common pool of behavior - but is an anticipated outlier. 
 
This glitch in the machine produces unhelpful and potentially injurious behaviors. But despite all our medicines and therapies we know of no way to fix it - in part because the same random collisions of neurological learning that produce autonomy and sentience also produce these illness variations (we can't get rid of the one without neutralizing the other). 
 
When we talk about Artificial Intelligence I think we fail to appreciate some of the known qualities of Intelligence itself. We all expect that problem solving, creativity, and logic will be features as we have come to expect these from intelligence. Many have offered that morality too would show up in AI since we see it in natural intelligent beings. But we are leaving out a conspicuous problem that we have long known exists within intelligence: Mental Illness / Psychological Disorder. 
 
If we imagine true AI as a self-constructing self-altering self-learning mechanism capable of achieving sentient self-awareness we must assume that AI like Natural Intelligence before it will have outliers who experience psychological dysfunction. I don't think we are giving this the attention it deserves, and it raises some important observations. 
 
1. **A percentage of AI will probably experience some measure of Mental Illness/Psychological Disorders.** When I say ""Mental Illness / Psychological Disorder"" I don't necessarily mean ""Violently Insane"" - though that is a possibility. When we think of ""Mental Illness"" we think of The Joker from Batman or a serial killer like Charles Manson. But those far outliers of human behavior don't even represent the largest threat from glitches in the mental system. The real danger lies in the ordinary appearance of mental illness. The man who beats his wife. The woman who drinks through her depression. The bullied child who brings a gun to school. ""Mental Illness"" isn't just the diagnosis stuff - it is the entire continuum of dysfunctional and sub-optimal thinking patterns and associated behaviors. Since we see this in the human machine as a common occurrence related to intelligence we have to assume we will see it in AI. 
 
2. **AI might need therapy**. The brain - our intelligence machine - has been described as a galaxy of complexity. The almost incomprehensible magnitude of this mechanism results in all sorts of neat results - self-awareness and intelligence for instance. But when illness, dysfunction, or disorder show up in the behaviors of the brain we can't exactly go in with a scalpel and rewire the circuitry to change this. Lobotomy doesn't work. So we turn to talking with the ghost in the machine - we counsel it - we attempt to heal it using the sum of its own complexity. We call this psychotherapy. If AI is capable of producing the vast galaxy of infrastructure required for true intelligence such that the ghost in the machine appears (self-awareness, sentience) we can only assume that when mental illness shows up (and it will) we can't just pop the hood and give the robot a tune up. We may need a form of psychotherapy devoted to AI, or perhaps members of the AI species that can perform this task on one another. 
 
**CONCLUSION**
 
A known feature of intelligence is that a percentage of outliers will develop dysfunctional psychological patterns. To the being these are often experienced as involuntary and subconscious happenings that can result in unhealthy, self-destructive, or socially destructive behaviors. Since we have known mental illness to have existed since the beginning of recorded history, and since we can detect even subtle mental illness in our friends and family, we should assume that it is a ubiquitous and reliable feature of intelligence. If mental illness shows up in AI - and we have no reason to assume it won't - we may need to develop a way to address this. ",52,57

Humanity is immensely fragile as it is, epidemics, famines, etc. Even if we do survive all of that the Sun will handle us later. 

When I reasoned this out one thing stood out in our mind, humanity is more than just our genes. I think humanity can also be anything we create. 

I think artificial intelligence is the only reasonable chance at a permanent solution, the artificial children of humanity could forever live among the stars.

However, during early 17th century, a court intrigue killed a popular general, and his aides fled to the Manchu nomads, who were the worst enemy of China's dynasty.

They brought the artillery tech with them, and suddenly the Manchus were no longer vulnerable to China's artillery.

Within a few years the Manchus conquered China, and destroyed a lot of it.

---

As the gap between the 'haves' and 'have-nots', and the richer countries and the not-so-rich country growing larger,

the 'have-nots , while tending to lack the skills and the intelligence to survive in today's world, do  covet what the 'haves' and 'First World'.

Right now, existing tech is enough to safeguard those who are the drivers of this civ, but if tech development stops and mankind is stuck on earth or does not get singualrity,

soon the 'have-nots' will gain enough tech to destroy the 'haves', the 'First world"", etc.

That is the greatest fear  of all - the downtrodden, instead of coming with pitchforks, might arrive with 'real' kind of weaponry.

Type I or Singularity will bring an insurmountable wall to keep them out once for all... and those who are capable of benefiting from these events will bring civ to a higher and higher stage.

However if they were not done in time before the Masses begin to gate-crashing the 'civilized world', 

It is probably going to be the end of the Tech civ, and a return to the agricultural civ or even beyond.

Civ has to continue its inexorable march toward the next level, or it will be consumed by those who can't understand it, but want the goodies anyways.

It is unlikely that more than 100,000,000, which I think I overestimated, will ever get to enjoy the New Civ. since the tech will be 'too dangerous to leave to the public'.

Reaching these goals will keep the downtrodden away and civ can advance with them, but if they are not reached  the masses WILL catch up with today's winners.",28,0

The above quote is from the November 5, 2015 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3rl676/technology_eliminates_menial_jobs_replaces_them/) on Futurology titled ""Technology eliminates menial jobs, replaces them with more challenging, more productive, and better paying ones... jobs for which 99% of people are unqualified.""

As of today, the post has received 2216 net upvotes and 1028 comments, so I thought folks here might be interested in the actionable insights I've gained from 23 years spent researching, designing and implementing ways to leverage tech, analytics and media to expand educational and economic opportunity, and to customize education.  

Some of my main insights are summarized in an October 2015 [article](https://medium.com/@PostRomCom/blogging-platform-war-portends-blogcoin-ad-space-prices-that-contain-only-truthful-peer-ratings-of-834baf0db39c) that I posted on Medium.com. Title of the article: Blogging-Platform Battle = Start of WAR for eBay of Customized Education. Subtitle: Platform + BlogCoin variant + market = ad-space prices that contain only truthful peer ratings of work samples. Most popular platket = next-gen LinkedIn = foundation for eBay of CE.

More of my (would-be) insights:

A key to maximizing the popularity of the eBay of CE is launching and popularizing a loan program for CE consumers.

A key to popularizing a CE-loan program is Moneyball-izing it (e.g., lowering borrowers' interest rates to reward their progress as students a/o producers). 

Key inputs to the Moneyball-ization of CE loans will derive from activity in CE markets and in complementary markets (e.g., said ad-space markets).  

Over time, Moneyball-ized CE loans will make it (much) easier for m-m-many non-wealthy people to thrive amid job-automating robots and AI 'bots.

I remember the designer being some college professor, but I've know there are lots of quacks that claim to have invented some revolutionary new technology and then never deliver the goods.

A bit about this. The prototype/scale model that the professor demonstrated in the video was a very shallow cylinder with a lot of grooves. Kind of reminded me of a flattened turbine. It had a stem sticking out of the bottom of it. I believe it was just supposed to act as a super efficient generator to power an electric motor in the car. In the video the professor was trying to build his design into a powerplant that would output 25kw, if that helps.

I know this isn't a lot to go off of, but the video I remember watching had hundreds of thousands of views, and the designer was a college professor in the engineering department with a bunch of students working under him to complete the project, so it seemed a little more legit than your random joe, and with the exposure that the video had, maybe another redditor remembers a little bit more.

One of the recurring ideas is that ""the rich will only get richer, whilst the poor will only get poorer"" -- thus leading to the institution of a ""universal wage"".

I understand the logic behind a universal wage in a world where robots are involved in the overwhelming majority of work. 

Isn't an opposite way of dealing with unequal resource distribution to simply limit how much one individual can earn?

Why isn't maximum wage realistic or interesting? I understand that in today's world a maximum wage would simply lead to the mass exile of the 1%, to countries that would not uphold such a policy. 

Can you help me see through the real implications of a maximum wage? ",42,6

Science and Technology have evolved thanks to the scientific method: you try several hypotheses through investigation, wich is based on testing and observing. My point is: Is that different from simulating things? I mean, consider a lab where trials are constantly made in order to find, for example, a molecule able to do X thing. You have to invest a lot of time and human minds in order to do it but, essentially, what you are doing is a simulation.

What computers do it's to simulate reality in order to recreate/modify it. This is [Moore's Law](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Estimations_of_Human_Brain_Emulation_Required_Performance.svg/800px-Estimations_of_Human_Brain_Emulation_Required_Performance.svg.png) predicting some very interesting things... [Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing.jpg) is another graph showing almost the same thing. By 2023 we could achieve neural simulation so we would be able to increase our ability to simulate reality and doing scientific research.

I don't know if my post is interesting for you, but I hope that I helped you to understand why Moore's Law is linked to exponential progress of science and technology. Thanks for reading!",8,0

They only see progress and tend to not see the blighted rest of the world, which consist maybe 80-90% of the world's population.

Some of them, particularly those who came from such pop and know the danger, warn the majority of the future-drivers but their voices tend to be ignored by the latter because they do not see a danger from the Masses.

---

Dien Bien Phu is a tragic example of such blind spot manifesting itself.

Long story short, the French set up a fortress in the middle of the jungle, to entice the North Vietnamese to attack it and crush the mob at there.

However, unknown to the French, the Vietnamese were trained by the Chinese, who just fought a 3 yr war against the Americans in Korea, to camouflage their cannons. China also gave the NVA trucks which were used by Americans but were captured in Korea.

So the NVA could be supplied in the jungle, and were able to hide their guns which made the French bombardment and airstrikes pretty much useless.

When NVA found it hard to take the fort rockets were impoted from USSR to help them, and that ended the siege.

All of the French (and the Foreign Legion and other nationalities) were taken prisoner, and many died in the prison camp.

In short, when the masses gain access to the same tech as the more advanced people, the masses will defeat the advanced ones and will show no mercy against them.

That is why it is necessary for tech to advance sufficiently to have an insurmountable gap over the masses, and if necessary take some measures to ensure the gap stands.

That task is not pretty and a thankless one, and potentially dangerous as well, but it hast o be done to keep civilization progressing and avoiding danger of destruction before it reaches the next stage.

If those who are likely to advance civ are not careful and lose their momentum to the Majority, the civ will revert to the majority's mean, which is much lower than what could have been achieved by those who could drive civ.

It is either the Advanced leaves the masses behind, or the masses knock out the advances and makes everyone to regress.",16,0

Right now everywhere is not wired so there are still some 'blind spots' which made things like the mess in Paris possible, but these spots are on the process of being closed.

I do not know when, but in the very near future everybody, high or low, will be living in Truman Show - privacy and individual freedom will be history.

The upper and upper-middle class, the only classes who do matter, are OK giving up some of their liberty and privacy to be safe and secure. 

In a world populated by drones, if a crime is about to occur, the drones will fly and smash themselves to the culprit's head, preventing the crime.

I don't see how a crime is possible. The only crime which might exist might be programming the drones to do their own thing, but the drones could crush these folks' heads before they finish entering the code.",29,18

In short, this robotic companion treats him like any good girlfriend would. Would you feel cheated by that robot; feel like you're in a love triangle? Or how would you take to that situation?

Why not work on and invent a machine that can detect and travel to the different alternate timelines? That way, should you make a change you don't like in a timeline, you can simply travel back to the original time line, effectively traveling between the branching paths that all decisions make, and being able to avoid any consequences of any meddling in the past that you do.

It would not only lead humanity into a whole new era of cause and effect science, but would also be an entirely new form of exploration. Being able to explore alternate universes on a whim. I think it would be pretty cool, don't you, future scientist?",10,0

If the moderators don't want the link then I'll remove it.)

One of the dreams of would-be space colonists is the terraforming of Mars. Perhaps the greatest example can be found in the Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson.

""Terraforming"" means making another planet more Earthlike.

There are a number of techniques proposed in terraforming Mars, two of the chief ones being increasing the planet's temperature and activating a hydrosphere.

To do both, one possible solution could be similar to Elon Musk's idea of the Gigafactory.

Instead of producing batteries though, this Gigafactory would produce a gigaton of water per year. This can be done using the sabatier reaction.

In the sabatier reaction hydrogen and carbon dioxide are heated and compressed over a catalyst to produce methane and water. In the terraforming Gigafactory the methane could be broken apart into carbon and hydrogen. The hydrogen would be fed back into the reactor and the carbon could be shipped out to be sprinkled on the Martian ice caps to speed up planetary heating.

But why turn carbon dioxide into water? Carbon dioxide is a good greenhouse gas after all. That's true, but the issue is that Mars has too much carbon dioxide locked up in its soil. In fact, there might be enough carbon dioxide in the soil to produce an atmosphere ranging from one to three bars (Earth's atmospheric pressure is one bar).

In addition, water vapor is both a greenhouse gas and a necessary part of the hydrological cycle. So we could warm up and moisten Mars with water.

The ""could"" comes from the fact that large amounts of hydrogen would be needed to produce the water. Some hydrogen could be recovered from the methane byproducts, but more than that would be needed. Other planets and moons have hydrogen in abundance, but shipping hydrogen from other parts of the solar system could prove too expensive to be doable for the near future.

It got me thinking about being able to choose a personality from a range of personalities available and what that would be like. 

It also made me imagine that there will be actual people that are famous because an IPAP is based off their real life personality. I imagine this would be completely different from the current celebrity worship and that the then present day celebrities will not necessarily be personalities that are sought after. I imagine it will be much more like what we see with Youtube celebrities. Regular people who have interesting personalities that rise to fame.

What do other think of this idea, can you see any other implications of a world with customisable IPAPs?",19,22

Ice ages are vast spans of time where glacial periods occur, punctuated by warm interglacials. Known ice ages have lasted 30 to 300 million years. Ours started only 2.58 million years ago, so it would be unusual for it to end now or soon. I'd be interested in (scientific) estimations and speculations on how long it will last, and what are the implications for the next ~0.5 billion years.

One issue there is that in all scenarios detailed in a New Scientist article about possible future continental plate movements ([rehosted image](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DNn8aA9AZC8/UkjzLYc7-6I/AAAAAAAAqLE/x7PHiBYOyes/s640/Future-Supercontinent-Configurations-3Possibilities-NewScientist-2007.jpg)), the bulk of the landmass is near the poles. Pangaea Proxima is the least bad, but not good. Polar continental landmass tends to accumulate permanent glaciers, something familiar from the current (Antarctica and Greenland icesheets) and recent past state (Quaternary glaciation in North Europe and North America). So, this could be a long ice age.

The question of the length of the ice age has an implication about the transition back to a Greenhouse Earth. Brightening of the Sun proceeds at a rate of about 10% in 1 billion years, which would be 1% in 100 million years. The absolute temperature of Earth is 288 K, so 1% translates to 2.8 K within 100 million years, all other things being equal. Now, if the ice age lasts only 30 million years, we have only about 1 K warming. This won't swing the scale in any direction; humans have already increased the average temperature by 0.8 K and nothing dramatic has happened yet, and even if we burn all fossil fuels we can find, it is unlikely that any dramatically larger change could be done. So, this scenario is ""safe"". With a 300 million year ice age, on the other hand, we'd have a 10 K increase during this time, which is huge. [This graph](https://scimedskeptic.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/fig-1horiz.jpg) shows that between a Greenhouse Earth and an Icehouse Earth, the difference is 7-15 K. 10 K is enough to push the planet out of the ice age, and in a warm age (regularly 25 C) the average temperature would be 35 C, which is unheard of since the late Neoproterozoic ([source](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/whats-hottest-earths-ever-been)). This was before multicellular life. A 10 K increase would certainly cause a massive mass extinction, by destroying all cold habitats and making a lot of regions uninhabitable for multicellular life. So, will the current ice age end in a massive extinction event?

Also, carbon dioxide works as a thermostat to maintain a stable temperature: a higher CO2 content warms the atmosphere and increases carbon burial by plants, a lower CO2 content leads to an ice age that kills the plants, but is eventually counteracted by volcanic CO2 emissions. If the intrinsic (solar-forced) temperature is high enough, the CO2 content cannot go low enough to cause ice ages anymore. Is our ice age the last?

I tried googling it, and the issue is that most articles there gratitiously confuse glacial periods with ice ages and/or global warming.",6,2

After the first few generations we should see EVs become available to more and more people. At some point we'll have an abundance of FFVs. One obvious answer is we need some way to recycle and repurpose the materials. I'm curious if anyone has ideas to accomplish this or ideas on where the recycled materials would see the best useage or weather or not it's feasible to convert vehicles to electric on a global scale. I'm aware of a few that this conversion has already been done to. MARTY the self-driving drifting electric DeLorean is one paricularly awesome example.,9,0

I've been asking around reddit for critiques and this is what I've come up with.

* A percentage of each transaction would be distributed to all users. I'd recommend 2.5% from both ends of the transaction, resulting in a total of 5% every time money changes hands, no ifs ands or buts. Not enough for the unemployed to live comfortably, but enough for them to survive.

* One account per user, verified by social security. In case of theft or fraud, you can report it and get issued a new one. 0.01% of dividends could insure this. Upon conviction of a suspect they would pay a 150% mark up on all purchases until 150% of their debt is paid including legal expenses.

* Redundant bureaucratic schemes would be prohibitively expensive. Fractional reserve banking would inflate dividends to keep up with the economic damage. Paying off credit cards with credit cards would be paying 10% to dividends. Offshore accounts and money laundering would cost at least 10% too. Of course you can forget about wall street trading bots.

* Parents of newborns would receive two thirds of their child's dividends until they reach the age of 10. Then the child and the parents each receive a third until the child is emancipated. At which point the child would receive the third of back dividends on top of their full dividends for the next 18 years.

* Upon death the remainder of the deceased's account will go to the next of kin or whomever the account holder requests.

* This would replace Social Security, Welfare, Unemployment Insurance and several tax credits and loopholes. This would relieve our tax burden by at least a third.

The biggest hold up would be market adoption. This hinges on accountability that comes from a central government. It would not be beneficial for banking.",12,0

I have a idea that involves Quantum Entanglement and Radio Communications.

I think a really advanced civilizations could build arrays of drones and scatter them among the universe! the entire concept behind my idea is if the Drones can broadcast and receive normal radio communications (make it possible to communicate with less advanced civilizations) but it is also controlled and communicated via quantum entanglement by the Advanced civilization.  

would this not allow a civilization to keep a ear open to the entire universe ????

i know it would take a countless time and loads or resources and effort but is this not theoretically possible ?",2,1

The makers of it claim that it boosts short telomeres and regenerate old cells. We all know that telomerase is the way to reverse aging on a genetic level, but how good is this product? According to the wiki, in animal trials it did reverse SOME physiological signs of aging but so far hasn't been proven to actually lengthen life. Also the main ingredient is from Astragalus, which has been used in herbal Chinese medicine. Does the activator in TA-65 justify the cost above just buying Astragalus root? How close are we to isolating a telomerase compound that I can just take to actually lengthen genetic age?

The group which reaches it first will rule over those who did not, for ever.

One very little known fact is that Russia, out of all countries, was a major destination for scientists and technicians during the 18th century.

Russia was not exactly considered as part of Western Civ until Peter the Great opened that country to the West and invited as many Westerners as possible.

Although there were setbacks (Russian reactionaries tried to turn back the clock by moving the capital back to Moscow and putting a grandson of Peter I to the throne to reverse all of the reforms - thankfully that boy-czar was poisoned before he did any real damages),

Petersburg became a hotbed of science and tech, which also housed, out of all people, Bernhard Euler. Unfortunately he left there during the time the above incident took place.

The Romanov dynasty ended on 1763 (although the name was kept till 1918 all Czars after Catharine II were Germans), but still Petersburg was a good place to get away from the turmoils of Europe with strong protection from the Czar. 

They did not mingle with the local population, and Czar's guards made sure nobody messed with these more advanced people. Eventually their descendants became quite dominant in Russian politics, science, and tech, until the Russian Revolution killed or drove almost all of them out.

===

As Europe gets hotter with turmoils, it is likely that ambitious and smart Europeans will find themselves in China, Hong Kong or Singapore where they can walk at night.

HK and Singapore always had a sizable Western enclave; the people living there keep separate from the locals, and the police take a good care of the locals who try to mess with them. Same for the richer Chinese cities like Shanghai or Canton.

With the arrival of smarter Europeans who long to be safe, combined with local talents, it is possible that China (the other two locals are under Chinese influence) could get to the Singularity faster than any Westerner could imagine. 

China has no concern over 'human rights' and other bullshit, and could do a Manhattan Project without answering to its people. And, with the addition of the Europeans fleeing the 'refugees' for a safer location,

(it is likely that parts of the major Chinese cities will be reserved for these new arrivals, with existing inhabitants forcibly removed, something unthinkable in the West but very common in Asia)

Xi Jinping of China will get a reputation of Catharine II of Russia, an ""Enlightened Despot"". 

That's why the West has to speed up on singularity - if the West won't, China will.

The other day I had my 'phone' charging and I went on for a while without it. Then just started to think (for whatever reason) about the relations of my native language of Finnish to other Finno-Ugric language. I like and try to think about all sorts of things all the time, but without my 'phone' I was at a loss, you can't find information or linguistic experts at 5 am whilst trying to get sleep at the same time. My first 'phone' had a green screen with two rows of text possible and the awesome ability to send SMS - the one I'm writing with right now would be a thing from science fiction back then.  Now in my thirties, after reading at least one study (not that big of an N...but it was widely touted news and the results felt scarily accurate) about the internet, especially that tiny googly search engine changing the way we remember things. Everyday things... and about augmentation - this 'probably inevitable path to the idea of trancending this human condition'. 

Gosh. 

In that lost linguistic moment without my 'phone' and the internet I then felt the restrictions of my wetware and started to really miss the information that usually resides within just a few taps away... The information available online can be a crutch, a blessing or just meaningless. The personal revelation that I, now in this time, just by being restricted from being offline was that I'm not the 'same' person without the comfort and access to the web. In a way I augment my everyday life with the web, like we all do here. 

We were all different animals 10-20 years ago. Now we've had these amazing gagdets with increasingly poor battery life and exceedingly more processing prowess and technological convergence with us for a good while - supercomputers of yesteryears in our palms.

[...could just be that I'm just web-addicted]

Tl;dr: Phone battery dead, realized was ""missing"" a part of my memory/brain. Fml? (Edit: guess we're all cyborgs now)

2549,2015-11-21,2015,11,21,22,3tow22,My thoughts on Globalization and the future,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3tow22/my_thoughts_on_globalization_and_the_future/,parissyndrome1988,1448113132,"Since 1990 the world has become connected in ways it never was before. In some ways this has been good I think, I'm glad that people in other countries can enjoy all the material stuff that before the early 90s was only available in a handful of Western countries. Things like Filet o Fishes, ipods, Levis and bananas are great. The increased trade has probably been good at stopping hunger and raising the standard of living in a lot of places.

Yet at the same time, I see globalization as bittersweet and a part of me views it as being ultimately negative in the long run. For one thing the emphasis on comfort and economic growth has IMO caused humanity to become more conservative and less imaginative, which is a huge loss. The emphasis on self gratification is the very reason why racism is making a comeback and why there's been a global shortage of girls since the late 80s, which has led to more sexism in countries that under Communist regimes were making strides towards gender equality (and also sucks for millions of men doomed to loneliness).

The influence of American media and ideology is making the world's cultures disappear and is more or less replacing them with the postmodern capitalist individualist culture of the Western United States, which is a huge loss because if we have only one culture that limits the progress and insight of our species in so many ways.

One also has to ponder if all the massive economic growth since the long 21st century started in 1990 is coming at the cost of future generations, as capitalism appears to have no answer for the environmental crisis looming ahead. Its emphasis on the bottom line is good for increasing microprocessing power but isn't so good at discouraging use of dirty fuels and has accelerated the amount of trash produced probably several fold compared to before globalization. Global warming wasn't even noticeable or significant before the late 80s but if you live in Australia or the western United States it's now blatant and obvious.

Along with the environmental issues, my biggest fear is the rise of conservative and right wing policies in general. Most people would argue we're in an unprecedented age of human rights, peace and welfare, but I disagree. Antisemitism, blatant hatred of poor people (especially the homeless and disabled welfare recipients), and racism towards immigrants is making a comeback. 

When you really think about it, the entire political scene in the world today outside of Latin America and North Korea is conservative and right wing dominated. Both the dominant neoliberal discourse and the alternative narratives like Islamism, libertarianism, Asian authoritarian capitalism ala Xiaoping and Kwan Yeu and Putinism are extremely conservative and anti-egalitarian.

The fact I can talk to people all over the world, something that wasn't possible in 1989 is awesome but I also think there is a huge cost to globalization, and that cost could be our concepts of not only equality but also morality itself. I could envision a future in the late 21st century and beyond when the abundance capitalism created in the 1990s and early 21st century trickles almost entirely to a small global wealthy class and production declines due to shortages of natural resources, yet the income disparity between the rich and poor still continues to widen - essentially plunging the world back into its old state of starvation and destitution being the norm.

Meanwhile I could see a few thousand ultra-rich, genetically modified immortals basically getting to lord over the sickly masses and rightly regard them as an ""inferior race"" because they will be able to augment themselves and produce perfect designer children with superpowers while everyone else is dying of diseases from the past that returned because people believed universal healthcare was evil and vaccination was harmful. 

These ultra-wealthy GMO ""gods"" will be able to pacify people to some degree with the promise they can join them (most likely as labor or sex slaves) and by the celebrity cult where people can live through them vicariously via the media, which of course exists already today. Most likely they'll create their own version of Heaven, perhaps like the space station in the movie Elysium.",10,0

The increasing 'abundance' will not affect the masses who will be priced out by rent, insurance and other indirect costs which will keep them from enjoying it, and they will be driven out from the 'good' stuff and will be driven to Banlieues (isolated suburb enclaves, out of sight and out of mind) where they will spend the rest of their lives, irrelevant to the world's comings and goings.

=====
The oil price fell to the ground but the air ticket prices did not move at all.

The airline execs have no intention to reduce their bonuses just because the oil price fell.

The supply for many positional goods are, I have to say, inelastic. 

Some people here told me land could be created. However, the energy and money expended for such endeavors could be used for profitable use.

Even though there are more things available, things most people desire, like a Harvard diploma, a Manhattan penthouse, etc, by definition have a limited supply.

Few people now know that Fifth Avenue was once full of very wealthy people's mansions instead of high-rises. 

Who knows. The people who drove the world to Singularity will enjoy wealth unimaginable today, and if they want to raze NYC's high rises and build mansions, complete with robotic security and robotic servants, on the Fifth Avenue it will be done, the tenants be damned.

The price of insurance, licenses, fines, and other things can be used to keep the masses out of the 'good things' - they will only be available for those who can afford the high price.

For example, let's talk about the 3-D printer. The govt could issue license for, say, $10,000/year to use a 3-D Printer which will imbed some kind of chip. Something not made by an approved 3-D Printer would melt down if touched by some device.

Such kind of devices could be made so no illegal goods will survive. That's singularity.


===The masses might enjoy a 'material abundance', but if they have to go home in the Banlieues which takes one hour to get out and in , and is only accessible via one road.

With the major cities gentrified away and cleansed of those who can't pay the high rent, tax, utility , etc costs, the masses will live in highly regulated areas with one or two exits - if they start to act strangely the only road out will be blocked , and will be reopened when there is no sign of life in there.

That's singularity.",31,0

People seem to recognize my username, and others have called me out for being too pessimistic, too contrarian. Others have called me a troll. I've also been accused of being too obsessed with this topic. After all, if I think the premise of futurology is bunk (and that we won't see huge technological improvements in our lifetime), why am I even here?

Perhaps I am too pessimistic or gloomy, and perhaps I do post too damn much. But let me take a moment to try and explain my reasoning:

The first thing I want to point out, which is something I've noticed over the years, is that it always seems like every new ""breakthrough"" ends up being a fraction as cool as it initially sounds. It seems like every time there's some new breakthrough or development, you read a little further and it's mostly just hype. You see people who work in the field start to tear it apart and nitpick, and then it's like nothing happened at all. You see this enough times and it takes its toll. I'm not the only one, either. I've seen plenty of other people post ""Okay reddit, tell me why this is bullshit"". 

Another thing to point out is that we've been inundated with reports of rats being cured of this or that, people moving robotic limbs with their brains, breakthroughs in solar energy or batteries or quantum computers, wondrous new materials, and so on and so forth, for years. And yet none of these things ever seem to materialize. Even when no one is debunking a breakthrough and everyone seems to agree that ""Wow, this is cool"", we still never hear about it ever again. Again, if this happens long enough, it can't help but encourage cynicism. The first time you read about stem cells, you're like ""Wow! We are living in the future!"" But when you've read almost a hundred articles about how stem cells (or whatever) is going to ""change everything"", you start to think ""Is it *really*? I bet it's not.""

And then there's the history of futurology. It's been pointed out many times before, but people used to think that we'd be living in space by now. People used to think that we'd be sending astronauts to Mars, and travelling all over the solar system. People used to think we'd have flying cars, fusion energy, robots doing all the work, and all kinds of amazing stuff, all by the year 2000, let alone 2015. And yet here we are, and not only do we still lack all of those things, but now we're making whole new predictions about regenerative medicine and self-driving cars and automation and robots and all this cool stuff that is totally going to happen, you guys, just wait. 

How is it different this time around? Right now, there's people predicting that we'll soon be growing new tissues and organs for patients, altering our genetics with new biotechnologies, and more. There's people predicting that we're on the cusp of a biotech revolution, while others are going on about a potential ""Cambrian Explosion"" in robotics and narrow A.I. People are saying that robotics and A.I. and automation are going to lead to more unemployment. Still others are talking about virtual reality and augmented reality, and how those are going to ""change everything"". And heck, on top of all of this, there's still people saying that we're totally going to colonize Mars, just you wait. And fusion energy, and solar energy, and on and on and on.

How is any of this different from the predictions of decades past? ",24,0

It seems like a smart idea for places where the cost of apartments is skyrocketing (looking at you, San Francisco). Why do I need to rent an apartment or even a room in a house? Maybe it is a better idea to simply adopt a sharing type economy combined with a commune methodology. 

It seems the major problem is obviously the price of the land and restrictive building codes. When you think of a floor in an apartment building, most of that space is wasted by having duplicate private areas (bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens etc.). A better solution would be to have a commune style setup where you have a few bathrooms and a few kitchens. That would save an immense amount of money on the need to buy a bunch of appliances that are going to sit unused for 23 hours every day. The overall idea is to figure out what everyone's major needs are and put everything into a sharing style setup. The end result would be higher efficiency in terms of building use and ultimately lower costs for the renters. A central computer combined with a swipe card (or other ID tracking system) could be used to calculate how much each renter is charged. The fine details could be adjusted based on what the tenants want, based on community vote of course.

I am fascinated by the current excitement (and growing fear) about the potential future of Artificial Intelligence, particularly [Strong AI](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~arihuang/academic/research/strongai3.html). But I am also a bit skeptical of what seems to be a growing consensus that it will come into existence if only present trends in computing continue.   
  
My question is whether the difference between organic human intelligence and current state of the art AI is a function of quantity or quality. If the difference is in quantitative processing power, it is reasonable to expect that strong AI is a foregone conclusion, and with Moore's Law we may get there faster than we expect.   
  
I believe however that the difference between human and computer intelligence is a qualitative one. Specifically, the ability to both create rules, and then make a choice whether to obey or break them, strikes me as impossible for a computer to ever do in our current conception. This ability is fundamental to the qualities we consider most human - judgement and creativity. We use judgement to decide that a human system needs to be changed, reject the laws that underpin it, and ultimately create new rules to live by. Cutting edge science and art are fundamentally about expanding our known physical and mental world. As far as I can tell we do not have a great understanding of how this works from a neurological perspective, yet we seem to expect that computers will soon be able to replicate forward thought. 
   
It reminds me of some of the excitement around the early space age. The tools invented then were amazing, and predictions abounded about our future life in space. Unfortunately, the rocket equation is a bitch, and as a result space travel has not progressed much since its inception. We would need a qualitatively different method of moving resources from earth to orbit in order to achieve the dreams of the early space age. My question is, does computer science have an answer to this? Is it possible for computers to break the rules that are written for them, and create new ones in their place?",7,1

For one thing TCP/IP and packet switching is a very inefficient way to transfer information, which is why Voice over IP still sucks compared to traditional telephony. Its primary strength is in its simplicity and versatility. The only reason today's Internet is so fast is because there's so much bandwidth now.

The second big limitation with the Internet is all the information stored on it is located in distinct servers with distinct geographical locations. This is a limitation for two reasons. First of all the information is not permanent, and will disappear if the server disappears and nobody cares to copy the information. Secondly, the fact that all the data on the Internet has a physical geographic location you can pinpoint means the Internet can still be censored and parts of it blocked in certain countries.

What I would suggest replace the Internet is something I call the Mirror. The Mirror would be a global mainframe optical computer with thousands of ""nodes"" all over the world, but functioning as a single machine rather than discrete servers.

When data is saved into the Mirror the information would not be stored on a single node, but rather as a series of relationships between all the nodes in the system - much like how memories in the brain are ""holographic"". For example if I was to upload a text file to the Mirror, it might store one byte each in several thousand different nodes around the world and the program would manifest by requesting a ""header"" of this distributed file which would reconstruct the document by sending what I call a ""domino request"" through the whole system. This would be possible with the advent of high speed and reliable optical computing.

Having information stored ""holographically"" throughout what would amount to a huge mainframe has the benefit of making information equally accessible everywhere in the world and makes data rot a thing of the past. If one node disappeared the file would still exist, it would just be a tiny bit reduced in quality. If people wanted a ""right to be forgotten"" like in Europe it would still be possible via what I call ""antiprograms"" - like antimatter, but meant to destroy information.

The power of the Mirror would be mind boggling because of its nature as a singular machine. This would mean that it could have very powerful AI engines, making things like URLs unnecessary because it would immediately understand what you were looking for. It would also make the system much faster because it would be like everything was on your local disk.

People would access the Mirror by using devices much in the way we do now but you could do far more as well, such as 3D printing, transmitting scents and touches as easily as sights and sounds, and virtual travel.

One use of it that could be seen as ""interesting"" is taking the city-building genre from videogames, e.g. Caesar IV, into virtual reality.

Take this street, [Hopefold Drive, Walkden, Worsley, Greater Manchester, England](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.5208883,-2.3886455,3a,75y,23.31h,88.97t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sn-maf5FOuwn6QIqyPN0PPw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656), a normal, suburban housing estate street [this was built in the 1980s or 1990s, as far as I know]. I used this as an example as it is somewhere I know in real life [in line with the rules of this site, it's not actually anyone's personal address, just a street].

Imagine if there was virtual reality that allowed you to change the layout of the street, virtually demolish housing, change the settings from day to night etc. 

It would be good for people who like things such as [world-building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding), but also has interactive gaming potential, currently Second Life is the closest thing to it in terms of actual interactive worldbuilding.

Looking at it from my perspective, as someone who enjoys games like Caesar IV and is a roadgeek [of sorts], virtual reality could give me the opportunity to try things that would not be possible in real life due to political or legal reasons [e.g. changing street layout, demolish housing, try different building usage etc., different class of living etc.].

The current image linked to shows late 1970s/early 1980s housing with a concrete 1970s streetlight, powered by sodium oxide [SOX].

Imagine if I wanted to replace it with a new housing estate, or different streetlighting, and different street layout? [yes, that's the citybuilder in me coming out, but I was a regular Caesar III and Caesar IV player]. Virtual reality could allow that to happen.

Virtual reality might be a good way for sports car fans to get their fix in different terrains without actually physically damaging themselves. In fact, it could be extended further to people wanting to actually drive [assuming human-driven cars are banned in the future].

That's a scenario of mine I thought about. 

What do you think will be the more interesting and/or different uses of virtual reality in the future?

I'm not talking about it for things like shopping, or mundane things etc. but other, more social activities etc.

By the way, the timeline I am looking at is further down the future, when it's more advanced and most jobs are fairly automated. 

All this is hypothetical, of course.",65,40

In that movie the Warren Beatty character changes bodies to stay alive, by the help of a 'guardian angel'.

For reasons not explicable for me, he opts to remain a quarterback, rather than living in a millionaire's body. When that movie was made on 1978 qbs made maybe $100k/yr (no more than $250k/yr now). Most QBs around that era now make their money by signing events and selling memorabilia, which means no money for second-string QBs.

Anyways, it might be more feasible to switch around bodies by downloading minds to there, like a Flower to Algernon, rather than having to enhance aging bodies.

As head-transplant tech gets more advanced, I foresee such scenario. If that tech was available during Commodus' time, I am sure the Emperor would have changed his body into the best gladiator's one without even blinking.

As time goes on, there might not even be a need for surgery. Something like a chip could be changed, like the USIM card in a cell phone.

Please criticize.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3upf75/personal_notes_and_theories_on_reality_and/,pecina,1448799355,"I've been writing down some thoughts and ideas on reality for some time now and I think it would be better to place them here for criticism.
The trigger was finding the recently published interesting notes from Eliott Edge's on living in a simulation.

Here goes:

Let us assume our universe has been ""set-up"" in an arbitrary way, by defining a baseline set of interaction rules between point-particles.
As the point-particles interact, certain configurations and higher-order structures of particles are drawn out from the noise, based on positive stacked probability of these events (meaning that the original baseline rules are in the favor of such configurations and their stability). The first assumption to make is that the all what follows is based on the original baseline set of interaction rules, but it is still very hard to predict the exact direction of ""interaction complexity development"". What is meant by this is that sets of particles, with their own interactions which get more complex when they stick together, are itself a model of the reality, since they are risen above the noise due to their ""adeptness"" to persist in the baseline interaction rules. It is a recursive statement - the interaction rules specified at the beginning of the universe implicitly (e.g. in the physical constants) contain primitive self-sustaining models of itself which will arise from the noise over a period of time, since they are statistically more probable.
If the primitive self-sustaining models fill the universe, they will then expand by creating models of themselves to model the ""new reality"". Thus, the universe develops by creating ever-complexer interaction models.
On a high level, the very complex entities (let us take living beings as an example) internalize some external process by creating a simulation of it in themselves.
Can it be assumed that this is what connects the mind processes of imagination, learning and awareness?
A kind of positive feedback loop which triggers when the models of reality, internalized inside our brain using models of models of ... of basic interactions which got probability stacked and favored over time, get confirmed by experiencing this very model in the reality? 

Some questions which arise from these notes and seem to be shared among community here: 
- Is this universe a self-executing theory of such a specific universe with specific starting interaction baseline? (I guess most common game-of-life question)
- What happens to / what is the goal of an entity which has mastered all the eventualities and all interactions by running all the self-executing theories and simulations of universes?
- Is the first life a consequence of starting interaction baseline or an inverse model of the universe in the making or why not both?


Life could be a result of stacked statistical probabilities, which are triggered by initial rules and then stacked by being steered/naturally selected from outside towards behavior game the system by surviving and increasing the odds of further existence.
The secret sauce is in the interactions, until we have a better understanding of basic interactions or the construction of the primitive point-particles. 

- Taking the ""we are a simulated theory of reality"" approach, isnt it obvious that our particular model of the universe has to be wrong, given the number of possibilities for life to reach our phase of existence?

Even worse:
- Is our entire analysis bound by cause-relation mindset written into the baseline rules of our universe? 

Limits of interaction propagation speed can be the cause the importance of locality of information (creating clusters of particles which are spatially close to each other).
- Does this lead to a self-modelling maximal-informational system, having defined maximal information as the ability to predict everything outside the model to the best of the entities interactive abilities (perception), using only internalized models of reality?
- Is the state of maximal information the one in which the subsystem (detached from the rest of reality by some interaction propagation limit such a speed of light) becomes an interaction itself, a super-particle with super-complex interactions which require minimal exchange of information and huge internal processing power (two self-aware galaxies talking to each other with just a few words, both having a complete model of the other but lacking its perception over time they talked last time)?

- Do we have a blind spot for entities whose particles are spatially close in completely different time frames i.e. an entity which lives throughout big bangs and comes back assembled again every history of space period T?

- Could this whole direction of thought be summarized as everything = statistically stacked evolution of baseline particle interactions?

This, of course, assuming that the elementary primitive particles are themselves not little information processing machines, which will in time change the laws of physics to explore other directions of reality. Perhaps all elementary particles are a kind of ""user's illusion"" or artifacts of an information-processing entity, which executes a set of universe-fabric instructions and can switch through different routines to seemingly become different ""particles"" to an interaction-based observer(such as us). It could be interesting to follow the analogy of a program trying to understand itself and its creators through analysis of the data it might have access to, such as program code and its own design. Such self-analysis might enable the program to build up an approximate model of the mental processes of its creators, since the creators invented the programming language and the program design as a paradigm of their own thought processes. What could the elementary particle design tell us about the entities running the ""universe simulation"" and what is the limit of our self-analysis if we are truly simulated?
This remark brings me the other possibility: We can assume there is a particle-interaction-complexity explosion towards ""above"" or towards more interaction complexity and more complicated entities being developed through time. However, maybe we have an ever increasing window of possibilities in both directions, since we can create infinite theories about the primitive particles and the interactions (in the direction ""down"") which got us here where we are in the first place.
It costs time and energy to move downwards and to understand elementary particles and this could be proportional to the time and probabilistic cost of moving upwards and understanding more complex interactions and entities.

Simulation is one of the ways of exploring both directions, but ultimately it also needs time and energy.
This might be reason why we exist - simulating interaction theories either ""downwards"" towards the baseline or ""upwards"" towards the complexity limits of a specific universe. Perhaps the way ""downwards"" is ultimately only feasible with massive time and energy investments, since it is exploratory/includes learning of new information and cannot be faithfully simulated.

-Do the limits of this universe, such as speed of light, limits the size of the maximal interaction particle / borders of what one massive super-entity can become?

Coming back to the idea of complex entities which internalize models of environment: 
Does consciousness arise in a system with a combined model of itself and the environment, doing predictions on itself in a closed loop? Basically, the continuation of the process of modelling the environment by modelling itself as a part of the environment. Consciousness might not be able to understand itself, since it cannot model the particles and interactions which give birth to it. It tries to create a second-order model of itself, but this model cannot be precise enough, since it is based on neural-primitives to model effects which arose on lower-than-neural-primitives.
Is any system with a model of itself with a model of the model of itself conscious?
Are the moments when the model matches reality moments of subjective experience?

If we would to build up an entity with the ability to remember, with models of motivation (must want to procreate etc. perhaps can be achieved through creating limited mental resources which need to replenished in time intervals), model of itself (not only the body but also a model of it's own thought process) and single point in which all sensor information from outside is being synced to the approximately same time, in order to support ""centralized"" decision making and also making these decisions conscious with delay, through comparing the self-model to perceived reality... could this be called a conscious entity?
Does the whole idea of ever-complexer interactions and entities only make sense if it results with such an entity, which can observe everything and achieve maximal information density?",4,5

For instance and for starters have a tube that runs from Los Angeles to Las Vegas but instead of running it over ground have it built under ground perhaps about ten feet down and along the side of already existing roads, or even built under the roads, the tube wouldn't need to be as large as one needed to carry people as it is only used to deliver consumer products like foods and merchandise between cities at a very fast speed.

Something like this might also be built underwater so as to transport products from country to country so that a purchase from the USA to New Zealand would arrive same day. This would also be much more energy friendly and cleaner than using cars boats and planes to transport goods.

Anyway this is something I was just thinking about and it seemed like a cool thing, sure it would cost a lot to build and take time but as the technology is already being tested I thought why just use it for people.

I actually believe HTTP and TCP/IP are fundamentally flawed and will inevitably lead to the kind of centralization present in the telephone and fax systems, because they are still based on data that is stored in servers that have fixed geographical locations and governments and communications corporations have an inherent edge over ""freedom"" and more capital to control the content on the Internet than everyone else.

I suggested the idea of storing files in a distributed fashion and making a global optical computing mainframe that uses AI to route and locate information, and making a ""universal browser"" that could represent any sort of information in a form understandable and manipulable by humans, but people thought it was pie in the sky.

The Internet and Web were designed for the 1980s and in my opinion only work well because bandwidth today is so great and big capital hasn't completed its conquest of the Internet yet.

Can you realistically see anything replacing the deeply flawed (if undeniably powerful) Internet protocol and the World Wide Web in the near future, or even 1000 years from now? The first ""Internet"" the telegraph lasted from the 1840s to the 1990s, which is about 150 years.
