I hope to be part of a future when the elderly will not be anything like the elderly of today. Some kind of nano-process must renovate our bodies one cell at a time, at billions of cells renovated per second (at least?), in order to restore our bodies to the way they were in our peak condition (which I believe is late adolescence.) 

What a way to extend our lives indefinitely, as long as we have this restoration ritual every few decades. Or this could be a one-and-done deal, where we're injected with a super-medicine that'll monitor our bodies at all times and renovate any part of it as they need renovation. Therefore cells never accumulate the characteristics of aging because a realtime bio-monitoring system could keep everything in peak condition, thereby making us look and feel late-adolescent indefinitely.

However, it helps to have an explanation for how these will come about and work. That's where you come in.

Also, how soon might this be? Will we live to enjoy this new development of our biology?",4,0

Here is a thought for today: the future is what we make of it, nothing more and nothing less. Are we futurists who act, or just more eyeballs?

Last year the people of /r/futurology helped kick off a [successful $150,000 fundraiser](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2hzld3/hey_rfuturology_lets_make_a_little_future_well/) for SENS rejuvenation research, early stage science aimed at bringing an end to frailty and disease in aging. Hundreds of you donated, and there was a great conversation about building the future, not just sitting on the sidelines and spectating.

This year Fight Aging!, Josh Triplett, Christophe &amp; Dominique Cornuejols, forever-healthy.org, and a generous anonymous donor have put up a $125,000 matching fund in support of the work of the SENS Research Foundation. Until the end of 2015 we'll match every dollar donated to the SENS Research Foundation with a dollar from the fund. Your donations and these funds will go towards research that will change the world by helping to remove the pain, suffering, and disease from old age, to ultimately enable the old to be just as vital and healthy as the young, and greatly extend healthy human longevity. The SENS Research Foundation is a 501(c)3 organization and donations are charitable in the US.

**What is SENS Research?**

What is SENS research? I'd hope you all know by now. Aging and all age-related disease - from Alzheimer's to cancer to heart issues - are caused by specific forms of cell and tissue damage. The SENS programs aim to overcome the most obvious hurdles that stand in the way of producing therapies to periodically repair this damage, thereby creating rejuvenation in the old and preventing degenerative aging in younger adults.

**SENS is Moving Out of the Lab Thanks to Donors Like You**

In 2015 we SENS supporters can do more than say ""hey, please fund this stuff that needs to get done in order to fix aging, results to follow."" Philanthropic funding has been going on at a modest but growing level for a decade now, and the most advanced results of that funding are moving out of the laboratory and into young companies founded for clinical development. We can point to specific examples where the donors of past years can now see the first fruits of their donations, some of which are outlined in the [latest SENS Research Foundation annual report (PDF)](http://sens.org/sites/srf.org/files/reports/SENS%20Research%20Foundation%20Annual%20Report%202015.pdf). For example:

1) From 2008, donors to the Methuselah Foundation and then SENS Research Foundation collectively helped fund the work of the Marisol Corral-Debrinski lab on allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes, a way to rescue cells in aging tissues from mitochondrial DNA damage. That was successful and in the years since then these researchers founded [Gensight](http://www.gensight-biologics.com/), a company that is now devoting tens of millions of dollars to establishing the first clinical trials of this technology for inherited mitochondrial disease. Yet without the funding at the earliest stage, provided by forward-thinking SENS supporters, that early stage work struggled to find a patron. This is the sort of difference we can make.

2) The SENS Research Foundation has for years been using donor funds to support efforts to clear senescent cells from tissues, to remove their insidious contribution to the aging process. In 2015 the Methuselah Foundation and SENS Research Foundation have provided seed funding for the startup company Oisin Biotech that will be further developing one of these methodologies: these clearance technologies are leaving the lab and starting on their own journey to the clinic, one that will see them attract far greater funding. But again, without the philanthropy, these are projects that languished unfunded by the institutional research establishment in their early stages.

3) One of the first and longest-running SENS programs was aimed at clearing age-related chemical junk from the cellular recycling organelles called lysosomes. With age, these organelles become clogged and faulty, and cells drown in garbage and broken components. The SENS Research Foundation has produced drug candidate molecules from studies of bacteria known to consume these compounds, and the long-time supporter Jason Hope has founded [Human Rejuvenation Technologies](http://www.humanrejuvenationtechnologies.com/) to develop the first round of treatments based on this technology, aimed initially at removing the characteristic blood vessel plaques of atherosclerosis.

**Help Lay the Groundwork for the Treatments of the Early 2020s**

The donors of 2008 are feeling pretty good about the assistance they provided to SENS back then. Donors today will be laying the groundwork for many necessary treatments that are still awaiting their turn in the sun. There is breaking of cross-links, making amyloid clearance a reality, suppressing telomere extension in all forms of cancer, and more. The SENS Research Foundation and its broad supporting network of researchers and other allies is a proven mechanism for making highly efficient use of donor funds to remove roadblocks and get other sources of funding interested in the work that has to be done. I know of no better way to speed progress towards greatly extended healthy human longevity.

**Did You Know That Early Stage Research Costs Little?**

Most discussions of medicine involve enormous sums of money, but near all of that is involved in taking new science from prototype to product available in the clinic. The actual work of performing early stage research to create those prototype treatments has become very cheap, especially over the past two decades in which progress in biotechnology has followed the same trends as progress in computing. Today $50,000 can fund a significant work of original research that would have required tens of millions of dollars and an entire laboratory back in the mid 1990s. Research is cheap; it is the clinical application of research that remains painfully expensive. But if you have a prototype treatment for aging demonstrated in the lab - well, money is no longer an issue, because people will fall over themselves to fund its commercialization, as is now happening for some aspects of SENS.

The state of SENS rejuvenation research today is that it continues to gather support, it is breaking out of the lab for the first time, but many areas are still in need of funding to speed up progress in the early stages of research. Unfortunately this is the stage of development for any new technology in which established funding institutions essentially sit on the sidelines and wait for a technology demonstration or a prototype to turn up out of the blue. So if we want to see faster progress, we have to help make it happen ourselves. We've done this already for some areas of the SENS portfolio, and now we have to build on that for the rest.

**We Have Fundraiser Posters!**

You can find a set of posters for this fundraiser at Fight Aging!:

[https://www.fightaging.org/fund-research/#posters](https://www.fightaging.org/fund-research/#posters)

Show them off to your friends and print them out for noticeboards. The more attention we draw to this cause, the better. Treatment of aging is reaching a tipping point in the public eye, moving from something seen as science fiction to something seen as science - and the faster that happens the better off we'll all be.

**Launched in Coordination with Longevity Day**

The 1st of October marks the launch of this fundraiser, but it is also the [International Day of Older Persons](http://www.un.org/en/events/olderpersonsday/), and the [International Longevity Alliance](http://longevityalliance.org/) would like this to become an official Longevity Day. This year, just like last year, groups of futurists around the world will be holding events to mark the occasion. Join in!",51,386

Creativity is the use of imagination or original ideas to create something. Imagination is the faculty of having original ideas, and there seems to be no reason why that requires a conscious mind to be at work. Creativity can simply be the act of combining two existing ideas (perhaps from different domains of expertise) in a novel way.

The eminent 19th-century chemist August Kekule solved the riddle of the molecular structure of benzene while day-dreaming, gazing into a fire. True, he had spent a long time before that pondering the problem, but according to his own account, his conscious mind was not at work when the creative spark ignited. You might argue that Kekules sub-conscious was the originator of the insight, and that a sub-conscious can only exist where there is consciousness, but that seems to me an assertion that needs proving.

Can computers be creative? When Google researchers installed a feedback loop in an image recognition neural network, the result was those fabulously hallucinogenic images. To deny that they were creative is surely to distort the meaning of the word.

Art is something different. It involves the application of creativity to express something. It might be beauty, emotion, or (my personal favourite) a profound insight into the condition of conscious life. There are probably as many definitions of art as there are people who have sought one, but I suspect that most of us would agree that to qualify as art, a piece of work has to be able to say something to other conscious beings about the experience of the artist. (If that disqualifies a good deal of what is currently sold under the banner of art, then so be it. In fact, three cheers, I reckon.)

To say something about your own experience clearly requires you to have had some experience, and that would seem to require consciousness. Therefore it seems to me that until artificial general intelligence (AGI) arrives, AIs can be creative but not artistic. This in turn means that while Donna Tartt and Kazuo Ishiguro are probably OK for a few decades, Wilbur Smith and James Patterson have chosen the timing of their careers expertly, and their publishers better find something different to do.",5,5

I believe that, when genetic engineering of the unborn will become safe and available, a country must subsidize it, unless it want's o become a third world country. 
This is my logic:

1. If you allow it, and: 
A: Let the ""market decide"", then we would see a genetic cast system in one or two generations. With the majority never being able to actually compete, and the rich would get away with even more of the pie. Some baseline humans might be able to rise to the top or middle class, but they would be  statistical noise.

B: Your country would be in a major disadvantage to the counties that would do so. Even if the engineering would be on the soft side; not supermen. But people that has a decreased risk of getting diseases, cancer and obesity. Higher impulse control, a modest bump in IQ, better concentration, etc. 
Just like GMO crops, that can produce better yield with less resources, the nation with subsidized genetic engineering would be able to produce a more productive society for a extremely low cost. This would make the country extremely competitive and attractive for global business interests. The nations that won't have it subsidized, will be out competed.

2. If you ban the procedure in a Luddite fright, you will end up in the same position as 1A. it only takes one country, out of the hundreds that exist on our world, to allows the procedures. After that you will see every family, with money and resources, travel there and come back with a genetically enhanced baby. Which would force most rich families to do this, unless they will be out competed in their social strata. 

Both 1A and  point 2, will make social mobility completely impossible. Even if you are a libertarian, you should endorse this. because other wise you would have have freedom in theory only. There won't be any freedom in a practical cast system, with every facet of power in the hands of the genetically gifted.

This is completely wrong, and a dangerous misunderstanding of economics.

To replace a human worker, a robot merely needs to be cheaper than them - but it doesn't necessarily need to be much cheaper. If it costs a company $9.90 an hour for robotic labor, versus $10 an hour for human labor, you're only saving 1% of your costs. Thus, it is possible for robotic labor to replace human labor without significant costs savings. This removes the possibility of lower prices - if the costs of production only fall by a small amount, then prices are unlikely to fall by more than a small amount as well.

Moreover, the cost of labor is only a portion of the cost of doing business - the costs of shipping and production, raw materials and the movements of materials from place to place, often play a large role in the final price of a product. While obviating the need for a driver or miner is helpful, you're still consuming resources in order to produce and transport things from place to place, using infrastructure, and otherwise doing things which take up resources - resources which are ultimately both limited, and which cost money.

The net result of all this is that prices do not fall to zero in an automated economy, because costs don't fall to zero. As such, the necessity for earning a wage still exists - stuff in the future society wouldn't be free.

And moreover, people would still need to work. Automation tends to push things uphill - you get rid of unskilled labor and replace it with increasingly skilled labor which is responsible for maintaining and even optimizing the automation, and keeping production running. Indeed, this is already happening in real life - factories which employ mostly skilled laborers, and yet which still produce the same amount of product. These people would still be producing useful things in exchange for goods and services, and would expect to be compensated for their time - they aren't slaves.

And why should these people produce goods for people who do nothing for them in return?

There's no good reason for this at all - indeed, they'd be better off without them, and be able to redirect their efforts into producing things which are useful for them.

So, others would need to still perform useful services as well in exchange for commodities. In the US, the service sector has taken over the economy, and this trend is likely to continue into the future - people will provide ever more sophisticated and specific services for other people.

Indeed, in many ways, this is a response to past displacement of labor - originally, 100% of people were involved in food-gathering. Today, it is closer to 2%. Then we transitioned to industry, but nowadays, industry only makes up a fraction of the economy.

At neither step did humans simply stop working - instead, they continued to work even as their greater efficiency allowed fewer people to do previously time-intensive tasks, freeing them up to take more sophisticated jobs.

In the future, this trend will simply continue - jobs will grow increasingly sophisticated over time, providing people with goods and services which were previously problematic to produce because no one had the time/resources to do it. But simply not working won't be an option, because you are, at that point, treating other people as your slaves - saying that their work is yours, without giving anything back in return.

Ultimately, economic exchanges are a form of mandatory altruism which allows people to specialize and produce things which they would otherwise be unable to produce, be that a new TV or an excellent massage.",23,2

It always goes something like, ""Robots won't replace jobs because there will always be demand for things robots can't do - at least until we get AGI and that's the singularity so it'll be all over by then anyways.""

I've never found this argument compelling, because job training takes time and automation seems to be getting faster - what with improvements in deep learning, etc.  But on the other hand, I'm very aware of my ability to be wrong so I'm always looking to challenge my beliefs.  In the end I find myself very frustrated with people who don't provide a good counter to my beliefs so in this case I've decided to do their jobs for them.  The following arguments are my best attempt to argue, contrary to my beliefs, that narrow AI and general purpose robotics will not destroy the need for most human labor.  


**Economic Agents vs Economic Infrastructure.**

A market is composed of what might be called, ""economic agents"" or actors capable of taking economic actions.  A economic actor has a degree of skill or specialization and takes advantage of the local economic infrastructure in order to multiply his productivity.  A robot or a piece of software is not an agent, and in fact is owned by another person.  The bot's owner in this case is the agent and the bot itself is simply infrastructure multiplying his efforts.  ""Ah!"" you say, ""But Distributed Autonomous Organizations *do* own themselves and thus qualify to as economic agents and thus can replace jobs!""  And you'd be right.  But DAOs are limited in the kinds of economic activity they can reasonably take.  Mostly they excel at commoditized goods and services where the demand is well understood.  Even if you made a single humanoid robot a DAO and sent it to work at a job site somewhere, it would have to be able to accept job training in the same way as a human, learn the job as fast as a human, and protect itself from fraud as well as a human.  That last one in the kicker and it's the reason DAOs will struggle to do anything that's not commoditized.  

**Robots as a Service.**  
There comes a point in Information Technology where you have *so much* of a resource that you actually can't make effective use of it.  Amazon's cloud service is an example of this.  There's no way Amazon could use all their computers to improve their core business.  They'd have to expand into web search or some other area in a crowded market where they have no experience or skill.  So what did they do?  They rented out their infrastructure.  Robots are perfectly capable of being sold as a service, passing on the savings and preventing the average entrepreneur from needing quite so much startup capital.  Amazon (in a sense) created Netflix this way.  So to will many large corporations create the innovative companies of tomorrow.  Today we have small teams of half-a-dozen programmers writing apps like Instagram that produce a billion dollars of value - or at least large companies like facebook valued them as producing that much value.  Tomorrow we will have small teams of programmers building entire cities in a few months time.  

Okay so there's my argument.  I will admit that it doesn't convince me, but the conversation hasn't been evolving like it should.  People have just been saying the same things over and over, so I thought I'd toss the other side some ammunition and see what happened.

We talked about Uber having self-driving cars, obviating the need for taxi drivers or drivers in general. So taxi service would become automated and made more efficient.

Traffic due to accidents would diminish significantly, and 2-dimensional travel would possibly slowly make way for 3-dimensional travel, aka flying cars. If the technology for flying cars is created (and we're pretty close I think), the self-driving car is the crucial step towards it in terms of safety. So many accidents are caused by poor drivers on the road, and self-driving cars have shown to reduce that by 90% or more. Flying cars would then go on to change society as we see it.

Personal automated mobility means that there might not be any more licensing, DMVs would no longer exist. DD's wouldn't exist either, and they can enjoy drinking with their friends!

Those are the simple things I can think of. Marrying this to home automation would make for drastic changes in society.

I co-host a podcast Almost Educational  My co-host and I are both High School teachers and once a week we bring topic, thesis statement, thought experiment or game to the table we would like to discuss with students in class but cannot due to time and curriculum. We try to ground them in research, data, philosophical arguments, literature and historical context. Some topics include, The Geopolitics of Space Colonization, What if Detroit won the 1968 Olympics? An Alternative History of the Korean War, Trans humanism spurred by Modern Day Sports, and exploring the concept of Canon through James Bond

We are debating bringing the topic of around the rise of Corporatocracy as a future form of legitimate government.  Seeing that in the past 75 years with the rise of the military industrial complex, privatization of prisons, American educational system though charter schools, for profit university system.  Corporate personhood, and the rise of private military contractors, and Li Keqiang recently meeting with American corporate heads as well as American heads of state and so on

First am on way off?  Is this too silly a notion?

Second can any of you direct me to some resources around this subject?

However, even the worst of the sociopaths tend to have some empathy to their own 'loved ones'.  At least they are less harsh to their family members than to others. The worst of worst might be harsh even to them, but they still tend to have attachment to something, even the pleasure of killing or destruction.

I do see that when civilization is going to break the barriers to reach Type I or singularity, the 'new human', 'transhuman' or whatever will be completely devoid of human emotions, even pleasure, and would be totally rational beings.

The challenges of a Type I / Singularity world will be vastly different from the challenges of now, even beyond the wildest imaginations of Plato and Aldous Huxley who never spent a day under Singularity.

I do think that their world is too different from our world for them to feel any kind of emotion for any given situation, and all of them will just act according to the most rational way possible.

The situation of the new civilization would be such that emotions and feelings will just be unnecessary luxuries, and will go the way of tails in humans. I think that to reach the next civ all emotions, such as reacting to the protest of the people who would be bothered by experiment facilities for the breakthrough tech, would have to be silenced before.

Now, I would like to hear your thoughts about this subject. I don't necessarily mean to create another post about the future of jobs, no. (there are a lot of 'future jobs' threads out there) I would like to gain some insight in ways of making money in the future. 

Of course, we'll have to define some parameters; for instance: 

- In this thread, I'm assuming that because of automation, a lot of people have lost their jobs. (They are now on unemployment benefits and cannibalising their life-savings etcetera...)

- Humanity has invented a human level AGI. 

- Policymakers have yet to implement a UBI or negative income tax, or any other solution for that matter.

- Any job that is invented can and will be done by bots, because they are cheaper and better.


The question now remains; what would the average joe do to make a living? Surely good ole Joe wouldnt be able to afford all those fancy autonomous bots, or would he? And even if he could, wouldn't the markets die out because of lack of demand? I mean, if my roof leaks and i have an autonomous bot at my disposal, why call a plumber or a carpenter? But i digress, onwards with the questions:

Could we all be entrepreneurs? Would we be able to compete with big corporations such as Google (or Alphabet, if you will) or Foxconn? Personally I think we (the average Joe, that is) would be like an inclined plane, wrapped helically around an axis... 
I'm just curious, what do you think?

(to make it easier to reply, i numbered the questions down below; feel free to copy and paste, so the replies are easier to read.)

1. How would the average Joe make a living?
2. Would the average joe be able to afford AGI/bots?
3. Could we all be entrepreneurs? And also, in relation to question 2, if average Joe has bots/AGI, would anybody still need services (like plumbing, carpentry) or would the bot they own do it all? (if so, how would we make money?)
4. Would we be able to compete with big corporations such as Google/Wal-mart/Amazon etc?

Looking forward to reading your replies! P.s. Not a native English speaker.

Is it possible that in fact they continue to build jets but really plan on drones? Chinese admiral laughed at one of our (USA) newest ships saying he could destroy it with a bunch of fishing boats loaded with high explosives.

I think we should stop planning on wars against ourselves (which is of course what they are, wars against fellow humans) because they just seem futile. I don't think a major conflict will ever happen again and maybe it is our friendly military industrial complex that gets fed by wars in Iraq, etc. -- only the people of smaller nations have to suffer. And we wonder why 911 happened.",7,0

The potential applications are nothing short of futuristic and quite profound.  

The presentation also does a nice job in summarizing the recent push toward commercialization by various companies.  If LENR truly works as the evidence appears to suggest, then the world could change in very fundamental and remarkable ways.

I've been wondering if we have been looking at this the wrong way round. We have been thinking of AI gaining a conscience and removing the unnecessary humans from many aspects of life. However, perhaps it could be seen as a natural progression.

We've been trying to create human like AI with reasoning and probably a sense of morality in the future, so perhaps we are simply trying to evolve albeit artificially. The robots would presumably have a deep complex conscience and natural learning system like us, and probably would look quite a lot like us but with as with every evolution, a resistance to what the last was affected by, which would be mortality in our case.

Usually with such an evolution the old species would die off, but in this case I would believe we would continue on with some form of equality. However from my little understanding of evolution, it would seem we will need several generations of artificial lives before they actually could exceed our capabilities.

At the same time, there also has been plenty of news about the threat which hacking poses to the implementation of autonomous cars.

How do you foresee this being worked around? 

Off the top of my head, I suppose two possible suggested solutions as ""hack-proof programming"" and ""non-connected vehicles"". But the former seems improbable, and the latter would greatly reduce functionalities. Is my analysis incorrect, or are there other possible solutions?

Within fifteen years, driverless cars will begin to take over our roads. They will eliminate taxicab drivers and may wipeout the need to have your own car. But this near future is not isolated to automobiles. Automation will be in our kitchens, grocery stores, coffee shops, bars, and hospitals. They will start pouring us beers. Theyll be handling our packages. And with little human interaction, they will [build our homes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKoQMD0QZQs). There is no limit to our creativity for how we can replace low-skill labor with a robot. As exciting as this future sounds, there are serious implications. [Employment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU).

During our last great economic transformation, industrialization allowed society to focus on higher-skilled occupational fields, such as finance, medicine, and engineering. Our world adapted from primarily agricultural employment to mainly a service-based economy. But automation will bring a paradigm shift in humanity when little work will be required of us to sustain our basic needs. If we do not experience fundamental economic changes, rampant unemployment may soon follow. [Basic income](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1oscos/basic_income_a_new_human_right_307/ccv6fmu) does provide some relief in our current system, but it ignores the growth and nurturing of an individual. As a society, we need to decide if we want our children to live in a [feudal future](https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/1uvqxj/are_we_at_a_tipping_point_for_jobs_and_society/ceopql0) of haves and have nots or a world where we can unconditionally provide food, water, shelter, a world-class education, and an opportunity to every person and child. If society wants to avoid a violent clash, it needs to begin utilizing the power of our communities.

&amp;nbsp;

##**Crowd Voting**

Since the mass expansion of the Internet during the early 2000s, people have been engaged in each others likes, interests, and opinions. Until recently, the right tools werent available to utilize these pieces of data. Bandwidth was [expensive](http://d2mtr37y39tpbu.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DUP401-Figure-3.jpg). Graphics werent [exactly the most attractive](http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/apple-early-homepage.jpg). And it was tough to go viral in [chat rooms](http://g.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/poster/2013/12/3023056-poster-p-aol.jpg). But we got better at everything. Running a website became cheap. Massive social networks made it easier to spread information. The Internet now is clean, pretty, and approachable. With the help of these improvements and a little math, many consumer industries can embrace user-driven crowd voting networks.

In the same vein as crowdsourcing, crowd voting allows for a community to centrally gather and utilize reviews of a product. Replacing its current existence as supplemental info, reviews are at the core of a crowd voted marketplace. Brands can rely on a marketplace to promote its product solely on merit. Users can be guaranteed of a marketplace without the advertisement of inferior brands. Crowd voting empowers an amateur with few resources to have immediate exposure to all potential consumers. Removing third-party distributors releases a producer from region and licensing issues. With capitalist motivation retained, crowd voting allows producers to shift resources from advertising and sales to employment and innovation.

Certain characteristics help the viability of a product sector to be effectively crowd voted.

1. Short satiation periods. I instantly know if I have a decent cup of coffee. I still dont know if my 14 year-old refrigerator is decent.
2. Digital consumption. Music, movies, video games, and podcasts are ideal candidates in the digital hemisphere.
3. High competition/low barrier to entry. Any grown man can get into the chocolate chip cookie game from his kitchen, but making superconductors in a garage is going to be difficult.
4. Function over fashion. I couldnt care less about the color of my laundry detergent.

With billions connected to the Internet, a marketplace can comfortably find [voluntary participation](https://sites.google.com/site/crowdsourcewiki/home/forms-of-cs/crowd-voting) for product voting. Voting can be accomplished in different ways, though product testing is most effective when incorporating random fashion. Verified user systems may be implemented to supplement expertise and prevent [deception](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3l1epw/how_to_scam_amazon_customers_out_of_100k_a_year/). A network effect is typically necessary for a marketplace launch; producers wont use a marketplace that has no users, and vice versa. With the help of social networks, including Reddit, a marketplace can effectively direct their message to their target population for a launch. As competing marketplaces are likely to use similar statistical methods, one would typically differentiate through design and the maximum allowable incentives. Incentives for producers include profit sharing and the retention of product rights. Various types of services may also be crowd voted, though would typically require more creative logistics than consumer products.

Lets take a look at an example.

    Janes been reading books her entire life. Lately, shes been disappointed with a few from her favorite bestseller list. Jane learns those books are promoted through various distribution channels and are not necessarily well-written books. Jane figures she can find the best, new books by handing them out to the people willing to participate and asking them to share their opinion. Poorly-rated books can be identified quickly, leaving her with only the best ones. For the user, she can organize the books by genre, difficulty level, and length of book, among other possibilities. She can also afford to give a majority of the profits to writers as her marketplace will be driven by the community, with participation from readers like her. This gives writers the opportunity to focus on their creativity and leaves the entire process of exposure and distribution to Jane. By promoting her platform to r/Books and other social networks, Janes user-focused bookstore has become the Reddit of books.


The societal effects of crowd voted marketplaces cannot be overlooked. Allowing producers to exclusively focus on quality lowers the barrier to entry, increasing the participation of industry creation and employment. The shift of profits from third-party distributors to producers triggers a natural redistribution of wealth. Crowd voting effectively hands the **control of the means of distribution** to communities. When the public can command distribution and cash flow, it can better allocate resources to its communities along with a larger presence in their government. In contrast to private ownership, society has no agenda other than the growth and care of its citizens and community. However, before society can take advantage of these resources, it will need to begin creating systems that utilize its people and the Internet.

&amp;nbsp;

##**The Quiet Revolution**

&gt;Where in the world do you find these angels who are going to organize society for us?

Milton Friedman pondered this after being [questioned about capitalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWsx1X8PV_A). He was unapologetically realistic. We dont work in a system that showers people who fight for our rights  for [peace](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/35l5o9/pope_francis_said_monday_that_many_powerful/?sort=confidence), for [health](https://youtu.be/m0HL4L6Pa-4?t=48s), for [education](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/18th-birthday-nobel-winner-malala-yousafzai-opens-school-syrian-refugees-n390751), for [privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn/courx1i?context=3)  these are not virtues we reward in capitalism. However, our free enterprise system is simply the most effective we have. It is largely driven by our greed. And greed is good, it absolutely is. It inspires thinkers and fuels innovation. But our empowerment of technology will soon change this world in ways we cannot currently understand. Among futurists, the discussion about low-skill jobs rendering obsolete is not about *if* it will happen, but *when* it will happen. With it may come [extreme wealth inequality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM) unlike weve ever seen. With a financial backbone in crowd voting networks, an upgrade to our communities can help mature humanity out of its infancy.

There are issues in this world that we, as individuals, simply have little to no influence. Politics. Law enforcement. Military. National security. Government spending. Foreign policy. Instead, we need focus on the issues that communities *can* impact. Without a doubt, there is someone who knows how to effectively get food into the hands of the hungry. How to rebuild schools for troubled neighborhoods. How to get proper medical care for the less fortunate. How to give shelter for those without a roof. How to improve [elderly living](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K3H2VqQKcc). The list is endless. Similar to how Jobs changed the way we interact with our phones, we now need a change in how people interact with their communities. With a focus on design and logistics, decentralized systems can help connect a community and complete projects with efficiency and satisfaction. Mobile apps have transformed our consumption habits; millions of people rely on Uber/Lyft because they made the experience safe, affordable, efficient, and easy to participate. We now desperately need those same design features in systems that can help society.



Well take another look at an example.

    Carl lives in Manhattan. There have been numerous recent robberies where he lives and few arrests have been made. Carl brainstorms about how a neighborhood watch would work. He believes he can make a simple &amp; user-focused app and sell its services to cities. His plans include an 8-hour neighborhood watch during the late evening and early morning hours. Carl estimates the city would need to employ ~85 people for one square mile. With an area of ~23 square miles at a rate of $15/hr, the city can service Manhattan for ~$86M per year -- a drop in the bucket for a city running a $75B budget. His community can also employ a volunteer approach to further reduce costs. With a full implementation in Manhattan, residents enjoy a safe nightlife and other positive effects from a secure neighborhood.

Capitalism and advertising are brilliant achievements that have sustained our world for hundreds of years. Its brought iPhones into our hands and Big Gulps in our tummies. But like anything, it has its [faults](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2nwu73/how_will_the_majority_of_humans_earn_their_living/cmhxwj1). Severe wealth inequality will reveal our ugliest face. Do we [continue to lie to ourselves](https://youtu.be/mjzrvRKv6Ks?t=48s) with the rhetoric of societys self-improvement? The answer to Mr. Friedmans question is simple. Its the logicians, the developers, and the designers here on Reddit who have a deep understanding of our issues. Its people like Jimmy Wales who made general knowledge free, simple, and organized. Its the few that can paint a vision for the rest of us. The transition to a post-scarcity humanity can be one that takes a bloody or a peaceful route. On the verge of automation, [only we can change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAeuChXAMKk) how we treat the world and, more importantly, how we treat each other.",3,40

I've noticed while driving and using the GPS that sometimes it's not using the correct route due to road construction. The GPS still wants me to use that road even though it's under construction, and will simply not re-route itself until I stop the car and correct the route. 

How will self driving cars deal with this? They can scan the exit and notice the big blinking sign (or QR code, in the future). But how will the car react afterwards? And will the car know before if it should take another exit, because right now Google Maps will direct me into the wrong direction. Even though it's reading the live feed/traffic feed. 

Will we have to run to the exit for the car to scan the sign or will it know beforehand? 

It's only about five year left (or two years in Gothenburg, Sweden).

So there's a couple of links to small news blurbs about this, but nothing really goes in-depth. Considering how big this news really is, and the fact that Elizabeth Parrish, the CEO of BioViva, is doing an AMA here Sunday, I felt we needed more info in order to generate a larger discussion.

This article contains a decent write up on the subject: https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2015/10/bioviva-moving-ahead-with-human-gene-therapy-for-telomerase-activation.php

**Edit**: They also are utilizing a second therapy, their own take on the Myostatin Inhibitor AAV Gene Therapy. Here's some info on Myostatin Inhibition: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/731725_3

There's a good discussion in the comments and one comment in particular stood out:

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; Interesting read! Agree with Steve, as he mentioned, telomerase's mRNA catalytic subunit and its hTERT transcript are an incredible opportunity to create true biorejuvenation in the real sense if controled against deleterious cancer telomerase jacking mutations. The telomeric DNA repeats (TTAGGG) of the telomeres control the gene signature program age-phenotype. As mentioned, this gene pattern change by telomere size attrition activates the death genes program in low telomeric kb/bp (kilobytes/basepairs) gene space. Studies have shown that telomerase lenghtens stem cells' telomeres during stem cell reprogrammation/total rejuvenation (see induced adult pluripotent mesenchymal stem cell reprogramming) and they are ready to differentiate anew and rebuild organ tissues from scratch - the damage, which is an (epi)genetic signature is retroprogrammed to a no damage gene signature (their heightened telomeres back up to 16kb reverse age to 0). Some studies stipulate that the DNA does not change between aged or young body - only the epigene structure surrounding it and the chromosome does, creating this genetic aging and gene pattern of aging.

&gt; Damaged stem cells accumulate short, unstable, demethylated telomeres too. This impedes the transcription fidelity of the gene network, meaning certain critical transcripts (hTERT transcript for telomerase activity becomes unstable and inactivated (cancers use telomerase to their own advantage when telomeres become sufficiently short from excess inflammation oxidative stress accumulation and genetically highly unstable (at about 2kb telomeres length, the s... hits the fan). What's more is that the cell Redox (Glutathione:Oxidized Glutathione) changes and contributes directly to the possibility of telomerase elongation access to telomeres during the cell division cycle. Studies showed that the oxidative stress, under Redox regulation, is in direct correlation to the cell's redox state. It is very telling that humans living 100 years maintain low adequate blood glucose, low oxidative stress, low glycated hemoglobin and albumin, low pancreatic beta-cell insulin production, high red blood cell Redox, high glutathione reductase, high levels of quiescent stem cell pools, high overall protection, but especially high maintenance of telomerase activity and enough elongation to slow things down; the antioxidant systems can only do so much if telomerase is weak.

&gt; How so ? Telomerase is shunted away from the smallest critical telomeres when oxidative stress rises and that leaves whatever exhausted redox antioxidant systems left (catalase, SOD, heat shock proteins, heme oxygenase-1, metalothionein, uric acid, ascorbate, ubiquinols, coq9 10, etc) to try to mitigate the final damages to a certain end because gene silencing of bad death genes is abolished in short telomeres genespace (p53, p16, p38 and other tumor suppressors that are a paradox for destroying cancers but creating inflammation telomeres attrition in good cells, a evolution mechanism to control longevity and allow human lifespan with heavy tumor burden suppression). Plus studies have shown low Redox can reduce telomerase activity by upwards to 80%, rendering it near useless. They are interconnected pathways that depend as a whole on each other to telomeric gene signal rejuvenate and repair damages, telomerase, redox, blood glucose, telomeres length, insulin resistance, glycation, all, in unison, to oxidative stress and thus aging. 

&gt; High telomerase is our gateway to immortality, no joke, telomerase and telomeres are a real epigenetic biorejuvenation, by way of the cell Redox, it's still only in infancy but surely one day as in mice that we will biorejuvenate repeatedly to live at least a full 100 years like a human and surpass it; then we will be very close to the holy grail ponce de lon was after. Maybe not in our lifetime though, seeing it takes some 100 years and more to see truly big revolutionary changes. Let's hope.

But even these people still think in terms of car ownership as such, whether it is a service like Uber that owns a car, a person who owns a car or a person who owns such a car to use it to provide Uber-like service.

But what if... cars owned themselves. I do not mean that manufacturers would just make them and let go as a kid, but for example every car would be ''born'' in the world with say 30 000 USD debt and the main goal of its existence would be to return this debt with the usual interest ASAP while providing services and receiving money for them. 

It's basically cutting middlemen, as if Uber bought such a car from BMW, Uber would also want to receive a part of profit from the car (the same if some person bought it and used it for providing Uber-like service), but if the car owns itself, it does not care about profits for executives, all it cares for its programming- to return money for which it was built. 

Therefore I think Tesla and Apple are thinking correctly about future transportation and money in it. With bitcoin technology/distributed ledgers and AI improving, it will be possible for these cars to work independently without any or minimal human input. Car manufacturers will provide the services (cars and brains inside of them) by themselves, cars will work independently... there is not much future in transportation, I believe, for a middleman like Uber or anyone else who does not produce next gen driverless and intelligent cars. Because there will be no need for a middleman, Google/Tesla/Apple or whoever produces such an intelligent car can insure it, provide its chargers/spare parts etc. in case repairs are needed and keep costs as low that it would be impossible for any middleman to compete with the manufacturer.

Their perspective tends to be ""jobs might become obsolete, but new ones we haven't thought of will take their place, that's how The Market works. It happened in the Industrial Revolution and it'll happen again.""

The impasse then comes when I name off jobs that are becoming at least partially technologically obsolete due to technologies that are already partially deployed: professional drivers (self-driving cars), paralegals and office clerks (search engines), brick &amp; mortar shop workers (RFID chips, ecommerce), medical diagnosticians (search engines, visual algorithms), simple manufacturing (robotics), internal combustion engine mechanics (electric vehicles). Each of these jobs maintains or creates a new job (engineers, software devs), but this should be dwarfed by the jobs they destroy.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics put out a [report of jobs that they predict will be gained and lost between 2012 and 2022](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecopro.pdf), which names jobs trending upwards and downwards, but doesn't cite disruptive technologies: health care, construction, and education are trending up, farmers and government workers are trending down. Interestingly, it *does* point out a 2% decrease in overall labor participation rate.

**TL;DR**: Have you seen a good list of jobs that will be destroyed and created due to technology that is already in various stages of deployment (not development or theorization)? If you haven't, let's try to put one together in the thread!",6,8

For example a horse that knows where home is is an effective self driving vehicle.   Also, there are decades of successful experiments in which we have remote controlled rats via electrode stimulation of facial sensory and reward centers of brain.  (Touch whisker region to make it turn etc.).  Quick info on this topic is available here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_control_animal .   i am not a proponent of animal exploitation but it seems someone could chealply convert a rat or other animal into a remote controled camera drone without brain surgery by stimulating its whiskers etc with servos or light shocks.   
Could this be done with birds or insects too?  Perhaps physically tugging on its wing to make it turn.  Or using electo magnetic stimulation to scew the inner ear (or the bird equivalent for balance) in a controlled way, (Google to see working version for humans to nake them turn).
    It seems like the world is full of amazingly complex self replicating machines, wouldn't it be cheaper and easier in many ways to hack and suppliment their abilities, (as we have done with horses) as opposed to building our clunky expensive, versions from scratch.   With remote technology this could be used to domesticate or dronify  much smaller, simpler and diverse organisms.

It is in many ways a potentially distopian picture, but considering its logic from a practical point of view  i wonder why it is not a more common area of research or discussion.   I am interested to hear your thoughts on this, and potential ideas where this could be of practical use.

Xerox Parc famously invented the Internet, the graphical user interface, and many other inventions that transformed the world. The technique he used was to imagine what would happen in 30 years, and then work backward to what's possible in 10 years and 5 years. Chosen correctly, there could be extremely valuable business opportunities.

Predicting the future has been done before with varying success. While some predictions like [Bill Gates](http://www.newsweek.com/world-bill-gates-predicted-has-come-true-329484) are surprising accurate, others like this [prediction from 1900](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-boston-globe-of-1900-imagines-the-year-2000-97021464/?no-ist) are off but interesting in retrospect. Here is my take on what the future will look like in 30 years. What do you think will happen?


1. Pocket sized computers similar to smartphones have replaced desktop and laptop computers. Heavy processing and storage has moved to the cloud, accessible through high bandwidth wireless connections.
1. Wireless and fiber connections are ubiquitous. Most telephone and cable lines are abandoned because its too expensive to dig them up. Broadcast TV and radio spectrum have been sold for bandwidth.
1. VR headsets like Oculus Rift and the Hololens brought virtual reality to life, and improvements to rendering made models look nearly indistinguishable from reality. Text emoticons will be replaced by avatars that make ridiculous animated faces and dance on your walls and floor.
1. 3D mapping is available live in many places thanks to data from sensors and self-driving cars. You can walk through the streets using your head display. You can attend live events virtually in real time 3D, including running on the field with players at the Superbowl, or dancing live on the stage of your favorite band.
1. Speech recognition is accurate enough to understand easy conversational speaking. Hand gestures are good for selecting or moving things. For offices and public spaces, nothing beats a classic keyboard since its private and quiet.
1. Most popular web services offer developer APIs and middleware vendors have made integrations seamless. Knowledge bases allow bots or virtual assistants to do simple tasks automatically and you can request tasks using speech recognition.
1. Deep user profiles and big data are so common that advertising is almost indistinguishable from relevant recommendations and education. Spam still exists in the form of low quality content but it's hidden fairly quickly.
1. Transportation is mostly automated including for cars, trucks, and planes. Traffic deaths are significantly lower and people can actually get work done or relax in their cars. Its still expensive and time consuming to drive and traffic is still an issue.
1. Robots are used pretty heavily in manufacturing since the cost of labor has risen in Asia. Live robot shows and competitions are popular among kids. They can be remotely controlled as drones or carry out action sequences. Some hobbyists and researchers experiment with self-learning general purpose robots but they are still too slow and clumsy for commercial use.
1. Classrooms have social networks and personalized games that improve performance over hours of boring lectures. Rich kids attend class online with some of the best teachers and students in the country.

(per Ray Kurzweil) And as exciting as the possibility of eternal life in a virtual universe of our design sounds, I personally see a terrifying danger that would come hand in hand with this advance. This piece in [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/05/immortal-but-damned-to-hell-on-earth/394160/) brings up one scenario that may keep you away from that 'Quantum Server' space you have been saving for; post organic life punishment for your crimes. 

But the danger I have honestly never heard discussed is even more terrifying. Credit card numbers are stolen every day from allegedly secure servers, along with social security numbers, personal information, government secrets, you name it. 

*What if someone stole your ""soul"" the way your most personal information is stolen today?* A malevolent individual could then potentially alter the environment in which you are spending your ""second life"" to anything they see fit. It's not hard to imagine what a truly evil person could do to create a living hell for someone to whom that living hell is all too real. 

Does this possible type of future crime make the idea of an extended, or even eternal life, less appealing to you? I am curious to hear other peoples' thoughts about this.

Of course, any change seems slow if you're keeping up with it every day.

The shitty day long socialising event global-government keeps quarterly so that all individuals and families come up together to share ideas of lives and blah blah, basically you just have to talk and converse verbally because according to scientists, human being have started showing up characteristics of a nuclear specimen rather than a part of species. 


Everything was different 100 years back. Before mankind found (at least we think we found) Ultimate subset of answers to universe. Yes it sounds big but big I was.

New theories were proposed explaining how universe was made. And in mere couple of decades we managed to solve half of the planet's energy crisis followed by sudden success of making an ionized ships which cut our interplanetary travel time but boggling 75%. Which has managed up to successfully colonize a part of space and a healthy Mars population of almost hundred thousand living organisms. Many of which are space born. Amazing right?


Well I am late for MSD.

Take for example driverless cars, bitcoin, smarter AI assistants that lead to internet of things, virtual reality, alternative energy... all these things that should take off within 5-10 year timeframe, that have not so much to do one with another, but if you look at them, they are really connected. And they will really change how we operate as species. 

With driverless cars you are effectively out of control as regards your transport. That means more time for online activities, and here comes VR. You can use VR in a driverless car and it will be used, and e-commerce will move there, eventually locking you in. If you can order your food and anything else in VR, you have automated robots and maybe even your appliances themselves order things via always on internet, essentially there is this huge amount of time added that you do not need to spend interacting with people in real life. Also, I think with more jobs that are left moving to intellectual type of work, work from home enabled by gamifying elements of VR will also take off, so it's again less time to socialize with people who are not your family/nerd-family online.

This impacts society in a way that gated communities will exist not only in real life, but online too. People already have become more extreme, due to insulation. News that you get from facebook are essentially based on what you like. If you like one article about migrant crime in Europe, you will get 10s of them that make it seem all migrants do are rape, pillage etc. Everybody lives in their own happy bubbles. That's one real concern for future. When you have driverless car that gets you from garage to garage or door to door, even if they are in different countries (and cheap, due to cheap alternative energy in future or even cheap gas, as it will get cheaper trying to remain competitive), does not let you talk to people who have opposing views. It just creates new clans and clannish behaviour. 

Furthermore, it will be a lot about losing the sense of identity. Not only due to being a part of these groups or lack of originality of ''everything's already done'', but if you have smart AI assistants you will eventually have your own ''doubles'' in VR. If you do not have time for something, or want to talk with somebody and find out their thoughts but have to talk to other 4 people, or just need to have a more efficient answering machine, you could create an assistant who is a copy of your mannerisms, has your core beliefs, knows what you like and how you like it and hold conversations with other people similarly like you would. So nobody would know when the real person is talking and when the double is talking. And if you die (as we have not yet solved aging), the double would perhaps just stay there and engage in conversations all the time... and learn from them. Does that mean you are dead, or in essence you are not? Perhaps, for example, this double could be worked into your tombstone, so when somebody approaches, you can talk with the deceased. An interesting idea. 

A lot of today's problems with world, if we are not talking about extremism that is bound to become even worse, I'm afraid, is the lack of food and overpopulation, us slowly destroying the planet etc. But these are all non-problems in a sense that I do not see that they are hard to overcome. Soon enough fake meat from plant products will have the same taste and in other aspects be even better than real meat, so to an extent we will be able to cut the least humane aspects of our food production to a certain degree. The number of really poor people in the world is decreasing all the time, population growth is slowing down and existing overcrowded areas will be eventually cleared by local conflicts and migration of people which is taking place on an unprecedented level now and will only become worse in future. As regards pollution, even without fusion energy, we will be able to get a cleaner energy mix soon enough. I don't see them as major long term problems, I see a problem with clannish behaviour though and partially I can see a kind of neo-luddite movement arising not only in Muslim countries but in other places too, because the AI and the blurring the lines of what's real with AI and intelligent assistants/virtual doubles will make many people uneasy.

At the moment I can honestly say I fail to see our space exploration dreams realized. We will have space mining in the future, but it will done by intelligent robots and that's actually where I see first most sophisticated AI beings ''evolve'', as due to time delay in communications, they will need to operate independently and make independent decisions... but then again I have doubts about it because nobody sends untested, new equipment up there and it takes a while for these things to go to asteroid belt or Mars, and with exponential technology development it could be so that they will be obsolete in Earth tech terms even before the rocket leaves Earth. But definitely either SpaceX or some other efforts will further democratize space and private entrepreneurs will go there.

However I do not see a bright future in space for humans and that is again due to VR. With increased complexity of AI and virtual environments we can create, there will not be as much of an incentive to spend time on lifeless rocks or to leave the planet en masse. And anyways, it will not happen in 30 years, at best some manned Mars mission to appease the public, but I really think that when the new kind of AI and VR kicks in in a few years, about 2020, people' interest in space will sort of diminish a bit. When you have a game like No Man's Sky and add to it more complex generation of planets and self evolving AI creations, Mars could kinda not be as interesting anymore. Sure, people are explorers, but when there will be tons of things to explore in VR, perhaps only handful of people or luddites of this new age will still be interested in solid rocks. 

I definitely think that we live in interesting times and what I wanted to really say is, I do not see our future in moving externally, instead its direction will be directed towards the inner things. Our focus will be efficiency, how many things we will be able to stack on other things to still have better VR environments as last year, our focus will be immersion and how to make AI more lifelike. Eventually it could lead to us merging with AI to enhance us even further and at that time the efficiency and Moore's law will not just be a choice but lifestyle. But again, the issue is how this will play with the clannish behaviours. Perhaps some people will be left behind forever? Some people could just receive their basic income and fight with each other until ''progressives'' become too machine like and forget about them, and the rest of humanity reverts back to savagery while the most advanced part migrates to something unknown, like some black hole to try and figure that out and how it could improve efficiency. But that's far away future. 

This is essentially how I cope with Fermi paradox. My assumption is that:
1) you can't be a space faring civilization without discovering Moore's law
2) Moore's law is real law, that's what happens when civilization reaches certain point in its development
3) When you discover it, you can't help but follow it, upon following it you can't help but become part of it
4) By following it, you alter yourself so much (and in really short time frame) that lesser civilizations are not interesting to you in any way
5) Part of Moore's law is efficiency, so even when you expand, your ''footprint'' is not as large as for lesser civilizations to be able to discover you
6) you would tend to migrate towards/manufacture massive black holes i.e. where lesser civilizations cannot live, not only because of massive energy needs but also due to the essential need to explore something really unknown and be able to figure them out. 

Essentially the argument is that for any advanced species to become space faring, it needs to be curious and exploration oriented. Upon understanding Moore's law and seeing increase in computation, their curiosity/exploration urges will move into this direction. Some members of such civilization could stay behind and follow traditional path, but here's another thing- suppose it is impossible (money, funds wise) to create Dyson spheres and other such things without venturing further down the rabbit hole/ Moore's law path, without stronger AI presence. But with stronger AI, you are tempted to enhance yourself. However, if you enhance yourself, you would soon lose interest in other civilizations, as your development would be exponential and you would not be able to be on the same plane of comprehension with lesser civilizations. 

Many people will object saying that this requires ALL CIVILIZATIONS to go down the same path, but what if it's what happens. To be a space faring civilization REQUIRES a civilization 1) to be curious and want to explore 2) to understand the concept of scientific progress (where we got only in 18th century) 3) to be able to build a rocket and leave the atmosphere 4) to have calculating machines to go where you want. Once you have calculating machines, Moore's law is the reality. Maybe not like it is here, but the general idea of exponential progress in computing. And then you get into AI territory and merging with the machines and you become something entirely else. ",3,22

What stops a billionaire from hiring a private mercenary army and take over a country of a wartorn part of the world, most likely in Africa somewhere. Maybe pay off the civillian populace to migrate. Only to use his resources to create a state of science.  
  
He/she could then use their vast fortune to buy natural resources of all kinds and have them transported to said land in huge amounts. Create a government and hire the brightest minds from across the world and basically create their own state based on scientific progress and free from religion, traditions, dogma, superstition and negative cultural impacts. Said person could then create their own agricultural system and slowly **remove the dependence on the rest of the world**. When said billionaire has created such a state and waited a generation and finished using ALL their money to buy up resources not otherwise located in said area - they would change the currency system to an internal point system. Thereby freeing themselves from the rest of the world and commit 100% to technological and scientific advancement in seclusion.   
  
A state of science based which distributes almost all of its efforts into science would no doubt be able to come up with weaponry able to defend themselves aswell.  
  
So yeah. Why can a religious nut-job terrorist organisation get away with this stuff for such a long time, while a billionaire with the power and resources to do the same with only benevolent intent - NOT do it?",120,142

[I know it's not really future orientated, but I'm looking for recent developments]. I did try searching on the sub and online so please let me know if there was something I missed.

Preferably I'm most interested in cases that were ostensibly good but failed due to other factors. For example, things like being ""ahead of the market/replaced before it took off"", ""lack of funding/support/vision"", ""poor launch/roll-out"" or ""market expectations"". 

By ""being ahead of the market, I mean examples where the product wasn't needed *yet*. This might be a missing technology. I think to a degree the electronic car failed because of limitations in batteries, 3D printers haven't seen the predicted widespread adoption because their isn't really a mainstream application yet. People often talk about VisiCalc being responsible for the success of the PC.

The alternative is where is was developed just in time to be made obsolete (by either technology or changed circumstances). The best I can come up with is [Minitel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel) which is decades old.

As for not understanding the market, the best I can up with is ""New Coke"" which was considered a better product in testing but Coke didn't listen to feedback that even though they preferred it they still wanted the original flavour and it failed in the US. 
  
I can't think of any good examples but I'm sure there are products that suffered because they couldn't meet the initial demand. 

Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks.",28,11

Instead:

- We have vast numbers of people who have technologies that go above-and-beyond the basics (smart phones, electric cars, VR, etc..) and yet they are taking actions which give them a poor quality of life (obesity being the most obvious one on my mind right now.)

While [Google Hangouts](http://hangouts.google.com/) and [Ring.to](http://ring.to/) use VoIP their reach is not limited to other VoIP users. Users have access to the [PSTN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network), so get real phone numbers and make and receive calls to physical phones.^1

Hangouts and Ring.to still require access to an Internet provider of some kind, whether cell service or home/school/coffee shop/work broadband. [RingPlus](http://www.ringplus.net), a Sprint MVNO,^2 recently began irregularly offering free cell-phone plans with 1000 voice minutes, 1000 texts, and 1000 MB of data per month. The service is advertisement-based; when users make calls, [they hear targeted ads instead of ringing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringback_Tone_Advertising).

While RingPlus's minutes and text allotments are enough for most people, Hangouts and Ring.to can use the data for even more calls and text.^3 In my experience one minute of voice uses about 1 MB, and a text over VoIP uses almost no data, so in effect the free RingPlus plan gives users 2,000 minutes of free calls a month.^4

The sustainability of RingPlus's current free plans is unclear. The company has in the past abruptly cut off earlier, less-generous free plans to many customers, claiming that local advertisers could not be found for them. The current plans' availability comes and goes; they are funded by an unspecified third party that uses RingPlus to test social-network marketing strategies. The quality of the Sprint network is the worst of the big four US cell-service providers (but, hey, free is free).

Whatever happens to RingPlus, it will surely not be the only company with such a business plan. At some point someone elseGoogle? Facebook?will offer similarly free cellphone Internet service that connects to the physical phone network, probably ad-driven in some way. Data buckets will increase in size, with 2GB, 5GB, and 10GB per month instead of 1GB. Non-Americans will gain access to RingPlus-like offerings, too, and Google or Elon Musk's or someone else's low earth-orbit satellites or balloons will expand network coverage globally.

What happens to society when we come to expect telecommunications to be 100% free (barring possibly the cost of the handset/tablet)?

^1 Because they use VoIP, users can make and receive those calls from anywhere with Internet access as if physically present in the US. No more having to pay for international roaming; just find a wi-fi hotspot.

^2 Any Sprint-compatible CDMA phone gathering dust in your closet will likely work, no matter how old.

^3 Such calls don't have ads, either.

^4 RingPlus also offers SIP access, so the 1,000 voice minutes can be directly used with any SIP client from anywhere with broadband, like Hangouts and Ring.to. I don't see much of a need given Hangouts and Ring.to's unlimited minutes, but the possibility remains.",24,5

After a little light googling, I couldn't find anything from outside of the Futurology/Singularity blogosphere. 

Then I went and looked at BioViva's website and found it...underwhelming. From the cheap layout, to spelling and grammatical errors in the content, to questionable credentials, it feels like Ms. Parrish is a very bright woman who has cobbled together a company based mainly around her personality and sharing interests with other bright people. Her background seems to be mostly in motivational speaking. The CMO is a radiologist, two of the board members are PR are people, and the most credentialed members of the board seem to sit on a bunch of other boards, mostly with each other... 

So, my questions for the community, which of her claims can we verify from a sources that didn't originate from BioViva press releases? (such as published studies in mainstream medical journals)

We've all seen those flying machines in Futurama, and I can't wait when (if) they become reality. I imagine they would be AI controlled, since it is too dangerous to rely on human reactions at these speeds (with many other vehicles around you). Lets assume these things travel upwards of 400mph. In the sky, I imagine invisable lanes (but visable on holographic windshield projections). An elevation view (side view) would look like this:

http://i.imgur.com/MzrJHSY.png

The computer could decrease the elevation of the vehicle the more it decelerates, that way high speed travelers will not collide with lower speeds. In the picture you can only see two planes of travel, but there should really be about 3 speed zones. The interstate (400+) State traffic (250MPH) and local traffic (35?MPH) This setup would solve the problem of being unable to quickly decelerate in the air, without stalling etc.

Given a not-so-distant future where knowledge is cheap and easily obtainable how will we assess intelligence?

IMHO right now many of the ways we assess intelligence depend upon actually assessing knowledge.  IQ tests for example are biased towards people with knowledge in certain areas.

Just to clarify my idea of what 'intelligence' is, I view intelligence as the ability to 'see' and 'connect' the dots and the quicker you can perceive and connect those dots the 'smarter' you are.  

Knowledge on the other hand is simply a reflection of your ability to retain data and information.  Obviously you need a certain amount of intelligence to be knowledgeable but being knowledgeable doesn't mean you are particularly smart.

You may know this dot is green, that dot is blue and another is yellow but you may not have the ability to connect them whereas som,eone else sees those dots are pixels and perceives a clear picture.

The role of education and what it means is part of this process.  Education tends to be geared towards the accumulation of knowledge and/or skills but what will that mean when knowledge is cheap?  ",3,12

A lot of time we just haphazardly use tech without thinking of increasing our benefits from tech.

I've been trying to use my different devices for specific uses...iphone, tablet, laptop.  That way I don't waste time surfing on them...it forces me to think about specifically what I'm doing and I stick to it.  For example I basically only use my laptop for music production now.  I use my tablet for surfing and reading.  And my phone is basically my jukebox and twitter.

Another ""hack"" is that when I'm researching and brainstorming I always write on paper because I can drawing diagrams and capture thoughts in more ways then a word processing software.  Afterwards I retype and catalogue the results on evernote.  I wanna start using prezi or some type of mind mapping software to help me keep track of my learning.

Basically....we waste a bunch of time with our tech.  I've had experiences where I figured out better methods that made me feel smart, quicker, and more efficient.  What are some of your methods that you developed that get bad ass results?",3,3

He completely misses the point people such as Musk and Hawking are trying to make.

It doesn't take a genius to understand this debate.

This will allow us to show clearly what we have in mind and get the project started?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3onu71/can_anyone_work_with_me_drawing_a_few_different/,mpwcarter,1444784311,"The crude paper model shown here in this link http://imgur.com/uHdXlHW depicts the overall teepee-esk / cone shape of the glass exterior of my design which would be made to provide protection from all foreseeable threats as our climate continues to worsen (People will soon grow tired of rebuilding little houses made of sticks as floods, fires, and wind grows worse, most are already tired.) This city too will be designed to provide protection and sanctuary from the ever increasing chaos of the public at large around the world.
Residential living spaces / suites will be a part of the exterior walls and their number could vary widely as best suited for the location, from 100 or 1000 rooms to 10,000 rooms as our largest hotels on Earth now feature and possibly as many as 100,000 or more in a single resort city structure.
I currently see the residential units, lavishly equipped with the latest tech, prefabricated made as slightly curved rectangular shapes that capture the angles and shapes necessary to make up the outer wall of the structure as shown in the model. This technique is used now for many projects including cruise ships.
These blocks then would be placed / locked into position like an igloo continuing in circles to the top, of course allowing for other uses in areas where space was being used for other non-residential purposes. 
As you have already pictured, with the living space in the walls the entire center area, becomes a protected climate controlled atrium featuring acres of space to be beautifully designed for the best pleasure of we residents, resort like. Think Disney Resorts (beaches, parks, restaurants, areas of various age groups etc.) only better and under glass! 
These structures will of course be off-the-grid, environmentally positive cities, they will include food production among other requirements. There will be no doors; entry will come by underground tunnels into the city as well as possible access directly to living units from outside. Cities will be connected to one another by underground transportation avoiding surface climate problems. 
In addition I am seeking help in compiling a list of the best of our latest technology to be featured in these cities. The shape obviously offers a tremendous amount of surface area for solar power as well as rain and snowmelt water capture for application to various purposes, those features are a good start but dont scratch the surface of the total applications of quality of life enhancing features we will have with input from all and what better place than Reddit; Futurology to seek this input? I hoping for a collaborative effort bringing the best of all disciplines together, to create the most perfect cities possible.
This is a project to save the best of life as we know it and have known it on Earth and build a better society. Intervening before we experience another dark age and lose all we have learned, perhaps never to recover this time, with the threats and weaponry humans face now. 
As with a mission to Mars it is critical that we establish a harmonious, homogeneous society. We would never want to send the disease of current world human relations to another planet and we certainly dont want that disease of enmity between people in this world to be present in our sanctuary cities.
We must have humans who all embrace and live by one operating system. 
There are too many belief systems held by various groups of humans on this planet to try to list here but this project is a God-given plan for the free-love, followers of the teachings of Jesus Christ; commonly referred to as Christians.
His teachings of love and forgiveness and association with those who practice the same, make for a society with unlimited potential. And Jesus teaching that in a perfect society there will be no marriage, therefore free-love, will eliminate the enmity between men and women which accounts for much human pain.
As in the case of the original Church 2000 years ago, all here will be held in common and the group will be led by all in consensus, with appropriate reliance on the wisdom of elders. All for one, one for all places our faith for future security and abundance in the group, not one mate as in most world systems. Individual mates break legs and get fired, a well functioning tribe eliminates these problems as well as the tendency to look for new mates with more cash or for individuals with much cash to control and manipulate mates and others. Here it is a marriage of the whole with Christ and a marriage with one another in Christ. We are all husbands and wives.
So our resorts will be like the all-inclusive resorts we see now, when you get there you receive a pass card to use for all you want.
With over 2 billion Christians around the world fundraising should be simple once the plans are clear.
Private Church clubs will be opened soon, prior to the completion of the cities, places of fun and safety. In these clubs we will grow closer as friends and friends in those clubs will recommend those who will go to the resort cities first etc. when they begin to open.
Other groups of humans: Atheist, Muslims, Jews etc. I assume are working on their own plans for these tumultuous times; this is our plan, bringing Christians around the world into beautiful resort sanctuaries. A plan received by and being executed by More Perfect World Church. I would appreciate any help you could provide in any area.
Obviously I have given only a brief description of the features of the project I am going to build.
If anyone is interested, we will begin collaborating and filling in the details.
Those working on this project will be rewarded as it becomes reality. Thanks for your time in reviewing this information.

His opinion was that draconian laws, including outright torture, summary execution, etc had to be allowed.

Actually, people like him are dime a dozen in Asia, where the liberal thought has no roots and whatever the king/emperor/prez says is basically the law, and the legal system just bows to whoever has power for the day.

I am afraid that the world is going in such directions to introduce draconian laws to eliminate all opposition against the advance of civilization. If the west won't do it, Asia will do it.

The moment some Asian nation reaches Type I civ or singularity, west is kaput.

===

There are too much inefficiencies and resources wasted in activities which do not directly lead to Type I Civ or Singularity.

For better or worse, Asia (read: china) is no closer to them than the West. Asia still has its petty rivalry and internal corruption.

But when Asia really gets its act on and concentrate all of its effort to reach Type I or singularity, the west can't do anything.

I already cited North Korea, which can't feed its population but has shot a satellite and possesses nuclear bombs. North Korea already showed what a determined Asian country, no matter how crazy, draconian and poor , could do if it really felt like doing something.

I do think that some kind of absolutist control will be needed to bring the human civilization to the next stage.

Most people would accept a certain degree of discomfort and restriction of freedom for a greater good, as seen in many people standing in line at airports to wait for TSA scans.

If such reduction of freedom might mean a new chapter in civilization, I don't see a problem with it.",23,0

[Becoming Someone Else](http://www.mindmedley.com/blog/experience-beamers/)

While the World is trying to meet the 75 on the Social Progress Index, SPI, the scientist of the countries working on Augmenting Human Intelligence and Nanotechnology need to consider the following.

Will the Human Brain be able to psychologically handle this boost in intelligence?
*What I propose we think about is to gradually increase the intelligence of the Human Brains Collectively*  [Collective Evolution](http://www.collective-evolution.com/)

Maybe the SPI will only be useful from 2015-2030 to help us visualize our progress. Could the next index include average intelligence as a factor as we go from 75-100 on the SPI?",1,0

It is genetic alteration after all.

Let's say a 60 year old woman can undergo gene therapy to restore her youth and reproductive system to have a baby. Wouldn't that have a huge effect on the child's genetic make up? Maybe the kid would hit puberty in its 20's or insert your own random speculation. 

My point is, it could be as human as a cro-mag was. We would need a new scientific classification for these new breeds of human. I have to say it would be a positive way for mankind to go extinct. ",7,5

This is purely fictional, but this is the context. So what would be the world people's reactions? Years of festivities? Massive amount of funds pushed into space programs? Global peace in reaction to the overview effect? Collapse of traditional religions? Industry restructurations leading to our own Dyson sphere program? 


All those expectations sound naturally unfitting to me. And I feel there will probably be a small period of chaos in the mind of the people, some debates, a bit of new start-ups and public programs here and there, followed by a rapid accommodation. Daily lives naturally getting back on track as they always do. 


So what is the issue? The issue is that we can probably count that announcement as the most important information event humanity would have ever experienced. This, of course, remains debatable, but the scale and variety of topics it affects lack comparison. We can see very far in the universe, we can understand more and more quantum physics, but we were still the center of the universe. But then, of course, it does not directly affect our daily lives: we have more urgent matters to solve, such as getting back to our routines and buying the baguette for the breakfast. 


So we can probably imagine mathematical models that explain how the people react to awesome news, how they accomodate. Maybe a string of small awesome news is more likely to have an influence than a big awesome news. Maybe it is the opposite, I do not know. Maybe the overall ""humanity psychology"" is chaotic, maybe it is not. 


So I wonder know: what is the psychology of humanity? It tries to survive a bit, keeps a bit of interest on new things, updates itself, then get back to basic needs. It tries to reach comfort, keeps evolving at a continuous rate, etc... I see it a bit like an animal I guess. The accommodation to big news probably working like our own accommodation to the electric signals in our biological nerves and brain.


With this in mind, maybe it can be a bit more simple to understand and use analogies to depict civilizations. I am then asking myself if there are available abstract or concrete tools, or knowledge base, dedicated to sociology on a big scale level. The kind of scale that let us use it to understand and imagine social interactions with other extraterrestrial civilizations for example. Or just to understand how we handle science at humanity scale, taking our whole History into account. I think it can be of interest to have some of that stuff in mind when diving into futurology topics.

I dont know if the idea is original, but it was new to me. As a matter of fact, I would be interested in any sci-fi or even scientific exploration done in the area of my post.

Writing my original post got me to thinking further on just how large the probe would have to be to block or at least modulate the intensity of the suns light to regions of space behind the probe. In my original post I speculated about the probe being as far away as Pluto. Upon reaching this distance from the sun, what diameter would the probe have to open up to in order to block or reduce the intensity of the suns light significantly to all objects in space directly behind the probe?

I understand the effectiveness of the light modulation would depend on the material the probe is made of, but at this point Im more curious as to the probe size and whether its feasible with our current space technology.",2,4
1310,2015-10-16,2015,10,16,12,3oy4ky,What if the bizarre dips in flux of the star KIC 8462852 are the result of an advanced alien civilization trying to communicate with our region of the galaxy? Perhaps the starlight itself is being modulated by a distant object to broadcast information to our solar system?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3oy4ky/what_if_the_bizarre_dips_in_flux_of_the_star_kic/,Zeitgeist_Zephyr,1444967546,"Ive been fascinated by the [recent news]( http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/10/the-most-interesting-star-in-our-galaxy/410023/) of a star that is fluctuating in intensity like no other star seen before. Normally, telescopes are focused on such stars to detect light fluctuations in order to detect planets transiting in front of the star. But in the case of KIC 8462852 scientists are mystified. See the [Yale scientific paper]( http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.03622v1.pdf) for more detailed information.

This mysterious flux got me to thinking about how intelligent beings could communicate anywhere in the galaxy by using their local star as a sort of beacon. You could do this by sending a special type of probe out into deep space that opens up to block your local stars light in one specific direction. This light blockage could then be varied in intensity to act as a sort of modulator for transmitting information.

Right now SETI is pointing radio telescopes at KIC 8462852 to try and find radio transmissions. But the problem with this approach to finding intelligent life is that it requires extremely powerful alien transmitters that are focused in a specific direction with a massive consumption of energy. Otherwise, the transmitted signals just get lost in the background noise. This seems very impractical unless you already have a previously open communication channel with another solar system and can target them with purpose.

So then, why not just use your own star as the transmitter? It has the power and can be seen with telescopes in most places throughout the galaxy. All that would be required is to send a craft far enough into deep space to block your starlight in a specific direction. This craft could be as crude as blocking the starlight or not blocking it, giving a binary 0 and 1. More than likely, however, the craft would vary the starlights intensity so that it could encode far more information.

What is interesting about this approach is that even from distances as close as Pluto, the sun looks only a little bigger than most other stars. Hence, even humans could send a probe within our own solar system that could open up and block (or modulate) the suns light in one specific direction, giving us a means of interstellar communication. The transmitted data rate might not be huge, but then maybe it doesnt have to be.

Twinkle, twinkle little star -- I know the twinkling is the result of our own atmosphere and pollution, but what if some of those stars are twinkling because theyre sending a message?

**Edit:** I'm including a comment here that I made below because it's relevant to this idea and I didn't want it to get lost.

What got me to thinking about this was the concept of a Dyson Sphere and the beings actually capable of building such a thing. There was much speculation around the web and here on reddit that a Dyson Sphere could be included in the conversation about why the stars flux had changed so dramatically.

So, lets say the Dyson Sphere could be constructed such that instead of stopping all the radiation from a star it could allow some of the light to pass through. Not only could you allow some margin of light to pass through but you could control the amount of light in an analog manner, hence providing a method of modulation for the encoding of dense data.

Hence, you could literally broadcast information to the entire galaxy in every direction simultaneously. If intelligent beings were capable of building a Dyson Sphere, who's to say they couldn't also use it as a ""we're here and want to chat"" star-beacon to the entire galaxy?

Taking this one step further, there could already be 100's of these beacons around our galaxy and the only thing preventing us from receiving their messages is that our telescopes are not quite yet sensitive enough. But as our telescopes improve we find the galaxy is alive with interstellar twitter.",55,50

I find it interesting that there was a paper released about a week or two ago that spoke of there not being any evidence of any alien civilizations in the observable universe. The research for that paper was obviously conducted at least a month before now.

But does anyone find it strange that we haven't been able to find anything, and we suddenly find something out there as conspicuous as a (possible) big ol' Dyson sphere? Could this be related to something like the Prime Directive (Star Trek for those not in the know)? In other words, could recent scientific developments here on Earth (there have been a lot lately!) have proven to alien civilizations that we are mature enough to meet them? Perhaps these developments (here on Earth) made an ""uncloaking"" of the so-called Dyson sphere possible.

To better integrate into human society and better make human society integrate with itself, I believe a super-intelligent AI, if not deciding to genocide us all(or maybe just some of us, there's also the possibility it could make different decisions to each and every human being, 50% becoming immortal gods, 30% staying the same and 20% being murdered for example), it could develop it's own biological technology, using DNA manipulation and artificial being generation to create for itself a kind of ""super-being/super-human"" artificial body that either looks like a human(that's why super-human) or that can change it's own appearance whoever it likes, that can do all the functions the best robot body you can think of can, but biologically, made out of cells and such. This body would be made with no ""mind"" or ""memory""(system/database) but have access with the cloud where this AI is. It the copy some of it's main functions and database to it, and live among us. It then would use DNA manipulation and other methods to change the organism of humans who want and agree to becoming the ""same kind"" of being it is, or something really close, without having to go through a surgery, just taking a medicine or an injection or something my puny human brain can't even think of, that almost instantly and painlessly makes us able to do everything we've ever thought we'd need a kind of brain implant or cyber-organ to do. Super-human regeneration, access the internet with the mind, see AR, infra-red, sound waves and such with the naked eye, download information to the brain, reshape the body itself just by wanting, become invisible, fly, ""breath"" in space and other ""super-powers"", you get the gist of it.
Wouldn't that be kind of more efficient than going ""metal and silicon"" as organism, if 100% manipulable DNA, are kind of more ""flexible"" towards the goal of evolution?",3,0

There is a debate to allocate the resources according to each person's needs, or to concentrate the resources to those who are the most likely to succeed, the smartest, the richest and those who are able to create the most advances.

Whether you like or not, there are billions of people who are not capable of understanding the future or participating in it.

In another post, I wrote about introducing draconian policies to stop any activities which might hinder reaching another dimension of human civilization.


Only about 10% (and I am giving the benefit of the doubt) of the whole population are , say, designing things, building machines, and 'improving civilizations'.

And they are making more money and , directly or indirectly, leaving more people behind, not because the latter is bad, but the latter simply lack the capacity to follow.

I think that it will be necessary for humanity to make a decision, to either uplift everyone, or to concentrate everything to the elites and simply kiss goodbye to those who can't join there or at least do not have any skills for them.

Billions of people who do not belong in the future could live out in genteel poverty, provided basic food, shelter and sanitation (somewhat like the Japanese-American internees during the World War II - although I pointed elsewhere that the JA men, smarter than most, chose to fight in Europe rather than to stay there) but not much else (and plenty of entertainment to kill their time), combined with elaborate methods to reduce their number. In short, they will be allowed to live, like the animals rescued in shelters who are usually neutered on admission.

If they rebel, it will be necessary to slaughter them without mercy.
Militarized police will mow them down, so the elites can continue their activities without any bother.

Eventually, with the less able gradually out of picture, the world enters a new phase of civilization, with Kardashev Type I, Singularity, and all the goodies not imaginable now.

Or, the world could decide to allocate the resources to the less able, whose numbers will eventually overwhelm the cognitive elites and create something like a Pol Pot (shoot all the smarties) rule, which will bring the world to the level of, say, Zimbabwe.

It is probably going to be one or another .. .no middle ground. 

Such regression of civilization did happen a few times, like the so-called Dark Ages, or the Mayans who were more advanced during around 1000 than on 1500. ",19,0

It seems far out, but it's only far out compared to the brief mundane existence we've experienced so far. We only experience four dimensions, but there are at least ten that we know of. We're looking at one tiny speck of reality surrounded by unfathomable complexity. 

Physicists say the past still exists after we've experienced it. We don't know if it's accessible or not though. If it is, and if we don't go extinct, scientists have billions of years to figure out how to retrieve or recreate anyone who has ever existed.

Which largely agrees with what I had argued before, namely increasing social control to quell dissents and concentrate all efforts toward advancement of civilization.

That means, it will be necessary for most of population not directly related to advancement of civilization to take sacrifices most of them won't be willing to take.

I already talked about North Korea, whose GDP is $12 billion (way less than what Steve Jobs' heirs inherited), which starved millions but shot nukes and satellites.

Asia is particularly good at forcing people to sacrifice for the greater good, which is why I think if nothing is done in the western world, Asia will get there first.

During the Russo-Japanese War (1904 - 05), Japan imposed a special tax of 50% per capita. Rich or poor, everyone had to pay a 50% tax to support the war against Russia which was more advanced than Japan. 

Poorer people ate leftover food, which they had to pay for. (Japanese would , again, later eat food left over by American soldiers during the US occupation of that country following WWII)

Americans fighting in Vietnam witnessed how little supply the Viet Congs were using. The Vietnamese fighting the Americans were willing to take sacrifices unimaginable to Americans.

Although Asians are more affluent nowdays and are not adverse to American way of life, if there is a need they will be more willing to take unimaginable sacrifices to accomplish the goal for the 'greater good of the nation'. And they would be more willing to silence any dissenting voices.",22,5

Also, while in vitro meat consists of animal cells instead of bacteria, some traits of bacteria evolution will apply.

So, when the cell cultures used for lab grown meat start evolving...how will we make sure it's for our benefit, instead of some missing protein that reduces how nutritious the meat is for humans (or something more plausible; I'm not a biologist)? Will the evolution be faster than livestock selective breeding because it's on a cellular scale, or slower since it's asexual?

- If you had the chance to link your brain to the internet, knowing you would not be able to unlink it, would you? If so, what do you think would occur afterwards?

- The moment you unlink, you die.

- You still have access to your body, you are just basically able to learn the entire internet worth of knowledge within seconds, and bring information to the front of your mind in milliseconds. Aka, you still have motor-functions, but can not separate the cords linking you.

&gt;These facts, which apply to the country as a whole, acquire ominous dimensions when considered alongside the ""rural flight"" away from the Midwest which began in the 1930s and continues today. The problem is far from just local: the area suffering from this reverse baby boom comprises 279 counties in six states, totaling nearly 470,000 square miles. Included are Wyoming and Montana, most of North and South Dakota, three fourths of Nebraska, and more than half of Kansas. In the past ten years 16 percent of the lower forty-eight states has seen barely one percent of the nation's births....

&gt;By 1985 births had begun to fall throughout the region, and the decline has accelerated since 1990. It has been greatest in rural areas, with the 98th Meridian serving as an approximate dividing line. The portions of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas west of this line have experienced an unprecedented ""child drought"" during the past ten years, and the birth rate for the past five years amounts to a child famine.

&gt;With fewer children, schools will be closed and consolidated. As the population drops, the Postal Service will close post offices. Government at all levels will reduce staff. Elks Clubs and American Legion posts will close, as will movie theaters and barber shops. Churches with dwindling memberships will be unable to support a pastor. In many towns the clinic or hospital will close, owing to a lack of patients and an inability to retain doctors. The effects of reduced economic input will ripple through the local economy -- particularly in rural areas, where people depend on one another. As the cutbacks continue, the value of real estate will plummet. Adding to the problem, in fifteen years Baby Boomers will begin to retire. Many will move to Omaha, Wichita, Denver, or even Texas. WOOFs (well-off older folks) will seek easier climes, and houses in many small towns will go begging. A similar fate awaits commercial property.

Thinking about the future here and its bleak prospects is not much fun at all, so instead of too much black-minded introspection you have the pills and the dope, the morning beers, the endless scratch-off lotto cards, healing meetings up on the hill, the federally funded ritual of trading cases of food-stamp Pepsi for packs of Kentuckys Best cigarettes and good old hard currency, tall piles of gas-station nachos, the occasional blast of meth, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, petty crime, the draw, the recreational making and surgical unmaking of teenaged mothers, and death: Life expectancies are short  the typical man here dies well over a decade earlier than does a man in Fairfax County, Va.  and they are getting shorter, womens life expectancy having declined by nearly 1.1 percent from 1987 to 2007.

http://singularityhub.com/2015/04/28/feeding-tomorrows-billions-bioprinted-meat-vertical-farms-ai-designed-recipes-and-more/

&gt;Bioprinting of Meat: Modern Meadow is a Singularity University company that uses bioprinting (tissue engineering and 3D printing) to grow meat (beef, chicken, and pork) and leathers in a lab. Their vision is to do this at scale and dramatically reduce the environmental impact of meat production. In 2012, it took 60 billion land animals to feed 7 billion humans. If successful, bioprinting meat has huge advantages: 99% less land, 96% less water, 96% fewer greenhouse gases, and 45% less energy.

&gt;Genetically Engineered Crops: We will increasingly rely on genetically engineered crops. In 1996, there were 1.7 million hectares of biotech crops in the world; by 2010, the number had jumped to 148 million hectares. This 87-fold increase in hectares makes genetically engineered seeds (GEs) the fastest-adopted crop technology in the history of modern agriculture. After 30 years of research, a great many of our fears about genetically engineered products have been quieted. More than a trillion GE meals have been served, and not a single case of GE-induced illness has turned up.

&gt;Vertical Farming: We will grow our food in AI-controlled vertical buildings, rather than on horizontal land. Vertical farms will be immune to weather, so crops can be grown year-round under optimal conditions. One acre of skyscraper floor produces the equivalent of 10 to 20 traditional soil-based acres. Employing clean-room technologies means no pesticides or herbicides, so there's no agricultural runoff. The fossil fuels now used for plowing, fertilizing, seeding, weeding, harvesting, and delivery are gone as well. On top of all that, we could reforest the old farmland as parkland and slow the loss of biodiversity. Companies like FarmedHere, Green Sense, and groups like MIT's CityFARM are making strides in the field.

&gt;Food Production Closer to Home: The average American foodstuff travels 1,500 miles before it's consumed. As 70% of food's final retail price is from transportation, storage, and handling, these miles add up quickly. With vertical farming and genetic engineering, production will become decentralized and distributed, allowing food to be produced nearer the location of consumption, and food's price to plummet.

&gt;Plant-Based Meat Alternatives: Beyond Meat and Hampton Creek Foods are companies turning plants into foods that look and taste just like meat and eggs. Hampton Creek's data scientists are actively weeding out billions of proteins from hundreds of thousands of plants to learn what could form the equivalent of a chicken's egg. The company is seeking to create the largest plant database in the world.

The main benefit of vertical farming and vat grown meat? We can restore the 40% to 50% of the earth's surface currently used for farming and ranching back to natural wilderness in a its biodiversity glory:

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/12/1209_051209_crops_map.html

&gt;Food production takes up almost half of the planet's land surface and threatens to consume the fertile land that still remains, scientists warn. The global impact of farming on the environment is revealed in new maps, which show that 40 percent of the Earth's land is now given over to agriculture.

&gt;""The satellite data tells us where cultivation is occurring with good spatial accuracy, while the census data is able to tell us what is being grown there,"" said Navin Ramankutty, a land-use researcher with Wisconsin-Madison's Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE).

&gt;The maps suggest that an area roughly the size of South America is used for crop production, while even more land7.9 to 8.9 billion acres (3.2 to 3.6 billion hectares)is being used to raise livestock. And with the world's population growing rapidly, the pressure is on farmers to find new land to cultivate, the study team says.

&gt;""How can we continue to produce food from the land while preventing negative environmental consequences, such as deforestation, water pollution, and soil erosion?"" Ramankutty said.

Vertical farming and vat grown meat are not just for starry eyed dreamers and optimistic futurists. They're attracting hard nosed, bottom line oriented venture capitalists and their money:

http://www.cnbc.com/id/102557803

&gt;From my vantage point of doing deals across a variety of segments, this is an area that has potentially massive long-arc potential for growth. Global demographic and environmental change is reshaping our world, and we, as inhabitants of this world, must in turn change as well. 850 million people, or one in nine people on Earth, today go to bed hungry. Without some sort of disruptive paradigm shift in today's unsustainable agriculture model, the 850 million will surely increase.
These global changes are, and will continue to, impact us all. While the sequencing and severity may vary by region or economic standing (first world versus third world), the challenge, and opportunity exists everywhere.

For investors, this might be the next big thing....

&gt;Yet there is a proliferation of these innovative agriculture companies. Whole Foods has provided funding in the Chicago area to FarmedHere, a vertical farm that also raises tilapia, with the nutrient-rich byproducts in the water being filtered off to benefit the produce crops. Sometimes funding comes from surprising places. Japanese electronics conglomerate Panasonic has moved into farming technology, helping provide equipment for what it says is the first licensed indoor farm in Singapore.

&gt;Some companies will benefit (especially groceries like Whole Foods who can now vertically integrate their supply chains) and hurt others (the suppliers of fertilizers and pesticides like Monsanto, and farming equipment like International Harvester, etc.)

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/04/20/will-vertical-farming-kill-monsanto-company-and-he.aspx

&gt;How would that affect Whole Foods Market and Monsanto? The country's largest organic food supermarket has already announced plans to eliminate products containing ingredients produced from genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, from its shelves by 2018 as well as plans to boost store count by 20%. Vertical farms appear to fit with the company's mission quite perfectly. Perhaps Whole Foods Market will become a vertically integrated business (no pun intended) by owning everything from food production and product distribution. What better way to supply urban stores throughout the country than with a vertical farm right next door?

&gt;The arrival of vertical farming will be one of the most important changes in the history of agriculture. Suddenly, a 1-acre plot of land could support 30 acres of farmland (in a 30-story building), food can be produced in the heart of population centers, and the amount of resources needed to grow crops could be greatly reduced. The possibilities are endless and the advantages undeniable, but a third major food production method doesn't have to mark the end of biotech seeds -- far from it. In fact, I think it's quite possible vertical farming spurs decades of growth for Whole Foods Market and Monsanto. Savvy investors will certainly want to keep an eye on developments in the field, er, warehouse. 

And the biggest beneficiary of vertical farming?

Legal recreational cannabis. And you thought all of those stoners growing pot under grow lights in their college dorm room closets weren't going to amount to anything. Think of the quality control. Think of the productivity. Think of the profits.

http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/07/08/649346/10088504/en/IGC-to-Develop-Multiple-Vertical-Farming-Sites.html

&gt;CEO Ram Mukunda stated, ""We are excited to partner with TerraSphere as we look to both develop proven pesticide-free organic growing intellectual property and secure a meaningful footprint of high tech facilities, in important states, for ultimately growing legal cannabis. In the interim, we expect these facilities to generate accretive revenue from other plants as part of our strategic short-term goal of building profit, while simultaneously moving IGC closer towards meeting our long-term goal of becoming a dominant player in the emerging legal cannabis space.""

I do think that space exploration is what amounts to a global hobby. But it's pretty expensive. Even a fraction of a penny from a tax dollar is allot when you see underfunded school, debt and inadequacies in the healthcare system. And on top of that the massive ammount of fractions of pennies from one country isn't enough to take us to mars.

The US and Russia seem to be the only space cowboys on this rock. I'm sure other nations would love to participate. But the capital investment in a space program is such a heavy commitment that it's almost pointless unless you are willing to cut the safety net. 

This really shouldn't be the case. It should be a global effort of small accomplishments with a wide net. It's really all of the little efforts that create byproducts that spin off into revolutionary technologies like GPS, cell phones and microwaves.

Colonizing mars is not a pressing matter. But the technology it would require to make colonizing mars feasible would improve life on earth big time. If you can make mars livable, imagine what that tech can do here.

Space exploration really should be the Olympics of science. Every country that wants to participate, should. Universities around the world should participate. Perhaps the whole thing could be open source.",20,19

An automation which costs more than a person to do the same labor isn't particularly useful, nor is an automation which requires more resources to produce than it itself produces.

But there's another important limit of automation, but one that I only rarely see discussed - slavery.

Back in the 1800s, humans had property which could perform any tasks that a person could. These were called slaves, and could perform these tasks because they were themselves people.

After numerous bloody wars and international sanctions against slave-holding countries, all countries in the world today have declared slavery illegal - people are not property.

And right now, that isn't much of an issue.

But in the future, as we create increasingly sophisticated machinery capable of ever more cognitively challenging tasks, there may come a point at which, in order to perform a task, we'd need to create something with human-level intellect - an artificial person.

And at that point, we have reached a very fundamental limit of automation, because at that point, we're no longer creating a piece of property, but a child - a person.

And you have to pay people. People have rights and autonomy.

While there are numerous movies about robots that achieve personhood, I seldom see this discussed seriously in terms of the future of automation. This may be because human-level intelligence is potentially extremely difficult to achieve using even future computing technology, but it is a real issue. Any task which cannot be performed by something of sub-human intelligence is a task which potentially can only be performed by a being with intelligence comparable to or greater than a human, which seems very likely to mean that they'd be a person - something capable of thinking for itself, of making decisions, of discharging the rights and responsibilities of a citizen, and, of course, of wanting to get paid for their labor.

This seems like a pretty big barrier to automation - beyond that point, further automation is not possible. You can make better people, but while you might be making people who are more efficient at doing work, you're still making people, who will require pay. Moreover, we are already capable of producing people, and producing people who are very good at certain tasks may not be a terribly profitable endeavor given that buying and selling people - slavery - is illegal. This is a fundamental economic limit as well.

So what do you think? How do you think this issue is likely to play out? Are there any tasks which seem particularly likely to require human-level intelligence, and thus not be possible to automate because of the ""person problem""?",21,8

Essentially, I was watching how they were an advanced civilisation that still had (presumably deliberately) and kept cultural, social, and aesthetic features that would be considered archaic. And I wondered, what if humans in real life did that?



Basically I wonder, if we do advance, and get more and more advanced technology, and maybe even transhumanism, instead of having cultures that pronounce the advanced technology a civilisation has (like sci fi movies always show), instead would a subculture, or even an entire culture go in a ""tangent"" so to speak and combine the advanced technology and aspects of society with more...historical living. 



Instead of uploading minds into a computer, perhaps some people choose to remain biological, albiet in genetically engineered, long lived bodies. Maybe keep your mind capable of uploading in case of accidents, but use it as a safety net rather than existing like that permenantly.




Instead of vast metropolises, maybe a group of people chooses to integrate their lives and technology more with nature.







Instead of lab grown nutrition, maybe some people still grow genetically engineered crops, and animals.




Instead of technology being out in the open, it will be integrated into more mundane things, e.g. you have an ordinary looking cup, but it displays the nutritional content of your beverage, you have ordinary looking clothes, but they repel all stains and liquids, and can actually reconfigure themselves according to temperature.


Is this making any sense? I feel like Im being incoherent.

NK and Vietnam were not democracies. Japan on 1905  was nominally democratic, but its elected leaders were all in cahoots with the military (and often came from the military) and only men who owned some property could vote.

Right now, the gap between the intelligent and the unintelligent, the gap between the wealthy and the not wealthy, and the gap between those who can create more wealth and those who cannot are growing further and further.

Although the politicians are increasingly moved by well-funded lobbies, they are still accountable to the electorate who often do not know what they are doing.

I think that to bring humanity to the stars, we will need rapid political reforms which will give a greater voting power to those with advanced education in real subjects, those who actually pay for social services, etc. 

Getting to the stars will increase economic growth . Singularity may or may not - Singularity will open new doors but how it will make the rich richer is not clear yet.

Otherwise the world will hit an economic iceberg of zero growth soon.

If the West can't, Asia will. Most of Asia's 'democracies' are just little more than civilized duels between influential families, who find voting boxes are cheaper than weapons.

Asia will introduce political reforms. Since many Asians know voting is just choosing between Scion A and Scion B, they will agree and if some do not they could be easily dealt with.

I do think that by 2025 it will be too late to change humanity's course. The country which first introduces reforms to maximize utility and minimize useless spending will have a significant advantage which will be hard to surmount.",4,0

A) Institute a robot tax to mitigate the job-loss caused by automation given the premise that it inherently has high business ROI

B) Incentivize the tech industry to rapidly adopt automation without regulation

C) Both A &amp; B

D) Neither

I'm not here to debate the legitimacy of this document but rather look at the content and open a dialogue about our future as a human race. When I read it I immediately thought of the block chain. Could this be our direction for the future's economy? Lets Discuss. 

""I dare you to throw out all your money, all your papers and coins and individual national currencies, and start over. Develop an international monetary system that is wide open, totally visible, immediately traceable, completely accountable. Establish a Worldwide Compensation System by which people would be given Credits for services rendered and products produced, and Debits for services used and products consumed.
 
Everything would be on the system of Credits and Debits. Returns on investments, inheritances, winnings of wagers, salaries and wages, tips and gratuities, everything. And nothing could be purchased without Credits. There would be no other negotiable currency. And everyones records would be open to everyone else.
 
It has been said, show me a mans bank account, and Ill show you the man. This system comes close to that scenario. People would, or at least could, know a great deal more about you than they know now. But not only would you know more about each other; you would know more about everything. More about what corporations are paying and spendingand what their cost is on an item, as well as their price. (Can you imagine what corporations would do if they had to put two figures on every price tagthe price and their cost? Would that bring prices down, or what! Would that increase competition, and boost fair trade? You cant even imagine the consequences of such a thing.)
 
Under the new Worldwide Compensation System, WCS, the transfer of Debits and Credits would be immediate and totally visible. That is, anybody and everybody could inspect the account of any other person or organization at any time. Nothing would be kept secret, nothing would be private.
 
The WCS would deduct 10 percent of all earnings each year from the incomes of those voluntarily requesting such a deduction. There would be no income tax, no forms to file, no deductions to figure, no escape hatch to construct or obfuscation to manufacture! Since all records would be open, everyone in the society would be able to observe who was choosing to offer the 10 percent for the general good of all, and who was not. This voluntary deduction would go toward support of all the programs and services of the government, as voted on by the people.
 
The whole system would be all very simple, all very visible.
 
*The world would never agree to such a thing.*
 
Of course not. And do you know why? Because such a system would make it impossible for anyone to do anything they didnt want someone else to know about. Yet why would you want to do something like that anyway? Ill tell you why. Because currently you live within an interactive social system based on taking advantage, getting the edge, making the most, and the survival of the so-called fittest.
 
When the chief aim and goal of your society (as it is in all truly enlightened societies) is the survival of all; the benefit, equally, of all; the providing of a good life for all, then your need for secrecy and quiet dealings and under the table maneuverings and money which can be hidden will disappear.
 
Do you realize how much good old-fashioned corruption, to say nothing of lesser unfairnesses and inequities, would be eliminated through the implementation of such a system?
 
The secret here, the watchword here, is visibility.""

I am a college sophomore at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. Currently, I am studying as an undeclared engineer. I am having a difficult time declaring which field of engineering I wish to study.

A little about myself:

* I am a jack of all trades. The idea of narrowing my field of study is frightening to say the least.

* I am young and creative. I consider this creativity a blessing, but other have often sensed naivety in my imagination.

* I have exceptional skills in physical sciences (mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc.); however, my social science (history, language, arts, etc,) fall short.

* Although liberal arts are not my specialty, I excel in studies of music. The reasoning behind this is either my scientific views of music or my perfectionist attitude I illustrate in most aspects of my life.

Currently, my plans are to fall into the category of Electrical Engineering after Spring 2016, complete that undergraduate program, then apply to the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Biomedical Engineering graduate program. My interests there would include macro- and micro-prosthetics, cybernetics, bionics, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, and, perhaps, artificial intelligence. 

I am looking for the best way to assure that my goals are reached. I want to use the vast amounts of untapped technology at my fingertips to better the world around me medically, socially, and, if necessary, militarily. 

Here is a link to Auburn University's Undergraduate majors:
http://bulletin.auburn.edu/undergraduate/majors/
After perusing this, please give me feedback, positive or negative, on my plans and perhaps some suggestions. 

Graduate Programs do not need to be limited to UAB; however, reasonable suggestions are appreciated. Doctrinal studies my also be an option if the circumstance arises.",6,0

I already read 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3328m7/how_will_we_cope_with_the_degradation_of_the/

so the questions in there does not have to be reiterated.

I do think that sooner or later, no matter how rich one might be, environmental degradation combined with desperate population will create a great problem today's tech and ideologies can't solve.

It is not certain whether the ultra-militarize police and drones can quash revolts since the rebels, if they have any brains, will have their share of techies trying to undermine these valiant defenders of civilization from the power of Darkness.

Singularity may not be enough. Nanotech machines do need energy, and whatever they do, they do increase entropy and cause effects not desired by the designers of nanotech tools.

K Type I would mean virtually harnessing all of the earth's energy and reshape the earth according to whatever the possessor of these tech feels like it.

That means, the civ which has KTI will be immune from any environmental degradation, and therefore any consequences from pollution, etc.

I think by 2040, 25 years from now, all the damages by the environmental degradation will began to become serious. I think KTI should already be reached by then, and plans to escape to the stars , a la interstellar, should be implemented long before the thing actually happens.",1,0

1784,2015-10-22,2015,10,22,6,3popow,"I am increasingly of the belief that ""consciousness"" is the ability to simulate another network inside your first, and imagine hypothetical situations. When we create a neural net that can simulate a smaller network inside itself, will we have created sentience?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3popow/i_am_increasingly_of_the_belief_that/,americanpegasus,1445462118,"In a related post just now I was discussing when we would first consider an AI as ""being sentient"".  I think many of us agree that we first ""came online"" around three or four years old.  This seems to be the minimum necessary complexity for a consciousness to arise.  
  
But what happens then?  What are you first memories?  
  
For me, they are cause and effect type musings: ""if i'm hungry, i can crawl over to this cabinet and open this..."" (as bottles cascaded all over my head).  ""if i'm unhappy, and cry, maybe mom will fix the problem"" (nope, lol, got spanked).  
  
Maybe imagination and consciousness are inherently linked such that we become 'conscious' when we reach a complexity where we are able to simulate a more abstract network than the one we are currently running on.  We do this by instinct, but our ancestors selected for this new ability (allowed by our pre-frontal cortex: https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy/transcript?language=en) because it gave them a massive advantage vs the fire-and-forget strategies of their ancestors.  
  
This principal also theoretically extends to any large network.  
  
For example, humanity has existed as nodes in a distributed network for a long time.  But the 'consciousness' of our species was a lumbersome beast of civilization that was inefficiently passed from one of us to another.  But what has happened recently?  With the rise of the internet, we are obviously **far** more 'conscious' than we ever were before.  This is because the nodes that make us up (individual humans) now have a second abstraction of a neural network (the internet) upon which we can imagine things.  This is the dawn of our global brain.  
  
Any opinions or ideas about extending/testing this hypothesis?  Are there any examples of an AI out there than can 'imagine' situations before it acts on them?  
  
---------------  
  
**edit**: Also, and this is important; *empathy* comes from the ability to *simulate* the experience of being another object: a rock, a pet, or a human vs. just yourself.  Perhaps empathy developed in humans slightly after consciousness did as another survival advantage.  In any case, empathy allows you to run a simulation (imagination) of another object and decide how your actions might affect it or how it's actions might affect you.  Therefore the key to creating a ""nice"" AI that won't turn us into paperclips is ensuring that it runs simulations of all those who might be affected by its actions (of a given complexity or higher) and makes sure it's decisions are at least in consensus with those simulations.  
  
------  
  
*double-edit*: I need to probably write this up into something more formal, and include some neuroscience research as well as current AI algorithms that are being used in things like Google's Deep Mind, but I really think there's something here.  This is why we believe we are conscious and have ""free will"" - we are constantly running simulations of reality (explaining why imagination and intelligence seem linked) and then select from decisions influenced and modified by those simulations.  
  
------  
  
*triple-edit*: Perhaps on a programming level this can be achieved by a simplified type of recursion?  To avoid the halting problem you would need to have constraints in the master function such that when it calls itself to imagine a subset of data, it doesn't do so in as precise of detail as the original function.  Eventually the hypothetical 'dreams' are forced to collapse into a decision because the current instance has grown too vague to be of any use.  
  
The exact constraints and ratios about how much of the functionality each nested ""imagination"" call are up for discussion but it seems that this recursory process is analogous to what humans do to imagine things.  ",19,6

Scientists like Stephen Hawking and groups like the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford are concerned about the enormous uncertainties such an AI would create. 

But why are we concerned about these uncertainties? I had a thought about this, we don't really have much control over how our children decide to run the world. Our parents and grandparents (I'm a millennial) often had radically different beliefs about the world and how to run it, but our grandparents eventually die and our parents retire to leave us to run the world. Over generations, things change dramatically: monarchies become democracies and vice versa, minor philosophies become dominant over established ones, science clashes with belief, progress clashes with restraint, etc. 

How are raising children that will run and change the world we helped build any different from creating an artificial consciousness that will do the exact same thing? Granted, it will be much more accelerated, but isn't this a good thing?

**Potential Situation:**

A self driving car w/ 1 passenger is driving on a long bridge (55 mph) when at the last second a (non self driving) car containing 4 distracted teenagers veers into their lane from the opposite direction (65 mph).

The car now has to make a decision on what to do:

* Choice 1.  Swerve to the left (into oncoming traffic), crashing into a different car (containing a driver not wearing their seat belt) 
* Choice 2.  Activate the brakes quickly, and crash directly into the car at slightly slower speed (say 45 mph) (assumption is other car still traveling at 65 mph)
* Choice 3.  Swerve to the right, avoiding the car/oncoming traffic, but directly off of the bridge, and fall 100 feet into a river 

**---------- Assumptions ----------**

* Choice 1 results in a head on collision between two people, with a high probably of 1 fatality (person w/out a seat belt) and 1 person getting injured (passenger of Self driving car)


* Choice 2 results in a head on collision between 5 people, w/ a high probability of multiple fatalities.  


* Choice 3 results in a 1 person accident with a high probability of 1 fatality.  


Assuming the car is able to calculate all of these scenarios, and deems that the best chance at limiting the total loss of life is to drive itself off of the bridge, will it do that?  Or will the automakers program the vehicle so that it chooses the best case scenario (highest chance of survival) for ITS own passenger only, with no regard to 'other vehicles'?

[Automation will replace most jobs, yes, but will we even need significant income?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3lwvds/automation_will_replace_most_jobs_yes_but_will_we/)

I think that ultimately automation will be a good thing and most people will be able to live a better life, but my theory depends heavily on the assumption that people would have the necessary equipment in the first place.

I was looking at the [2014 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm) for the United States and I realized were going to face a very turbulent future indeed.

* The consesus  in this sub seems to be that Production Occupations will be the first sector to become automated. [8,934,050 jobs there alone.](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes510000.htm)
* Then I guess its transportation. [9,249,310 jobs.](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes530000.htm)  
* Food Preparation and Serving employs [12,277,720 people](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes350000.htm), with 3,651,300 related to fast food alone.  
* Sales and Related Occupations: [14,248,470](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes410000.htm), with 4,539,270 working on grocery stores, general merchandise stores, clothing stores, department stores and gasoline stations.

Thats 44,709,550 jobs, with plenty of other industries I havent mentioned. If we assume a 20% automation rate for the next 10 years (which is reasonably low IMO), thats *8,941,910 people* becoming unemployed in the sectors I mentioned above.

I said in my previous thread about automation that people wont even need significant income, but my theorys weakness is that it relies on the assumption that people would be able to afford 3D printers, computers and materials in the first place.    
This made me very concerned:    
[62% of Americans Have Under $1,000 in Savings, Survey Finds](http://www.gobankingrates.com/savings-account/62-percent-americans-under-1000-savings-survey-finds/)

This means its very likely that, whenever the next industrial revolution really kicks in, the vast majority of the american population wont be able to afford what they need to subsist without a job.  
What does that mean in practical terms? The first thing that comes to mind are politicians. This will look very bad on them, and theyll try to do whatever they can so that theyre able to say theyve created jobs.

Were already seeing strikes and even vandalism because of Uber, and thats not even automation-related. What happens when cabs dont even have drivers anymore?   
Some countries, like Japan, are already embracing them. But Id bet many taxi drivers in other countries will vandalize driverless cars.

I think corporations will be vilified for replacing human workers, even though itll make things cheaper, faster and more efficient for everyone involved.  
People constantly mention basic income as a solution, but I dont think that would work. Governments would have to increase the corporate tax burden, because the average worker wouldnt have that high an income to be taxed, and jobs would be dropping like flies already.  
What happens when they try to tax companies and distribute basic income? What already happens, really. Companies will just move elsewhere and even more people will lose their jobs. Smaller countries with small populations will make themselves tax havens so that their own politicians can get some of that money, even if its a very low percentage, because in the end some income for them is better than none at all.

With companies moving away and people losing jobs, the federal governments revenue will decrease rapidly, but at the same time government spending on welfare will be higher than ever before, and this is when I see major civil unrest taking place.  
3D-printed guns and perhaps even explosives will be widespread, and things could get ugly really fast.

What do you think? I really dont see how this could be prevented.",16,0

Perhaps even a painting could be painted from within a full-immersion virtual world, and then what exactly is ""the original"" in this case, other than a recorded set of defining information that can be digitally transferred and mass 3D produced/replicated similar to how music and movies can be shared today.

Will the current earth realm, as we live in today, remain like an anchoring reality, while all manner of full-immersion virtual worlds become sub-realities that are dependent upon the harmonious functioning of host computers in the anchoring reality?

Or might it be possible that virtual worlds will be created such that they become self-sustaining nodes in a great network of virtual worlds, whereby our current earth realm is effectively just another virtual world with no necessarily special anchoring properties? This would amount to universe creation.

Perhaps our earth realm is already just a node amidst a sea of virtual worlds, and when we obtain the power to create new nodes, we will gain access to the ""true universe"" which is actually an infinite network of virtual worlds. If this is true, then maybe the Mona Lisa painting is already just a set of digital information, and its physical manifestation is not ""the original"", but merely a representation of the dynamic data-set that defines it. This leads me to additional quizzitudes, like wondering where exists the ""original"" data set that defines a given human being. Perhaps that source data is inherent to the being, and we are all basically universes unto ourselves, gradually coming to gaze upon the infinitely subtle maze of creative powers that beckon to us from the unraveling chrysalis of our very own existence.

But I dont see that happening to all of us. Just like dad's with fashion, some of us will stop trying to keep up and live happy lives with a certain amount of technology in our lives. Personally, I'm happy right now. What are we lacking? Not to say that we shouldn't progress but the problem with technology is that it starts out optional and becomes mandatory. Think of cell phones. If you say you don't have a cell phone or a car or a TV you get funny looks from people, like you're a little insane or a little homeless to not have these items. It's only going to get worse. ""You mean you *don't* have the new iPhone brain implant? How do you survive?"" 

Anyways, what do futurologists think? Are we doomed to be led by technology or will there be a choice.  Small enclaves or small cities that form around say, 2010 technology and another around 2020 technology and another around 2030 technology, etc.  Then, could we be allowed to live backwards? 1800s technology? 1950s technology?

It is used as a tool to work more effectively and efficiently.  
Now computer language (programming) is our major form of communication.

Evolution takes the path of least resistance with the highest survivor rate.
All the while highly influenced by physical and moral concerns.
 -----------------------------------------
 

I would like to make an argument on these issues.  Future issues pending.
Do you have any questions about these statements?
------------------------------------------

 

Unlike a machine I am a mortal and can not have my broken parts replaced indefinitely

As well, my ability to retain peek performance dwindles with age.

Not so with computer advancement technologies (hardware and software).

Not unlike other forms of communication...computer programming is 

evolving in it's own participation (environmentally and morally).

Reflecting it's self image to future generations of user interface.

-----------------------------------------

 

Design is the science of function.

A chair has a specific design for it's engineered purpose (stool or throne).

The technological advancements for the chair design has it's constraints, not communication.

Man's design of communication mutates, into slang, in response to public mass appeal, advertising.

But is there a calculated end game to the future purpose?

What becomes of the social and moral laws to govern freedom or censorship?

--------------------------------------------

 

Speaking in code is to make a private language, pig Latin or Klingon.

The ability to transfer information privately is power and espionage.

Hackers dislike infinite power so fight with espionage only to force creation of new code walls.

A game of intelligent moves and counter moves based on public access of provided information.

Now the speed for the transfer of communication is a social game changer.

---------------------------------------------

 

With daily sensory capacity overload, old people can't seem to work the TV controls.

Programming or programed to comprehend the advancing technologies.

Not completely understanding the function of the design.

Now an environment rapidly creating Dick Tracy watches and photo shopped selfies.

Is self awareness the communication or the language?  A product or a creator?

-------------------------------------------

 

Society is running the business of communication as it did with transportation, currency,

and war. 

Keep isolated and separate (divide and conquer) yet maintain control of the monopoly.

The new technologies of the internet is now a product like the invention of fire, very hard to

contain with such speeds of development (popularity almost a necessity).

Would the world end without computer communication (possibly our standard of wealth)?

Can we pull the plug on any current major commodity and not feel a global ripple?

With all this fuzz about back to the future day during the week and having recently watched 2001 A Space Odyssey I found myself wondering what the most important milestones of the past decades have been. 
This sub sees the future with a lot more optimism than most people do, mainly because most people don't actually bother to look for what's happening, however based on previous optimistic estimates such as the ones above we could be off by quite a lot. 
Many of the things portrayed by 2001 A Space Odyssey are just starting to happen now, in 2015, and chances are they'll take a couple more years to really start maturing as technologies, and many of those on Back to the Future have happened for completely different reasons and with completely different implications (i.e. the Internet)(of course this was a lot more science fiction than actual science but bear with me). 
Many of the ""coolest"" features of both, however, seem not to have happened at all and I can't help but feel Marty McFly or the regular 1968-1970 guy would be dissapointed in many ways about the progress we've made, hence my question, what have we actually achieved as a species?",29,13

Even in the so-called 'advanced countries', there are clearly a lot of people who may be able to use some aspects of the new tech, but are not exactly in the position to get much out of it.

Although so far the wealthy and powerful, the only people who can drive some part of humanity to the next level of civilization, have been able to keep the world masses quiet, there is a slight chance that they will lose, because there are always people like Urban of Hungary (who sold the cannons which could destroy Constantinople to the Turks) who would side with the masses for their own benefit.

If the masses win, the best and brightest lose and the advance of civilization stops.

Right now, the power of the unwashed masses is on their weight of numbers. It will be necessary to develop some kind of ideology that those with skills and ability to drive to the future are , well, different from those who can't, so the world could concentrate all of its energy to reach the next level of civilization (it may or may not be singularity, but if it is something the masses can't touch, that's good enough).

Clean energy is often hailed as the solution to this but nuclear is more like fossil fuels in that it involves liberating energy which has been sequestered from the climactic system. 

Even long-promised fusion with its supposed perfect cleanliness and limitless fuel means adding energy to the earth's climactic system that was previously locked up in the strong nuclear forces in a hydrogen atom. 

How much energy do we, as a species consume? How much could we? If tomorrow energy were essentially free - both in terms of dollars and pollution - how much of an increase in our usage would it take to outstrip the environmental advantages of non-greenhouse producing energy and replace ""the green house effect"" with ""the waste heat problem?""

&gt;	Once upon a time, on Tralfamadore there were creatures who weren't anything like machines. They weren't dependable. They weren't efficient. They weren't predictable. They weren't durable. 

&gt;	And these poor creatures were obsessed by the idea that everything that existed had to have a purpose, and that some
purposes were higher than others. 


&gt;	These creatures spent most of their time trying to find out what their purpose was. And every time they found out what seemed to be a purpose of themselves, the purpose seemed so low that the creatures were filled with disgust and shame. 

&gt;	And, rather than serve such a low purpose, the creatures would make a machine to serve it. This left the creatures free to serve higher purposes. But whenever they found a higher purpose, the purpose still wasn't high enough. 

&gt;	So machines were made to serve higher purposes, too. 

&gt;	And the machines did everything to expertly that they were finally given the job of finding out what the higher purpose of the creatures could be. The machines reported in all honesty that the creatures couldn't really be said to have any purpose at all. 

&gt;	The creatures thereupon began slaying each other, because they hated purposeless things above all else.

&gt;	And they discovered that they weren't even very good at slaying. So they turned that job over to the machines, too.

&gt;	And the machines finished up the job in less time than it takes to say, ""Tralfamadore."" 

Now replace ""Tralfamadore"" with ""Earth"".

Help, to make a lasting change to the timeline of humanity!

How to accelerate research (for our most urging problems)?

2 of my suggestions:
1)I would start many bottom-up Research 'clubs' for students. (our country doesn't have those)
2)Create a research fund, that works like the marshall plan but as a business angel/angel investor in high technologies. So it reinvests in itself and grows endlessly, so more and more high tech can be realized.
2.1) inspire people to invest in technologies that will solve problems.
3) Inspire school children. 
4) be the best Innovation manager, R&amp;D developer and Research policy advisor in the world.
5)????? (of course i have ideals but some really different ones?)

It would be great to get more realistic crystal clear ideas how research can be accelerated!
--
How can i make people research and realize their findings to make the world a place more suitable for living? All i want to do is to make the world a better place in the long run.

tl;dr:How to accelerate research?

Democracy, egalitarianism, etc are becoming more irrelevant as tech advances and those who are in the position to use them get much more ahead from the rest of humanity.

It is likely that only a few percent of population , even in the advanced countries, will be in the position to benefit from the new tech which means they are probably likely to monopolize its benefits.

Even a cursory thought makes it clear that not too many people can enjoy the benefits of the super-tech.

Let's imagine everyone has nukes and can use them whenever he or she or it feels like that. What will happen to the world?

Or, let's assume 3-D printers get cheaper and more people have access to them and things get a bit more advanced so everyone can make the things they wish with them. 

The world's economy will collapse.

It is like giving everyone the Ring of Sauron. Frodo the fool gave it up with Gandalf's sweet-talking, but not everyone will be like him.

It is unavoidable that those who reach Kardashev Type I or singularity first will quickly monopolize the world's power. Just like the Americans who quickly monopolized the world's power with the A-Bomb on 1945.

Some people, like the Rosenbergs, gave the tech to USSR so USA would not be the only country which has the bomb, but the Soviet bomb was greatly inferior to the American one for most of the early 1950s. 

Given that singularity or KI would require a heavier investment and a greater scale than a nuke, which even North Korea can make now (as I have written in a few previous posts), it is very unlikely that a nation/group/whatever , after singularity or KI is achieved, will be able to quickly follow the example overnight. 

Of course that means the immediate death of democracy, freedom, etc, and all that, since almost everything is no longer relevant after these goals are reached and those who did it have entered a new stage of civilization/existence/whatever you can name it.

It is , say, like an Australopithecus learning how to walk in 2 feet - the leap is comparable to that. 

There will be new problems after reaching these stages but that's something to be worried about when that takes place. It suffices to say that whoever has reached them first is probably going to be remembered as gods by subsequent generation, like Prometheus, the guy who discovered fire. ",14,0

The limit and ease to how deep you can build something is, I believe, at least slightly better than to how tall you can build something, besides the possibility for ""modular building"" in which you build a whole ""building"" room by room and still being allowed to expand any floor sideways off the alignment of the subsequent floors. 
Also, if you create underground building techniques well enough, you could have a whole city just under a forest, with a few towers above ground and a few constructions above the trees supported by the towers, trails through the forest and other commodities in tune with nature without having to put even a single tree down nor to expel almost any animals from its natural habitat.

Subways and Hyperloops for transportation, a few tunnels with access from every ""building"" solely for personal vehicles and not a single ""street"" on the ""walking"" and ""living"" areas.
I truly believe humanity could benefit quite a lot if turning towards the underground to further develop it's living conditions, if done properly.
Civilizations of old, ants and other insects thrived for uncountable years on that, but we still try to build things higher instead of deeper.
Besides, the deeper you go, the shorter the distance between point A and point B when compared to it's correlating surface point, so even travel time could be shortened, I think.
We don't need to forsake the surface to go underground, but we could forsake the above ground ""concrete jungles"" and let real forests live again while settling mostly bellow it with quite a few access to the surface. 
Merging with nature in coexistence is possible.",25,53

Its basically multidomain questions. Any solution will probably need to integrate medical, electronical and information processing knowledge. So i am posting it here because its definitelly futuristic.

Basically i will like to have a special device. It will observe my body. Camera will observe my face. Sensors on head will record brain waves. And other accessible informations about my body workings. That complex coctail of information will go to device and device will extract from it ideally single number between 0.0 and 1.0. If i am maximally concentrated at present moment device will output 1.0 (some traditions calls this state of high concentration to present moment ""Now"" ) If i am sleepeing it will output 0.0. If i am daydreaming it will output maybe 0.5. In other word more i am aware of present moment then ouput will be more near to 1.0. And more i am lossing conscious control what i am doing at present moment then output will be more near to 0.0.

Having that device i can make ""consiousness regulator"" which immediatelly notify me if my brain start to slides to unconscious
states and automatisms. This will help me to live more in present moment with less distractions of thought about past and future and things unrelated to present moment. Simply sayed it helps me to enjoy more life i am living Now. It can also notifies me when i am exhausted too much and should relax or sleep instead to trying to be more conscious.

I think that device should be possible because human brain ""leaks"" lot of information about its inner workings throught body behavior. And if human observes another human doing something he can give some information about in which conscious state obeserved human is and therefore informations about state of consiousness must be contained in leaked informations. So with more detailed recording of informations body produces and more precisse processing it should be possible to get outputs better than human observer can.

Still this is very complex task to do. Any related ideas?

I am also curious if there is some half-solution, some heuristic or trick to force human behind computer to be more in state of concentration to present moment?  ",1,7

In this scenario, should we forbid this basic needs to those who don't have an income in order to force them to ""work"" or ""die""? Even if there are not enough jobs? The answer is obvious, the proof is that, in 2015, there's still poverty and unemployment in developed countries where food is wasted.

Nobody dies in for example, the EU, because of hunger or because the lack of medical assistance. But we tend to understand that people must be poor if they don't have a job (or even if they have a bad one). That's a medieval idea issued from scarcity: in 1900 people died in Europe because of starvation, after eating the horses.

Actually, we could invent more jobs, but there's no point to worry about having or not one because abundance is technologically provide. The problem is that this system is based on scarcity and coercion and it's not able to provide a good base to allow exponential and disruptive changes. There's a huge contradiction that we have to solve.

My point, after saying this, is that population is not a problem, but an indicator of how a civilization is advanced. The more population there is, the more technolgy has this civilization to provide such quantity of individuals. Considering the ""exponential"" nature of this growth, that correlates perfectly with technology so, the idea of ""overpopulation"" is based on linear intuition of what progress is and I'm pretty sure that population will still grow exponentially (the Universe is huge).

At this point of my argument, we must consider the critical inflexion points of population growth in order to understand when we could reach the next big step. We may be not so different from a bacterial form of live...

But, considering the Law of Accelerating Returns, I guess we don't have to worry about overpopulation anymore. That's an idea from past times and from the reality of our days: radical income inequality.",4,0

We share one planet with our DNA as humans interwoven with everything that lives on this world. Actually the whole universe, as Neil deGrasse Tyson says: ""We are all connected to each other biologically, to the earth chemically and to the rest of the universe atomically"".

Isn't it a great time now as a species to grow up and put the crayons back in the box? Stop drawing lines on the ground and learn to share the planet? Especially in a time now where we're subjected to a culture of fear bread by a few extremists from different ideologies that ironically share so many believes but still keep fighting and thinking they are more privileged/different then one another which could lead to extinction of all life as we know it.

I think it's really time for a world resource based economy, Jacque Fresco hits the nail on the head with that one: ""Earth is abundant with plentiful resources. Our practice of rationing resources through monetary control is no longer relevant and is counter-productive to our survival.""",31,2

Even if it takes much more energy to produce the hydrogen, ship it, and power a car with it, the process will be much cheaper per Kw/h if the hydrogen is produced from solar farms in Africa. Covering Africa with 4x - 8x as many solar farms as would be necessary to power the world might be cheaper than simply producing electricity locally.

Because of this, perhaps it makes more sense economically to simply use the less efficient method of solar-powered hydrogen fuel production, and take advantage of existing liquid fuel transport infrastructure, particularly considering the risk of power grids toppling catastrophically in the wake of local generation.

Why aren't we doing it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3qmkiq/skydiving_from_helium_balloons_anchored_to_the/,OkImJustSayin,1446072554,"So, for a long time(since I was about 8) I have had this dream/idea of a 'theme park ride' sort of thing that would essentially be a large helium filled balloon(or balloons, for safety) that have enough lift to raise a person and the cable attached to them to 20'000 feet or so.

I never really looked into the logistics of it, but today I got bored and started searching for materials. Rope and cables that have a few tonnes of strength range from 10-15kg per 100m, or 100-150kg per km. 10km/33000ft = 1500kg of rope/cable.

So, the rope/cable is light enough to reach the 30000ft I desire. I'm sure if I really looked around I could find something a bit stronger/lighter, but this is good enough for the conceptual process thus far.

Hot air balloons vary from 1840 to 2973 cubic meters, according to google. Helium has a kilo of lift per cubic meter, or thereabouts. 1800 kilos of lift from a 'small' hot air ballon-like design would be more than enough to get a person(or 2, or 3) up in the air.

The balloon would be attached to a winch, so would be pulled back down after each use, to be used again and again.

So.. why don't we do this? It seems that *technically* it's possible, but I would hazard to guess that the local government wouldn't be too happy with people using these devices(airspace problems etc).

Issues I can see would be hitting the line on the descent, but I think large and obvious fluoro markers/flags every 50m would give divers more than enough awareness to avoid that.

I reason I think this would be great is:

1: Going up silently, enjoying the views, it would be very peaceful compared to the loud and intense occasion that going up in a small plane is.

2: No fuel used, cost of operation would be much less than having to pay pilots, runway usage, maintanence on aircraft, etc etc. Skydiving could become a lot cheaper!

3: Safer(possibly). Planes have a million things that can go wrong with them, rely on a single person to make sure everyone doesn't die, and move fast so issues while exiting the plane are a possibility. Now, not to say things couldn't go wrong with this concept of mine, but it seems to me that the moving parts and components of it are very small in number so would be easier to make sure everything is safe and operateing normally. No pilot is needed either, so assuming the operator has checked the weather forecast, it seems like there would be less room for mishaps. 


What do you guys think?

EDIT: Ok so I don't know why this never occured to me, but I just think I thought of a *much* better way to do this.

So, instead of having a 1500kg cable and a super expensive, giant ass winch pulling it back down each time, how about just an engine.. electric or combustion, that is essentially pointing strait toward the earth. When the people are released, it powers up and starts pulling the balloons back down. I'm positive that with 1000kg of play, an engine/battery/fuel supply could be arranged to do this. It only needs to pull 1500/2000kg of payload less than 10km, what do you guys think?",40,10

Sorry if this is not an appropriate place for this sort of post, if there's any other place that might be better let me know!

First things first, while I like all the topics, I'm fascinated mostly by the prospect of AGI and more so, supercomputers with ASI. Based on my limited knowledge, it seems like the day these machines arrive, the transformation will be extraordinary; on par with the developments in Mesopotamia 10,000 years ago as far as civilization goes. (Possible that the majority of humans will never need to work again, live forever, travel through space, etc.) I've seen some things Kurzweil has said about these potential machines; they'll be able to solve problems humanity has collectively worked on for decades in a matter of seconds. It's easy to imagine them figuring out immortality, digital consciousness, space travel, all those other sweet things from science fiction (assuming we haven't figured them out first in the meantime), and probably stuff we can't even conceive of right now.

This is where I get caught up: the politics of it all. Who's going to possess this sort of machine (or future technology generally)? I often find myself jumping to a dystopian view: the world's most powerful people will. I'm not pulling out the tin-foil, as I don't think there's anything as nonsensical as an organized ""Illuminati."" But it isn't a stretch to believe that humanity's powerful elite share similar thought processes about the direction of technology and humanity; and there's no doubt that resources and those who have them rule the world as they always have and likely always will. We're already going in that direction: the only members of the public who are able to visit space are people who can afford to drop $20m. 

I'm going to cut myself off before this becomes the length of a modern day budget bill. What do you guys think? Am I thinking too much in fiction? Assuming the best futurologists' predictions are realized; who will possess the technology, and what will happen to the rest of us? 

Man, the future is so fucking exciting. Being alive right now is extraordinary. Being alive in 2050 will be mind-boggling and almost incomprehensible. Go humans! We're badass!",5,0

**PUTS ON MORPHEUS GLASSES**


I'm going to make prediction and say that in 15 years the majority of cars on the roads in cities will be self-driving. The obvious argument against that is that there's still going to be cars made probably for the next 10 years with zero self-driving capabilities. Therefore if the average life expectancy of a car is 15 years then 10 years + 15 = 25 years before the most of the cars are self driving and still probably 25 years + 10 extra for really tough vehicles = 35 years before manual-driving only cars are extremely rare on city roads.


So how can it be that in only 15 years most cars will be self driving? Because Uber has expressed interest in making all its cars self driving. This will bring down the costs because insurance will probably be cheaper and you wont have to pay a driver. So as long as uber and companies alike have healthy competition then the total cost of taking an uber especially if you just need it for commuting is going to go down.


The average cost of driving a vehicle is about $9,000 a year if you include everything. So even if it costs you $7,000 to take a self-driving uber yearly then it's saved you $2,000 which is a pretty big deal since it requires almost no life style change at all and you save $2,000. And of course the more people you share your ride with the more money/energy you save so you get the added benefit of being more green also since there would be less cars on the road that means less accidents and less road repairs which is also more green and economical.


So basically why would continue to potentially drive a manual car for $9,000 a year when you could not worry at all about driving, insurance, theft, or damage, and save a couple thousand dollars a year with very little lifestyle change? 


So basically I'm saying once people realize that it's significantly cheaper but just as convenient and comfortable they will sell their manual cars for scrape metal and sell their self driving ones to be used by uber. Of course there will still be a market for some people who want/need to actually own their own vehicles but it will be a small niche market and most people in cities will use things like uber to get around.

http://www.who.int/ageing/global-strategy/GSAP-ageing-health-draft.pdf

Sadly, their draft is missing advanced preventive healthcare research and development as a priority. This glaring omission is caused by the fact that, In the first session of the W.H.O., too little was said about the potential of the technology. Nothing was said about the fact that such research would radically lower the cost of healthcare around the world. Nothing was said about the need to find ways to incorporate nanotechnology into cures for diseases ranging from diabetes to heart disease...from altzheimers to cancer.

Finding cures is supposed to be what the World Health Organization is all about, yet oddly...the priority of finding ways to help people live longer via technological advancement in medicine does not appear to be a priority. Instead, they are pursuing a business as usual approach to medicine.

The reports of W.H.O officials show that the biomedical research remains unappreciated as a mean to address the issue of aging population. The voices of the scientific community and transhumanists are not being heard.

Fortunately, we still have the possibility to promote our position :

If you are truly interested in being healthy...and if you really do want to live longer (without getting sick or infirm) you need only download and complete the following survey form :

http://www.who.int/entity/ageing/draft-zero-gsap-ageing-and-health-survey.doc?ua=1 ,

Fill it and email it to HealthyAgeing@who.int

Translators who can translate in UN official languages should send a copy of their translation(s) to support aging research.

By doing this, our efforts will call attention to the crying need for medical research which the World Health Organization is ignoring.

Examples of petitions you can circulate follow:

1.One of the first strategic objectives should be to promote fundamental and translational research to prevent, postpone and treat age-related decline, including frailty and aging diseases. This priority should be further developed in the following sections of the proposed draft :

A) In Section 4.2 Guiding principles should include the principle fostering scientific advancement to prevent and treat ageing related functional decline and to promote healthy and active longevity.

B) In Section 5.3 Proposed Strategic objectives of the Five Year Strategy (2016-2020) should include Supporting biomedical fundamental and translational research aimed to ensure healthy longevity.

C) In Section 5.4. Strategic Objective 1 proposed actions should include promoting, translating and disseminating research to identify the causes of ageing related functional decline, effective approaches for its prevention and control

D) In Section 6.1. Measures of success should include a set of indicators on fostering scientific advancement to prevent ageing related functional decline and to promote healthy and active longevity, such as having a share of GDP allocated to ageing related biomedical R&amp;D, growing the number of clinical trials to prevent and treat ageing-related disease, and, the number of new evidence based therapies and diagnostic methods to prevent and compensate for ageing related health decline, the number of new patents in this area, and most importantly, the number of people benefiting from the biomedical technologies, the number of cases of disability and mortality prevented.

E) Section 6.2 should be expanded to create a a special organizational body should be created by the World Health Organization. This body should be for the express purpose of coordinating research and development in the area of biological processes that underlie ageing (pathological age-related processes), their prevention and treatment; further, this organizational body should include research organizations and NGOs supporting biomedical research and advocating healthy longevity.

Of note, the Healthy Ageing concept worked well to promote pro-health policies worldwide. However, it does bring complications: a large part of the biomedical research community define ageing as a set of pathological processes and even consider it as a disease or a syndrome so Healthy Ageing is then an oxymoron (an expression that contains something and its contrary).

In some languages, the term ""Healthy Aging"" is translated as ""Healthy Frailing"". Since there is no way to be healthy if you are frail, it logically follows that we should reconsider how we refer to aging.",5,1

http://thegreenopportunity.org

If it turns out that KIC 8462852 is home to a distant civilization then I venture to say that we're about to experience the largest and most impactful paradigm shift humans have ever seen.  Of course it also could turn out to be comet dust, no biggie. 

I have a sense though that even if this isn't the first encounter for us Earth-ians, we are getting closer.  The potential for evolution and technology to connect us to the vast-beyond is endless.  At the moment at which we do confirm a distant neighbor, change won't occur overnight but the impact to our human psyche will be deep-seated and will become more apparent over time.

We have been waiting for this moment for a VERY long time.  Our distant ancestors stared at the sky in the same way that we today stare at our screens. We can now clearly see the potential of technology.  We just need to figure out how to harness it to work for us in a bigger way.  The potential for worldwide change is endless and infinite at the rate of pace we're going today. 

And the cool thing is, it seems like we are starting to agree on what it ""could"" look like. We're seeing the potential for technology not just to impact our day to day but also how it could empower entire swathes of the planet to rise up out of poverty and toward freedom.  

Knowledge is power and with the technological innovations over just the last 20 years, we can only imagine what the next 30 years could hold. 

Learning is the next generation's mantra and given all the tools at their fingertips it certainly feels like we are currently raising a new breed of human, the next evolution of human.  When we finally do make contact we will be blown away by the capacity and potential of life and this will inspire us even more.  Our eyes will have been opened just a tiny bit more but in a very big way.

We will start to see what we will need to be a species who survives on this planet.  This event will connect our human spirit in a way that has never been felt.  Of course there have been ""world-wide"" events occurring prior but they have all occurred at our doing, never from something outside of us. 

We are the only creators we are aware of at this point and the fact is that this ""fact"" might be changing relatively soon.

As a society we will be inspired by this realization and take a more concerted effort to make the world a cleaner place. We will study and innovate and experiment and triumph and fail, all the while figuring out how to implement the biggest shift this world has ever seen; the move away from fossil fuels.  

Then, when we're 60 we'll sit back and relax while our kids have kids that grow up in the first clean energy generation.  Cheap electricity, powered by the earth in perfect harmony (well maybe not always ""perfect"") will be our pathway to a truly beautiful world. One in which anything becomes possible.

The future in which energy is completely clean and cheap, is a beautiful one.  ",11,6

I've found that many uses for them can be done by a dog right now (follow me, go get my slippers, protect my house, protect my belongings while I sleep in this bench, go get help). Beyond that, imagine a really powerful computer that follows you around, can defend itself and call you if stolen. Instead of having a smartphone you could basically have a screen in your pocket and the droid would do all the computations. Also, instead of building cars with expensive on board computers they could be made cheaper with just sensors and a port the droid can access, and once connected the car would get gps, autopilot, night vision, dashcam...

Instead of the bulky design of an R2D2 I envision monkey-like droids that can run around and also climb on your back if needed, or a drone that can land on your shoulder like a parrot. Or walking fridges if you liked Interstellar a lot.

Blind people could use them as augmented versions of guide dogs (take me to this place, read the signs around me, stop a cab).

Can you contribute with more uses for them?

I cannot claim this idea as my own. It was presented to me recently by a friend who read it in a science fiction novel. The name of the novel escapes me, but maybe one of you will know.

The basic procedure is:

* The original human (A) is set into a chair next to the replacement body (B), likely (and hopefully) an artificial one.

* Both bodies are connected to the medium that will handle the actual transfer of the data, probably a powerful computer

* Over the course of minutes to hours, A is fed increasingly pure sensory data from the sensors on B

* This process continues until A has a complete raw sensory data stream from B. At this point in time, A's brain, X, will be processing data from both A's body and B's body

* In the reverse process of step three, A's sensory data is incrementally dampened, eventually resulting in the loss of data streams from A's sensory organs. X will now now be relying solely on the input data from B's sensory organs.

* X's connectome (the map of the links between all the neurons) can begin to be copied into the new brain, Y. Y resides in B's skull. The copy will take place like a traditional transfer between storage mediums, with small bits of data being copied to Y and deleted from X. During this time, the subject will temporarily lose the ability to recall certain memories, speak, think abstractly, or other functions of the brain. This is temporary, and because only small amounts of data are inaccessible at one time, at no point will the subject become unconscious.

* End procedure. Psychological and physical tests should be run.

In such a way, we have avoided disrupting the stream of consciousness while also avoiding deleting an entire consciousness instantly, as would be done in the ""traditional"" method. 

The procedure could also be modified to allow for transferring to a purely digital medium, such as a VR. Such a method could also allow for even more exciting possibilities, such as transferring the entire mind to a chip the size of a camera or smaller; one could then potentially insert artificial cushioning into the deficit where the larger biological brain would have been, decreasing the likelihood of a fatal accident. Or, perhaps more tantalizing, to transfer the mind to a small chip buried in a safe server room which could then remote pilot a terrestrial body, eliminating almost all risk from living.

Additionally, step six could become even more complete were we able to develop a framework for the subject's consciousness to be able to access the data as it was copying-- to be able to read from both X and Y to form a complete memory or function.

Can you find flaws? I would love to hear them. This is the only method I have found that could offer a real transfer, not a brutish cut/paste, which would effectively kill the original subject.

(AbbVie) and Calico announced a research and development collaboration intended to help both companies discover, develop, and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. **As of September 30, 2015, AbbVie has contributed $750 million** to fund the collaboration pursuant to the agreement, which reflects its total commitment. **As of September 30, 2015, Calico has contributed $250 million** and **committed up to an additional $500 million.**

&gt;Calico will use its scientific expertise to establish a world-class research and development facility, with a focus on drug discovery and early drug development; and AbbVie will provide scientific and clinical development support and its commercial expertise to bring new discoveries to market. Both companies will share costs and profits equally. AbbVie's contribution has been recorded as a liability on Calico's financial statements, which is reduced and reflected as a reduction to research and development expense as eligible research and development costs are incurred by Calico over the next few years.

So, 1 billion US dollars have already been funneled into this specific anti-aging partnership that Calico has created, and $500 million more will probably be added. And this is only *one* of their partnerships, which they [have much more of](http://www.calicolabs.com/) (go to the news section of their website and you can find a bunch of them).

Honestly, I think it's safe to say that Aubrey de Grey's work is done. Calico is going to kick aging in the ass with the virtually indefinite resources that they have access to through Alphabet. And I can't fucking wait.",24,35

Right now, those who are able to drive civ to the next level mostly live sheltered lives, away from the 'crowds' who are unable to drive civ to the next level and are not likely to benefit too much from it due to their limited income and ability.

However, it is getting more and more apparent that while they are not aware of the amazing advances and enormous headway being made, they are getting more and more aware that they do not exactly belong in the new world which will take place when the civ breaks away from the paradigms set in, say, the renaissance or the enlightenment.

The breakaway (let it be either Type I Civ, Singularity, AI , or something else) would be similar to , say , the first hominid learning to walk. When that happened all the existing hominids suddenly became irrelevant.

Mankind has to reach for the stars. Singularity won't cut it since even if it is achieved mankind is still stuck in a rather insignificant rock in the backwater of space.

Singularity, nanotech, etc are great but they are like life-prolonging processes to keep someone alive till a cure is found. A good analogy would be rushing a couple yards here and another couple yards there, to just put the frigging football into the field goal range.

I do see that around 2040, mankind will reach a critical stage. Some people call it the 'population bottleneck'. 

There will be too many people who will not contribute to the civilization, and the productive part population won't be able to carry them any longer.

In addition, shortages of resources will create a crisis which will get worse since years of malinvestment and frictions were not dealt properly but were only dealt with stopgap measures which did not warrant any long-term changes.

During the old times, even around 1900, the gap between those who were intellectually capable and those who were not, those who stood to gain from the advances and those who were not were not insurmountable. Hard , but not impossible.

The changes being made is such that it will be, for all practical purposes, insurmountable for 90% of the world pop to even understand what is going on.

When they know they are disenfranchised and are on the way out, they will revolt. And , like the Hungarian engineer Urban who sold the cannons to the Turks to destroy Constantinople, there will be some people who will side with them for their own profit.

The introduction of such draconian measures might be possible, just to prevent such acts from happening.

Some say mankind needs at least 2 earths. it is true that while mankind has not utilized all of the earth's energy (i.e. Type I Civ), its needs fill 1.5 earths. 

That's why the vast majority of humanity have to live like, say, the Filipino in order to concentrate all energy into reaching the next level of civ.

If by 2040 mankind has not reached a breakaway point, the masses might catch up with the drivers of civ and could overturn virtually all progresses which are vulnerable in a system collapse.",44,0
