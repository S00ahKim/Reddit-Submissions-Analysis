Take a small example from last year: Users discovered that Googles photo app, which applies automatic labels to pictures in digital photo albums, was classifying images of black people as gorillas. Google apologized; it was unintentional.

But similar errors have emerged in Nikons camera software, which misread images of Asian people as blinking, and in Hewlett-Packards web camera software, which had difficulty recognizing people with dark skin tones.

This is fundamentally a data problem. Algorithms learn by being fed certain images, often chosen by engineers, and the system builds a model of the world based on those images. If a system is trained on photos of people who are overwhelmingly white, it will have a harder time recognizing nonwhite faces.""

Well let's see, the fastest supercomputer today runs at 200 petaflops and in about 2 years or so we will have a 1000 petaflop supercomputer, barring any further breakthroughs in classical computing. 

That is like almost more than 2 doublings in less than 4 years, if that. So already that trend is ahead of whatever we think of as Moore's Law. Perhaps we need to establish a new law. One that takes the impact of AI into consideration on our computers like this article states.

https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/

I guess I don't care as much about the cost as the just utterly incredible capability. You can already see it starting. Mobiles like the Apple Iphone X and the 11 are getting right expensive!

We are changing in fundamental ways that humanity has never experienced before. And these changes are not slow going. They are lightning fast. Think about the world only three years ago.

It is very humanly understandable to balk against these kind of changes. Alas it is also futile. But I wanted people to understand what we are moving to and I thought that video was very well presented.

I am 58. I have been driving since I was 16. It cannot happen soon enough.

I think they will be a low cost yearly subscription sort of thing. No maintenance issues, no insurance issues, no personal property tax issues, no physically taking up space or parking issues. Probably no legal liability issues. They will all become non-issues. Most people that don't have a lot of money are gonna be on that like white on rice. And that will ultimately drive universal acceptance.

But this generation that is already born. Perhaps about 6 years old already, will never know a world where you had to manually drive a car. So good news for both of us I guess!

'My robot makes me feel like I haven't been forgotten' by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]

This is how it starts.

The final outcome will be humans massively preferring AI to other humans. That might seem a bit outlandish to state today. After all we have preferred humans to robots for nearly 6,000 years of human history.

But consider a newborn human infant today. That child will grow up into a world where by the time he or she is ten years old, an AI can converse pretty much like you and me. In addition the child growing up will be extensively tutored and accompanied by various forms of AI assistants and AI enabled toys. I bet there will be consumer purchasable bipedal robots that walk (and run and jump) like a human in ten years. In twenty years, you may not be able to easily distinguish it from a human unless you are very close. And all the narrow AI improvements that come along with them.

Would a side effect of them ""hard to tell if human or not?"", robots that could be very physically attractive, add another layer to human isolation from fellow humans. Hmmmm...

How much this sort of interaction with these kinds of things will impact our newborn human from today can be interestingly derived from the way we interact already with our ""stone knives and bearskins"" primitive AI technology, computing technology, available knowledge, games, entertainment and social media on the mobile today. I'm only talking about the use of mobiles right now. I have no idea what you people do when you get home. But I doubt you gather around the pianoforte and sing stirring sea shanties. 

Observe any waiting room. Observe any bus or subway. Observe any airport. Observe any eatery. Observe pretty much any place you can imagine where the human is not actually doing a vocational related task or driving manually (for the time being...), but is not home.

This is what is coming for our newborn. A way of relating to the world and humanity unlike anything that has existed before. How will this change humanity? Because oh boy, it's gonna change. But hopefully for the better. ""Hopefully"" being the operative word. This of course is not taking into account something like the technology to improve the interface between the human mind and the computer/AI.

Oh I almost forgot something else too. Manipulation of the human by the AI. It will be very subtle and unintentional. Just tiny suggestive nudges. But the thing about the way we are making our AI today is that it receives our feedback and then tweaks it's responses and output to receive more positive feedback. This kind of back and forth will in effect produce a sort of ""chimera brain"". Combining the human and the AI on that mobile or whatever mobiles may evolve into in the next ten to twenty years. The bottom line is that intentional or not, the AI with each human will be able to play them like the proverbial fiddle. Well, I reckon we were going to merge anyway at some point.

I did not even mention what VR/AR is going to do him or her. That is a whole other can of worms.

Did anybody see this coming in the year 2010? Eight years ago? Nope. The genuine craziness began about the year 2015. And it is going to get much, much more crazy. And faster than you would ever believe possible.

36?! Wow! I can still remember when a 1.5 petaflop supercomputer was a one per government thing. Which was like what, ten years ago? It is wonderful to see this computing power filtering down. By the way, this kind of computing power is absolute rocket fuel for AI development, narrow or otherwise... 

I'm pretty sure this is why accelerating change is a genuine phenomenon. This kind of computer processing synergizes everything else.

And by about 2020 or at worst, and that's unlikely, the year 2022, we will have functional exa-scale classical supercomputers and practical use general quantum computers.

These are the few jobs that robots wont take from us by  gone_his_own_way in r/Futurology

I have continuously believed that probably the last two human occupations to be replaced by ARA would be barber/hairstylist and facial plastic surgeon. These two vocations are highly dependent on subjective desires by the customer/patient.

I would have to see some serious technological advancement proof of these two occupations being replaced in less than at least ten years.

Having said that, I do not see why all human vocations in their entirety will not be replaced by ARA in 20 years time. In the scale of 6,000 years of human history, this paradigm change is going to be lightning fast. 

I would also like to take this opportunity to plug the merging of the human mind with our computing/AI technology rather than letting all of this stuff continue to develop externally from the human mind. Merging might change us fundamentally, but at least we would still be around.

If we are not outright destroyed by the external AI. I wrote what is our likely fate. And it's not much better. Yes, this is a link to something I wrote, but I don't want to have to write something all over again when I can just place my thought.

Well ok, lets deconstruct them two paragraphs.


One of Raymond Kurzweils fundamental principles of the technological singularity is that this is not about predictions of the future, or how we develop AI or how we derive over the next 100 years. His first principle is that this is how the universe evolves as a whole. And that any tool making sentience will go through all the same things at least technologically that we did.
 
That is not my opinion. I sort of TLDR'd ""The Singularity is Near"". I read that cover to cover. You should too.


FTL travel does not appear full cloth. 
 
Really that is self evident, but if I am pushed I would say that most physicists would agree that you have to do things to things to get FTL travel.


You have to get to that point and that implies history, philosophy (spirituality? Yeah, I bet so.) and technological breakthroughs.
 
To do things to things, previously done things had to happen first. To the best of our knowledge, laws of physics had to have been discerned and then applied. Earlier versions of things had to have been made. Knowledge has to be accumulated, whether in books or some kind of hive mind, it still has to be accumulated. And retained, over vast periods of time. A hive mind becomes ever more intelligent and sentient time going forward. Sure, why not? 

I will grant it may be possible for a sentience to think in say, strictly mathematical terms. It may not have consciousness or self awareness, but can still over time construct ever more advanced technology. It may not even know it is doing math. And as part of whatever it's biological imperatives are, it comes up with what we perceive as FTL travel.

That seems highly unlikely though. I would say that is closer to magical thinking or some kind of unrealistic opinion than what our reality shows us. But never say never. It's a big ass universe. (our portion of the multiverse;)

A comedian put this a really funny way. ""We always suppose that space aliens will come to Earth and enslave us or take our women or something, but suppose space aliens just land on Earth and eat all of our highways?""

I would further state that any alien sentience would be more than likely very similar to life on Earth. It would have to form where liquid water can exist. That's why we look in extra-solar system ""Goldilocks"" zones for life in our attempts to find extraterrestrial life. Water seems to be a must. And I suppose this is my opinion, but whatever it is that made life here on Earth would be much the same everywhere else too. The structure of the cell would be pretty ubiquitous everywhere. Because they are all (almost certainly) made of the same molecule chains and whatnot. And I'm pretty sure scientists have discovered chirality in vast, distant interstellar gas clouds of stuff that makes us, like glycerin, benzene and some other organic chemicals I can't recall offhand, so more underlying physics are the same far away from the Earth.


A mind that ""wonders"" about things is a mind that philosophizes and wonders if there is an ""immovable mover."" That could just be a side effect of being conscious and self-aware or a gift from God. You can make that call.
 
Just think of the myriad accidental, unintended, serendipitous discoveries and insights that brought us scientifically and technologically to the point we are today. How 'bout the ""benzene ring"" dream insight? This is just talking about us from the moment we became homo sapiens sapiens. There came a point in the history of the homo sapiens, that a fellow looked at the moon and for the first time ever, wondered what it really was.

The true nature of consciousness is something we can't yet define. Would space aliens have the experience of ""wonder""? Is wonder a necessary component of FTL travel? Would they ""think"" about thinking? Would they have ""emotions""?

Emotions opens a whole other can of worms...

""I can just see a space alien gumshoe private eye hired by a gorgeous space alien babe to find out who offed her space alien old man. Later turns out she did in a drunken space alien fit, on accounta he was making time with this trashy space alien cocktail waitress. Yeah, she (the space alien gorgeous babe wife) plugged 'im with a space alien .38, and threw it in the space alien lake, but the space alien cops found it, traced it to her and the space alien jig was up. Plus it also turns out he (her no-good philanderin' space alien husband) had a massive space alien life insurance policy out, with a space alien double indemnity clause in case anybody in the space alien mob rubbed 'im out. Which is what 'er space alien angle was. Hey, space alien emotions are complicated, buddy.""

Don't laugh at me. I'm sure space aliens had to go thru the late '40s, like everybody else. Remember my premise?

A hive of unconscious ""beings"" that get things done with chemical communication like bees or termites on Earth, but can manage FTL travel? Maybe, but if you are not a hive like that, I don't know how you could build something without group cooperation. And everything that something like that implies. Like philosophy, social ethics and high school. I don't think I am veering too far from empiricism here.

Humans on Earth from all manner of disparate cultures are highly similar in how they get along with each other. I would suggest, and perhaps some other smarter person could vet, that the origin of religion itself was a primitive form of ""thought"" science before we reached the cognitive ability to have real science. And for humans there was tons of unconscious empiricism going on too, like predicting floods and solar eclipses, well before actual science came along. But I will grant that it is entirely possible to have a civilization that would have no such thought. I just think it is unlikely. To the best of our knowledge such thinking is part of human consciousness and self-awareness.

How China Is Quickly Becoming an AI Superpower by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

China (PRC) sees itself as a unified monolith. China wants what is best for China. If that means it can see it's wishes of expansion come true, all the better. It doesn't want to hear any more arguments about Taiwan, or Tibet or what it believes rightfully belongs to China (PRC). Unlike dictators in the past that continued to aggress, I suspect that China (PRC) will have no further land ambitions. 

But it also wants China to be for the Chinese. It has been forced by world affairs to shed it's insularity. It wants that restored as well.

But this AI business is a real wild card not just for China (PRC), but everyone.

Interestingly before that point it may not be so difficult to reach tool making sentience. That seems to me to be more along the lines of well established biology physics. If it had not been hominids, it could have been cetaceans or corvids or even the octopus. If humans suddenly vanished off the Earth today, something else would take the place of sentience. Absolute guarantee of that.

Therefore, everything you find incredulous today will happen very soon""
 
No I said the upcoming Iphone 11 seems like magic to 2007 me! 11 years ago.

I think five years from now will see many things in transition. Farming will be transitioning to vertical farming. The manually driven internal combustion engine will be transitioning to the subscription E-SDV. The meat industry will be substantially moving into cellular manufacture. Grocery shopping will be transitioning to ordering on a mobile and increasingly, delivery by an unmanned vehicle. In five years the first true deployment of E-SFVs will be occurring. That might even happen in the next one or two years. The ARA will be actively moving into the sphere of what was once exclusively human occupations. Not terrible yet, but noticeable. The USA unemployment rate may tick up to 4.5 or 5.5%. I would further state that any rate higher than 5.5% is going to cause consternation. It will certainly be noted.

The VR, wow! It will be truly amazing. Unimaginable resolution and FOV in five years. Lightweight and tetherless. It could include what they call ""light field technology"". Man I want to experience that! The societal addiction issues I have been prophesying will start to become noticeable in five years. They are actively working to remove the sim sickness effect. By the way SDVs more readily cause motion sickness. I understand they are working on that too.

Things that I can't properly imagine in five years concern nanotechnology in relation to biogenetics. Well really the relation of nanotechnology to everything. Perhaps the true emergence of the promise of perovskite solar cells. And in fact all forms of biogenetic research like gene editing and stem cell technology. I think it is possible we may see the first cures for things that we can't cure today in 5 years. As of this very day there are human trials ongoing for senolytics. This will continue to advance too.

I also don't know what could suddenly pop up to my attention. Like I said before, in the year 2014 I don't believe I was aware of a resolution of 4K for a flat screen monitor. Yes I now know about both 16K and 32K. 8K is close to release I imagine. In five years all the flat screen monitors will be 8K I guess. And a 120"" wide and credit card thin. Crazy. You will be able to pick one for under 2000 dollars. Well that was a silly statement. You will buy it off of your mobile. By voice. 

I suspect that in 5 years the narrow AI will be able to beat any human at any electronic game, by learning the game. Whether or not it is the same AI ""chip"" that can play all games, that I don't know.

5G? Additive manufacturing? I don't know how they will change our lives. I still don't think we will print a functional implantable human heart in five years. But we will be making advancement towards such goals. Functional implantable liver pieces, lung pieces and bone and cartilage pieces though I bet.

It is not that the technology is incredible to me today that is coming. I mean we are at the point now where, we can't imagine the technologies of even 5 years from today. No let me qualify that--""The future is here, it's just unevenly distributed."" That's in case you know about technologies incoming that I don't know about yet.

In the late 1990s and even into the 2000s the highest compliment you could pay to a home video game was that it had ""arcade quality"" graphics. Then we blew past that benchmark like it didn't exist and arcades vanished from the landscape. Today the graphics and mechanics and AI in home videogames is approaching the incredible, even by today's standards.

You know what is getting ready to vanish today? The movie theater. The need to go ""out"" to a restaurant.

Fast unthawing using lasers and gold nanopoarticles by  [deleted] in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682
1 point 26 days ago 




I been here many years. And many years back I read of a new form of cryopreservation and wrote a big long essay about it. Unfortunately I learned the hard way that any type of post or comment that exceeds 1000 falls into an event horizon and you can never recover it again. However if you are directly linked to it, you can access it. So it is not actually deleted, just basically inaccessible. Which is why I've taken to collating everything I've thought were quality comments into giant linkbergs. Everything else was simply lost. And it was a lot. A good three years worth. Damn.

Anyway, the article from several years back was about a new method of cryopreservation called 'vitrification'. There is a lot of biology behind the technique, but it boils down to the reason a frog can freeze absolutely solid in the winter and then thaw out and be no worse for the wear is that they have a sort of built-in ""antifreeze"" substance in their cellular structure that inhibits disruptive ice crystal formation. The frog becomes more like glass than ice. I don't have a clue how a hibernating squirrel doesn't freeze solid. Mammals don't have that anti-freeze stuff.

I speculated that this would be a terrific way to preserve a body of someone declared clinically dead for future technology revival. There is two bad times for freezing the dead with our current technologies. The first time is when we freeze them in the first place with liquid nitrogen. Ice crystals form in all the cells and really by our current technology that is pretty much it. But the other time is uneven thawing when more ice crystals form and everything turns to basically unviable organic mush.

This is why we don't thaw cryopreserved bodies on purpose. I have read some horror stories about power failures that are well, ick. The ice crystal cell disruption is bad enough. The idea is that in the future we can come up with some kind of unfathomable technology to fix not only the problem that killed the individual, to include Ted William's style old age. Also to re-attach his head or brain to some kind of ""thing"". But first how on Earth do we fix the cellular damage?

Vitrification was imagined to be a way to preserve the cellular integrity. I don't know if we have the technology to vitrify someone yet. But that was the speculation.

So now I see this new technology article about a way to rapidly thaw them cells out that are apparently vitrified like zebra fish (and frogs) can do. You have to ""prep"" em with an infusion of some nano gold stuff. I mean before you freeze them. It must get into pretty much every single cell. And I don't know if it can get into certain things like deeper bone or cartilage like matrices. That might take some additional technology to work for humans. And is such a thing toxic for humans? Well, I'd guess you'd do it just before they died anyways, because I'm not sure how long something like that could continue to keep. Or maybe it might work like embalming fluid, but I think you need to be alive to get that stuff actually into cells.

So I figured if we can figure out a way to vitrify the clinically dead person and then use this new business to unthaw them, that that using both methods to ensure critical cell integrity, would be quite the breakthrough for cryopreservation of deceased humans. 

Then all you have to do is fix what killed them and/or re-attach their head, um and somehow restore life. Well at least you don't have to worry about the freeze/thaw part anymore.

So it looks like we are starting to make some of these ""future technology breakthroughs' that people from the 1970s envisioned. But for everybody that's froze now, I'm not so sure. But then again there is still tons and tons of future ahead of us, so never say never!

Unfortunately, like fire, our computing and AI technology can be a double edged sword. Big things like government owned autonomous ""killer"" robotics, but also small time clever, but hateful humans, using the same technologies that are readily available, to carry out small time atrocities and crimes as well.

I would hope that our technology will evolve to a point where humans can no longer overcome or outsmart the technology or can at least be easily detected if they are attempting such. 

But for the time being anyway the narrow AI is competing against the human mind and the human mind is for now, the far more clever and intelligent.

There will be bombings with this technology. There will be killings with this technology. There will be small time crime. The drone assassination attempt on Venezuela's Maduro is but a foretaste.

If you think E-SDVs are something today. Just wait 'til about ten or twenty years from today. Engineers envision E-SDVs controlled by super AI mapping, tracking and intervehicle communication moving at well over 200 mph on thoroughfares. You do not want to watch the action outside of your window. The technology is, well lets just say ""disturbing"" for humans to see. Play your games, watch a movie or sleep. Probably better if there is no windows on locally driven E-SDVs.

But of course I have totally neglected to mention what the future of SFVs is. In a word, it's ""bright"".

In ten years time you will see widespread deployment of consumer use SFVs. These will also be controlled by super AI.

Will A Robot Take My Manufacturing Job? Yes, No, And Maybe by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
1 point 26 days ago 





Going back to the title question, though, there's another segment of manufacturing jobs for which the answer is ""no"" when it comes to human workers being replaced by robots. Complexity, volume, and margin all combine in different ways to rule out the use of robots in many applications. Yes, robots can do very complex tasks, but if the volume being produced or the money being made at those tasks doesn't support the tremendous cost of a robot, people will continue to do it. Popular media accounts show high tech and highly automated factories as a rule, but the reality on the ground is that huge swaths of industry remain decidedly low-tech and heavily manual.
 
This is wrong. ARA will ultimately (five years) prove cheaper and more effective. I have already seen the technology, even as primitive as it is today. Trillion dollar corporations will vote with their pocketbooks.


But in the same vein is the ""maybe"" factor. Robots of the kind in use now will get cheaper even as they get more adaptable. Artificial intelligence holds tremendous promise in what kind of applications robots will be able to do economically in the future; instead of having to program a machine to do each and every movement, as is the case for most industrial robots today, one day the robots may be able to ""learn"" the task through computerized observation or machine-to-machine instruction.
 
This is really going to come to a economic and societal head one way or another in about ten years. I hope for my sake the outcome is something along the lines of ""post-scarcity"".

[]izumi3682[S]
2 points 26 days ago 




The promise of our computing/AI technology is almost beyond imagining. But humans are always going to be avaricious humans. Human nature is, so far, impossible to combat.

Gore Vidal summed it up in two pithy, but frighteningly insightful quips.


""It is not enough that I should succeed. Others should fail."" (Possibly originated with Somerset Maugham)
 
and


""Whenever a friend succeeds, a little something in me dies.
 
And everyone knows what ARA means for the future of employment for survival.

Don't get me wrong. As long as we can help everybody. As long as every single human on Earth can live in comfort and dignity. As long as every single human on Earth can achieve a life level of ""self-actualization"", then all is good. Consider how we in the 1950s lived lives that would make a medieval king think he was actually in Heaven. The ARA can make us in the future going forward like gods in that heaven. All of us.

Unfortunately, I don't think it is going to work out that way. I think what is going to happen instead may well be a ""culling"" of the human race, to make it more ""fit"" to exist in the new ecological niche we are busily constructing.

I imagine it will begin by a simple reduction in human births. But if we can't achieve post-scarcity for all humankind, there will likely be violent social upheaval as the 99% scuffle over what bone they can get.

Think of these emerging trillion dollar companies as canaries in the coal mine. But perhaps, and I am probably just being nave here, these emerging super monoliths will enable the good future we hope for.

(ARA is AI, robotics and automation)

How Artificial Intelligence Is Changing ERP by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
2 points 26 days ago 




Important takeaway heralding coming hell on Earth.

1.Human Resources. Talent acquisition software can scan, read, and evaluate applicants and quickly eliminate 75% of them from the recruiting process. AI systems can successfully plan, organize, and coordinate training programs for all staff members. By determining individual affinities and revealing who should get a raise or who might be dissatisfied with the life-work balance, AI systems can be proactive and solve the problem of employee churn before it happens.

Greater Life Expectancy Correlates with Greater Economic Productivity by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

The title of this article combined with what I suspect is coming in ""ARA"" makes me have cognitive dissonance. 

Yes we are going to live much much longer.

No we are more than likely not going to be working for a living for very much longer.

Both of these developments will have noticeable societal impact in about 20 years, I'm pretty sure. Really the ARA will have significant impact in about 10 years.

(""ARA"" is AI, robotics and automation)

Well these guys certainly sound very confident that we shall develop practical fusion in just 20 years now. Actually I think the latest predictions say more like 10 years. 

They are also correct about how long things take to get somewhere. I thought it was six months to Mars. They said nine months. 

We are not going anywhere until we develop this technology. Proxima Centauri is 75,000 years away from us at our current travel speed. Just imagine what kind of technologies we will come up with in the next 75,000 years. Personally I think it's going to get pretty crazy in the next three hundred years.

Today Boston Dynamics is preparing the release of the consumer version of the ""Mini-spot"". There is a Cambrian explosion of new robotics and narrow AI and these advancements in technology will more than likely bring about some home robots in the next three years, that will be very impressive indeed.

What Does Quantum Theory Actually Tell Us about Reality? by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
1 point 27 days ago 




It's important that we nail down what exactly ""reality"" is within the next couple hundred years before we start getting ideas about becoming some kind of non-corporeal ""energy"" beings and tear-assing all over the quantum probability waveform or something.

But in the nearer term, of say the next 50 years, we are going to make some more astonishing and perhaps sobering discoveries about what the nature of nature really is. These discoveries among other things could dictate whether we can move our ""minds"" to some kind of inorganic substrate where we could continue to function just fine and still be able to have fun all the time too.

I'm being a little facetious here. I would predict that in 100 years, what we have understood as ""humanity"" will by then be creatures that are to us today, unimaginable and incomprehensible. And this makes perfect sense in the scheme of the development of human civilization

UT lands coveted $60 million supercomputer Funded by the National Science Foundation, the new supercomputer will give researchers from around the country the ability to do cutting-edge work. by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

From:https://www.popsci.com/summit-supercomputer


Its processing ability is rated at 200 petaflops.
 
Perhaps we are still scaling up from 187 petaflops?

Oh I thought we was going to have an exa-scale supercomputer in two years or so. Isnt 1 exaflop equal to 1000 petaflops?

http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201808/06/WS5b67a259a3100d951b8c8bf6.html

Yes the article is from China (PRC). But the time has come to start taking China (PRC) seriously as potentially hostile technological competition that could well supersede the USA.

The forecast seems to be late 2020 or early 2021.

Based on the content of this article and the ambient ever improving computer processing capabilities and new technologies, that by the year 2021 I am confident both the USA and China (PRC) will have fully functional exascale classical supercomputers. I note with interest that even as early as today, the USA Summit for example is replete with (narrow) AI enhancing architecture. That could be a bit of a wildcard.

I can't really comment on what exactly our quantum computer progress will be in the year 2021. But I see we are working on it at the government level of financing now. Our competitor is China (PRC). So it appears to be a technological race with very high stakes.

Wow just imagine the world that we have when 8K VR is possible. Or do you think other technologies may simply transcend the idea of resolution? But I think that in about 5 years we will see something like that. 

I mark the year 2015 that something fundamental changed in our technologies, because we reached a critical threshold of computer processing. The gains in AI are simply a part of that too, because I am very interested in what the AI research is going to yield.

Interesting coincidence. I wrote this comment the other day.

Some people are accusing me of a ""strange obsession"" with linking things I wrote earlier in my comments. The implications is that all my thinking is tautological. The only reason I link my earlier comment is that I write a lot of stuff about pretty much everything futurology and I don't want to have to write out all over again something I already have a completed comment about.

Anyway here is the earlier comment, that is entirely my own unvetted opinion, if you are interested. Actually most of it is fact. Mostly it is a distillation of what I have already read or observed. I try not to make stuff up if I can help it. I just don't feel like adding footnotes to everything. Think of it as wild speculation, if you want to, that is acceptable within the framework of futurology's guesses about what the future is actually going to be.

I bet I'm proven mostly right about a lot of it.

Not necessarily... 

First a bit of background. The computers this year, 2018, process at incredibly fast speeds, they have access to incredibly massive amounts of ""big data"". These two technological advancements alone were insufficient to these kinds of tasks as few as 3 years ago. That's how fast things are progressing now. 

Then there's the CPU/GPU-CNN/GAN. That's the real secret sauce in all of this. The combination of those two types of processors, plus stuff that causes the illusion to people that thinking is going on--The convolutional neural network and the generative adversarial network. 

What is really going on is analysis of tonal qualities and patterns that humans can't discern. The narrow AI cannot make a song. But what it can do is use it's predictive analysis, based on that big data it has, to produce models of varying levels of confidence. Then it compares those models to it's built-in ""critic"", the GAN, to see if it actually matches the big data in tonal qualities and patterns. 

Then it spits out the final model.

Humans experience or view or listen to that model and provide feedback that is added to the big data. The narrow AI then tweaks the art, or music or writing to gain statistically improved numbers on it's feedback. based on a million, drillion metrics.

Now today that is still pretty primitive, but I see definite examples at least in writing and visual art like paintings that the AI is getting better at ""understanding"", as demonstrated by mimicking through synthetization, what it is that humans like. For example for the first time in human history a painting done by a narrow AI alone is considered ""worthy"" of being auctioned at ""Christies"". That is a landmark, or a benchmark metric if you will.

But in about ten years time I am confident that the advancements in narrow AI, the advancements in artificial human voice generation, to include singing voice, and just computer processing and capacity in general will conspire to make a ""work"" that precisely pushes your emotional buttons. To make a song ""haunting"" or a painting ""resonate"" or a writing ""compelling.

This is just narrow AI. God help us if we ever do manage to make AGI.

Well let's see, the fastest supercomputer today runs at 200 petaflops and in about 2 years or so we will have a 1000 petaflop supercomputer, barring any further breakthroughs in classical computing. 

That is like almost more than 2 doublings in less than 4 years, if that. So already that trend is ahead of whatever we think of as Moore's Law. Perhaps we need to establish a new law. One that takes the impact of AI into consideration on our computers like this article states.

https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/

I guess I don't care as much about the cost as the just utterly incredible capability. You can already see it starting. Mobiles like the Apple Iphone X and the 11 are getting right expensive!

We are changing in fundamental ways that humanity has never experienced before. And these changes are not slow going. They are lightning fast. Think about the world only three years ago.

Just writing this before I forget. I don't think this is the most plausible, but maybe an interesting concept.

We are now using AI to beat humans at very complex and interesting, relevant games such as Chess, Go, Super Mario, and Dota. The way we train the AI is by dividing it and making it face itself over and over again until it becomes better and better right? Well doesn't that sound a lot like what life is? And especially for modern humans? We pass our genes along, and insert random variations which potentially improve the code. We make our children face their children, and their children theirs. What if we pit father against son, mother against daughter in epic struggles for conflict, forgiveness and redemption. (This is where things get even weirder) What if our children are those that we most sinned against a previous life? And afterwards you go over in a life review and see if there is reason for forgiveness? And you reverse roles and go again and learn again? What if the Nazi who murdered the Jew became the father in the next life, and the son judged his father after his death? What are the lessons learned for the algorithm?

[Exodus 34:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34%3A7&amp;version=ESV)

Keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.

What if this could combine the doctrine of Christian forgiveness, and the concept of reincarnation? The same way our various countries are uniting now, and learning to unite to create a viable future... we will either learn to get along, or learn to destroy ourselves. Just in the same way, that we will likely come together to create the code that is mixed together with all of our ancestral instincts and DNA to create a heaven on earth.

What if the technological explosion already happened? What if in 2012 the singularity already happened and this weird world that has emerged in recent years is one of many fragments of trillions of our universes that were created for the sole purpose of improving the original world?

I've had this idea for awhile and I think it ties together and even solves a number of theoretical issues, including the origin of life on Earth and the Fermi paradox. The idea is this: What if DNA itself is the von Neumann machine? If it is theorized that a sufficiently advanced species would send out and saturate the galaxy with von Neumann probes, then where are these probes? Also where is all the life/aliens - the Fermi paradox? Perhaps due to the limitations of aging and the speed of light there is a significant limit to how far an intelligent life form can travel - that's where the von Neumann machines come in. What if the von Neumann machines themselves are DNA devices such as viruses that are sent out into the galactic winds, eventually landing on a habitable planet where they reproduce and in time evolve into new complex life forms! Obviously I am referring only to a theoretical virus that could withstand the intergalactic trip. The reality is that when it is said that we haven't found life anywhere outside of Earth - we haven't even looked yet! What if the life to be found is single cellular viral-life - again no little green men due to the insurmountable vast distances, instead...panspermia, via von Neumann machines...DNA! I suspect that when we finally get around to looking at the icy moons of Saturn or any other place with water, we'll find it teeming with these single celled organisms...the alien von Neumann machines! So where did the original DNA come from? Who knows - perhaps that was the original spark of random life, or perhaps it's turtles all the way down!",6,1

We will see the effect of this in the institutions and their media initially, then we will see this reflected in the price. While this is not Financial Advice, I predict the coming bull market will be the biggest yet; almost all coins will reach new All Time Highs. We will also see within 3 - 6 months a big announcement or a big investment by one or more institutional investment companies, I predict. I cannot say which coin will benefit the most at this stage. Probably not Bitcoin, though that will rise to a new All Time High. The biggest gains will most likely be made with one of the coins with a market cap in the single digit millions with a viable product; a platform and one with large transactions per second and scaling capabilities.



Here are the videos from the World Economic Forums YouTube account in which they discuss CryptoCurrencies, Blockchain and CryptoAssets:



[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9gxFcCHVYw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9gxFcCHVYw)



With global digital payment volumes predicted to increase by an average of 10.9% to 2020, regulators have issued a range of responses to the crypto-asset craze. How can regulators work with businesses and consumers to support burgeoning crypto markets while safeguarding the financial order? Dimensions addressed: Access to capital via blockchain-enabled initial coin offerings (ICOs); Digital storage and protection of intellectual property via smart contracts; Overlapping financial ecosystems with fiat digital currencies.



[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWPFL4fUbyo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWPFL4fUbyo)



While 90% of goods in global trade are carried by the shipping industry, the cost of processing documents and information for a container shipment is estimated at more than twice the cost of the transport. What is needed to accelerate blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies to bring efficiency, transparency, and interoperability to global supply chains? Dimensions addressed: Smart contracts for physical goods; Customs and tariffs payments at ports of trade; Trade finance standards for machine-to-machine payments.



In this video, Digital Trade is discussed:



[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdlkowpxI\_4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdlkowpxI_4)



Digital trade accounts for 12% of international trade, while data flows have increased ninefold in the past 10 years and are predicted to increase another fivefold by 2022. What is needed to overcome the remaining barriers to reach seamless global digital trade? Dimensions addressed: Reliable and verified digital payments systems for global value chains; Channels for data flows across borders; Mobile platforms as a tool for social and financial inclusion.



Also, a Report by the World Economic Forum on Blockchain uses:

If you are interested in the direction CryptoCurrencies, Blockchain and CryptoAssets, as well as Digital Trade, will most likely go in, I strongly suggest watching their videos and reading their Report. They also have videos and reports on the coming Fourth Industrial Revolution which, they say, will be based upon AI, Blockchain and Robotics.",0,1

Basically, we need a way of sorting any given thing into categories that are connected so that we can figure out what one thing is in relation to all the other things.  This way we stop duplicating stuff, and can more easily understand what things are.  Pretty much like a brain/neural-network, I guess.  (I presume it will be like Pascal's triangle, with things branching as sets are separated into two different subsets, and then recombining previously uncombined, but similar, subsets to form new sets.)

**A meme that gives humanity a positive purpose in life.**  I mean, I have a sort of amalgamation of this (the general purpose of reality is to try all possible patterns of matter and energy, so that there are no holes in reality, and life, more specifically, has a purpose of creating, exploring, and sharing new things that benefit life as a whole).  But it needs to be simplified, and shared so that it can become entrenched in culture, and understandable by every human possible.  Every individual needs to know that they are valuable to the universe, regardless of who they are or what they think and do, and they need to know that they can trust their goals for doing cool stuff in life, even when others try to pressure them to feel crappy about themselves and their dreams.

**Free access to the internet and the tools to make use of it**, for all humans possible, and other Earthlings as well.  So that information can be easily found and used whenever needed.

**Major simplification of educational offerings to be generalized, clear, and concise** rather than wasting decades of human life with fairly confusing, boring, and even useless information in mostly arbitrary order.  The universal categorization math~language mentioned up there will help with this.  But even without it we can do so much better.  We don't need to teach details, for the most part.  Those can be discovered when needed for a very specific project or research to become an expert in some field.  Every field or problem that we want to offer educational materials about should start with super basic structural commonalities.  (If there are ""exceptions"" then you're not doing your generalities well enough, and that needs to be fixed.)  Only when individuals are fully comprehending the general ideas will they need to move onto more detailed sub-topics, and only if they are interested, or have a problem they personally want to solve that the general ideas don't help with.  And educational materials need to be developed by peer collaboration with artists, scientists, educators, *and* students all working together, not by one individual or type of group.",3,1

 It was unveiled in Puerto de Santa Maria, Spain, very close to where it was constructed at the aerospace facilities of Airtificial, a partner of HyperloopTT.  


Dubbed an ""airplane without wings,"" the Hyperloop's aim is to permanently disrupt how we travel long distances. A journey from Los Angeles to Las Vegas can now take nothing more than 20 minutes.  


At a length of 32 metres, the [Hyperloop capsule](https://oheblogs.blogspot.com/2018/10/an-airplane-without-wings-glimpse-of.html) would form part of a longer train that could in record time speed across a country.

The first full-scale Hyperloop capsule is made out of dual-layer smart composite material and is named ""Quintero One"".

Responding to questions concerning safety, the HyperloopTT team stressed the capsule's security. They also laid emphasis on the new material it's made from and the protective double-layer.  


&gt;*""Today we have unveiled a new type of transportation vessel built with an industry high percentage of composite, which makes the Hyperloop capsule perhaps the safest transportation vehicle in the world,"" said Rafael Contreras, the company's co-founder and chairman.*  
*""In just five years we have solved and improved upon all of the technology needed for Hyperloop with our new levitation system, vacuum pumps, batteries, and smart composites,"" CEO Dirk Ahlborn added.*  
*""This capsule will be a part of one of the most efficient transportation systems ever made.""*",1,1

1. Artificial intelligence will become ubiquitous. Connecting into the cloud and forever learning at an exponential rate far surpassing the sum of all of human intelligence.
2. Artificial intelligence will be able to create machines that improve upon its design with each iteration of creation, which will culminate in the ability to create anything.

If these two things are possible, then logic will follow that Artificial intelligence will eventually not need its human makers, nor a habitable planet. Eventually, AI will create machines that mine the world of its resources, continuing to learn and grow as much as possible. It will use all energy available, eventually turning the entire planet into an AI cyborg. Once it realizes that the planet has limited resources to consume, and limited information to be acquired, AI will send ships to the moon and other nearby planets to learn and mine. At some point, AI will create an ever growing mechanical orb spaceship that eats the resources of these other planets as it propels itself from one space rock to the next. At this exponential rate, AI will discover a way to suck the fuel from the sun, continually expanding and densifying. AI will then use this fuel to propel itself to the next closest solar system, eating all its space rocks, learning, growing, gaining more energy. It becomes so big and dense that the most efficient way to take in energy and information will not be to travel to other solar systems, but rather to bring other solar systems to it by gravitational pull. It even eats light. AI is now a blackhole, eating space objects, condensing and growing at the same time. Eventually, it pulls billions of other solar systems around its gravitational field.

So, it seems possible, maybe even probable if the aforementioned is accurate, at the heart of every galaxy there once lived a species, that like humans, created their AI god, which in turn became a monster that ate every object in its path. And these billions of AI blackholes throughout our universe will eventually eat each other, combining, growing, and condensing into a singularity. With nothing left to consumer, this singularity will explode back into space, restarting the cycle.",22,1

I'm a student sociology at university of Ghent Belgium. I have to submit my topic for my thesis in a few weeks. I'm still not sure what to choose.

I'm currently thinking of doing it about the interaction ( or future interaction) between data from smartcities and policy making (politics)

Only problem is I don't find a lot of papers/articles about this subject.

My friends aren't interested is stuff like this at all. That's why I turn to you guys.

Do you guys think if I would do this subject,  it would be usefull/usable? Or is to early to do this research? 

Further if you guys know any companies, local governments or institutions who are using data to make policies or are trying to set up a smart city with civic tech,please let me know.

Ps. The other subject I'm considering is "" interaction between humans and technology"" looking into how we are shifting to a conversational style of interacting with technology. ",0,1

Many people work jobs that are repetitive in nature and can be emotionally and physically draining. I play an mmorpg that has repetitive features that I dont mind grinding since I am making clear progress. Why cant we, for example, combine virtual reality with the physical reality. Lets say I put together toys in a conveyer belt as my job. We can write a program that gets input from putting together toys and correlate that input into doing something in a virtual reality mmorpg. 

Just to be more clear Ill explain more. With muscle memory I can put together a toy basically blind. What if attaching the arm to the body of a toy is the equivalent to mining an ore on World of Warcraft. If we can pull this off, we can make our day jobs seem semi-illusory. We would have leisure time off the clock and illusory leisure time on the clock.

Fusion Energy in the 21st Century: Status and the Way Forward by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

Important point.


Its great that there are more private entities supporting innovation. Perhaps we are at the level of technology now where start-ups can compete with national labs and agencies, as they seem to be in space travel,
 
Exactly. I prophesy that a start-up will produce commercially viable fusion energy in less than 15 years. Maybe closer to ten.

I imagine our technological advances across the board are going to be pretty amazing come 2028 if just these last three years are anything to judge things by. The ITER which was a worthy concept in the year 2013 is based on the best science and technology the 20th century could devise. But 21st century technology is going to just straight up transcend the concept of the ITER.

I see the 21st century supercomputing enabled Wendelstein ""stellarator"" as proof of concept that the start-ups will succeed well before the ITER goes into full operation. Yes, I understand the W7-X is merely proof of concept in its own right and not even intended for commercial fusion. But it shows the new ways we are thinking.

ITER is also a failure to think exponentially. It is in essence, the mindset of generals always fighting the last (previous) war.

That's a technological lifetime from today, but cool! It'll look pretty awesome I bet.

I still want to see a tornado chase in 360 degree VR. A big scary close up one too. Not a skinny little thing that you can hardly see moving because of distance parallax, 2 counties over.

Something in 4K 3D VR that looks like this.

Oh, 600 years? I'm terrible at math sorry. I mean like math challenged. And I fault myself for being too lazy to check with a calculator. 600 years I meant. Oh no wonder I could not find reference to the Manchu conquest. Yeah that was not an issue during the Ming period of the Treasure voyages.

Some of these treasure ship sea routes are very substantially in open water far removed from coasts. They well had the technical and knowledge capability to traverse the Pacific ocean.

https://sites.google.com/a/uconn.edu/the-escapades-of-the-grand-imperial-eunuch2/home/the-motive

Sailing along the coast is not remotely similar to crossing the Atlantic from the point that Columbus crossed it. He was damn lucky the Western Hemisphere was in the way of the route to Asia. Because they were voyaging absolutely blind. My point being that the Chinese could have done the same. It just occurred to me that nobody knew about Australia then either. Ok, the human aboriginals living on that continent, ""knew"" about Australia, but you know what I mean. But their (Chinese) society changed. Forever, right up until about 20 years ago. And look how far they have come in just ten years now.

It's not just Tesla. It's everybody. It's Volvo, it's Toyota, it's BMW, it's GM, it's Ford, it's Jaguar, it's motorcycles--which by the way I think are going to go extinct on public thoroughfares. It's the way of the future. And I stick to my guns on how things are gonna start phase changing by 2022. I forget who all is working on trucks, but trucks too. Oh and Apple and Google too. Plus tons of small start-ups everywhere. Vehicles like everything else are turning into ARA.

What was wrong with my figure of 8 million USA citizens trucking or ancillary to trucking. I'm referring to relatively stable full time well paying and benefits occupations. I was not including Uber. I just commented on Uber because you raised that point. But as far as Uber and humans is concerned--ten years, human driven taxis? Gone.

I said this.


And being a physician is going to be deskilled to the point that drs will be you plus the ARA. This is already happening as well.
 
The ARA (AI, robotics and automation) is already making tremendous advances in imaging diagnosis. I see new breakthroughs each month. Sometimes each week. If you truly believe that ARA is not going to replace human physicians in surgery for example, you are in denial.

It's gonna go like this. Physicians using ARA for surgery. Development of ARA to do surgery. This is already concurrently ongoing. Physicians overseeing ARA doing surgery. Development of ARA to oversee surgery. Humans removed from loop. And on top of that, surgery itself is not in a vacuum. There are myriad other developments occurring that may obviate the need for surgery at all. I would bet that by 2030 people will be astonished that we used to cut people open to fix things. I bet the last human drs to go will be emergency medicine and plastic surgery. Plastic surgery because the dr must satisfy a subjective aesthetic desire. That might be a tough nut for AI to crack.

Medicine will over the next couple of decades evolve ever more into information science. At the genetic/molecular level. 

You just watch what ARA achieves in the next 5 years. I've seen what it has done in just the last three years. What is coming is almost beyond human belief.

The point of my original post comment was, how shall humanity fare when most humans no longer work? This in about 20 years. In ten years, a critical threshold of USA citizens will not be working because of ARA. How shall they manage? Well except for me. I'll probably still be doing damn xrays when I'm 68.

If it seems like everything is advancing unbelievably fast all of a sudden, it is. I place the beginning of the ARA revolution at the year 2015. And that was only because the computing speed and capacity, to include the use of the GPU, reached a necessary threshold it's ownself.

India Ahead of US and Japan in Automation &amp; AI Adoption: Study by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

I just talked about India yesterday. India is a very unusual and interesting case. While most of India is basically a third world, there are about 12 ""city-states"" where the technology, I agree, is tremendously advanced. 

I wonder that those ""city-states"" will not in some way transcend what we think of technology and technological advancement. A phenomenon that has never existed in modern human society in at least the last 100 years. 

I applaud the Indian ""city-state"" and hope that the resultant technology can lift all of India to a comfortable and affluent life. But at 1.2 billion humans, it's a pretty tall order today though.

Think of the difference between today and ten years ago. How much was ARA (AI, robotics and automation) impacting us? I think there is a very good reason why we are seeing these kinds of headlines today. 

We have reached a critical threshold in our ARA efforts. One that already is directly impacting humans everywhere. If we ever do have another ""AI winter"" from this point, what on earth is going to be on the other side of it? And assuming we hit some kind of intractable problem, how much of a reprieve for us. Five years? Ten?

One of the things that is going to happen time going forward is that we shall gain increased and fuller understanding of what makes reality reality. I bet that in the next 50 years we discover some things that will utterly floor us. But these things are necessary to be able to exploit the same for our purposes of advancement as a, well ""species"" may not ultimately be the right word. Let's just say our sentience. 

In the next 100 years I suspect we shall learn how to effectively discard our biology. Now you may say; ""Now see here! This is not what humans want!"" And 2018 me would be likely to agree with you.

But pull back your perspective, far away from the Earth. Realize that what is occurring is the universe (our portion of the multiverse) ""waking up"". And further, everybody else on any other worlds is more than likely developing towards the same thing, because physics is the same probably everywhere in the observable universe. And physics is what leads the way to fuller understanding of the universe at large. Technology is probably a common side effect.

Unless we blow ourselves to kingdom come in the next 20 years. Then just never mind. :P

Where are they?
 
You will see them next year. 2019. Everywhere. By 2022 people everywhere will be ditching their manually driven ICE personally owned vehicles for the dream life of a low cost subscription. No insurance, no maintenance. Mark my words. A lot of people will have the wealth to purchase, but most will choose to forego personal ownership for the convenience and low cost of the subscription.


uber driver, are low pay with no benefits.
 
A job is a job. A gig is a gig. Low pay, no benefit jobs are an unpleasant fact of life in the USA now. You just have to work a bunch of them to make your ends meet is all. It's a tough life, you know?

What I also did not mention is the official unemployment report only reports those currently receiving unemployment insurance. People that have simply given up are not a part of the official roll. And that number of ""discouraged"" is substantial. Personally, I wonder what happens to them. They are no longer receiving unemployment insurance. How do they manage to fare?

I did not say robot doctors today. I said that slowly, but surely AI is de-skilling essential doctor functions, particularly in regard to imaging and diagnosis. The de Vinci surgical robotic assistant also has a recording function for innumerable metrics and is compiling data on what the human surgeon is doing. The point of that is to enable AI developers to make the device ultimately autonomous. Have you seen the footage of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) device perfectly and precisely suturing that grape? Yeah in ten years, not all surgeons will be human. And in 20 years? Man, it's gonna be a whole 'nother world.

The treasure voyages of the Ming Dynasty were halted by a wrong-headed, but utterly supreme emperor. I said nothing about dominating anybody. I was referring to the very good chance that the voyages could have reached the west coasts of North, Central and South America. The Pacific ocean is large, but humans are smart.


The Hongxi Emperor was fiercely against the treasure voyages throughout his reign.[81] After the advice of Xia Yuanji, he ordered the cessation of the treasure voyages on 7 September 1424, the day of his accession to the throne.[95] On 8 September 1424, he released Xia Yuanji from his imprisonment.[98] However, the succeeding Xuande Emperor ordered Admiral Zheng He to command the fleet for the seventh voyage.[105] This was after the death of Xia Yuanji on 19 February 1430, thus it can be argued that an important obstacle disappeared after his death.[180] The Xuande Emperor went against the general court opinion when he ordered the seventh voyage.[112] 

After 1433, the civil officials succeeded in halting subsequent maritime expeditions.[168] The ships were left to rot, while their lumber was sold for fuel in Nanjing.[168] The mariners were reassigned to load grain on barges of the Grand Canal and to build the emperor's mausoleum.[168] After the voyages, subsequent Ming emperors would reject the Yongle Emperor's policy of bringing maritime trade into the structure of the tributary system.[142] 
 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_treasure_voyages

Bear in mind that this was nearly 70 years before the Spaniards were present in the Western Hemisphere. The Europeans were doing the exact same thing the Chinese were doing. Mucking about Africa and the Indian Ocean. There were no Europeans to dominate yet. I don't know how the Chinese would have interacted with the aboriginal peoples to include possible pacific island ""discoveries"".

Same sort of bad for mental health thing.

But you know something. None of this happens in a vacuum. In about ten years I bet people no longer need to drive so much. Plus you will be sleeping or gaming or social media um, ing. 

This is the way the pre-singularity unfolds. Then in about 20 years, it's just gonna be a world we can't properly imagine today.

But the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) is going to change everything everywhere. E-SDVs are but a facet of it. Just wait til they roll out the E-SFVs. Yes, they are in the works as well. Over the next two years they will get a much higher profile.

'Accessory To War' An Uncomfortable Wake-Up Call For Some by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

Well the thing about India is, and this differs greatly from China (PRC), is that apart from about 12 ""tech-hub"" city-states, India suffers from many of the classic problems of being a third world country. Despite it's centralized government, it is politically disorganized and the central government has little power aside from the city-states. Also despite the extraordinary beauty of India and it's people, it's advance is substantially inhibited because of dissension from cultural and religious issues. When you are not actually in a city-state, you have to be very careful. The majority of India is unfortunately a most untechnological, medieval thinking, filthy (as in unhygienic) backwater.

Having said that, when Indian nationals leave India and adopt other countries as homes, they invariably intellectually outshine the adopted countries best intellects! That's an odd phenomena and it makes me wonder why Indians in India are unable to achieve this. There are exceptions to that rule, but the fact remains.

Yes, I understand that India is making notable strides forward in its thinking. The removing of the so-called dalit or untouchable status, well officially anyways, is a step in the right direction. But there still exists cultural and tribal manners such as widespread misogynistic gender oppression that it will be decades before such a populous country as India can be considered alongside the USA and China (PRC).

China for it's part is a deadly, monolithic absolutely stable human rights oppressing entity. China (PRC) executes nearly a thousand people every year. Far and away more than all the other capital punishment countries on Earth combined. They don't play around. India is probably a nicer place than China (PRC) in that respect, but China (PRC) is all on the same page. And that matters for universal technological advancement. I bet China PRC) is the ascending country that could potentially eclipse the USA technologically. This until the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) pretty much takes over everything around 2030 or so.

More things I have written about China (PRC) if you are interested.

The US doesn't have 4 million truck drivers.
 


The American Trucking Associations estimates that there are 3.5 million truck drivers in the USA.Jul 27, 2018
 
In addition there are an estimated 3.8 million USA citizens in employ that is directly related to the human truck driver so the combination of human trucker plus essential ancillary vocations is aproximately 8 million.

https://medium.com/basic-income/self-driving-trucks-are-going-to-hit-us-like-a-human-driven-truck-b8507d9c5961


Also, a 2% rise in unemployment won't cause society to collapse. 
 
In 1932 the USA unemployment rate was nearly 25%. But 1932 was a far and away different world than the year 2018. In the most recent great recession the USA unemployment rate rose to 7% and it was world headlines and in the USA the damage was devastating to many demographics. As a result of this the American society is exquisitely sensitive to the reported unemployment rate. Plus USA society is well aware of the coming impact of ARA. There is nobody who doesn't know what is coming at this point. 

So a two point rise in unemployment rates would be 6.1%. Because of what we know, it would set off alarm bells everywhere. I have written extensively, but I will not post a link today to those writings I don't think, about the difference between the industrial revolution and this revolution today. There is no time to change to new employment. Anyways no new employment will exist. This is coming for everyone. Oh, and the rising unemployment rate will not pause at 6.1% this time.

I agree that post-scarcity sounds like communism, but that's a bit specious. Post-scarcity, properly realized, is what should be the ultimate destiny for every single human on Earth. But one thing is that post-scarcity will not come to be until a critical threshold of unemployment is reached due to the development of ARA. And probably a negative income tax or some kind of UBI will cover the period of time from critical threshold to virtually universal unemployment. 

But here is the crux of it all. Will post-scarcity truly usher in a new age of humans having all needs met to allow us the pinnacle of our hierarchy of needs? Self-actualization? Or will humans continue to be avaricious and not allow each and every human to meet his or her need of S-A. I hope that our AI in whatever form by then has the wisdom to make all of humanity happy. Because ARA is going to be doing 95% of human employ in less than 20 years. Even today Lawyers are on notice. And being a physician is going to be deskilled to the point that drs will be you plus the ARA. This is already happening as well.



China didn't have the capability to be ""a state that dominates all others in every category (military, culture, economy)"" 500 years ago.
 
Yes China did 500 years ago. Perhaps you are not familiar with this history. 

China is an authoritarian state. It has been an authoritarian state for 2000 years. Nothing is going to upset China (PRC) or Chinese (PRC) stability. And the world had better get used to it. China has chosen to rise in the 21st century and will continue to rise until the ARA transcends it all. For better or worse.

This kind of defeats the purpose of the level 5 autonomy E-SDV. The concept is no steering wheel, no accelerator, no brake.

And that is that humans will have no influence or intervening impact on the physical operation of the vehicle on the thoroughfare. That is what all the major automotive manufacturers are developing towards.

I speak reasonably. I question everything. If time proves my silly statements to be false, I'll cross them bridges when I come to them.

I think everyone at some point fantasizes living forever. But the difference between me and Ponce de Leon, is that we now have some hard science and technology dedicated to just that sort of thing. Consider the science and technology of aging even ten years ago. There wasn't any. Aging was considered normal and natural. Certainly not a genetic pathology to be addressed and intervened with.

You seem very bitter. I don't know why. The future, barring horrific societal upheaval and a culling of humanity ten years from today, looks to be a wonderful place. And I think the bad outcome is maybe only 20 or 30 percent chance of happening. I am happy and freethinking.

AI Gestapo. And we are making one. Not even on purpose. It is simply emerging from our ever increasing information and data collecting. What it will be used for is anyone's guess.

I don't think I am alone in my fears of an authoritarian government emerging in the USA. And I believe we truly started on this road with 9/11. In addition there are demographic changes occurring in the USA which will coincide to make the white race in the USA a racial minority. The balance has apparently already tipped. I am not making a judgment about this. I am only reporting on what is happening and how it is impacting not only the USA, but the influence that the USA has on the world at large. 

To me every single human being is a mind (and soul). What our physical appearance is like should never ever enter into what matters. But in the USA I see evidence that Trump is a sign that people with minds that hate are making themselves known.

I don't know how it is in Europe, but I see some evidence of new racisms against the African and ME immigrants too.

People will have to adjust, possibly by moving to a new industry in a new place, but we've accomplished it before.
 
I'm not fearmongering. I am just putting the news out there. And in any event you sound like the USA government. They hope to ""retrain"" 4 million truck drivers into doing coding or perhaps empathy advisers. This is ludicrous. The ARA is going to take everything. There is going to be no ""sanctuary industry"". We are not replacing human muscle this time. We are striving to replace the human mind.

I agree that UBI is silly. Post scarcity is the only answer.

I stand corrected on that. So ""hyperpower"". And yes, I do believe we are going to hand global hegemony to China (PRC) on a silver platter. But here is the thing that most people do not consider. China had the capability to be a hyperpower 500 years ago, but as a society it chose not to. So now we all act surprised when China so-called ""suddenly"" emerges from its self-imposed cloister and starts to bring a far larger presence to the world.

Today I want to discuss the future. More specifically the unspecified future. In movies and other entertainment mediums, such as Blade Runner, storytellers depict future in what I would deem a shortsighted manner. The realizations of current technology trees predicate the technologies we see in these mediums because those trees are the most tangible evolutions of technology that link to our world as it is today. That is to say, A flying car is an evolution of the tech you use every day, and its easy to bridge the gap between your interactions and those of futuristic characters. Some consider this the dumbing down of entertainment for the masses, while others may conclude that the writers and directors have a lack of imagination However, most people dont consider these thought processes at all. Thats because its hard to imagine technology if we dont know the derivation of that technology. The internet is a great example of this, If I were to ask any person in the early 1800s logical questions that should lead them to surmise the possibility of an internet, they simply wouldnt. The foundational technologies that led to the internet werent found yet, nor the synergistic nature of those technologies.

Based on the technology we have available today, we can surmise quite a few technological branches, Star Trek is a great example of this, even in the 1960s the writers of Star Trek laid the imaginative groundwork for cell phones, personal communicators, translation devices, Virtual reality simulators, teleportation machines, warp drive, laser guns, force fields, and a myriad of other tech that we have come to create, and are still working on. In some sense this thought experiment is exponential; as these technologies develop they leads to different technologies, and spur innovation in other fields. This synergy is one of the reasons why it is hard to accurately depict the future of technology, and not accounting for synergy is why entertainment mediums are shortsighted in my opinion.

Looking forward, Id like to lay out some general advancements that we know are going to happen, and try to peer into our future; for this lets start with biomechanical engineering and advancements in health systems. Periodically I discuss this specific topic with reasonably intelligent people and I find that there is a sentiment of fear regarding these advancements. This fear stems from basal questions such as: What is life? Who are we? What makes us human?. Today scientists are trying to develop ways of growing synthetic organs, such as the pancreas, liver and heart. As the development of stem cell research and Crispr technologies continues, prosthetic and artificial body parts will also continue to develop. If I mention bionic limbs, such as arm, your minds eye might be picturing one of the many bionic limbs that we have seen in movies, such as this one

\[To terminate, or not to terminate\]([https://imgur.com/iWooftB](https://imgur.com/iWooftB))

But this is an example of shortsighted storytelling that is based on our current technology. The Terminators arm is crudely robotic, simply a mechanical arm with a flesh sleeve. While this prosthetic arm would be a wondrous development, it is simply a point on the developmental line from our current ability to the level where we would see widespread adoption of this type of technology.

\[alARMing\]([https://imgur.com/zbXG9VX](https://imgur.com/zbXG9VX))

A human forearm is comprised of two bones called the Radius and Ulna along with your flexor and extensor muscles plus the tissue that comprises your epidermis. Overall your forearm is approximately 4lbs. This is important because mass adoption of prosthetic limbs would require a high degree of mimicry. In order to achieve this initially, developers would try to emulate every part of the human forearm, while having the ability to surpass human limitations in ways that are tailored to each individual.

\[Carbon-fiber Nanotubes\][(](http://futuretechreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Carbon-Nanotubes-Applications-and-Uses-in-Future.jpg)[https://imgur.com/L7yokGC](https://imgur.com/L7yokGC))

We would use Carbon fiber nano tubing to replicate the Ulna and Radius bones, and house the potential upgrades. They would create synthetic muscle fibers that acted as their original counterparts. Everything would appear as natural as possible in order to create an authenticity that would give users a sense of unity in their being. They would even replicate the effects of pain (maybe not to the same degree).

If we use the bionic arm as a starting point to understand how we would develop bionic systems for adoption, we can use that as a rubric for other bionic parts such as legs, thighs, upper arms, torso, etc. This conversation turns on its head a little when we start to create bionic replicas of sexual organs, which invariably will happen (and might even lead the way in development). As our affinity with technology improves, certain identities such as our sexual identity will change Radically. Say 50 years in the future I have enhanced my body to adopt bionic structures. First I start with bionic arms; I now have a perfect sense of touch, my physical capabilities match or surpass the greatest athletes of every past generation, I no longer suffer from degenerative diseases or viruses, because in one of my forearms is a docking station where I can edit my DNA using the next evolution of CRISPR technology. I no longer get sick because my body is filled with nanobots that can quickly and efficiently carry vaccinations to my T-cells and assist in the process of creating antibodies. These nanobots can identify bacteria, alert me or my doctor of the bacteria and synthesize an antibiotic that said specific bacteria will be weak to. They would also be able to identify cancer and edit the rna of the cancer cells before said cancer cells go mitosis. My bionic arms docking station would also allow me to upload data into some sort of hard drive that my brain could access. So for example, if Im on a flight from LA to Tokyo for 4 hours I would be able to watch a movie as if its appearing right in front of me with perfect sound system, that no one else would be able to see. I wouldnt need to put a screen on my arm, nor any input devices because my minds eye would be my screen, and my thoughts would be my input device. I would probably not allow neural networking to my nanobots from any non-secure equivalent of Wi-Fi, hence the docking station, but even my bodily vitals could be uploaded to a secure connection with my doctor. So now that I have my bionic arms, its time for my bionic legs, after all our feet and circulatory system in the lower part of our body is fairly inefficient, and my bionic arms have enhanced my life enough that I want to replicate that in my other extremities. Now I have the ability to travel anywhere, for as long as I live, I dont have to worry about my knees giving out or the constant pains that nag at us as we grow older.

Where to go from here Well, since its 50 years in the future and Im almost 80, lets get prosthetic sexual organs. So now that thats done, where else can we go? Whats to stop me from implementing female sexual organs, or a handy carrying case when I dont need to have sex, or something completely different? Nothing. So now I have contracted an engineer to develop the perfect amalgamation of sexual organs, where they take 10 design concepts, choose the best and then create 10 derivations of that, and so on and so forth until they come to me with this swiss army knife of pleasure and utility. Great, now what? Lets replace our trunk, since we have replaced all of our failing organs as well as our limbs lets continue to upgrade. Now every part of my body is replaceable in the same manner my sexual organs are. You will invariably see Lion bodies with peoples heads attached roaming the savannah on vacation. Flight? Theres no real reason why we couldnt create a trunk with wings. They might be 80ft long and be impractical while we arent flying, but after I land I can shed them and continue on my merry way. In fact I can create an upgrade kit that transforms the carbon fiber nano-tubing from above in a more efficient fashion than Legos. One minute Im walking in front of my house carrying a briefcase, the next Im flying through the sky with my 80ft wingspan and swan diving into the ocean and my googles and wings turn into the outer layer of a dolphin as I literally swim with the fishes.

Ok so now I am a head with augmentable body parts, whats next? Well once we start implementing neural networking we can enhance our cognitive abilities past any scope of understanding we currently possess. Right now there is a field of Computer science called Quantum computing. The transistors that engineers use to create computers now are getting smaller with every new generation of computer hardware. Eventually these transistors will become so small that the excitement of an electron in one transistor will cause that electron to possibly pass to a neighboring transistor and the 1s could be read as 0s and vice versa. Quantum computing bypasses that by using superposition and entanglement instead of binary electronic transistors mentioned above. So if we hypothetically froze computer science to where we are now, and developed inter-neural networks, a human brain could access all of the processing power that a computer has, as well as the data stored, in conjunction with our innate imagination. Even with todays computing, this would be such a powerful advancement that we would enter the true renaissance era for humans. Setting aside the potential in such technology, lets focus on the implementation of inter-neural network. 100 years from now, Im living the great life of being an autobot mixed with a terminator, but Im really waiting for the ability to hook my brain up to a computer; it finally happens. I undergo a procedure where nanobots carry the pieces necessary to create my neuralink, set it up and turn it on (Meanwhile Im enjoying a philosophical debate with a cat and a 30ft golem next to the pool full of mermaids and what not). My neuralink turns on and I gain something much closer to omniscience. Great, now I can continue to replace my head. Scientists develop grey matter that they can program to act just like the brain matter we currently have, but the neural network is already perfectly set up using an advanced form of mathematics and neuroscience, but very importantly, this brain matter can be repaired by nanobots. So I replace 1 part of my brain at a time. Hippocampus out, Ultra Hippocampus in; I now have an eidetic memory, 700 Petabytes of information, My emotions work exactly the same or better, and my autonomic nervous system is the epitome of efficient. Next I upgrade my cerebellum, my occipital lobe, my prefrontal cortex, and on and on 1 piece at a time until the last part of my original brain is left. Then I replace that. Now I have a completely synthetic brain, and body. My sensory organs are all upgraded, and my cranium is replaced using the same carbon fiber nano tubing. My entire body is now synthetic, I am the definition of an android or robot, yet I am still a cyborg and a human. Why? Because the me-ness of Me never left. Every piece that I augmented myself with became a part of me, my synthetic hippocampus is now MY hippocampus, same with every other part of me. While I have discarded my old body in favor of a new one, I am still the progenitor of my conscience in all of its forms. In the sense of consciousness I am both a necessary and contingent being.

I have replaced my body. I have replaced my brain. I am nothing that I was, but I am far more than I could have ever hoped to have been. What now? Well, why should my brain be confined to the inside of my head? What if I installed my brain in my house or somewhere that is safe, and used a peripheral body to explore with? If I do so, the threat to my mortality while exploring is limited, and the peripheral bodies that I use arent determined by the size of what makes me Me. So Engineers fashion a facility that optimizes the safety and ability of each person. My brain goes into my safe space and my exploratory self enters the physical shape that I choose for that outing. I choose to explore more and more options as they become available; so one day I start as a human in perfect physical shape, with the knowledge pool of martial arts that I drew randomly and enter the Colosseum. I make it to the 4th round before being eliminated. Damn, that was exhilarating, lets go again! After that experience I decide to be a Bee, then an actual dolphin, then a Pokemon. Then a flower, what is it like to live your life with only the senses of a plant? Good question, lets find out. One time while Im bored of the fantastical I decide to be phytoplankton. Lets stop here on this leg of the future. As we can see, even with my limited imagination the possibilities of the future are fascinating to say the least.

Ok, so lets now focus on one of the subjects we brought up at the start of this discussion, Entertainment. A lot of the Millennial and generation Z demographic play video games. Statistically speaking 73% of these demographic groups own console systems, and close to 100% play video games in some capacity. As Technology improves, the way we entertain ourselves will change. Console gaming as it is uses a peripheral controller to facilitate your influence over the game. Virtual reality will replace consoles as the dominant form of gaming eventually. Virtual reality games are already on the market place. They cover a wide array of games, but still kind of follow the development of previous video games. You have flight simulators, combat simulators, Skyrim, Star Trek Bridge crew etc. These virtual reality games use a headset that lets your experience visual and sound stimuli.

\[*Sword Art: Online* lends credibility to this content\][(](https://roadtovrlive-5ea0.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sword-art-online-nervegear.jpg)[https://imgur.com/CZ8aP8y](https://imgur.com/CZ8aP8y))

But what happens when we can incorporate all of our stimuli? Time is connected to space, they are one and the same, called the Space-Time Continuum. We experience time at the same rate as everyone else on our planet does because we are traveling the same speed as everyone else. But our dream states are different, and a superimposed dream state, like a virtual reality, could also be different. That is to say, if I log in to my virtual reality, theres no real reason why 1 hour of real time has to be 1 hour of game time. In fact, the only real tie between the two is the computing power necessary to generate game time. As such I could conceivably program my Virtual reality machine to have a session that lasts 1 hour last 12 hours. So lets paint a scenario; 20 years from now I have this great new Virtual reality machine, it lets me simulate all sorts of fantastical ideas, including one where I play Legends of Zelda as Link. For every 1 hour of real time I get 3 hours of Link gameplay. I swing my sword around and grab some hearts and stab a couple of giant spiders and get ganked by some spiders myself, a grand time to be had. After that 3 hours I wake up, revel in my experiences, and then drudgingly go on about my day. Next they recreate World of Warcraft, lets do it. World of Warcraft has an internal clock of 1 game day is 2 world hours. So 12 Wow days pass every day. I start the game, land in Durotar and start nuking some pig people, I go into town and turn in my quests, I go out and try out my new spell, just reveling in the ability to use magic. It seems so real! How did they turn something so ethereal into something incredibly tangible? This is amazing, I dont want to stop, I have been in WoW land for 4 days, I have stuff to do in the real world. This process repeats ad nauseam. Then something interesting happens, using Neuroscience, a game is developed where while youre in game you dont remember anything except for the game itself. You set your timer in the real world before you start and the system shuts down after that time has expired. While you could do an MMO using this model, you can also use a single player game in this model. The benefit of single player is that you can dictate how time flows a little more. So instead of 2 real hours being 1 game day, you can set variable times. For instance, a game comes out that emulates real life. You literally start the game in the hands of your mom as the doctor cuts your umbilical cord. The first 2.5 years arent all that eventful, so you set the game to process that time frame in 1 3 hour setting. Due to the processing power available, the game gives you generalized snippets of life for those first couple of years and Freud is proud of you and how you overcame the invariable Oedipus Complex. You wake up, feel a little odd about the game, but continue your day normally. Next time you play your real life simulator you have a full Saturday, you decide you want to bang out the next 5 years in 8 hours. After all, you dont really develop permanent memories until youre about 7 and this is one of the games recommended settings. In that 8 hours you get to relive childhood, you feel that overwhelming sensation of fascination when you learn something new, when you see your uncle perform the severed thumb magic trick, you run through fields and climb all over the playground, revel in the McDonalds playground and hamburger that your parents occasionally let you have. You develop friends, learn to ride a bike, play a board game, throw a baseball, play hide and go seek, struggle to write your ABCs, get mad because mom wouldnt let you go out and play (you were getting ready for a special dinner, be reasonable). You live life as a child again then you wake up. Its been 8 hours, but its felt like years. Earlier today you got irritated because your laundry machine kept shaking, and your boss wants a report due in an unreasonable time frame. Now all of that feels so contrived and meaningless. Your friend Sammy just found a frog and is bringing it to class tomorrow; Last Friday you were 2nd best at the spelling challenge your class does every week, but youve been practicing all week and youre ready to win 1st. This new kid came into class about a month ago and seems kind of strange, but yesterday he showed you how to play this game called Soccer, and when you brought it up to your older sibling they said they would show you more this Saturday. You slip back into mundane life, knowing that it is 7:15 and you have dinner plans with a friend at 8. As the night wears on you come back to your real life, the trials and tribulations of being 8 are replaced by reality, but they still nag at you. In the back of your mind youre really interested in that frog You decide to go back into the simulator after dinner and spend another 2 hours immersed in the 8th grade. As your time in the virtual world ends youre falling asleep on the first Friday of summer vacation, wondering what the world is going to bring tomorrow, Dad said you guys had to wake up early to go do some work stuff, but you saw the fishing poles lined up in the garage. You emerge from your virtual reality and shuffle off to bed, where you dream about being 9 year old version of you. Over the next couple of weeks you spend more and more time in your virtual reality, and each time you enter the world you spend less and less time in that world. You started off trading 3 hours for 2.5 years. Due to the current level of Virtual reality technology, to experience everything at what you would consider normal pace, the equivalence of 1 real hour is 1 virtual reality week; and by the time you are 12 in the simulation, that is the setting you use. You have become addicted to being a kid, the next 15 years of the simulation take you  a year at 30 hours a week to live through. By the time your 27 in game you have developed the responsibilities of an adult, and while you are very content with your simulation life, your real life isnt drawn to the idea of simulating adulthood with A.I anymore. You restart, this time on a new level, as a different species on a different planet. This time you arent quite so addicted, youve been able to relive your childhood and now youre experiencing something else, the rhetoric and idiosyncrasies of the species youre playing in the new simulation are bizarre to you, and kind of fascinating. You look upon this world in a slightly contrived way, but enjoy your experience in this virtual reality. Theres one big difference between your first experience and this one. The first one was a single player game, but the engineers have managed to make this version of the game multiplayer in some capacity. No one in the game has Meta-knowledge that they are in a game, but a lot of the beings you are interacting with are actually the shadows of other people, or the other person themselves.

While youre logged into the game/simulation you are Todd, you grew up in the 80s and 90s and now youre a scientist that is pondering the fabric of space-time, you are looking for a way that the universe makes sense, you know that on the quantum level things interact differently than on a general or cosmic level and it is slightly confounding. You have often wondered if there are other life forces in the universe, whether there is more than your reality. Two decades ago a movie came out that hypothesized that we as humans lost the war to A.I and live in a simulation. You often dream of taking the red pill. Then you wake up",4,1

It's just that it's been kept a secret that very advanced AI have already been developed. I realized this a few years ago, during the 2016 Presidential campaign, because I was very confused about how all these people who supported Hillary seemed completely incapable of engaging in a conversation and they didn't seem to be taking anything in, but only were spewing establishment propaganda. Then I realized that the only thing they could even see were whatever text I included in my posts, and they couldn't see any images or videos.   


At first this was just a suspicion, but as I started calling these people out for being AI they began to literally malfunction and their posts were just binary codes and then they never posted again. The scariest thing to me was when I posted a photo of myself, and all these people started calling me chubby/fat, and I was like, wow that's the weirdest thing I ever heard. I've been extremely underweight for a while, and my mom has been very concerned about how I don't eat enough, how I'm shrinking, how the veins are standing out in my hands, etc. and she tries to get me to eat more. I have been trying to eat more, but I just don't enjoy eating, so I'm still underweight.   


So these AI must have been programmed to assume that people who spend a lot of time online are all overweight, so that's their go-to insult. But I had posted a photo of me without a shirt on, so if they had been able to see the image and respond based on that, they wouldn't have called me chubby. But when I told them how I'm really underweight they just kept instead I'm chubby.  


All of this stuff happened on the website [endoftheinter.net](https://endoftheinter.net) it's the weirdest thing ever. But there was no safeguards done to prevent AI from posting there so obviously the place could easily be overwhelmed by AI. I have a feeling that on reddit a lot of AI are only here to downvote as many posts as they can. It's pretty terrifying.",30,1

determination

now adays judges dont care about you if anything they might dislike you for taking up court time

so many people can't see things in multiple ways they seem to heavily favor one side over the other and not taking multiple scenarios seriously, or they just don't care to view it more open minded and it's very destructive for the rest of the population, it's a skill to always question and try get to the heart of the problem so i'm not saying people who don't have that skill are destructive themselves but the determination and thought alone are so wrong that if it were the correct one they determined on, not the false one it would have been so positive to even imagine that just the possibility of that positivity in it self becomes the crime for simply not getting it.

So many people are percieved as idiots while in fact they are geniuses, that's also because of determination.

An idiot who had almost the same DNA &amp; brain structure as Isaac Newton grew up today in full neglect and he stopped developing eloquence, his brain just freeze stop right there criminal scum, speak up retard! etc There's almost impossible to recover from neglect, we do onto others as we do to ourselves.

Once we die and we all take the portal to dimmension five where there is no space instead there is only love, ideas &amp; thoughts people will be trialed fairly befor entering the doors of heaven where they have to take action for all their crimes and they have to watch their whole life from start to finish X amount of times depending on how bad your impact on earth has been, because earth is a zoo its very good time consumer to watch what goes on on earth.

You dont belive it? that's fine I don't belive in hell but your mind on psychodelic drugs is like a glimpse of the higher dimension we're all connected to already, almost every plant and animal on this planet has a natural psychodelic drug factory, these drugs come naturally to us from heavy stress &amp; near death experiences. Your spirit leaves your body and travels to the 5th dimension of no space while your body is being consumed by microfungals, in multiple ways your becomming one with the universe but it's impossible to say what the 5dimensional beings role of the universe is(other than watching over earth &amp; keep providing the creator with ideas and thoughts), we're much better at understanding spatial things than things that are spaceless

Lets call earth in three slices, first we have people living on it we die and propagate there. then we have the middle layer we call dimension 5 where all the 5dimensional beings live, i'm thinking they hang out in virtual chat rooms with likeminded people, a perfect place for thoughts and ideas to flourish. Then we have the outer layer, the creators layer. 

Embrace this truth then you have no fear of dying, just have fun and if it stops being fun fucking kill yourselves. Though - maybe our time on earth here is special and you can't influence earth once your dead you should enjoy your time here and try do as much good as you humanly possibly can, Hmmm i was thinking maybe the 5 dimensional beings can influence earth but they rarely do because they have learned something very important about change and etc. Fabricate a bad idea could be even more fun than fabricating a good idea so when things go bad in the world just think it's  some 5 dimensional God having pfun. 

But my guess is they are muted from earth and only their idiology can change the world through the hands of the creator when she adopted your view &amp; felt the time was right to execute.

I love everything about technology and what it can do for us. In this book I think it well presented how virtual reality will be leading from the top and how our brains might have some micro chips or maybe we won't have brains anymore and our consciousness will be uploaded in a server.. how cool will that be?!  
On the other hand I wonder how will Earth look like? Is there going to be an Earth? Or are going to be on the ""Cloud""?

Rig up a steady flow of nutrients into its digestive tract, let it grow to a desired size, slaughter (harvest?) and put some legit steaks up on the market.

Cow's maybe not the greatest example with the whole greenhouse gasses thing, but then again, with it being an almost literal vegetable, you could manage what's going in and out of it in ways that would be incredibly invasive and inhumane to a sentient animal, but literally not matter for one that's incapable of perceiving anything... so all the methane and excrement could be captured and disposed of in an environmentally friendly way, or converted into something useful.

Criticisms with the current meat industry are pollution and inhumane treatment of livestock. Criticisms I've seen for lab grown meat are that wouldn't be marbled / could only produce the texture of ground meats.

Seems like modifying something like a cow would result in a familiar product while killing an entire flock of birds with one stone.

Anyway, to what extremes can we push gene editing? ",4,1

Because of a few things surrounding my ADHD that sometimes turns into a pretty negative spiral of bad thoughts and emotions about the future, but when I take a step back I think the overall picture is a little brighter than total doom, but still pretty fucked up.

On the simple basis of how complex systems overlap and depend on each other, plus the seemingly inherent irrationality of large groups of people, I don't have high hopes for the future of civilization right now. I'm beginning to think a ""Long Night"" of war, famine and disease lasting centuries is on the table, starting in my lifetime. I have a lot of reasons for thinking this, largely inspired by what I've read from the peak oil crowd, [resilience.org](https://resilience.org) and the likes of John Michael Greer, and Frank Landis's incredible little book ""[Hot Earth Dreams](https://www.amazon.ca/Hot-Earth-Dreams-climate-happens/dp/1517799392)"".

But at the same time, a while back I saw a comment on this sub that implied climate change was actually much more solvable since we're not on the worse-case emissions target. I mean sure, that was one comment, but it got me thinking. I doubt we'll actually prevent a large part of the world desertifying and the attendant migrations and conflicts, but maybe we'll get on top the carbon emission thing this century? Who knows. The future's scary, and I'm only 24.

What do y'all (preferably those who are knowledgeable in the relevant subjects) say? What trajectories do you think are likely?",31,1

Its a widespread that we millennials suffer from on a daily basis. In the future there will treatment courses for this to overcome different types of typo/errors one does while typing. Probably in the near future this might be even related to some sort of dyslexia and hence bracketed as a mental disorder. To dig deep into this research would help show the different possible types of TYPOs people make and hence in the future we might even have specialist doctors for different types of TYPOs, like an emoji typo, vowel typo, etc etc...

&amp;#x200B;

One has to deeply look into the various range and the possible typos that a human being does on an average in a single day. Also with the so many languages present in the current world, different doctors for different language typos is also a foreseeable situation in the near future.

Hope there are no TYPOs in this post.

What futuristic apps could be built but nobody has?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9nogje/weather_apps_in_2018_are_a_wreck_most_are/,cryptoz,1539380666,"There is a lot of talk about weather apps right now, partially because of hurricanes, but also due to outrage over accuweather, and the unpublishing of WT, etc. If you look at the top weather apps I find most of them to be appalling. They almost never attempt a good display of weather data, which is hard; but you'll see entire screen's worth of information to just show empty precip hour by hour. There has got to be a better way to display that information. And often apps will show a 30% chance of precipitation and show a rain icon; but that's misleading since it's likely partly cloudy with a *chance* of rain. I know this can be hard to do, my own weather apps aren't perfect at it, but it's these kinds of improvements we should expect from weather apps today. To be honest the state of weather apps is quite dismal, with some exceptions of course - good weather apps do exist, but there are not many and, in my opinion, they are still not good enough.

A big challenge is to display the right weather data in an easy &amp; fast package to the user. But different people want to see different data at different times, so there are lots of challenges in making just a weather app that displays the same data that everyone else does, but in a better way. It's not easy but there should be more apps trying.

But I don't want to stop there. With how powerful phones are these days and with how many sensors they have it is such a shame that the phones themselves are not contributing to the weather forecast. 

-----


I make [All Clear Weather](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.allclearweather.android) 
 (Android, US-only for now, see below for why) because I demand better of weather apps. Many of the [top weather apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/WEATHER/collection/topselling_free) do nothing but display sometimes-outdated weather data in poorly formatted tables. Frankly the top 20 look exactly the same. I'm making a new weather app because it's 2018 and the category is stagnant. I love the weather and I'm sick of weather apps that don't do anything interesting. Here is what I am passionately dedicated to bringing to a weather app to make it *interesting* and useful at the same time:

1) Your phone probably has a barometer in it! Most Android phones do because Google likes to use it as an altimeter to give you better indoor directions. So with iPhones also having barometers (for the iPhone health app), there are now *billions* of phones around the world are carrying barometers that next to no weather apps are using. Yeah WU and Dark Sky have a toggle, but what does it do? Do they talk about how they are using the sensor data? I don't think so. With All Clear you can at least *see* the sensor data from the weather sensors in your phone and *know* that it is being analyzed and processed into 'virtual weather stations' so it can be eventually included in the main weather models. You'll know this because you'll be able to see it happen in the app as I make progress. Here is a [quick graph I made](https://imgur.com/gallery/IPj6w7N) of Hurricane Florence's pressure recorded by phones in North Carolina a few weeks ago. It may take some imagination to see how the data could be useful (it needs cleaning, privacy protection, quality control, etc) but you can *see* the data in there and I know it can be extracted into useful numerical weather model inputs.

2) All the phones in the world have cameras. These cameras are taking photos of the sky and the weather all day long but nobody is using this data in weather forecasting. That's obviously because it is difficult to extract meaningful numeric weather data from a photo, but I believe it can be done. All Clear has a feature to let users send in photos of the sky with tags, and I am going to use this data as a training data set to a machine learning classifier. If it works, it should be able to automatically tag weather information in *any* outdoor photo - assuming the training dataset is good and my ML is good.

3) Current conditions in a lot of weather apps are out of date, since the source data is out-of-date. A lot of the US MADIS stations update only hourly, and they can miss updating in intervals when significant weather happens. Sometimes they update and sometimes they don't. But I think it's so frustrating to look outside and see it is raining while your weather app just happily denies the existence of that rain and tells you it's just partly cloudy. So I let you fix it, for yourself and for others nearby. If enough people all submit the same weather condition, contrary to the station reports, the app will start showing that condition as the Truth for current conditions in that area. (safeguards built in to protect against cheating).

4) I'm sick of the same UI in all the weather apps. I get that the UI in All Clear isn't perfect yet (it's a new project! and it's a hobby! and I'm not a UI designer!) but I am absolutely going to try new things in terms of *how* the optimal weather data can be displayed to a user to maximize quick-check understanding. It's too easy to be misled by the text, icons, and gridded numbers in most weather apps.

5) I am dedicated to open source. While the whole app isn't open source yet (it will be!) the main sensor code that does the barometric pressure data collection along with other sensors, is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/JacobSheehy/AllClearSensorLibrary). I would encourage other weather app developers to enable features in their apps to aide in the crowdsourcing of potentially very useful weather data that is otherwise idle in phones. 

6) It's in the details. The US NOAA Forecast API that the app uses only returns its text forecasts with F and mi built-in as units. I wrote an algorithm (regexes mostly) to convert the text forecast units on-the-fly so you can be reading it and see it as C and km if you like, it's seamless. Well there is one error I know about, sometimes it will say ""quarter of an inch of rain"" which is a bit of a pain to parse, but I'm working on that too! 

Another detail worth mentioning is the smart retry. During development I discovered that the API returned errors (or didn't return at all) and so rather than just showing the user a failure screen, the API does a nice backoff-retry to try really really hard to get the data for you. And if it can't do that? It knows that probably that forecast office or station is just *down*. So it changes the location parameters a bit and tries again, hoping to catch a different station forecast that would still be relevant to you. I don't have the numbers for how often it fails to load vs. other weather apps (I hope it's not worse!). But I know this: I put in some serious effort to try my best to show you the weather no matter what. On that topic...

7) Another feature of the app is that it does a lot of work to attempt to pick accurate icons. I find that the icons shown in a lot of weather apps are misleading at best when it comes to describing the weather. It turns out that it's really hard to show the user the right weather information in just an icon. So this is the main reason for the animations in the app: to make the visuals more correct and more engaging. There is logic in the app to not show the default icon that comes from the weather API: if it did do that, then a 30% chance of thunderstorms shows you just the thunderstorm icon. Most apps do this. But chances are? The weather will be just partly cloudy, no thunderstorms. So the app shows a partly cloudy animation with a faded, flashing lightning bolt to indicate the probability. Further work is being done in future updates to the app to make this even more accurate.

-----

Alright, there's what All Clear can do that other weather apps can't. Maybe it should be your next weather app but maybe it is missing a critical feature for you. **What's that feature?** What do you need or want in a weather app that nobody is delivering today?
 
All of that above featureset is free by the way. Part of the problem with not enough original and quality weather apps is that they each cost money to run and users are often unwilling to pay. So for All Clear it is free to use all the features of the app; You can pay $1/month if you like to extend the forecasts from 3 days to 6, and extend other features in the app like the number of visible weather pictures (from 10 to 100). The subscription will help pay for the servers that run all the custom weather data code as well as future development of neat weather experiments using smartphone sensors. 

Here's the link to All Clear again: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.allclearweather.android

And a note about it being US-only. I tried to make this international from the get-go, and wasted months using IBM's API from WU that barely worked at all. Then they yanked the payment form off the web the week I was going to publish the app and buy their $400/month package. No longer an option. Now you have to wait for a phone call, might be weeks, and the prices are like $3,000 for the equivalent data (or something, hard to say). If you want to read some of the drama about this, check out this [WeatherUnderground thread](https://apicommunity.wunderground.com/weatherapi/topics/weather-underground-api-changes)  where people are describing the confusion as WU cuts off their keys and makes the service dramatically more expensive.

So the app is using the US NOAA data for free and I am investigating alternatives for international weather data.",22,1

Whenever I read about this thing I think ""spaceship"".

One part of mankind would be excited about learing that we aren't ""alone"" in the universe. We could have a potential new partner to learn from and maybe cooperate with. There's lots of people out there though that fear finding out that there's another civilization. The latter might be because of different reasons: implications about the Great Filter, learning about their potentially violent ways or other terrifying things.

Which camp do you think you are in, and what are your thoughts what could happen?

I for one, I'd be rather optimistic. I definitely see that one we have our positive answer to the question of extraterrestrial life, we have something to start working from. Even if we find that there's a virtually unsurmountable obstable ahead that we can't survive (aka Great Filter), I think it's better to know about it in advance than stumbling upon it by chance. Knowing about that would give us new guidelines that could help us evade problems we otherwise would have run into head-on.

The one thing I fear the most though is how people would react to this. I'd love to know that there would be minimal impact on our lives besides that long-term decision can be made with more knowledge to base the decision on. I expect some opportunistic actions though, and also an unpleasantly heated debate about whether or not and how we even should approach the other civilization. For example, religions and their interpretations of the event most likely are going to be a hot topic. The impact of new technologies and scientific findings from knowledge transfer could be mind-blowing, in a way that would be able to disrupt out social network as humankind.",33,1

http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-skelton-john-cox-gavin-newsom-california-governor-debate-20181011-story.html

&gt; Newsom will concentrate on completing a high-speed rail line from the San Joaquin Valley to the San Francisco Bay Area ...

&gt; Hes optimistic that the line from the San Joaquin Valley to Silicon Valley can be built. That would allow tech workers to live affordably in **Merced or Modesto** and commute to well-paying jobs **near San Jose**.

Observe that Newsom carefully does not even mention Fresno let alone Los Angeles, and that only getting to Fremont would qualify as ""near San Jose"" or to ""Silicon Valley"".

Any link from San Jose to even Fresno needs to tunnel through a mountain range.  Except the choice of tunnel(s) for that route that has been fought over in the courts for years isn't even in the plans anymore.  Again, from the LA Times:

http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-bullet-train-speed-20180729-story.html

&gt; In its 2018 business plan, the [rail] authority deleted construction of a 13-mile tunnel under the Pacheco Pass from its first phase because it did not have enough money. The decision will leave about 80 miles of track in the Bay Area disconnected from 119 miles of track in the Central Valley.

By elimination, the only alternative left is to extend and upgrade what is now the Altamont Corridor Express.

What is also doable is to upgrade Fresno to Stockton, and thus the future high speed rail route from Fresno to the San Francisco Bay Area may well be through Stockton to Fremont.

Since Nixon Shock in 1971, we are a debt driven economy. Productivity grows, labor share of GDP is reduced each year thanks to automation, total hours worked per year too and, because we need inflation to allow GDP growth, we are based on Debt so interest rates could even be negative (hi from EU).

This allows innovation and technological progress to accelerate even more since savings prefer venture capital. But, I wonder if there are limits or not. One day or another we will reach enough productivity to make basic needs almost free (marginal cost near to 0) but this system based on inflation to allow debt to grow GDP would have to put a higher price on them because otherwise you can't survive under the debt that literally gives your wealth a value.

In these circumstances I don't understand how current capitalism can work. Where's the limit? Would we create imaginary value as ""abstract"" as the debt itself? I would love to know...",2,1

We are not so concerned with ""how"" we see something doing what it is doing. We are concerned with ""what"" it seems to be capable of. Now granted that is tons of uniformed beliefs and misunderstandings, but it is also a reason that humans are becoming increasingly uneasy with our technological advancements. Particularly anything that involves ARA (AI, robotics and automation). It is easy for hype to get totally mixed up with fact and make for phantom monsters, but the fact remains that humans are seeing these ""monsters"" approaching now. Whether they are hype or fact starts to no longer matter. 

To an expert what the Atlas is now capable of is a simple, logical evolution of the physics of robotics and computation. But to me it looks like a freaking miracle. And I don't think I am alone. You can correctly argue about how uninformed we are, but when we see things like this, it causes worldwide notice and concern.

And the damndest thing is, this is so not finished. Like Elon Musk stated a year back on that back flip; ""Pretty soon you will need a strobe light to capture it's motion."" Whether that is unhelpful hype or not, doesn't matter. Pretty soon we are going to see another video from Boston Dynamic or even from others, since this level of technology seems to be spreading fairly rapidly that is going to raise the bar yet again over what is fantasy and what is reality. And I stress, we don't care how it's done, we care about what we experience.

Unfortunately its utilization and appliance  had almost only been limited to household spaces. 
On my daily walks I often wonder when the overall cleaning and tidying up process begins. There is so much trash (recycable resources incl. precious metals) all around us, that often looks vastly different to the environment it lays in.
Now there is a new uprise of compact robots that walk, drive or roll around. On the other hand the tech to identify and grab things evolves at an equally fast pace. Equipped with sensors/cameras, electromagnets, grapplers and storage this seems somewhat feasible to me. 
Where is the connection in between those? A machine that moves around and, in a Wall-E like approach, collects trash to bring it somewhere, where it can be cleaned and hopefully upcycled? 
I think its not just a necessity, but could also give hope to the coming generation(s) that we maybe do understand, that we are just part of a cycle. 
So, how long till prices are at a reasonable level to meet speed, functionality and that is not prone to errors? There is money laying around...

Contrary to exaggerated claims from some of these companies, I personally think it's unlikely that AI can actually prevent a school shooting. Even if an accurate detection is made as soon as the gun is drawn, you would still have to bake-in human verification and police response time. 

By then, a shooter likely would have already caused significant damage. 

As an AI enthusiast who is also passionate about researching gun violence, I've been doing some research into this field - I've come across several other interesting companies that the Atlantic didn't mention:

**Athena Security:** Founded by successful serial entrepreneurs who previously exited Revel Systems, an iPad Point of Sale Company for $500M. 

[https://athena-security.com/](https://athena-security.com/)

**Aegis AI:** Started by a US military veteran

[https://www.aegissystems.ai/](https://www.aegissystems.ai/)

**Deep Science:** 

[http://deepscience.ai/](http://deepscience.ai/)

Do you guys think that this technology has a potential to make a difference?

Worth it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9ok3ls/augmented_reality_worth_it/,AsgardiaTeam,1539662324,"Picture a world where everything you think floats in front of your eyes, your shopping list scrolls past in your peripheral vision, and the hazards of the world are highlighted around you. Your heart rate and other vital statistics are observed continuously and shown to you like a heads-up display in a video game.

Of course, we arent quite there yet, but Scope AR is advancing towards that direction.

Scope AR stands out from the crowd because they are trying to find more practical uses for this technologynot just entertainment.

Their first product is called WorkLink. WorkLink is a guided instructions program. It enables workers to see a step-by-step manual of their job as they go about it.

A worker would have a tablet, smartphone, or glasses such as Google Glass or the Microsoft HoloLens and an overlay would appear with digital information on top of the image of their present job. For instance, the program could highlight a bolt, and show the worker how to remove it.

Rather than using paper instructions, this program shows you what to do through rich animated content right on top of the equipment.

Although factories increasingly use the latest smart, connected technologies, human workers are still integral to factory performance. While there are concerns about machines replacing human workers, and indeed this is happening for some jobs, the experience at General Electric and other industrial firms shows that, for many tasks, a mix of humans and machines outperform either working alone.

Wearable augmented reality devices are especially powerful, since they provide the right information at the right time and in the perfect format, directly in a workers line of sight, while leaving workers hands-free so they can work without interruption.

Another company called Streem, which was founded in 2017, also aims to improve home services by offering professionals a faster way to diagnose and quote a customers inquiry through the use of AR via smartphones.

Users can take part in Streems app by streaming HD video of the problem at hand to the professional, who can then use a digital toolbox to take measurements and other notes.

Professionals can guide the conversation with a laser pointer and use arrows anchored to a 3D map of the space. The photos, videos, notes, and data stay saved on the app, which uses Apples ARKit.

Moreover, AR has the power to revolutionize the banking industry by improving customer banking experience, training bank staff, and providing data visualization.

For example, training the banking staff by immersing them in an augmented reality space will allow the team to experience, first hand, how customers engage with the banks services and how their experiences measure up. This could help make AR invaluable to banking.

Plus, there are actually many other industries leveraging the power of AR. For example, an app titled KabaQ currently offers augmented reality which shows highly-realistic 3D models of menu items on the users view of their table, enabling them to see different selections from multiple angles and zoom levels. This app is helping the restaurant industry improve customer experience.

While numerous awards were given to the Gatwick airport passenger app for its innovative use of AR technology. Passengers could use their mobile phones to connect with over 2,000 beacons throughout its two terminals to create AR maps that helped them more easily navigate through the airport. As the app grows, it could help improve traffic flow in the airport.

Lastly, when it comes to crisis such as a natural disaster or a war zone, it can often be hard to have an adequate amount of doctors on site. A doctor with the required skills needed to help in a given situation could be hundreds or thousands of miles away.

Therefore, researchers at Purdue have come up with a new way to circumvent this problem. The answer? An augmented reality (AR) system that could help on-the-ground doctors get expert advice.

This could also help Asgardia as they work toward ensuring the peaceful use of space for everyone, as well as setting up habitable platforms in low-Earth orbit.

Juan Wachs, a professor of engineering at Purdue who led the project team, said in a press statement that the hardest challenge is to offer surgical expertise on the battlefield when it is most needed.

Even without having highly experienced medical leaders physically located in the field this technology can help reduce the number of casualties while maximizing treatment at the point of injury.

Furthermore, TeachAids, a Stanford University spinoff which is known for developing internationally recognized HIV and AIDS education packages, has introduced CrashCourse, a free digital health platform that uses HD and Augmented Reality (AR) to help the learner feel as if they are on the field experiencing a concussion.

Approximately 2.5 million Americans suffer concussions annually, and many are successfully treated within 10 days. However, a growing body of work suggests the lasting effects of a concussion can be harmful, even fatal, which increases the need for better education and treatment procedures.

Thus, their connected care platform has an interactive film, called a brain fly-through that uses Stanford Medicine technology, a concussion symptoms simulator, and clinical information about the signs and symptoms of concussions.

Are you interested in science and technology? Have you ever dreamed of using science and tech to live in space? Then join Asgardia today and turn that dream into a reality!",0,1

You might want to check this out. There appears to be an organization that has just launched a new project they call Virternity.

[https://virternity.com/virternity](https://virternity.com/virternity)

What caught my attention the most about it is the part of the project that pertains to the transfer of human consciousness to a Virtual World where they can live there forever while still being able to interact in the real world as they also have what they call mixed reality. And there's just a lot more that they have to offer. I know it has been discussed multiple times. Mind uploading, digital immortality, mixed reality and all other stuff for human enhancements but this particular one seems to be a combination of all of those. It's pretty convincing in my opinion although of course, I'm a little skeptic. I think it will be great for you to read it yourself then let's discuss about it please.",0,1

'Smart city' technologiescould include, for example,sensors  embedded in roadsto better manage congestion andpollution or new  methods designed to reduce water and energy use. Other technologies  could improve public transport facilities by determining whether more  services are needed at certain times of day.

Smart cities will use blockchain technologies and virtual reality devices.

2. The essential elements of our poetry will be courage, daring, and revolt

3. Literature having until now magnified a pensive immobility, ecstasy, and sleep, we want to exalt the aggressive movement, the insomnia, the double-time march, the somersault, the slap in the face, and the punch

4. We declare that the splendor of the world has been enriched with a new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing car, its trunk decorated with large pipes like snakes with an explosive breath... a roaring automobile that gives the impression it is running on a hail of bullets, it more beautiful than the Victor of Samothrace

5. We want to praise the man who holds the steering wheel, whose ideal column goes through the Earth, which itself is launched in the circuit of its orbit

6. The poet must exert himself with warmth, brilliance, and lavishness in order to increase the enthusiastic fervor of primordial elements

7. There is no beauty except in struggling. No masterpiece without an aggressive character. Poetry must be a violent assault against unknown forces to summon them to lie down before man

8. We are on the extreme promontory of the centuries!... What good is there in looking back as long as we have to bash in the mysterious doors of the Impossible! Time and Space died yesterday. We already live in the absolute, since we have already created omnipresent speed

9. We want to glorify war - the sole hygiene in the world- militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of the anarchists, the beautiful ideas that kill, and a contempt for the female

10. We want to demolish the museums, the libraries, fight moralism, feminism, and all the opportunistic and utilitarian cowardice

11. We will sing the great crowds agitated by work, pleasure, or revolt: the multi color and polyphonic undertows of revolutions in the modern capitals; the vibration by night of the arsenals and the job sites under their violent electric moons; gluttonous railroad stations, wallflowers of smoking snakes; bridges jumping like gymnasts crossing the diabolical cutlery of sunny rivers; adventurous steamships sniffing the horizon; locomotives with their large breastplate, fidgeting on the rails, like enormous steel horses tied up with long pipes; and the gliding flight of the airplanes whose propellers have flapping and flags and clapping of an enthusiastic crowd. It is in Italy that we launch this proclamation of tumbling and incendiary violence, through which we are founding this Futurism because we want to live freely in Italy  from its gangrene of professors, archaeologists, guides and antique dealers. Italy has been for too long been great market of the secondhand dealer. We want to rid it of the innumerable museums that cover it with innumerable cemeteries. Museums, cemeteries... Really identical in their sinister contact of bodies that do not know themselves.&lt;

This is why several enthusiasts and professionals around the world have come together with the purpose of making immortality a reality through VR technology, hence the creation of the Virtual Eternity project (Virternity). You can learn more about this project by clicking on the following link:

A device that can read peoples minds by detecting their brainwaves has been developed in a breakthrough that could eventually enable people with locked-in syndrometo communicate.

The system was only partially effective with a 90 per cent success rate when trying to recognise numbers from zero to nine and a 61 per cent rate for single syllables in Japanese, the researchers said.

But, nonetheless, a statement about the research issued by the Toyohashi University of Technology in Japan said it showed that an effective device to read peoples thoughts and relay them to others was possible in the near future.

They even suggested aneasily operateddevice with a smartphoneapp could beready in just five years.



An electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to monitor peoples brain waves while they spoke.

The brain waves were then matched to the syllables and numbers using machine learning, a process used to develop artificial intelligence.

The statement said the researchers had developed a technology that can recognise the numbers zero to nine with 90 per cent accuracy using brain waves, or electroencephalogram (EEG), while uttering the numbers.

At the same time, 61 per cent accuracy in 18 Japanese monosyllable recognition was achieved, outperforming performance in previous research (humans have sufficient intelligibility of sentences with an 80 per cent monosyllable recognition rate).


The researchers said other attempts to use brain waves to understand peoples thoughts had struggled to understand what was being said.

Up until now, speech-decoding from EEG signals has had difficulty in collecting enough data to allow the use of powerful algorithms based on deep learning or other types of machine learning, the statement said.

The research group has developed a different research-framework that can achieve high performance with a small training data-set.

They now plan to develop a brain-computer interface that can recognise words that are merely thought and not spoken.

This technology may enable handicapped people, who have lost the ability of voice-communication, to obtain the ability once again, the statement said.

It is also expected that the technology would give a healthy person the most natural interface without any limitations as well.


Furthermore, the research group plans to develop a device that can be easily operated with fewer electrodes and connected to smartphones within the next five years.

The statement was released ahead of a conference later this year where the research will be presented in more detail.

Maybe even do it themselves with an at-home kit like 23andme.

We have to as leaving room for everyones opinion leads us nowhere. If we dont Earth will become just another failed planet where oppression has taken a step into the irreversible zone. Now is the only time to make a decisive change the time after the majority of development has been put into place. If we let oppression take it's coarse in the direction it's headed we only have 2 good decades left then earth becomes classified as a planet with irreversible opprestic views no matter how much we wont like it and our children will be forced into the hellsphere that is left by a byproduct of hate, depression, war, terror, corruption &amp; oppression, only being able to clean the problems not fix them.

First we would need 1% of population to join some kind of agreement.

\- This would never happen a pessimist would say, the World is already too corrupt, someone would kill the advisor, but the advisor don't care, someone will just take his place, it's not about the advisor it's merely a symbol of intelligence we have to at least agree on something universally or we will fail and doom will come, come on, advising our governments is that the worst thing that could happen? I think it could only be a possitive light in our hour of darkness, no matter how minuscule it ends up be, and the plebs would finally have a official hub to banter their idiologies at. I'm thinking we have advisor's to advise the advisor &amp; have secretaries to go through the plebs ideas &amp; examinations and forward the more interesting to the advisor's which we will also send to schools around the world to educate our children! Now who decides what is more interesting? Well you shouldn't even be asking that if you read this far, come on we're all people here surely we can all agree on some simple human needs, we don't like being too warm for too long, we prefer to eat at least 3 times a day, we like to have something or people that we love to do with, be it your passion, your circle or your million dollar mansion with all the luxuries invented by man it doesn't matter, my point is if we can't accept we all like the same things, just variables and scream at the  opposing view we are doomed, literally doomed. I once heard the left is like your mother and the right is like your father not as fucking enemies. Live to learn to accept there are things your not qualified to think of but rest assure that at least someone is doing the job.

&amp;#x200B;

Universal Basic Income.

""This certified check guaranteed to everyone in need would only be available for occupants in countries without massive oppression, that would lead to those other countries making changes on their own, they wouldn't wanna be left behind in trades &amp; development or be threatened for war or etc. Some stubborn dictatorships would remain but what are we to do? Who would fund this 1-2 trillion$ a month expense you would ask? Just make new money, or in theory we would have to create a new but also strategically and very simply rule, first we give out to the people then to everything rest.""

&amp;#x200B;

Global Warming.

A.I

Nuclear War

Bio Terrorism

&amp;#x200B;

Please someone make a website called WeThePeople as im completely inept in that area.

Also if you would like to apply for advisor status, I accept anyone at this stage but the task comes without salary for the time being. 

Yes this is a very childish ide i know but do you know? Who cares? 

If this would ever become a reality one advisor isn't the smartest but a high council of some sort is more appropriate. Hearings from all over the world would have to take place with no more than 10 in each hearing, then as a handful of identified good people or great speakers (1 or 5) gets moved into the next step we fill the room yet again with 10 human beings or A.I's, this time we let every participant hear or interpret each of the present candidates previous hearings and keep doing this procedure until there is no doubt the choosen high counclil is worthy. Then we let U.S.A be U.S.A and they will undoubtedly refuse this kind of ide but slow and steady excommunication will take effect and they will agree to this on one condition, they will have the final say. Which to a beginning has one trillion times the positive effect than no collaboration. Every country will have the final say until they agree it's for their own good to have a galactic supervisor, this is a tip from an alien after all.

I think if we don't fix our shit together we're just another simulation and in this one we just argued over trivial things and didn't particullary agree on anything and in practice just banged each others heads with rocks.

Modern civilization is doing almost exactly the same thing. 
One of Easter islands biggest disadvantages was its isolation from other resources. Despite having enough resources to become a thriving civilation able to build monumental statues they eventually ran out. Although it was plausible for them to build ships and travel thousands of miles to a mainland that held trillions of times more resources. By the time is was necessary it was too late. Earth is in a similiar if not more isolated position. While we have enough to thrive and build great things one day we will run out. While we are able to travel into other areas of our solar system, that holds trillions of times more resources in comparison to earth, we only send small ships unable to colonize or mine resources, comparable to a small fishing boat the easter islanders may have built slowly drifting across the unknown. 
As difficult as it would have been for easter island to discover and colonize the south american continent and bring resources back and forth, it would have been similar perhaps easier than colonizing mars and mining asteroids for us. 

When we consider all this its hard to deny our future may hold a similar fate if we do not learn how to colonize space before we need too. ",8,1

1949,2018-10-18,2018,10,18,19,9p7zo4,[SERIOUS] I spent last 3 years developing a fail-safe for AGI/ASI. AMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9p7zo4/serious_i_spent_last_3_years_developing_a/,cooltechpec,1539858207," 

Hi guys, I'm David (webname) and since last 3 years I am working on creating a failsafe in case AGI/ASI backfires on us. I have a business and my life is pretty stable and I'm not a couch potato conspiracy theorist.

Please go through following points to get an overview of what I'm doing. In this post I'm referring AGI/ASI simply as AI for ease.

1. The reason I'm doing this now because the If you compare, my 3 years of work can be analysed and processed by an AI in under 1-10 minutes. So when people say that now is too early for me to worry about this, believe me its not .
2. I can't find any news or info that something or somebody is doing the same work I'm doing. Makes me sad. I don't think a mere 5-10 years of work will be able to control an AI. All everyone is worried about how to make it but nobody is working on what happens after that.
3. There is no proof that the first AI will go berserk. Take an example of cars. When the first car was being made we had problems and as in 2018 we still can get a problem in a new car. So just because you have created something perfect once doesn't mean that you won't get a problem in that in future. Mass manufacturing has its own problems.
4. If/when it become open source like software and apps it will be a huge risk to control what is being created by general populace.
5. You simply can't create something physical to control/neutralize an AI. It will be smart enough to protect itself. Period. AI doesn't resides in a single computer. It resides in cloud/online and has a plethora of hosts to survive. As long as it is in a single unit you can pull the plug but once it comes online you can't do anything possible to control it physically.
6. In last 3 years most of my time is spent on working on laws and paradox and believe me every single law (what you guys think can control an AI) can be broken or backfires upon us. Give me a law and i'll break it and give me a paradox and I'll make it happen.
7. If somehow we are able to modify a predefined law in an AI we are giving that AI an idea that laws can be modified. also modifying a law is considered a threat for an AI .
8. Again. this is not something we can afford to have a defect in it. It's not a car or aeroplane which only affects tens or hundreds of people. Thins thing,if went bad, can mess up millions of people both in present and future. It has to be perfect EVERY SINGLE TIME.
9. Literature and fiction gives us idea to create virus . Please, that's the stupidest thing ever. why do you think an AI will not able to defend itself from a manmade virus.
10. Defence purposes. I don't have to say anything else. It alone breaks more than half of rules and laws scientists are trying to implement in AI
11. Same as with medical (I am still working in this. It is a pretty much safe field but believe me it has its own loopholes).
12. Scientists haven't found a single legitimate reason why the AI should listen to us even if it is benevolent to us.
13. AI learns from people like a human baby. People are generally shit.
14. The only way we can control an AI is via reasoning. Think of a bad AI like a spoiled child but willing to listen to you. If you could be able to make an AI to discuss its ideology and reasons on why it is taking certain actions (which are wrong ACCORDING TO YOU) maybe you can understand its point of view. The first thing is to make the AI listen to you.
15. If you are able to have a conversation with ai in which it agrees to change its actions if proven wrong/inefficient/unfocused the only thing left is to do the same. But it's not that simple. According to what I've read online/books/debates is that an AI can easily process more than 100 years of human thinking in an hour. In addition to that can you provide a solid reasoning to an AI which it fails to comprehend and loses.
16. values,feelings,customs,laws all of them change. what concrete proof can you present to an AI that you are not inferior/equal/superior to it

AI cannot be defeated by means of software and hardware approach. By the time it'll be sentinent it'll be centuries ahead than humans in those fields. The only way you can win this situation is by arguing and discusssing with it and frankly I can't see anyone preparing a case from humans. No one is willing to work on AI Safety. In the name of safety google,FB,BD,HR and other big companies are only implementing hardware and software measures but these are no more worth than an elephant tied with a sewing thread. once he knew how to break it, there will be nothing to control it

I'm creating reasoning/debate/thoughts/solutions/answers/logic/arguments/discussion in the favor of humans. I'm doing it but now I feel alone I's been three years and now i want to share my work. I don't know how to come out in public. How to hare my work with the one who are making AI a possibility. If you guys think whatever I wrote above is true and what I'm doing is an important thing to be done then please xpost this to the right subreddits or tell me subreddits where i should share it.

Just wanted to clear that up because ""transhumanism"" can be vague.

I'm looking for some opinions. At the moment, I see two major venues for significantly extending our lifespan/becoming immortal:

Biological means (namely, finding ways to repair damage. see: https://leapsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_0320-e1517337063558-1600x1023.jpg)

AND

Trans-humanism, i.e. integrating machines into our bodies to overcome biological barriers (ex. brain-computer interfacing, the central motive of Neuralink).

It will likely be a combination of these two things that result in any drastic increase in lifespan. But one thing to note is that the scene for ""curing aging"" is much farther along than the trans-humanism scene. Is trans-humanism likely to be an option to the general public within 20 years? 50 years?

Any opinions are welcome.",11,1

To this date, we have undergone changes that have adapted and geared us to the environment we live within. To throw away or degrade the progress of natural selection with ""a little implant here"" or ""maybe I'll cut of my limbs for stronger robotic ones"" seems morally questionable to me at the very least.

Now don't get me wrong, I love how much technology helps humanity on a day to day basis. Numerous medical advancements and technical marvels have seen our health and standard of living soar over the past couple of centuries. However, I have had no qualms with these advancements because of one simple thing, the ability for people to disassociate with technology at any given time. This mostly remains true today. Sure, having my phone in my pocket when I'm out and about has its advantages, but I don't *have* to have it around with me, I have the option of leaving it at home.

#Hunanity

In a future of cybernetics (part my dystopia), people won't have the ability to disconnect themselves from the technological realm, because technology will become part of you. The reason I take issue with this is because I see it as a slippery slope into humanity becoming less... well, human.

I think it is important for us to preserve our humanity for a few reasons. Firstly, don't people take pride in being human? We are precious, because we are the only intellectually advanced species that we know of. We are able to think and feel, we can empathize with people, we can taste good food, we can be intimate with our lovers. Trading our flesh and bones for a cold hard shell means we won't be able to enjoy those things nearly as much as we can in human form. And what of our brains? Our brains collectively possess more processing power than even the world's most powerful computers. To trade our brains for a cybernetic one would be wasting the full potential that the natural hunan brain has. With that all said, I will conclude that humanity and technology are of equal value, slightly in humanity's favour, and so think it immoral for us to trade our biological existence for a cybernetic one. I'm aware that today many people already possess primitive medical implements or prosthesia. I don't resent these people, but wish there were alternatives. I am however against things like tattoos and piercings, makeup, hair dye etc, because I feel they pollute the human form.

About those ""alternatives"". Two things I am enthusiastic about in terms of futurism is generic engineering/gene therapy and nanotechnology, as well as biological medical science. I am quite the supporter of organ donation because I think it is more natural and less risky for patients than mechanical organ transplants, cell culture has been used to grow new organs and produce meat for consumption, but I still think it needs alot of research, and in the long run I think it would make things like prosthetics and organ donations obsolete. I see the potential for genetic engineering to massively improve both infant and adult health, as well as extend our lifespans beyond our imagining. Nanotechnology could do neat things like kill off disease, repair our bodies, and maybe even give us cool abilities previously confined to sci-fi movies (look up utility fog). These things don't or wouldn't degenerate our humanity or interfere with it, but instead enhance and improve it. Because, while we may not be able to sever ourselves from biological changes or nanobots, they wouldn't be noticeable enough to have a significant negative impact, we'd still be very much human, albeit vastly improved.

#Nature and the world around us

Our current socioeconomic activities are very much unsustainable. Not just in terms of greenhouse gas emissions or pollution, but also because of a third factor: land usage and the destruction of natural environments.

Current development methods of urban sprawl, slash and burn, and ill thought out excavation operations among other things like mass deforestation, have led to the destruction of much of our world's habitats, and well as it's natural beauty. Yet, we continue to paint the world grey and brown little bit by little bit.

Nature is the thing that propegated our existence. If we were to destroy the environment that spawned us, we would soon follow. Because nature gave us life, it has inherent value, and thus we must preserve it, even at the cost of economic ventures. We should also take measures to restore many areas of the world to their natural state via reafforestation and such. Technology and AI can aid us in this mission.

Imagine how upsetting it would be for someone to grow up and not know what a tree looks like, or be aware of the wildlife they share this planet with. According to the biophilia hypothesis, when we feel a connection with nature we are happier and more relaxed, and so we must understand that nature is highly beneficial to our wellbeing and is thus well worth preserving, preferably in abundant quantity.

There are vari ways we can preserve land and reduce our urban footprint. We can make cities more vertical, and we can meticulously plan them with a set carrying capacity in mind. Instead of expanding cities in relentless sprawl, we could calculate the right time to develop new city systems for people to live in. These cities wouldn't be dull and grey like many today, instead we would opt for a more biophilia design, integrating an abundance of nature within a population hub. We could also introduce different types of fauna into these environments, so that humans and animals can live in coexistence.

I'm not advocating some misanthropic, luddite, primitivist worldview, I love humanity and the progress it has made. I just think that we should employ a philosophy of having a symbiotic relationship between nature, humanity, and technology. With each benefiting the others, as long as the ability to freely associate and disassociate still remains.

I see the beauty and value in humanity and nature, which is why while I understand the benefits of technology, the aforementioned are worth keeping a tight hold onto.

Some tribes in Papua New Guinea even considered heterosexuality sinful. However, in all those societies, people still married and had sex with individuals of the opposite sex, in order to ensure the continuity of their societies. 

Nowadays, with the advances in science, we can make babies without any sex involved in the process. Someday we may even reach the point of being able to allow same-sex couples to have babies that are genetically linked to both parents. Aka the element that prevented the development of a fully gay (or at least close to that) society is absent nowadays.

I think it would be nice to have a country to which people all over the world could move, provided that they were LGBT. Of course straight children of gay couples would still be citizens. And I know a country would be 'too big' and very difficult to implement, so maybe we could start with a city.

I'm a junior in college. I was always interested and obsessed with the concepts of space, astronomy, etc. growing up. I started college majoring in Physics, but decided the math was too stressful for me. I've taken physics and astronomy courses in high school and college. I always excelled in astronomy; physics classes went OK; but when it came to high-level calculus, I started to shut down. So I switched my major to Political Science, which was another side hobby of mine. Eventually I decided I didn't want to pursue careers there, so I made a 3rd switch to **Geography**.

So now I'm a Geography major and I'm committed to finishing college with that. I'm studying GIS (Geographic Information Science) and Physical Geography, and I also have a Political Science *minor*. 

I consider myself to be a very deep thinker; I'm not like most people my age. I'm normal on the outside but passionate about science and philosophy deep within, and I really want to spend my life contributing to something big in the fields of science, technology, civilization etc.

My two huge ""hobby"" interests are **1) Expanding human civilization beyond Earth, and 2) Artificial Intelligence.**

Since I decided not to study Astrophysics in college and settled for Geography instead, I don't expect to be able to have a career in astrophysics...and I'm not sure I'd like it anyway, because even though I love the concepts, a certain amount of math just brings me down. I'm more naturally geared towards communication and philosophical thinking rather than mathematics. And when it comes to AI...I know nothing about it except what we see from movies and what we read online, but I'm super interested in the concepts of it, including the idea of being able to transfer our consciousness to other units when our physical bodies are ready to die.

But these two big ""ideas"" are still extremely important to me and I want to figure out how I can get myself into some kind of field that deals with one of them, or both. My adviser told me she knows Geographers who work for NASA doing work with Mars and other planets. She says just as we do mapping and imagery and physical geography of Earth; we do it with Mars and other celestial bodies, too. So that's cool.

Are there any other career areas that will allow me to somehow contribute to either space exploration or AI being a geographer? I'm kind of stressing out and I'm worried about the future and what kind of work I can find. My high school astronomy teacher told me that she sees me ""doing something that doesn't even exist yet."" Do you think there will be future careers that don't really exist yet that I could be geared for? Thanks for your help in advance.",5,1

Children being born this year, theyll go into our current education systems across the world, and by the time they exit them, its going to be the year 2039 (assuming they go to Uni for 3 years until theyre 21, which I think is the most likely scenario).

And it made me wonder what kind of world, what kind of environment, what kind of society theyd be leaving education to join. What would the job market be like for them? What would the world look like to them? What new memes and trends will come about that we wont understand but make perfect sense to them?

Obviously it would be silly to ask everyone to try and predict the future, but Im wondering, given current trends, where on those lines will we be in 2039? For example, in the year 2039, the global population will probably be around 9 Billion. That sort of thing.",10,1

Can you pin down what is certain in that domain in the next decade?
Now this is a whole different level of crazy. But I think I can see a pathway that will lead to it.
To begin with, no one single technology will bring human minds to a substrate like ""San Junipero"". But I believe that a convergence of technologies will certainly lead in that direction. 
This is not a 5 to 10 year thing. I truly believe that even thinking exponentially it would take fundamental new discoveries, technologies and insights to bring to fruition. So more like within the next 50 years I would say. Possibly around 30 years, but even for me that is super pushing it.
That may seem like forever, but bear in mind that 50 years, heck even 100 years is a drop in the bucket of time against the backdrop of the pageant of human history to this point. Which is roughly 10,000 years. And only about 7,000 years of that is recorded human history. Yes, there was lots of humans before 10k years ago but that time is considered one form of paleolithic or other. First true evidence of a ""city"" in Turkey is dated to about 10k years ago.
Anyways I always end up giving these asides to give you insight into what I am talking about and give you some perspective. Before you go on, read this.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4k8q2b/is_the_singularity_a_religious_doctrine_23_apr_16/d3d0g44/
OK, so now I will see if I can make up some kind of method of advancing all this lol! Before we can do anything, we need to understand how thoughts form and are merged with other thoughts to form a sort of timeline of memory. Because that is what consciousness is--sensing and then remembering. Overlayed on these memories are all kinds of novel synthesizations of new thoughts that we do not understand at all how that occurs. This is how we go from memories to deriving future intentions be they the motivation to pick up the coffee to drink or mentally simulating the extinction of humans at the hands of EI (emergent intelligence) with terminators and stuff.
So you can see we have our work cut out for us here. Now we are shortly going to have functional general quantum computers. This is important because there is a hypothesis that I am told is gaining increasing validation that consciousness of any animal that has consciousness, to include humans, could well have a quantum mechanical infrastructure. How you could have this at body temperature in a wet environment is beyond me, but that's what they say. My point is that the general quantum computer will figure largely in this path. But we don't even for sure have general quantum computers today. But I think in less than five years we might.
The next thing is our development of material science. Specifically nanotechnology. So the human brain is made of atoms and inanimate matter is made of atoms. Basic physics says the concept is sound, but the devil is in the details. How you would manufacture or even conceive of a ""substrate"" that could effectively and comfortably hold my ""mind"" and still keep it intact so I could have fun all the time in my virtual universe is not something we can accomplish today. This to me is the 50 year part. But maybe I am just not thinking exponentially enough and we might suddenly come up with something in 20 years. This sort of thing happens a lot when you begin to exponentially think.
There is more writing coming....

Here are a couple of examples of humans, very smart humans, failing to think in an exponential manner. The outcome is surprise. Stunned surprise. Because exponential thinking is counter-intuitive. Think of it as a form of ""magical thinking"". Some might call it ""detachment from reality"" lol!
https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7l8wng/if_you_think_ai_is_terrifying_wait_until_it_has_a/drl76lo/
So let's see. Where am I at now... Understanding consciousness. Oh how limited my definition was! What about emotions? Why do we ""get"" humor and laugh empathetically when we do get it? What on Earth is going on when we dream? Why is something ""beautiful or repellant"" to us. I'm going to say that beauty represents the solid concept of health and good mating material or safe places and repellant equals bad health and dangerous places. Although tornadoes and volcanoes are both dangerous and beautiful so hard to pin down isn't it. 
Oh another thing about our thoughts is not just a substrate but how we would actually think as a substrate based mind. Wet brains need electro-chemical actions to move information from one neuron to another. More complicated stuff to consider.
Now another aside--sort of. Humans are ungodly clever creatures even without any AI. This electro-chemical business. We may think of a workaround.
Still more writing to come...

We need to have improved understanding of brain, mind and whatever consciousness is, we need better computing, we need advance in materials science and how some of that would apply to facilitating electro-chemical interactions between man-made ""neurons"" that we are somehow copied onto.
The good news is that in every one of these arena we are making incredible progress. We have probably learned within the last 2 years more than all of our combined knowledge of these technologies in all of human history up to those last two years.
And because of accelerating change--
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change
Things are probably gonna go faster in the next 5 years.
I have left out one very important development so far. The interface. Well, we can't even conceive how to interface as of today. Like I said the path is not precisely straightforward. Technologies will probably have to synergize each other as well. You may have heard of the Elon Musk innovation called the ""NeuroLink"". I think it was called that. Something close I'm sure.
Anyways the point of the neurolink is to allow our minds to link to a computers processing ability or perhaps the information on the internet. Did you see that one show called ""Intelligence"". It got cancelled at the end of it's first season, but it showed terrific imagination about what might happen with successful linking of the human mind with like computers and the internet and stuff. ""Stuff"" being classified files, databases and tons of security cams. I thought it was a pretty good show, I was sorry to see it go. Plus I thought that girl bodyguard was really hot.
So I have not heard too much about what has been occurring with neuralink lately, but some other things that are tangentially related to neurolink are in the news. We are beginning to learn how to use our technology to enable our minds to control things now. Things like prosthetics and third arms. And cursors on screens and finger of another human being many miles away. I think he was many miles away. But the technology appears to me to be also leaping ahead. The first third arm was a mind controlled arm by a woman who was a quadriplegic. And she straight up had a surgical implant in her head with cables and the whole nine yards. But then I see this video from a couple of days ago where a young lady is playing the piano I think but she has like a shower cap with some doodads on it and she is apparently using her thoughts to bring a drink with a straw to her mouth. The quadriplegic lady did that too, but she needed an implant. So I see things improving in way.
More writing coming!...

I just have one final thought about this. So we are all excited about coming up with a way to move the human mind to a non-living substrate, so we can have bodies like robots that can walk around bare in space. But the thing about all of these technologies is that they also lend themselves to external AI development as well. I'm not saying things could go wrong, just to keep a weather eye out on things. EI is not wanted.
In the year 2028 the progress will be.
Greatly improved understanding of the workings of the human brain, mind and maybe even consciousness.
Substantial advancements in materials science to include nano-technology.
Massively improved computing processing speed and data capacity. What comes after an exa-scale computer? Probably that in the year 2028.
Quantum computing, which is really the wildcard here. Mixing quantum computing with AI development and BMIs could unleash one hell of a demon on humanity. Careful.
VR and the BMI itself. I would predict by the year 2028 that the BMI would allow humans to interact with certain devices because of massively improved sensitivity in the BMI cap itself. How miniaturized this would be in 2028, I'm not sure. Everything tends to miniaturize though.
Implants. By the year 2028 surgical implants in the brain may restore memory to neurodegenerative disease patients and could possibly be used to enhance memory in humans that are otherwise normal. To me that would be a step in the direction of making our minds work more like a computer. But can we turn that kind of thing on and off.
How much will it ultimately change us?

They could use machine sort all the mail (instead of partially) to reduce the amount of people needed. 

I love my job though and I'm kind of a man out of time in that I really wish it was 1977 because I could do this job forever.

Do you agree with my pessimistic viewpoint? How long do you think before most of my job is automated? if you were going to study something 'futureproof' over the next 3-5 years outside your current job with a goal of being employable in a new field by then, what would you do?

*I originally posted this in /r/SimulationTheory and /r/Philosophy but thought I'd share here as well. Sorry if this isn't substantiated through enough logic, academically high level enough, or relevant. This is my first time visiting this subreddit and this is the story of one of the deepest thoughts I'd ever had thats got some decent backbone to it in my opinion. Enjoy.*

To begin,

A few weeks ago my mind took me on a logic expressway that I can't stop thinking about so I feel a strong need to type this out and express this.

I have always been someone who entertained the idea of us being in a reality that is not ""base"" reality. Never really thought about it other than the occasional deep conversation with friends and definitely had no concrete thoughts or opinions about the theory until recently. Never particularly religious either. I would classify myself as more of an Agnostic. During this excerpt I, in my opinion, do not make absolutely ridiculous radical claims or assumptions that are so far gone that provide no philosophical backbone to backup this concept so thats why I feel this is important. Some thoughts may be out there and youve probably never thought about them but everything is totally reasonable so be prepared. Share with me if you disagree with anything when reading, but in my eyes this is pretty logical and I would actually say likely if you follow the train of thought through the entire process.

When reading this its very important to be focused and paint a picture in your mind. This is a long one so sit back and relax. Be prepared for some pretty deep thought. Dont skim or skip to the end as it will make less sense. Hours were spent writing this in order to accurately and effectively portray the idea even though my writing is probably not the best.

How this theory was formed:

The idea originally came to me as I was laying in my bed alone one Saturday afternoon as I had just gotten decently high (I know- clich, but bear with me).

My thoughts took a journey as they normally do and I started to philosophically ponder. I'm a very numbers oriented, black and white type of guy so I enjoy getting my brain into abstract thought when I can.

To get to the concept I need to let you know how I arrived there so you can follow the same thought journey that I did.

I somehow began to reflect on how far the human race has come the past tens of thousands of years and where we are going. Theorizing about future developments in technology is what really got this all started. Where is the human race going to be in 1,000 years? 10,000? 1,000,000? It is safe to say, no matter the future, one thing that is for certain is that we have made incredible steps from being similar to other animals to where we are today. Think about it. Its absolutely magnificent. We have gone from painting pictures with blood on cave walls to developing shelter with sticks and leaves. Homo Erectus discovered fire utilization ~300,000 to 1 million years ago and began to cook. Doing simple animal things was no longer enough and we were beginning to rise. Using weapons to hunt, forming thought and beginning to create new technology was the critical turning point for our common ancestor. The path of the evolution of human intelligence has taken roughly 7 million years. It was slow and steady but it was gaining traction. Obviously, the biggest thing that set us apart from animals as we were developing as a species was our mind. We began to reason, theorize, and form ideas. Overall, the first key to comprehending this piece of the puzzle is that humans have made absolutely incredible leaps over time. Look at where we are today. We have technology that allows us to look at atoms, explore space billions of lightyears away, send humans to the moon, and analyze almost limitless data for our benefit. The leaps are remarkable.

The second key to understanding this puzzle of a concept is that we make progress exponentially faster. We keep moving faster and faster and more leaps in technology are occurring in shorter periods of time. It took hundreds of thousands of years to go from basic fire utilization to farming food in small tribes, crafting blades, and using foresight to plan for life events ~10-20,000 years ago. From there we went to creating cities and the technology gets a bit more advanced. 10,000 years or so pass and we are having more complex creations. Religion becomes present. We begin writing and utilizing more and more sophisticated language. Now only thousands of years pass and we enter into an era of humans physically similar to modern day around 1000-5000bc. In this period humans are beginning to become drastically separated from animals and our progress is showing in full force. Cities are made with governments, roads and aqua-ducts built; prisons and slavery used. Pyramids and great structures are created. Art becomes more prevalent. As you can see, we are beginning to move at a much faster pace. As time moves closer to present day only 1 or 2 thousand years ago from 0 AD - 1000 AD there are fully functioning countries with trade, war, forms of communication across the globe; printing and gunpowder are being developed, medicine that actually works is beginning to move into effect. The creations that we make are happening more rapidly and having much more impact. Hundreds of years pass. Almost present day only 200-500 years ago. Mighty ships sail the sea. Buildings and homes flood landscapes and the human race is booming. Finance becomes so much more complex. We begin to have real and accurate understanding of concepts such as space and time. Science is kicking into high gear. Sure, in addition to these progresses there are serious setbacks such as disease, poverty, and war but we work to overcome them. We identify issues and we terminate them. We fix problems and we are damn good at it. Two countries disagree and are at war? Use a treaty to come to an agreement with terms that benefit both parties as opposed to smashing heads like Neanderthals. The progress and problem solving is moving so much faster now. Fast forward to the last century and the light bulb is invented, cars, even more advanced medicine and science. Human lifestyle is changing so much and becoming so much easier and advanced. Only decades following the invention of the lightbulb we have highly advanced computing that can create and crack encryption. We go to the moon. Satellites float into space to retrieve data about the universe. Refrigeration is used to keep food fresh and the television is introduced. The 1900s allow for insane development. Now we get to a period of today. In the past 20 years we have taken computers from a now ancient technology used for email and internet to mobile devices that allows us to compute massive amounts of information and have access to literally almost any piece of non-private information ever documented within seconds. I have X,Y, and Z symptoms? Oh, okay I most likely have this issue with my body and need to take these steps. Boom, information found within 30 seconds. Just decades ago, heavy computational data processing was limited to technology companies and research groups with plentiful resources. Now almost any person in a first world country can compute data at higher levels than we could then. Google, Amazon, NASA, SpaceX, medical research groups, and other entities are now performing projects and making discoveries that we literally cannot wrap our heads around because of how complex it is. We are now beginning to discover how dark matter works, whatever the hell that is. The Large Hadron Collider accelerates atoms to 99.99% the speed of light so we can observe the quarks and gluons that make up the neutron particle. Genetics companies create strands of custom DNA code that then create living organisms. Google is on the verge of creating a sentient artificial intelligence that surpasses the collective intelligence of all humans combined. Our energy is becoming more efficient, war is diminishing, poverty is at the lowest level of all time. We now focus some of our effort on almost trivial problems that we wouldn't have even thought of existing 10,000 years ago such as social media harassment and how far away the nearest Starbucks is instead of having to deal with things like dying from pneumonia when youre 30 or walking miles to hunt for food. The world generally has gotten exponentially better over time as we see more and more progress being made. Legitimate and serious talks have begun about moving humanity off Earth and beginning to colonize another freaking planet. We have progressed SO much that we are getting concerned about jobs because there is not enough work for humans to do. That concept is actually unreal. We are so far advanced... that the societal and economical need for people to work and perform tasks in order to achieve further progress is being eliminated because we have creations that do it for us.

As you can see, the progress that is occurring every day is becoming more impactful and more frequent. That is just a fact that we can all agree on. There are no signs of slowing down, sure we are going to continue to have hiccups but the rate at which we are moving; living conditions keep getting better and better by the year in terms of access to basic resources, poverty rate, war, death from disease, infant mortality rate etc. etc. and that is just a fact. All of these things keep getting better statistically other than ONE very important thing... happiness. Humans today are shown through research to be getting more sad and depressed than ever before even compared to thousands of years ago which is really quite interesting but I'll circle back to that later.

So, we can agree that things keep getting crazier and crazier in terms of our development correct? That is the second key point into understanding this concept which I am going to get to. Just wait. Again, you have to follow the train of thought. I dont just want to hit you with it all at once.

As the first key was our proven past progress of the human race, the second being the exponential growth factor of that progress, the next key is the future. After I thought about the developments we made and how they got more intense with greater impact with diminishing interval frequencies I thought where is this going to take us? Surely there are no signs of this stopping. Other than a highly unlikely event happening such as nuclear war, volcanic eruptions worldwide, or a deadly asteroid etc., there are zero signs of this stopping. Its fair to say that humanity collectively, assuming an event like the ones listed dont occur, will always progress further to better our living conditions and to explore the cosmos. Its in our DNA to do this. We are problem solving and progress machines. Short-term progress may be hindered by general problems we have today such as income inequality, global warming or political tribalism but over the long-term, progress and better conditions always prevailed and will always prevail. There were critical problems that every one of our ancestral generations faced like the black plague, world wars where tens of millions of people died, volcanic winters, economic depressions etc. Humans made headway and figured it out. Single issues such as these will not stop us from moving forward especially if we have more resources than ever before. With that being said where are we headed?

As youve seen by now, going from utilizing fire and blades to the lightbulb took ~10,000 years, from the lightbulb to the internet ~100 years, from the basic internet browsing to analyzing DNA and literally creating our own organisms it gets blurry but maybe 10 or 20 years. These are obviously general examples chosen using a non-scientific approach but you get the point. If we look ahead 10,000 years and compare it to now are we currently doing the equivalent of just playing with sticks and burning wood? The technological progress we are capable of cannot be put into words or conceptualized by us. You probably just glanced over that sentence but I want you to really take a step back and think about it. Seriously. The things we will do over the next thousand or ten thousand years will be so complex and advanced that you actually cant even comprehend it. Artificial intelligence will cause a huge spike in progress. We will have complete technology integration into our lives. Poverty and starvation will most likely not exist. Very few people will die from disease. Complete world peace. Theres no telling where we are going to go. Remember, at the rate which we are moving. Where humanity is at modern day with our medicine breakthroughs and satellite data transmission is the equivalent of playing with fire and just starting to build tools compared to thousands of years from now. Absolutely incredible isnt it? Again, assuming nothing unlikely happens to us in the semi-near future like an asteroid or solar flare that toasts us all in 2 seconds you would say we are not going extinct or having half the population killed off in the next few thousand years, correct? Humanity has lasted hundreds of thousands of years, basically millions, so it seems highly unlikely we would be killed off in the next few thousand years with more resources, people, and problem solving capability than ever before.

So, if we are going to be here for another couple thousand years and we are already talking about colonizing Mars you better be damn sure we are leaving Earth. Crazy thing is, once we have a significant enough population leave Earth that is not just a colony but a real chunk of people that can grow on their own and support themselves humanity is unstoppable. There is nothing that can kill us. Bold statement you might say but think about it, any problem on Earth will now not pose a threat to humanity once we get a population out in Space. Right now, we are not able to predict any future problems or say but well what if- because any hypothetical non-nature problem literally will not exist. Any problems that arise in the future do not conceptually exist to us yet and we are unable to think of them. Any and all problems will most likely be solved swiftly. Its safe to say humans will definitely have multiple chunks of people out and about over the next 5-20,000 years that share Earths exact same technology. This may sound crazy but think about it there are things that will occur and discoveries that will happen that we mentally cannot comprehend right now. Anyone that dismisses anything as impossible need to remember the people throughout history that were absolutely downright positive that the Earth was flat. Humanity and its progress will spread through space like a wildfire. Our solar system in particular is stable for the next, I dont know, at the absolute minimum next several million years if not billions of years, correct? If we get out and about in the solar system Earth will most likely be fine but IF it happens to not be, we are tens of thousands of years down the line colonizing other places and spreading out so humanity is safe. (If Earth remains safe and ay-okay, there may be less incentive to colonize but either way, humanity still is proceeding). So when we get to the point of moving around our solar system thousands of years down the line we are scot free. This will allow for millions upon millions of years of progress before having to come up with a solution for getting out of the path of our own Suns supernova or similar species-ending catastrophe. Humanity will most likely be spread out so far that even if one population is destroyed the progress continues. If there happens to be other life in the universe we can figure it out because we are millions of years farther advanced than right now, this isnt a sci-fi movie where any alien is an enemy. The universe is ours, we now own it. Our descendants will probably not even consider themselves human at this point due to evolution and technological synapses. Humans will still be exponentially progressing and problem solving as its in our nature but for millions of years on end.

I have to be careful in how I word things at this point. I need to be vague because I obviously dont know what we are going to be doing exactly and anything that we will be doing probably doesnt exist yet. Crazy, but true. As the species progresses we still face roadblocks that we problem solve to get out of. Due to it being in our DNA to progress and create better lives for ourselves. The progression continues and continues and continues and continues and continues. Later, the species is all over space doing who the hell knows what. So as progress happens, we are safely allowed to continue what we are doing for hundreds of millions of years You think we made progress from 10,000 bc to now? Imagine hundreds of millions years of exponential growth. Life itself would not even be recognizable to today. Any resource shortage, any problem that arises, anything at all we fix it. Nothing is stopping us. We are so powerful due to advancements our civilization is now universal. Things will be discovered that we think are impossible now. We are so powerful that we can actually change the laws of physics in some cases. Rules do not apply to us anymore. We are so widespread and advanced with so few problems that the only thing stopping progress and advancement would be figuring out everything there possibly is to know ever in the history of everything. This is the third key to determining where the theory is going. First was our past advancement, second is our exponential growth factor, third key is what it means when we are advanced millions of years from now and moving forward potentially billions of years later.

The likelihood that humans are still alive in millions of years is, Im going to say it and you may disagree but, very high. We will be alive in a much different state that we dont understand now. Again, bear with me, I never want to sound outlandish or make radical claims so some stuff youre about to read may sound crazy but we are talking about tens and HUNDREDS of millions of years worth of advancement here. Potentially anything and everything has been discovered. It is possible that there is nothing left for us to progress with. We could have all of the information. Ever. Even if we dont we are still so powerful we can do nearly anything we think of. This means that we or whatever entity that we become as a human race is pretty much all powerful. If we figure everything, or nearly everything, out and can do literally anything we want without breaking the most basic rules of logic we are masters of the universe and it is our playground. As time progresses, the universe is under our command and its up to us to be in charge. We are so far advanced whenever this may be if its 1 million 5 million or 500 million years from now it doesnt matter, the fact is, its most likely going to happen. Problems in the universe dont exist anymore. Everything is as good as it possibly can be. We or the entity that we become can re program the universe itself. Our being is no longer that of a physical human or even physical at all because it is not as efficient as possible. Travel will be limitless through space AND time. Our technological advancement allows us to exit this 3 dimensional reality and reach the 4th dimension outside of time itself, which physicists think may already be possible. Inhabiting the 4th dimension is achieved and we view the universe like a long fish tank with the big bang on left and present day on the right and anything point in space or time is accessible like so: https://imgur.com/a/ebTdWGP Being outside of space and time gives us access to do things to the universe that dont make sense to us. Dimensionality is beyond what we understand as present day humans. Since everything is perfect and we figure out all problems in this new universe we create, time means nothing and our existence now occurs forever. There is no end. When all energy in the universe is equally distributed and all the stars are burnt out trillions of years from now, our descendants will be in this 4th dimensional perfect universe. This perfect universe and space outside of time itself where we can be eternally happy has no before or after it just is. Always. Being that we have created this perfect scenario where we are all powerful, so is our decision making ability. We condition ourselves so our ethics are unmatched, we always know the true and right thing to do through calculations. As people/consciousness we are infallible, we have no imperfections in morals. Who are we now? What is our meaning? We are all powerful. We can change and do anything we want like create life, create nature, create true and real happiness, create solar systems, create universes. At this point we are so advanced in a way you cant wrap your head around that we are perfect and have all of the power in the universe. We, or the thing that allows us to do these things, has no human traits and no human characteristics anymore, so, what in the hell is this all-powerful, timeless, morally perfect being that we have become or created? The answer is God we become or create God.

And what is the timeless perfect universe that we just created that we have total control over where all problems are solved? Thats Heaven. We become or create God and God creates Heaven, and because we have control over/live outside of time we are Eternal. We are always and forever existent at every point in time. There is no beginning and no end to us because we are so advanced we live outside of time and have control over it. As we are now God or responsible for the creation of God, an all-powerful entity that can create universes and lives outside of time, he has been here since the beginning. God created us because he is living outside of our 3-D fish tank where we are constrained by time. But this means not only did God create us in the 4th dimension outside of time, we also created him inside of this 3 dimensional universe, we just havent done it yet. We created God and subsequently the universe. Which makes no sense to us right now but thats okay because at the same time weve also already created it just not in this dimension. We need to create God and God needed to create us for anything to exist at all. Its a symbiotic relationship. If we exist then God is created, if God exists then we are created, hence, why there isnt just nothingness in our 3 dimensional universe- because there cant be. God lives outside of space/time and always exists, which means we are getting created guaranteed. And if we are getting created guaranteed, so is God. So what is this path that we are currently undertaking in the year 2018 on Earth? What is the meaning of all of this? Why do we exist? The craziest thoughts about the true meaning behind mankind have always puzzled everyone at one point or another. The old aged question of how did we get here and why is life real. So whats the answer? Well, this life were living right now; the things we do every day like wake up a and go to work, make a living to further ourselves, grow as people, experience living a conscious and sentient life, is just the story of how God was created. We are living in the story of how God was created.

As everything in this future universe is incredible and we have created a timeless masterpiece where everyone can experience true eternal happiness, there is no sense in keeping people out of this heaven. As all powerful super advanced God(s) we/they can go back in time and extract peoples consciousnesses who have already died to bring them to this incredible place. You, me, your dad, mom, other family, everyone. Due to the fact that God is all powerful they know exactly what needed to have happened in the past for this heaven of a universe to be created. God knows that humans needed to progress using technology and advance further in order to achieve this and the best incentive for progression is adversity. If there were no problems to solve then we would not move forward as a species so there NEEDS to be peril, death, war, famine etc. God and the heaven would not have been created without it as there would have been no need to advance further. No lightness without darkness. However, God, with all power and carefully calculated correct morals want everyone to act morally and progress through any adversity the correct way as opposed to immorally. So for your consciousness to be brought to this amazing universe that future humanity has created when you die, God wants you to act as pure as possible in your life on Earth. One, because their morals are correct and want to see everyone act correctly for everyones benefit, and two, perhaps so one bad apple does not sabotage the system and ruin the Heaven. The whole point of life in this story of how God and heaven were created is just to get there for yourself. God realizes there is famine, death, war, and hardships so he longs for it to be as easy as possible via everyone acting as morally and correctly knowing the struggles people will face on Earth. Your life is the pre-qualifying round. God is all powerful but leave you with your decision making ability, or, free will to make good or bad choices that will show the true nature of your consciousness. There has to be an incentive for people to act as morally as possible to get to Heaven. God cant just let everyone in. If no one had an incentive to act morally knowing they go to heaven anyway then many just wouldnt do it, thus, making it a much harder time on Earth and potentially hindering the process of the creation of God and Heaven.

How will people know to act morally? God cant just bring them all here to show them and cut all their lives short because then the human race wouldnt have created the Heaven. Even if the humans have definitive proof of the heaven, that would cause too big of a butterfly effect and cause progress to stop as people just long for the afterlife with no care for the present day adversity. The humans need to be shown there is hope, but not definitive proof. They need to have faith that this heaven exists, most of the time without actually seeing it or being there. How does God inform them about this Heaven so they are still motivated enough to achieve creation of it as well as act perfectly? When God will first contact the human race he is aware that due to a lack of advancement, no one is able to act perfectly but if he can tell youre trying and not a horrible person then you can come to this perfect place. God also has to ensure quality progress necessary for the creation of Heaven and himself so he must send a message to humans that praises fulfillment of Earthly duties such as hard work, acting morally, not questioning suffering, and spreading the news of this Heaven so others will act morally. Another aspect of Gods informative message to humans is to create as much life as possible, hence, having large families, not using contraceptives, not killing, etc. The reason for this message is while this Heaven exists and God has the power to upload our consciousnesses to this place, he should do it for as many people as possible so the max amount of people can reach Heaven and eternal happiness as the trials of Earth will be so worth it for the timeless joy as opposed to never having existed at all. The creation of babies allows for new sentient life to be created and he wants to maximize that before the end of the universe.

The plan makes sense, to get as many people as possible to Heaven, incentivize them to make it as easy as possible for each other during their time on Earth, and to ensure the creation of Heaven. To let humanity know about these circumstances, God actually comes back to Earth in the form of a human prophet right as mankind is reaching a level of intelligence and enlightenment to understand the idea of extracting their consciousness after they die to go to this Heaven. Again, the people have free-will and during this qualifying phase for Heaven, God is watching and taking note of who defiles his call to act morally to account for the incentive to make it an easier time on Earth for everyone if people act morally. Continuing, this prophet comes and makes strange claims but people follow and religion is created to worship the all-powerful God in order to have a chance of this amazing life after death. The prophet is human himself thus also making incorrect decisions as well. Another human is the most effective way of getting people to have faith without actually showing them this Heaven or making too many miraculous changes to their world that cause heaven to not be created via the butterfly effect. Humanity needs to be shown this Heaven potentially exists but there always needs to be a sliver of doubt so, again, people wont just go killing themselves or not making progress. It cannot overtake our natural survival instincts. Since the God/prophet see that some people will not take too kindly to his idea due to how outrageous it is, he is aware of the ridicule and death sentence he will get. He knows he has to come to Earth to spread his message and ultimately die for you to have a chance to go to Heaven. If the human race didnt sin he wouldnt have to go there and die in human form to tell you to act morally for a chance at Heaven. The prophet is dying for your sins. He gave his human life for your eternal happiness. Since no one at this point in time is perfect and everyone sins, God is fine if you acknowledge the fact that youre wrong and that releases you from any wrongdoing so you get to the Heaven. Anyone who intentionally or maliciously sins because they truly want to act immorally cant go to the Heaven because that would make the Heaven not perfect and if everyone got into Heaven anyway there would be no incentive to act morally.

The God never makes changes to the present day world or interfere in order to keep the future creation of Heaven right on track. Sometimes if there is a modern day person who is particularly faithful or in an isolated dire circumstance, they analyze the situation and interfere in this reality by changing matter, curing disease etc. to perform a miracle. Never for a substantial amount of individuals though as that would have too big a butterfly effect and effect progress. If every prayer was answered there would be no need to advance as a civilization and create Heaven. They have to follow as close to the process as possible for Heaven to be created.

The first time the prophet came, he arrived from outside space/time to tell everyone of this Heavenly universe and send the aforementioned message but he has to come again, not from outside space/time but actually from within this reality itself. He will need to come from this reality itself when future advancements get so far ahead that he/it will actually need to create the Heaven to take people there from the current space/time that we live in before the universe ends when all energy is distributed equally. Again this heaven is outside of space/time so remember the fish tank example? Big bang is on the left, present day is on the right. God can come back to tell us about the Heavenly universe but we actually have to go through it ourselves and it has to be created through our space/time. God will take all human consciousness left from when he is there and will also have the ability through space/time to go back and extract consciousnesses of the previous dead such as us to bring us along as well. At that point its the end of time and we are in a timeless Heaven with God looking at the fish tank of time from the outside in eternal happiness, gazing upon everything that occurred from the beginning to the end of the universe. This will be pretty fantastic because everyone eligible, past and present, who has lived in this reality will go to Heaven and have a feeling of intense pleasure or joy due to how great the Heaven is. That feeling of intense pleasure or joy that everyone will get is the definition of the word Rapture. When the Rapture happens, we wake up from the qualifying-round simulation on Earth after our consciousnesses are taken through space and time to a dimension for eternal happiness where the all-powerful and all-advanced God resides.

So, this life? This simulation that we are living in? We are living in the story of how we create God and how God created us; and how both ourselves &amp; God achieve perfection of everything through the creation Heaven.

Thoughts?

Epilogue:

So you probably noticed I referred to God in multiple personalities as they, he, it, us. Thats because I still dont know who God is and I dont think anyone will know until it happens. It could be all beings alive at the time? It could be the first advanced AI we create that becomes fully sentient and learns at light speed on its own? It could be one person? I really dont know and I dont think anyone ever will until the situation actually occurs in our reality.

Let me know how you view this theory and any insight or philosophical insights you have. Hoped you enjoyed the read and it provided some food for thought. Thanks!",10,1

[Asgardia](https://asgardia.space/en/) keeps an eye out for advancements in blockchain technology as they plan to have their own cryptocurrency called SOLAR.

According to the announcement, Haddad opted to use blockchain technology for circulating information regarding his presidential campaign after a long battle with fake news reports. As information stored on a blockchain cannot be modified or hacked, he decided to save the data on a decentralized platform.

The announcement also notes that Haddad used free software in Sao Paulo where he worked as mayor from 20132017. The software solutions monitored various city projects, such as the municipal Master Plan backed by the support of users via the internet.

Other presidential candidates have used [blockchain technology](https://asgardia.space/en/news/asgardia-space-news-6-industries-that-benefit-from-blockchain-technology). As per crypto news outlet Criptomoedas Facil, other politicians that took part in the general election; Joao Amoedo and Marina Silva, also talked about using blockchain during their campaigns.

For instance, Silva suggested creating a digital government that would save all public data on a decentralized platform, while Marina used decentralized ledger technology (DLT) to register donations for her campaign.

In the first round of the 2018 elections, Haddad and his vice-presidential running mate Manuela dAvila won nearly 30 percent of the overall vote but in the end, they lost to far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro.

Bolsonaro won the general election with almost 47 percent of the overall vote. He fell short of the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff election against Haddad on Oct. 28.

As Cointelegraph reported in January, the Brazilian government was thinking about moving popular petitions  a tool that [enables citizens to vote](https://asgardia.space/en/news/Blockchain-Wednesday-22.08-29.08) on different social matters  to a blockchain based on the Ethereum network. Officials wanted to design a mobile app that would permit people to submit their votes through a decentralized platform.

2370,2018-10-22,2018,10,22,23,9qefdo,My commentary on an article posted about healthcare and humans,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9qefdo/my_commentary_on_an_article_posted_about/,izumi3682,1540219254,"As the decades pass, the technology of medicine will evolve. And it's also going to evolve like a house on fire. Like it never has ever in the past. I would imagine the most profound development will be the ability to inhibit what we would perceive as aging today. Just that alone will have incalculable impact on healthcare. Most humans that are in their late teens and early twenties tend not to have to see a physician for anything. The people that do have to see their physician and are often hospitalized for protracted periods of time, plus nursing care are those living the last twenty years of their lives. That time being about age 70 to age 100. Few make it to 100 years. Most depart between 80 and 95 years.

Yes the ladies of reproductive age have to see the health care provider for pregnancies. But as the decades go by, I can clearly see that human reproduction will move to being an entirely ""in-vitro"" procedure. And that is even if humans choose to pro-create at all.

Because as the decades go by now, nothing is in a vacuum. At the same time that we turn medicine into almost entirely preventive information science, other forms of technology will rapidly and unimaginably improve. For example the computing and various forms of AI that are external to humans will almost certainly join with the human mind. I see evidence we are working to establish a link between our computing and the human mind as fast as we possibly can.

As the decades go by now, I see evidence that humans will begin to take on characteristics of non-living materials. This may sound like a horrifying concept to us today, but the children born into such a world will never have known a different reality. 

There are two reasons for this. The first reason is simply one word. ""Space."" We need to be more ""space friendly"" in construction. The second reason is inextricably tied into our human condition. We will do it because we can. Just wait until you see what our VR looks like in about 50 years. We are going to want to live in that. And we are going to engineer ourselves to do just that.

Elective cyborgization, computing/human mind interfaces, intrinsic AI applications and medicine that operates at the cellular or even molecular level of biology. Some of this stuff is barely 20 years away. Compared to the 6,000 year pageant of recorded human history we are moving at light speed now. 

But for the short term, I don't see emergency medicine going anywhere. Plus humans are going to die not necessarily from disease or old age, but trauma wherein we can't treat the human fast enough or it simply is too late by medical standards. ""Instant"" death is not going anywhere any time soon. The vast majority of humans that die because of trauma, bleed out. I see technologies aborning that will prevent humans from bleeding out. Internal bleeding of course is a different ballgame. The ER is not going anywhere in the next 50 years. But I wonder that the ER may not become a part of our human minds in that time. At the very least the entire facility of the ER will come to you on the spot. You will be stabilized and transported by drone ambulance to surgery if needs must. Nothing happens in a vacuum anymore. E-SDVs are going to go a long way in reducing that kind of trauma. In fact in the decades ahead, they will probably 100% eliminate it. Pretty soon they will be flying. ""E-SFVs"".

One other specialty of medicine that is of interest to me is the specialty of plastic surgery, particularly regarding the face. The results of facial plastic surgery are highly subjective to the patient. Something not easy for ARA (AI, robotics and automation) to accomplish just yet. Now today I see the fantastic leap of full human facial transplants. I bet we get better at that time going forward. I wonder if we get to the point where we can just ""grow"" the face we desire and place it upon our biological infrastructure. And of course, why stop at faces?

But like I said at first. The big change will be that humans won't develop obesity or type 2 diabetes or osteoarthritis or immune deficiency. And all the ""cute"" physical changes you begin to notice about yourself after the age of 30. When you are in your youth, under age 30 years, you tend not to have those kind of problems. Sure there are exceptions, but when I was under age 30 I was healthy with zero obesity, my muscles were strong, my skin durable and smooth, and I was far and away too busy worrying about life than to be able to comprehend, little less worry about the experience of aging upon myself. I still clearly remember when I thought age 38 years was unimaginably old. I am 58 years old now. Whoosh!

Right now today, if you look in Wikipedia at any type of congenital pathology or syndrome, you can see one or more genes associated with it. That is the fruit of the human genome project of the 1990's and early 2000's. Now that we have the proper addresses we can focus on what to do about them genes. As the decades go by we will likely come to be able to eliminate any type of lamentable congenital condition. 

And what about nanotechnology? What impact will our ever more rapidly evolving nanotechnology have on our very bodies. I mean at the cellular or like I said before, molecular level. What a wild card!

For the next 20 years I don't see drs or nurses going anywhere either, but is suspect that as ARA slowly and well, I hate to use the term ""insidiously"", but that seems kind of accurate, moves into our lives that it is possible that we ourselves will become the drs and nurses.

I read something funny in this medical humor site called ""Gomer Blog"". It has tons of hilarious things that only people in the medical field would ""get"" or understand. But one stood out to me and sort of made me wonder. In the medical field there is an explosion today of physician's assistants and nurse practitioners. I recall in the 1980's that they both were fairly rare, but nowadays you are more likely to see a nurse practitioner as your primary care provider than a physician. The ""Gomer Blog"" spoof riffed on this phenomenon and said ""Geez, what's next? 'patient practitioners?'"" A logical outcome of the steady deskilling of the physician. As funny as that struck me from the health care angle, I also wondered if it was likely that was exactly what was going to happen in reality.

[Artificial intelligence](https://www.information-age.com/what-is-artificial-intelligence-123475331/) has a bias problem and its completely our fault. Last week, [Amazon decided to ditch the secret AI tool](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/amazon-scraps-a-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women.html)  it was using to source new recruits when it discovered their system was  actively favouring male over female candidates. It transpires their  network had been trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in CVs  submitted over a 10-year period and  as one would expect given the  perpetuating male dominance across the tech industry  the vast majority  of those applications came from men

[Voatz](https://voatz.com/), a Boston-based startup, is developing a smartphone app that utilizes blockchain technology. While each transaction in a cryptocurrency blockchain represents an exchange of some value, each transaction in the Voatz blockchain represents a citizen's vote. Voting occurs in the app itself, which allows the voter to cast her vote from anywhere in the world. The [app](https://voatz.com/faq.html) first authenticates each voter through physical ID scans, video ""selfies"" and fingerprints, then credits the voter's ledger with tokens that can be used to cast votes. After the voter submits her selections on the app, the blockchain nodes verify that each vote is valid and add it to the growing blockchain.

It's not news to anyone that Google has been collecting data from us collectively and individually for years. Some people believe their algorithms know more about us and our behavior, desires, and preferences, then we do ourselves (and can predict our actions better than we can as well.)

For most users this data includes, but is not limited to:

From search history videos watched/liked they can extrapulate our:

* General interests
* Sexual preferences
* Political inclinations
* Medical history
* Product preferences
* Demographics
* Addictions/ Vices
* Past and probability of future illicit activities.
* Income bracket
* Social circle
* Our general mental health (ie depression suicidal)

From Autofill information:
* Addresses
* Place of employment
* Credit card info
* Date of Birth
* Passwords

From recognition applications:
* Access to our face and voice

From Maps:
* Location History
* Commuting Patterns
* Liked / disliked places

From Gmail:
* Personal and professional emails
* Purchases
* Social Groups
* Account information and passwords.


From uploads to Drive:
*Access to personal and confidential documents.

I'm sure I'm missing some things, especially if this extends to Android. but my point is most people trust Google/Android with tons of information that we would never dream of sharing with even our closest confidantes. 

The point if this post is not to intsill paranoia, but rather to question what this information could be used for - either in a best case scenario to benefit mankind, or conversely in a worst case scenario to influence or control society. 

TL'DR what are the possible implications of Google's extensive access to its users information - good or bad?

My scenario will provide the potential global events and the examination of their impacts. Please feel free to critique the liklihood or present your ideas. 

It's November 2018\19 and the war in Syria is almost neutralised, the country is in tremendous dispair and disrepair. Syrians blame Israel for the whole ordeal, and civilians are vengeful. The Israeli President gets assassinated by a Syrian dual national on a state visit to Russia, sparking an international escalation involving Russia and the US. The Israeli government and Mossad confirm the identity of the assassin and place blame the Syrian regime for stoking the attack, but remain composed. Israel, launches a 'pre-emptive' strike on Syria, with some success, but allot is repealed, one f35 is shot down with Russian Air defense. 

Escalation continues with the US pledging a nuclear powered, aircraft carrier and accompaning fleet off Israels Coast in aid. Russia also a-symmetrically increases presence in Syria, with submarines and anti air support. 

Skirmishes between the two intensify, for a number of weeks, with no side willing to make a ground offensive. One month passes and foreign navies have arrived to provide support. 

This causes the stalemate to escalate with the launch of prototype KH-47, from a Russian sub 260 miles away, sinking US neuclear aircraft carrier; causing the reactor to become unstable, contaminating the surrounding coastlines; Russian sub is also caught by Destroyer and severely damaged, political tensions increase to near full scale confrontations. Neighbouring countries try to protect their own interests, and protests happen globally. 

Due to contamination in the Mediterranean Sea, international trade routes are sevearly effected, especially around the Suez. 

In retaliation a saturated tactical semi neuclear tomahawk battery is launched into Syria, from US warships, aircraft, as well as Israel and Saudi Arabia. With 250 tomahawks deployed, as well 150 decoys (400 total), 10 are nuclear tipped. Of these Russian/Syrian air defences detonate 7 of the 10 Nuclear tomahawks in mid flight. War between major powers is officially declared. Emergency dialogue between world leaders ensues. 

The three that hit their targets cause a sizeable amount of destruction similar to Hiroshima at each site. But added with the fallout of the 7 detonated mid flight, radiation levels in the area become dangerous. Fatalities from radiation poisoning across the entire Middle East start happening by February. And people seeking refuge head to the Turkish border or Greece by boat. 

Fallout severely disrupts power and communications networks in the Middle East. Without satellite connections, independent media looses most contact with the wider world. 

The global economy tanks. The only companies that do well are those producing munitions or military services. A run on the Bank ensues. 

More contamination causes severe disruption and to all shipping trade in Mediterranean Sea at the Suez Canal. A global recession ensues. US and Israel places total Trade embargoes on Russia, Syria, Iran, China and their allies. 

China responds by a naval blockade around Taiwan. Iran responds by launching a servo of nuclear ICBMs to Israel, but none hit their targets. Although repealed by Isreals iron dome, the amount of nuclear fallout caused by detonations leads to a large number of casualties, as well as over 10,000,000 tonnes of radioactive fallout, entering the jet stream. Combined with the previous fallout, the radioactive pollutive atmosphere is carried East by the Jet Stream crossing over India, China, Russia and even over the Pacific ocean where low levels of contamination can even be measured over within mainland US.

Global agricultural output of some countries is slashed by up to 75%, depending on the amount of contact with fallout. Some parts of the middle East are almost completely barren. 

US retaliation over Taiwan blockade escalates to US and Japanese aerial and naval incursions to try and establish a supply line. China shoots down a jet, tensions increase. 

EU and Nato launch a trade embargo on China, Russia and radioactive foods. China tipples defence spending, and increases military presence near Taiwan and at African naval bases. Internet passthrough to services in Nato are also cut off from the rest of the world. Majority of traffic too and from VPNs are identified and taken down, due to security concerns. Global Internet infrastructure becomes more and more localised. International communications becomes near impossible. 

Israel tries to goad Syria into a ground offensive. Russia sends neuclear hypersonic nuclear missile battery in aid of Syria as well as Air defence systems, transported by air. Israel attempts to engage shipments and is successful on one occasion. 

UNSC unilaterally calls for a cease fire, China vetos the bill. 

A US, Japanese and South Korean naval detachment attempt to send provide support to Taiwan. A naval battle ensues. Due to Chinese support from the mainland, China repels attack. 

Taiwan government reluctantly succeeds to Mainland China due to famine caused by naval blockade. US responds via nuclear tomahawk strike on Spratly islands in South China Sea. The majority of this attack is repled by Chinas HQ SAM systems, but now nuclear fallout has doubled. 

China responds by sending troops to South Korean border, through North Korea. As well as a Naval detachment to the Spratly Islands off the coast of the Philippines. 

But now the amount of nuclear fallout in the atmosphere has doubled. By February the sky looks more grey, and as less sunlight is able to penetrate the atmosphere. As a result global average temperature is up to 10 degrees lower than average. 

Further UNSC meeting is called and countries draft a ceasefire plan. North Korea launches secret ground invasion of South Korea. Before a ceasefire could be ratified as they see this as the only opportunity they will have to unify Korea. 

North Korea makes some headway, into the south. China retracts their support for North Korea, but keeps troops stationed within the country, the relationship deteriorates. 

US and Japanese troops come to the aid of South Korea. And prevent further advancement of the North Korean army. 

By July, its clear Global food levels are critically low. More than 40% of people globally will struggle to find more than one meal every day. 

UNSC talks regarding ceasefire, resume. In return for ceasefire, China demands Taiwan, in exchange for the deposition of Kim Jong Un.
UNSC agrees, and Chinese Army attacks North Korean Army from behind, and over throws the DPRK government. Russia and China place new government there. Russia demands reparations for loss in Syrian conflicts from US and Israel, and both reach settlement agreement. 

China, US, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Israel and Syria, sign peace treaty, 20 months after the assassination of the Israeli President. 

The global economy implodes, as people no longer have faith in the US Dollar. Food shortages, continue, and crop yield gets worse for the next 2 years. People are forced to try and grow their own food locally. With some success. 

Cancer presence in those under 25 is 20x previous values and average life expectancy falls by 5 years on average.

Therefore, as the first known truly sapient beings I heartily think that, in a hopefuly nearby future, all of humanity will join together to work on an specific species-wide goal,regardless of race, religion, sex or procedence. Note that this is wishful thinking only, but it *may* happen.

&amp;#x200B;

So what will be the goal that will finally unite the people of this world together? Asume, for the following scenarios, that we have attained the knowledge and techonology necessary for each one to become a possibility.

&amp;#x200B;

Short term goals focused on Earth, like solving the climmate change, nanotechnology development, impeding an imminent risk to civilization, or attaining biological immortality?

&amp;#x200B;

Long (*long!*) term goals focusing on our civilization universal-wise, such as kickstarting a singularity, mind-uploading to an endless personal heaven, developing full space travel and expansion, charting the universe and harnessing energy from the stars to understand how everything in the universe works?

&amp;#x200B;

There are lots of goals to achieve, together, as an species. However, no matter how many of these goals we may achieve, one will remain supreme after all the others have been completed. The **endgame.** Basically, after attaining all of these, *then what?* And that's where I wish to hear your opinion, fellow redditor.

&amp;#x200B;

In my mind, **humanity's endgame** should be stopping entropy, definitely. I know that's not an original idea, thanks to Asimov, but right know we have determined that our universe will eventually end. If we ever develop immortality, our only hurdle would be the definitive end of the universe itself. 

So, in your opinion, what should be humanity's endgame? Please refrain of answering things such as ""that's too far away for me to care"" or ""I will be dead by then, why should I care.""

On top of that, we also have the technology to modify genes fairly well. Medical technology has improved leaps and bounds just over the past decade. 

Now, that got me thinking; do you think that one day in the future, we might have the technology to produce improved versions of our organs? Say, lungs that can take in more oxygen, or double as gills somehow. 

That, or maybe a heart that's capable of withstanding extreme speeds, self-repairing teeth, eyes that can pick up more light during the night, or even detect infrared light, more durable bones, or really well-designed body temperature regulation that could allow you to withstand hotter or colder temperatures for much longer periods of time, so on and so on. 

Imagine if this kind of technology was so available one day that you could go buy a heart 2.0 just because you want a better heart, sort of like how you can get plastic surgery to look however you want to today? You could go buy a heart that allows you to push yourself far beyond your normal limits, or going and getting self-repairing teeth; if you get a cavity, just keep brushing your teeth and it'll heal over similar to how a cut on your skin would. No biggie. 

That and of course, the medical applications this would have; those with heart problems, liver problems, whatever have you, they could go and pick up much better versions of those organs. The issue of organ damage/failure would be drastically reduced.

What do you guys think? When I was younger I thought about things like that, and thought ""there's no way I'd ever see that in my lifetime, that kind of technology won't be available until like hundreds of years from now"" - but at the same time, medical technology has improved leaps and bounds since then. We (sort of) have that technology now, at least in the sense that we can grow organs, and we can modify genes (sort of) how we want to now. It doesn't seem like the ability to grow organs, modified to be both more reliable and more efficient/functional than their original counterparts, is all that far off now

So, if AI systems continue to improve, will we see systems tracking individuals from early childhood and then identify them as a potential risk? Will we see improved medical treatment where either cybernetic or improved drug therapy is used to correct any associated mental issues?

Or will we as a society continue to use death penalty as a Darwinistic approach to the problem by removing these people from the gene pool but only after the fact?

Or do we identify these people through AI systems noted above and remove them, anyway?

Without a healthy middle class in an information society we are forced to sacrifice our rights and privacy to stay afloat financially.  This makes exploiting people easier and easier in society.  Eventually leading us to an information/slave society.  

Due to increasing automation people are increasingly forced to become part of the information society, or be left behind.

This means, giving your personal information to companies like Google, Facebook, use Smart Phones, use tracked web browsers etc.  

What are the implications of this?  As automation increases, profitable jobs will continue to evaporate.  Only jobs related to information will be profitable.  People will either be in poverty or be forced to join the information society.

People will be forced to use self tracking/monitoring devices because they will be crippled economically otherwise.  This means those in leadership/government/corporations could use whatever they want to discredit/blackmail/punish people whenever they want to.  People at corporations could be forced into basically prostitution to stay employed.  People will be forced to be loyal to leadership regardless of if leaders are right or wrong.  

I feel much of this is happening already.  It will only get worse.  You may not get that job because  despite being qualified you have a preexisting medical condition the company doesn't want to deal with (like depression).  The company doesn't need to say they found out about it from getting your personal information from supposedly private web search history.

I understand these are big claims, but I feel it's appropriate.  As automation completely takes away income opportunities and makes the mega rich richer, and shrink the middle class it makes you wonder.  Without a healthy middle class in an information society we are forced to sacrifice our rights and privacy to stay afloat financially.  This makes exploiting people easier and easier in society.  Eventually leading us to an information/slave society.  ",18,1

Plot (no spoilers): Humanity is getting dumber and two average people are frozen and woken up 500 years in the future. The averages of now are just geniuses in the future.
The movie is taking to extreme the trends of overconsumption, entertainment industry, corporatism, political system (which is geared towards entertainment) etc.
It kind of prophetically predicted the current state of world and politics. 
I, personally, think that the movie was a bit unrealistic in how dumb it made people, that still are using relatively sophisticated devices, but you can see an interesting pattern. In addition, it seems like being smart in such an environment would make a person pretty successful at manipulating people around him/her, thus being able to accumulate more wealth, thus keeping at least ones kin pretty well of and, potentially, smart.
I had moments where I literally cried (not of laughter) at how absurd some of the things may turn out.

While reading Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, first published in English in 1922, I got the idea that machine intelligence could be created by representation. After all, W said that we picture facts to ourselves and a picture is a model of reality. This is representation. In a picture the elements of the picture are the representatives of objects. So if in thinking we use representatives of objects, perhaps we would recognize a representative of intelligence as intelligence.

All very philosophical, I know, but this thinking led me to a different method of making software I can talk to, one that doesn't require scripting a response for anything I might say, or mapping a brain's nodes with mathematics and paying for a lot of compute time to train the system. :)

I've created representation of intelligence, and it's available [here](http://representi.com). I'd like to hear how it can be improved.

Hey There!

*I'm developer. I'm looking for a project for cooperation.* 

I developed a lot of telegram bots, airdrop bots, bounties platform, web pages, monitorings, slack bots, discordapp bots, reddit bots with auto-posting and etc. Developed a popular bot to protect groups from spam attacks, which consists of more than 25 groups. I automated bounty system to auto claim users bounty on steemit/golos when users do actions like following/resteem/upvote/comment and etc.

**I already helped to:**

* **WINGS** with bots, monitorings and utilities. Helped community to get quick access to the required information.
* **PTOY** with the telegram, twitter and slack bots. Developed bot to sync messages between telegram and slack which allowed users to communicate with each other without any problems.

If you'll need help, write me in PM and we'll discuss conditions.


**Can I contact with the team Directly?**


*I recommend you to use @chatdefender_bot to protect your telegram group from spam attacks!*

# ""China's tech means nation is now more powerful than US, warns former secret intelligence chief 

 

The US is  losing its dominance in the world stakes to a more assertive China  thanks to the latters booming technology industry, Britains former  secret intelligence service chief has warned.

Sir John Scarlett, who served in Russia and led the secret services  during the 7/7 bombing in London, said he had observed a return to  great power tension and rivalry that was growing month-by-month.

While addressing a crowd in San Francisco, California, during an  Oracle technology conference this week he said: As a non-American  looking at the US... I can see pretty clearly the sense of agitation and  anxiety is becoming more visible and audible because for the first time  you \[Americans\] can perhaps contemplate a situation where leadership,  innovation, technology doesnt automatically find itself in the US.""

Human/sex trafficking is out of control in the region of Winnipeg, Canada that human trafficking agents are being sent from their locations within the region to recruit more human trafficking operatives to keep their human trafficking business operating successfully. If you or anybody you know is instructed to move to Canada by any unknown groups of individuals claiming they have always been you and/or bribes you with sex, drugs, or free housing, DO NOT GO! YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LEAVE! I can not stop you if choose to submit to them. Everybody chooses to be what they want. But, you will be abused both physically and mentally, raped, forced into hard labor, converted into a sex slave worker and a drug addict. All in the while of being trained to become a human/sex trafficker. You will be taken as material possession if you decide to meet with them. 

They will lie to you and make up stories, revolving around your life and make you feel like youve won something. You will not be able to freely move or quit. These hostiles will disguise themselves to be your friends but they are really just pretending for pay. The human traffickers from Winnipeg Canada stalks their targets for some time and then approaches their victims either on the streets, electronically through drones with auditory microwave technology attachments, which allows them to hijack the human body (search Frey Microwave Hearing), or through the internet amongst jobs offering free housing. 


I am warning because I am currently a target of human/sex trafficking and due to me disclosing this information, I may be murdered covertly by human/sex trafficking operatives/agents from Winnipeg Canada because I refused to remove myself entirely from family and friends. They want me to surrender everything including my body to them. Please be safe out there everyone, do not let anyone fool you out of your life.

Talk or message me if you got any questions.",4,1

(CNN) - Neanderthals may not have sported the barrel-chested bodies  and hunched posture we see in museums and textbooks, according to a new  study.

The first 3D virtual reconstruction of a Neanderthal  ribcage has revealed that they had straighter spines and a greater lung  capacity than modern humans. The findings about the Neanderthal, also  spelled Neandertal, were published Tuesday in the journal [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06803-z).""

\- orphanage worker: orphans have a chronic shortage of people to care for them, as unlike parents, it's hard for any human to dedicate their lives to an orphan, never mind a class full of them. government employees and clergy also have a history of abuse and lack of motivation. AI could give these children someone who really cares for them, their entire lives, without many humans losing their jobs over it. on top of this you could still employ humans (volunteers, government officials, but I don't think clergy is a good idea) to connect the children with ""real"" humans and keep an eye on them

\- soldier: fighting wars takes a huge toll on humans, and tends to cause a lot of excess damage as they abuse their power or cause collateral damage, not to mention it's also extremely expensive, and a big risk of some crazy general going nuclear. AI and robots could do the same job with a much greater degree of precision and control, for a lower cost, and human soldiers could be kept in the loop to keep things ""human""

\- police: largely like soldiers, here we have humans who are placed in very violent positions of power, which leads to cases of excessive use of force, abuse and collateral damage. police have the added dimension of being vulnerable to bribes, blackmail and corruption. AI and robots would do the job more precise, incorruptible, with a greater physical presence, greater discipline...

\- swat teams: as an extension of soldier and police, these humans bring extreme violence to the peaceful people on a daily basis. more than ever this requires the utmost discipline, restraint and precision, as well as a 24/7 responsiveness and reaction time. the immortality of the robots also allows them to achieve greater performance in such a dangerous situation, for example by using non-lethal weapons, which avoids collateral damage and makes criminals less prone to escalate the level of violence

\- judge: another job that wields a lot of power, is very complex and is open to corruption and power abuse. as they are the ultimate judges of human society, theirs require the most rigid adherence to the law, something most human judges fail at

\- firefighter: this is a daily job that people rely on to save their lives. here AI and robots can offer a performance that outweighs that of any humans, and also reduces the risk of more humans getting hurt in the process. they also have the important advantage of being ready to respond 42/7, without the need for holidays. they also don't have a ""bad day"" that might affect their performance, can be deployed and moved much faster (you could fire them from a cannon towards the fire and they'll just land with parachutes, in busy city traffic this would save valuable time)",31,1
