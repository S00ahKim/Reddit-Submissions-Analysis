The 10 year bid would include building things like technology, bases, forced learning of said technologies, occasional study of our bodies (without bondage, etc), etc. You may not be capable of technical things at first glance, but they would provide augmentations to make you able. They would provide Food, clothing, shelter, healthcare (all the necessities plus more) for free for those 10 years.

After the 10 years, you would be Guaranteed a ticket (or a ship) to travel all over the universe + you could keep your augmentations (you'd pretty much be a super human). You could go back to your normal life if you chose.

The stipulations:

1. No murderers, violent and / or sex offenders are granted the slavery program. They would remain in the current jails. All others released and given 2nd chance. The jail system would be automated so employees could become ""slaves"" if they wanted. BUT if you committed what is considered a human crime after this release, you would be instantly executed (you're constantly tracked and monitored).

2. If you denied your 10 years of slavery... you would be sanctioned from enjoying all the new technology and benefits plus you would be banned from communicating with current slaves (impossible to work around).

3. If you denied the 10 years, you and all others who refused to oblige would be kept in a massive compound representing a mini earth... that allowed you to continue on about every day life. (may need to find a new job...etc.)

4. No marriage or sex for the 10 years, insane amounts of work to be done. You get 4 - 6 hours of sleep every night. (you would be separated from your family and friends. There would be no contact for those 10 years.... this means no internet... no phones... etc.)

Imagine a father wanting to inspire his kids, about what they need to work towards and what they can look forward to when they become adults. He would have little more to suggest to his kids, than to someone who was due for retirement.

The responses that I normally get to the question, are far from convincing and are along the lines of: people will take up more hobbies, or they will spend more time with friends, they'll take up a sport, or more people will work in laboratories, or there'll be more people in healthcare.

[Original thread here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Technostism/comments/3fcexr/nonprofit_seed_factories_as_a_way_to_replace_the/?context=3)

&gt;I was doing some research and discovered that hydroponic crops can create in addition to food - bio-plastics, acrylics, building materials, and many other products. A controlled environment can create a very high amount of products in a short time and low space, which may be used to build another greenhouse/factory. If the business model is focused on automation of these products, and the construction of further facilities, it could expand exponentially. You could for example feed your output of bio-plastic to a large 3D printer or something. If the business was non-profit it would only need initial and not continuous funding, since the facilities ""make themselves"" at a lower cost; many of the final products possible like food could simply be distributed to the public as a shared service; in effect the business is public. Such a project might best be started in a more remote area with less city licensing/zoning limitations and where land is cheap. If it grows large and makes enough things it might qualify as a self-contained compound of sorts.

Narrow AI isn't the issue and it will never be the issue, but all the fears, unpredictability, and woes of general AI stem from a fundamental lack of understanding of ourselves and how a computer would deal with consciousness with a mind that supercedes ours. 

IMO, for every dollar spent into AI capabilities, we need to spend two into the field of psychology that I feel is currently incredibly underfunded and taken for granted as a pseudoscience. Psychiatry has taken over due to the biological aspect of things and, thanks to big pharma, it gets all the funding ever needed, but even that is built on old psychological standards that fall behind with each and every year. 

In tandem with logical training, reasoning, and objective rebellion of our base instincts, a well funded psychological field would lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of the mind and with that more security when we do create AI.

But we need to keep improving CPUs while these technologies are getting ready.

1.We can make them simpler by getting rid of obsolete instruction what were kept for backward-compatibility

For example, to deal with molten salt's corrosiveness, each reactor has a buddy reactor that is on a 4 year cycle of graphite moderator replacement. Also, the replacement is made easy due to the entire reactor system being suspended underground by retractable cables. This also solves the thermodynamic expansion issue. In the end, these reactors require less in materials, less in fuel costs, and certainly less in environmental/health hazards than coal.

According to the Flynn effect, people who are on the brink of being learning disabled today were in the top half of the distribution about 100 years ago, and the same would apply to this society. People 2 SD below average (120 IQ) would still be gifted by contemporary standards. 

This group of people is not spread around, but for whatever reason all live in a country together (like an eastern european nation, lets say latvia). 

So assume a nation of maybe 20-30 million people is created like this, but the rest of the earth (due to not wanting to engage in genetic engineering isn't smarter). How does this nation differ from others? 

I'd assume education would be different, a hundred years ago most people only got 8 years of education while now it is almost the norm to get 16+ (preschool, K-12, 2 years of college) and 19 years (a masters) is not unheard of. Would something like 22 years education be the norm in a higher IQ society? 

What about boredom? People with higher IQs get bored more easily, how would a society function? Would they just import all the low cost laborers like some oil rich middle eastern nations do? Or would the people be happy to work in low wage, no challenge jobs? 

What about scientific R&amp;D? Would 10% of GDP going to science be realistic? I'm guessing a big part of their economic system would be based on innovation and then selling those discoveries to other nations. 

In the real world, it would be rare for all the people to be in one nation, but with genetic engineering, IVF, stem cell gametes, etc it should be realistic for people who want it. ",12,4,False,self,,,,,

What I am wondering about is whether these will be regulated or not as people having robotic arms could in fact be seen as weapons, if future prosthetic limbs are better than real limbs will people have their biological arms or legs replaced with robotic ones, will this be allowed or will prosthetic limbs only be allowed for people that have lost limbs in verifiable accidents and if so how would this be controlled?

I can walk from my back yard through the back yards of 6 of my neighbors in about 5 minutes (our lots are long and narrow-ish)...

I just moved to this neighborhood, had always lived in apartment complexes until now, and something struck me after the snow melted... why does every individual household have a $1500+ riding lawn mower? They only use them about 10 times during the season, once a week... I've been using my neighbors and paying him for the privilege since I don't have one and it seems to me like a HUGE waste of resources to have 6 of these expensive machines within a quarter mile of each other. All of us on this side of our block could share one of these things easily. Suppose we all chipped in and bought one for $1500, it would save EACH of us $1250, costing only $250 per person/family. At that price I wouldn't even care if I ended up moving and had to leave it behind with the rest of them, I still saved a TON of money.

This is one example, but there are all kinds of things like this that I'm starting to recognize, expensive things used rarely that could easily be shared by a community to everyone's benefit. What has caused us all to be convinced that our self worth is dependent on owning all of these stupendously expensive gadgets and gizmos? I know people that treat their riding lawn mower like a status symbol, they practically brag about it! I never understood that mentality with cars, let alone lawn equipment.

You might ask how this relates to futurology, well IMO I feel that being less wasteful should be part of the future, and I see having a dozen lawn mowers, chain saws, leaf blowers, etc on the same block is ridiculously wasteful. What I'd LOVE to see is the emergence of community ""libraries"" of expensive tools and other rarely used things that people can check out for a given amount of time as needed, things that are hard to transport could be handled on a per-block basis while things that are easier to move around could be for the entire neighborhood or town.",45,16,False,self,,,,,

**My short bio:** Dr. Aubrey de Grey is a biomedical gerontologist based in Cambridge, UK and Mountain View, California, USA, and is the Chief Science Officer of SENS Research Foundation, a California-based 501(c)(3) charity dedicated to combating the aging process. He is also Editor-in-Chief of Rejuvenation Research, the worlds highest-impact peer-reviewed journal focused on intervention in aging. He received his BA in computer science and Ph.D. in biology from the University of Cambridge. His research interests encompass the characterisation of all the accumulating and eventually pathogenic molecular and cellular side-effects of metabolism (damage) that constitute mammalian aging and the design of interventions to repair and/or obviate that damage. Dr. de Grey is a Fellow of both the Gerontological Society of America and the American Aging Association, and sits on the editorial and scientific advisory boards of numerous journals and organisations.

I was going to respond to the pothole reporting post, but that discussion seemed to be pretty road-repair focused. So here, we can talk specifically about drone+SDC synergies (I hate that word but it applies pretty well here). Here are two ideas to get started:

* Why fly from warehouse to doorstep when you can just fly from street to porch? Delivery drones can hitch a ride on SDCs to recharge and save energy for long journeys. The drones will compensate the SDC for the added energy/drag they use with an automated identification/payment system. This could be done with conventional cars - it's the system of shared routes and a standardized dock that would allow this to happen: the drone knows the intended paths of thousands of cars and can pick the best one, hop between cars as needed, and eventually make a delivery to a final destination. 
* In car deliveries: hot Starbucks, In-n-Out burger, whatever you want. Like a drive-through without even having to stop or change your route. Then enjoy without anyone having to focus on driving. ",6,19,False,self,,,,,

Private companies also do researches, but the purpose of such research is to find something which will make money for them, not to make 'progress' on something.

Some say Web 2.0 is a huge progress ; a lot of wealth has been created from it, true.

However, the new tycoons of Web 2.0 have become the new Powers that Be, and they tend to direct researches which would make sure they would retain control over the new tech . In other words, they are not likely to encourage researches which will slip out of their hands.

This reactionless thruster is the result of 23 years of researches conducted by ASPS.

The engine, which is propellant-less, works by exploiting Lorentz forces that are generated inside twin capacitors with a shared plate. The potentialities of this engine are enourmous, because without the need to expel reaction mass the fuel isn't a constraint anymore, since the engine just needs an electric energy source: a fission reactor could power the device for years! This means that a ship equipped with this kind of engine becomes immediately a real space ship like the ones in science fiction movies: it could visit various celestial bodies in a single mission and then come back to Earth in brief time. Moreover, if the engine will provide an acceleration of 9.81 m\s^2, the crew would experiment a ""simulated"" gravity for all the journey duration. Most important of all: since that the engine could thrust as long as the energy source is active, theoretically there are no limits to the speed it can reach! Even FTL travel becomes closer!

I'm just under the impression that the brain changes structurally as we age and that because of that, we're able to store memories. I don't know much about the brain so I'm making a lot of assumptions here but I would expect that if you compare a 25 year old brain with a 40 year old brain, one would have more experiences and be structurally different.

Imagine if humanity had magnetic rail around moon circumference. We might use it as giant accelerator to lunch stuff into deep space.
The spacecraft will be inserted in a long pipe like form. When it reaches the target speed it will be released at the right exit point. After leaving the accelerator it will assemble itself into the final form. That way we might reach extremely high speeds ,maybe even 0.01c or 0.1c . If indeed that range of speeds is possible then proxima centauri might become reachable in human lifetime.

Advantages of using moon over earth:
1. No atmosphere - meaning the spacecraft won't turn into fireball (No vacuum issues).
2. Extremely low shade temperature, meaning we can use super-conductivity with no extra effort.
3. Lots of energy from the sun. 

Incentive:
1. Obviously space exploration.
2. Cheap satellite lunch into earth orbit.
3. Might be used as weapon (Shoot asteroids into earth, no radiation).
4. Send lunar goods (Helium 3) back to earth.

Assuming that the moon have all the necessary materials to build the accelerator and the fact that robot intelligence is on the rise. We will be able to send an army of robots in a few decades from now. And let them do the magic. With as little supervision as possible.

Sensory experience could be sent directly to the brain, and muscle impulse signals could be intercepted by the device in order to control a virtual avatar instead of the physical body.

This setup could provide the ultimate immersive experience while the physical body remains peacefully at rest.

Now, I don't think the issue of whether this is possible or not is that debatable: we have already seen how special chips can send sensory data to the brain. This sort of technology is still in its infancy but the technology is coming to life.

There's lots to think about here, though:

1. Is there an already established term for this? I assume there has to be. For now I like NVR, but would love to know if there's a real term.

2. How long do you think it will be before these technologies enter commercial entertainment? Currently we are seeing the dawn of a much simpler form of VR with the oculus rift and project morpheus and the like. This is a massive step forward in virtual experience, but compared to NVR, is little more than taping two miniature TV's to our faces with some nice motion tracking.
That said, neural interfaces might not be too far off, since we're already experimenting with simple ones. What's your countdown?

3. Do you think fully immersive simulated experience is the ""destiny"" of the species? Perhaps saying it that way sounds silly, but NVR poses the prospect of apending our days living out hand-crafted experiences that we tenderly fabricate for ourselves and one another. The future of humans may simply be striving to architect the greatest and most moving virtual experiences that you can, or experiencing that of others. Meanwhile, a fully automated supply chain nourishes our physical forms and enables our continued virtual growth.

4. Do you have any thoughts on the transition that will happen as virtual experience begins to rival physical experience? What happens when virtual experiences might as well be physical ones? Do you see massive problems forthcoming as society adapts too slowly to the existence of NVR? Perhaps it will cease being called VR, and we will instead speak of digital reality vs analog reality...

5. Would you be an early adopter of NVR if it required a surgically implanted neuro ""port""? 

6. It's possible that a huge decision for humans in the future could simply be what world you want to live in... Either physical or virtual. And even further, how many vast and beautiful ""designer realities"" would spring up?
Where would you live? What kind of world would you want to call home?

In closing, maybe it's worth saying that virtual reality is a gimmick, or at least, it'll be used as one for a while. The launch titles for all these VR headsets are likely to be short lived, but there will come a time in a few years where you may experience a jaw dropping and deeply moving 80 hr game all through the immersion of one HD screen for each of your eyes. NVR will likely begin the same way, relying on gimmicks, until the true geniuses step in and take the wheel.

To make an analogy to video games, no video game is right for everyone, and some people aren't interested in them at all. But with every great art form, there are outliers so fantastic that they resonate across the ages.

Perhaps we're approaching some sort of golden age, where virtual lives help us satisfy many of our longings without consuming crazy amounts of physical resources, and allowing us all to realize that the journey - the seeking and striving for of events or things - is what we really enjoy. Sure, you could strive to be rich in the real world, but you've already simulated being rich in the virtual world and it was alright. What do you REALLY want?

Or perhaps, maybe you think all this is wishful thinking? There could be a thousand reasons, and I'd love to hear yours.

 It got me to thinking, much like how a battery works by contact on either side of it, could it be possible to have a flat, metal bumper, and the charging station be an identical flat metal piece that transfers the charge when you slowly drive up to it and make contact? Connect the bumper to the battery and have the charging port send electricity to the battery when the two metal plates make contact with each other.

I think it's a cool way to easily charge your electric vehicle. Obviously there would be stuff like ensuring that the bumper works as a bumper in case of a fender bender, and having an alternative method of charging in case a fender bender occurs and it breaks.

EDIT: So, in addition to cloning dogs, there is other stuff going on with Sooam Biotech. First off, they are working on cloning a whooly mammoth. I mentioned that maybe the mammoths wouldn't like the current environment much, though the researchers seemed confident that the mammoth could survive in today's climate if it had the right kind of personalized habit set up for it. The other project they mentioned, and one I find much more interesting, is the cloning of pigs. Right now they are trying to figure out how to transplant pig organs into humans in need of organ transplants.

DISEASE CONTROL / DEPT. 5  
V.I.P.E.R. DISEASE CURES (up to date, as of July 1, 2532)  
  
For over two hundred years, V.I.P.E.R. Division, in cooperation with S.A.I.L. (Social Advancement for Intelligent Life), have worked hard to study diseases and their onsets.  
  
Our scientists have pushed boundaries and challenged the human body beyond levels of human comprehension.   Our strong and consistent push for disease treatment and disease cure have lead us to numerous awards, achievements, and advances.  
  
Below is a list of our up-to-date disease cures, information on such diseases, and a compilation of what our scientists are working on right this moment.  
  
 
CURES:  
  
Swanson Virus  (aka Swanson Outbreak)  
  
Year:  2450  
  
Background:  The numbers of humans affected continued to rise throughout the months of February and March, as many will recall from GUN (Galatic Unbiased News) reports.  Swanson Virus was introduced to the human race via the landing of the EZKALE (pron. - EZ - KALE) alien race.  
  
Total Affected:  Approximately 30.3 Million  
  
Symptoms:  Formation of webbed hands and feet (1 month after exposure); Frog-like facial appearance (2 months after exposure); Tongue blisters; fatigue; nausea; vomiting; excessive sweating.

Total Affected:  Unknown  
  
Symptoms:  Exposure to Krolee heightens physical abilities - increased strength and endurance, approximately 60%; damage to liver and kidneys after exposure.  
  
Year Treatment Was Found:  2448  
  
ONGOING RESEARCH:  
  
Sector 9 Contamination and Quarantine

Fuck you buddy!!**

Ill understand if this receives a lot of reflexive downvotes because of the word fascism. Thats just a healthy self preservation instinct. Totalitarian ideologies were responsible for some of the most brutal atrocities in human history! But in the modern era, Chinese totalitarianism has also achieved some impressive rapid progress in manned spaceflight. So please hear me out. 

To get this out of the way, bolded for emphasis, **this is not about racism**. I am not a racist. I do not condone or abide racism. A search of my comment history will bear that out. Fascism is not intrinsically racist. Mussolinis movement wasnt racist, neither was Oswald Moselys, at least early on. Space fascism would, should, and must be multicultural as it's for the benefit of all humanity.   

**Why space fascism?**  

At its core, fascism is about a populist uprising leveraging sheer numbers and unity of purpose to brute force its way to a particular goal. In this case, permanent manned settlements on other worlds. This is something I do not believe can happen any other way, or I would never propose such a drastic, risky method for achieving it.

*But what about private spaceflight companies springing up in recent years* you say. This is a mirage. Where does their money for *manned* spaceflight come from? Still the government, no? So its still ultimately dependent on our political process, which is a huge, fickle mess. The precise conditions that were necessary to put humans on the moon within a decade required a geopolitical perfect storm the likes of which we may never see again.

There just isnt anything profitable to be done on the Moon or Mars. Thats the hard and fast truth of it. Even asteroid mining will not require a human presence. Suborbital joyrides for the wealthy dont accomplish anything, even if they one day are able to purchase brief lunar visits. 

Whats needed are massive well equipped habitats for thousands of people, the cost of which is impossible to secure money for under the present system. We need the kind of government which can simply decree that there will be a Mars/Moon colony, and all of industry then gets to work making it happen. 

**You want to kill people dont you**

Absolutely not. The militaristic and racist focus of historical fascist movements account for that, although fascism is to some degree inherently about imposing your will on others. Yet, bolstering the military industical complex would not be the goal of such a movement, rather the creation of a space industrial complex. 

Basically a mad dash to pour as much money as possible into building loads of manned space infrastructure (and sending people there) in order to obligate continued support after the regime is toppled or implodes on its own. 

I do expect it to be toppled, too. Its inherently unstable and doomed to eventually collapse. I see that as a good thing. I hardly want to live under a fascist regime for the rest of my life, or to inflict such an existence on the next generation. This hypothetical movement would be a single-use tool to accomplish the goal of making humanity multi-planetary at any cost (probably the destruction of the USA as we know it, followed by balkanization) 

Once there are large human populations off Earth, an economy will manifest because therell be thousands of people who badly want a variety of goods and cannot (yet) make any of it themselves. There will finally be genuine, sustainable business models which necessitate manned spaceflight. For a while it will be the government buying them supplies, but I expect private entities to step in and sell them shit at some point. 

Lunar and Martian colonists will be able to produce novel kinds of value (low cost satellite launches due to lower gravity, selling scientific data, reality TV, low G porn, etc.) this, and their local economies, will generate the wealth needed to continually expand living space from in situ materials. 

Most likely sealing and pressurizing subsurface lava tubes or building habitat space from concrete theyll make with regolith. Tin can habitats are costly and not the right answer except for the first wave of settlers. This growing ability to self-support will gradually reduce the supplies they need from Earth, something world governments will be only too happy to facilitate. 

**""Why the hurry?""**  

I think we're living in a window of time during which this sort of thing is possible, which is going to come to an end within another two or three generations. Because oil will become irreversibly expensive, because of the effects of climate change on agriculture and the countries we outsource to and so on. 

We've built ourselves up to what may be a short lived apex of technological civilization, and when it collapses we may not be able to rebuild it afterwards. If only because we've already consumed all of the fuels that are easy to access and do not require high technology to extract useful energy from. We either do it sometime in the next few generations, or it just never happens and that's all she wrote for h. sapiens. 

Anyways, thats the idea. Scream and curse at me, tell me what an awful monstrous notion it is, but I consider putting large human populations permanently offworld sufficiently important to justify almost any means used to do it. Agree or disagree, I want to hear from you.

**107 After Ford (2015 A.D.) // Currents:**
Australian band Tame Impala release their third studio effort, Currents. Extremely well received, both critically and commercially, the album catapults them into the mainstream. At the peak of their fame, they enjoy incredible success for modern standards. Shortly after the release, they become the biggest band in the world.

**108 A.F. (2016 A.D.) // Experience:**
Music festivals continue to attract thousands of fans solely for the experience. Musical acts become tertiary to drug intake and socialization, now the main appeal of festivals around the United States. Culturally insensitive fashions and drug overuse are rampant.

**108 A.F. (2016 A.D.) // The Greatest Living:**
At one of said festivals, Kanye West declares himself the greatest rock star alive. This enrages Kevin Parker of Tame Impala. He then devotes his life to taking West down.

**108 A.F. (2016 A.D.) // Progress:**
Due to advances in technology and the integration of cloud computing and streaming as a preferred source of music, listeners have increasingly less ownership of their music. Instead opting for streaming services like Spotify,Apple Music and Pandora, they feel less and less compelled to buy it in physical form as time goes by, distancing artists from their fan base.

**108 A.F. (2016 A.D.) // Uniformity:**
Music festival lineups become increasingly homogenized as musical variety ceases to be the main focus of these events. Bands like Flaming Lips and The Strokes now almost exclusively operate under the festival house band model with many big name acts following suit. Tame Impala, the latest sensation, soon joins the ranks of these festival giants steadily climbing to the top. This renders many lineups to be nearly identical from city to city, festival to festival. Alas, Kanye sits at the top of the festival food chain.

**108 A.F. (2016 A.D.) // Community:**
Multi-genre underground music scenes around the world, while rich in good content and musical variety, are unable to penetrate the barriers imposed by the few companies who now control an extremely large portion of the music industry. Soon, they start to slowly but steadily dissipate.

**109 A.F. (2017 A.D.) // Identity:**
Leon Bridges rises to mainstream prominence with his brand of throwback classic R n'B. Having started out as a dishwasher in Ft. Worth, Tx the 27 year old is now one of the biggest artists in the world. An extremely rare case, Bridges is one of the very few discovered, not manufactured mainstream artists of such commercial success. Unusual for this time period, Bridges employs fully live instrumentation, analog production and substantial lyrical content, albeit borrowing stylistically from past artists. Before him, Adele enjoyed comparable success with a similarly stripped down musical style.

**108 A.F. (2016 A.D.) // Stability:**
The large majority of broadcasting channels and radio stations are now completely owned by a few select corporations and therefore have continuous rotations with increasingly limited variety and musical scope. Overly-produced, formulaic songs are now the norm in FM Radio. Lyrical writing levels in mainstream music are at an all-time low. Limited to their unvarying respective genres, staff-writers hired by major labels mass produce carefully calculated songs with different combinations of a small variety of subjects; pussy, ass, money, beer, trucks, bitches, shots (both gun and liquor), and bottles are all celebrated topics in mainstream music of the early 21st century.

**109 A.F. (2017 A.D.) // Fewer Still:**
Former thriving music scenes like Austin, Brooklyn, and Los Angeles continue to fall prey to big business and gentrification. Most musicians are priced out of the cities while many venues and music institutions become replaced by strip malls, banks, or luxury living complexes. This further reduces the amount of active musicians.

**111 A.F. (2019 A.D.) // Past Life:**
Tame Impala releases their fourth studio album, this time having a completely electronic sound not at all reminiscent of their previous studio albums. Though, initially well-received, it fails to retain the hype of the last and teenage audiences are quickly lured by the next pop sensation.

**112 A.F. (2020 A.D.) // Kimye:**
Kim Kardashian releases her debut pop rap album, PU$$Y//A$$ produced by self-proclaimed Best Producer In The World Kanye West. While critically panned, the album reaches #2 on the Billboard Charts, second only to Transformers 7: The Soundtrack.

**114 A.F. (2022 A.D.) // Twistin' &amp; Groovin':**
At the threat of becoming stale, Leon Bridges moves on to an electronic style of music. The live band is gone and he now performs choreographed dance moves whilst lip syncing. Bridges achieves unprecedented levels of commercial success.

**116 A.F. (2024 A.D.) // #NowPaulIsDead:**
Paul McCartney, the last Beatle alive, dies at 82 years old. #NowPaulisDead trends on twitter. His death marks the end of an era. The Beatles music sales experience a large spike which industry analysts call the dying breath of music sales.

**116 A.F. (2024 A.D.) // Same Old Person, New Mistakes:**
After attempting to record new material and reinvent Tame Impalas brand, Kevin Parker becomes frustrated while trying to cope with how unrecognizable his sound has become, even to him. Unable to produce something he genuinely enjoys, he announces publicly that he is going on an indefinite hiatus. Meanwhile, West continues to acquire copious amounts of currency which he uses to expand his control over the music industry. Unlike other rappers/rock stars of the time, however, he does NOT bed large amounts of females. In 116, Year of our Ford, Kanye West is still uncharacteristically devoted to Kim Kardashian West and therefore only half of the era's popular adage ""Fuck bitches, get money"" applies to him.

**117 A.F. (2025 A.D.) // Nothing That Has Happened so Far Has Been Anything We Could Control:**
Due to the decreased exposure to the masses (particularly the young), the guitar and other musical instruments experience a rapid decline in popularity as a hobby. Big instrument stores like Guitar Center, Sam Ash, and Musicians Friend are forced to carry out massive downsizes reducing their operations to suit very small niche bubbles of consumers around the United States. Many independent ma and pa instrument shops have unfortunately gone out of business by this point.

**118 A.F. (2026 A.D.) // Apocalypse Dreams:**
Lady Gaga finally performs her long-delayed concert in space. After witnessing this historical event, Beethoven's illegitimate long-lost great great great great grandson, Ludwig Khan Beethoven, has a visionary experience. Despite all indications of it being a bad economic decision, this leads him to open up his own music production company: Synthefreude Records.

**119 A.F. (2027 A.D.) // The Bold Arrow of Time:**
After being erroneously pronounced legally dead for the fourth time within two years, Keith Richards is still going strong.

**119 A.F. (2027 A.D.) // Beeb Boob Boob Beep:**
Katy Perry's breast comes unscrewed at a show in LA's Laser Adhesive Center (Formerly the Staples Center) exposing her to be a fembot made of completely robotic parts. She is immediately seized by government agents and taken offstage. The spectators that night are treated to complimentary kool aid on the way out. The public at large never finds out about this event.

**120 A.F. (2028 A.D.) // The Less I Know The Better:**
In two short years of existence, Synthefreude achieves extreme levels of success and influence within the frail industry. It is rumored that this is, in large part, due to the use of oppressive tactics and bribery to acquire music rights.

**120 A.F. (2028 A.D.) Feels Like We Only Go Backwards:**
Music is now a supremely rare subject to be taught in schools. It is mostly a pleasure reserved for those who seek it themselves, or those who are lucky enough to be born into a musical family.

**120 A.F. (2028 A.D.) // Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind?:**
West learns of Ludwig Khan, the latest big player in the business, and approaches him with a proposition to join forces. Initially reluctant, Khan finally agrees and they merge all their assets. Unrivaled, Synthefreude begins their systematic overtaking of the industry.

**120 A.F. (2028 A.D.) // Desire Be, Desire Go:**
Through questionable methods, Synthefreude acquires all the music rights of the three biggest record companies. Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment subsequently go out of business.

**121 A.F. - 128 A.F. (2029 - 2036 A.D.) // Replacement:**
Synthefreude Records adds a hologram division to their label. Instead of signing musicians, the record label now deals exclusively with computer programmers and virtual reality animators and uses their vast catalog of song rights to supply their touring ""bands."" Able to remain young-looking forever and execute music with excruciating precision and invariable dynamic, hologram bands become the norm for the music industry, replacing aging musicians prone to human error. While some human musicians remain, the hologram craze effectively replaces what was, until then, known as the music industry. One of the very last pre-Fordian music institutions in the world, the New England Conservatory of Music closes its doors due to a lack of applicants as the new generations fail to produce young human musicians. Many other music conservatories and universities follow in their footsteps. Most historical buildings in their campuses are leveled to make way for parking garages and office buildings. The Juilliard School of Music building in New York City now serves as Synthefreudes world headquarters.

**129 A.F. (2037 A.D.) // Cryonics:**
The Rolling Stones, now an indie band without rights to their original music, wrap up their 75th anniversary shows failing to sell more tickets than their synthetically young hologram counterparts managed by Synthefreude. Fed up with the band's decline, Keith Richards, 93 years old, goes into a deep cryogenic freeze with an indefinite revitalization date.

**130 - 139 A.F. (2038 - 2047 A.D.) // The Age of Joy:**
Many musicians try to combat the monopolization of the business by Ludwig and Kanye, who in response to the uprising decide to fuse their physical bodies to become invincible. The newly formed Khanye eradicates his opponents through use of deathly soundwaves. With most former prominent musicians now completely out of the picture, Khanye and his associates have total control of the music industry and its output. The power-hungry Khanye soon finds that the key to controlling the rest of the world is in the music. After unsuccessful attempts to exert mind control using pre-existing songs (which were not designed, or written as they used to say, with the purpose of conditioning), Khanye commissions the best scientists in the world to help him develop a way of cloning famous musicians that can create new mind-numbing material. Together, they manage to isolate the gene that causes musical adeptness in humans. Thousands of musician embryos are bottled and injected with a mutated form of this gene through a procedure called the Wayneovsky Process. They are subsequently placed in the Azaleator Apparatus where they are genetically extracted of any potential desire for creating music of their own and instead are conditioned to create vile tuneage that dulls the population. Finally, they are hatched and grown in incubators. With a whole new army of clone musicians unwilling to disobey orders, Synthefreude Records holds the first music festival in space: Earthella. While only the elite are able to attend, the strange synthetic music is broadcast onto Earth and can be heard all over the globe, regardless of location. After the broadcast, multiple reports of bizarre behavior surface. A wave of complacency washes over the people of Earth who now feel no eagerness to challenge or even question Khanyes authority, musical or otherwise. With a lack of conviction, humans become cogs in Khanyes master plan to control the Earth. He is able to manipulate the population into submission by broadcasting invasive frequencies that stun their minds. This allows Khanye and his associates to overrun the world with their criminal activity. As a result, all remaining surviving musicians move out and away from Earth. The lucky ones, that is. While they continue to try and rebuild their music scene in a new planet,Gliese 581 c, they run into an unusual problem. There is too much helium in the atmosphere and it makes all singers sound like chipmunks. Quite frankly, its pretty fucking lame. Earth, which is now known as The San Francisco of Planets is overcome with monotonous songs and brainwashed people.

I've been watching the Gigapixels of Andromeda video on repeat for the last hour while poring over google about immortality and the like, about the theories of Kurzweil and the Moravec Transfer and, well, and all that stuff.

I'm here for a personal opinion, from all of you. I'm sixteen and a half now, going into Junior year in a few days. I'm in good shape and have always been, I eat well, I'm not depressed or anything like that. Is there a chance that any of this could ever happen in my lifetime? I'm overcome with this desire to, I don't know, to see these stars in the video, to see the universe. I don't know if that makes any sense to anyone but me.

I've started to think about college, as well, and if it is possible, I want to help. I don't just want to sit by and let everyone invent everything for the future. I've been thinking about going into Genetic Engineering, but whenever I tell someone that they look at me like I'm crazy. 

So, those are my questions. Is it possible that someone like me, now, could be able to life forever, and if so, what can I do to help?

As always, thanks.",6,8,False,self,,,,,

Over time rules evolve, occasionally through logical foresight and legislation, and too often through violence.

It used to be the rule of law that women were the property of men and African Americans were the property of white people.   We have long since moved past these rules, but it took violence to advance. 

The issue with the traditional legal system is it uses precedent to make decisions.  In other words, it is backward looking to determine compliance with the rules.  This creates obstacles when society is trying to make systemic progress as we have seen with women and African Americans getting property rights.

Just like people don't look in the rearview mirror to drive forward, society should NOT look at past rules to create better laws about a technologically efficient, productive, and disruptive future.  

Creative solutions are necessary for problems without precedent.  Most lawyers are not very creative at dealing with novel issues because they were trained in law school to use historical precedents to solve legal issues.  There are very few creative lawyers who practice in the current legal system as the current rules require backward looking logic and lawyers must play the traditional game to make money.  Lawyers are trained, conditioned, and rewarded for looking backwards to solve problems.

Automation, digitization, and robotics are now transforming how we do everything in our culture.  Unless we creatively look forward and implement better rules, we can expect lots of frustration and anger by those not being offered security, freedom and opportunity from the present rules as culture evolves.

Has anyone noticed how few politicians, lawyers, and judges (those creating, discussing, and overseeing the rules) are discussing automation and the societal implications in the current presidential and other political campaigns?",12,4,False,self,,,,,

So here we go.

From my limited understanding of climatology and global warming, I understand that our current problem is from excessive amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere. Sunlight enters the atmosphere and reflects off the surface and leaves. With all the extra CO2, instead of leaving, the sunlight continues to bounce around our atmosphere which continually heats it up.

My question is this, If global warming is caused by excessive energy build up from the sunlight, wouldn't absorbing the energy and changing it to electrical/mechanical/whatever contribute to global warming in the same way, if not more slowly? The energy is still being trapped and will eventually be released as heat.

But when I begin bringing in the dough, you can bet your ass that I'll be doing this. What is this?

ADVERTISING. I'm sure as many of you know, right now, for $5, you can put a message/advertisement on Facebook and many other websites that will get in front of THOUSANDS of viewers through pay per click campaigns. For $1000, you can get in front of hundreds of thousands of people, potentially even millions. My thoughts? We should take things into our own hands and begin mass-advertising the efforts of longevity research and begin calling upon donations from the public. Think about it, if each month 100 people from r/futurology gave $1 for advertising, we could target (for example) New York City with advertising on longevity research and bring the topic in front of the eyes of hundreds of thousands of people who haven't been exposed to the idea before. What this will do is get the general public used to seeing the possibility of longevity and at the same time, we will get people to donate.

I know this is obvious, but I just wanted to get this line of thinking out there because I think it could be mind-blowingly effective. Think about it, if this subreddit organized advertising campaigns where we had a monthly ""pot"" where we gather advertising funds consistently and created a gripping and memorable ad, over the course of 1 year, 2 years, etc., we will be slowly planting a seed that millions of people over time will become exposed to. Through these ads we can send these people to SENS' website or a page where we answer their questions about overpopulation etc.

I think it would be a great communal effort that could be game-changing.

Some of them refuse to believe transhumanism and AI will change humanity forever. One way I've tried to explain what I'm imagining goes like this

There are plenty of people out there who willingly modify their body (especially youths). Either through just piercings, hair color, eye color, tattoos and cosmetic surgery. Is it really that unlikely that there will be a number of people who would happily replace one of their biological organs for an artificial one? 

For example, if there was a new ""smart"" limb prosthetic that was equally good or greater than someone's actual limb, there would be a group of people out there that would gladly amputate their own limbs to get an artificial arm or leg. 

Just like all the extreme piecing and tattoo enthusiasts, they would gladly replace/modify all their organs with artificial ones. 

To me this an inevitability!

If we get into nano tech (which is sometimes too advanced a concept for the average person to grasp), it's even more plausible.

In my opinion, its already here. What do you guys think? ",62,28,False,self,,,,,

These same years have also seen an explosion of narrative. The increasing complexity of human interaction and communication technology (beginning with the printing press) have spawned an unimaginable amount of convincing, emotionally powerful, and wildly diverse narratives. Humans more and more undergo complex, difficult, dangerous and sometimes suicidal series of actions as acts of active participation in a narrative that gives their counterintuitive actions meaning. 

More than ever, humans live away from the world once inhabited --  the world of air, sun, sky, soil and water -- the world profuse with grass, flowers, bushes, trees and the living things that move in the  earth and on the surface of the earth. More than ever, humans live in a world of boxes and lines and numbers and stories and fantasies. 

As technology continues to grow and proliferate humans have more power than ever before, both individually and in groups. The potential energy of humanity is increasing exponentially. The power of humanity can be expressed both through the traditional hierarchical structures of the nation-states, many of which now possess the power to destroy part or all of the planet with nuclear weapons, and increasingly in individual, non-state actors who possess enough wealth or creativity to take actions of enormous significance. 

The diverse, powerful, contradictory narratives at work in the world show no signs of defusing the externally-focused tension inherent in all of them, or of possessing the ability to empathize with or even tolerate the existence of a narrative fundamentally unlike their own. 

There is no reason to suppose that the trend over the recent centuries of larger and more destructive wars has happily ended in our time. The same narratives, systems and tools that effected those conflicts are still in our world today, and they grow stronger all the time.  There is every reason to suspect that large areas of the planet will be laid waste and go dark in the next fifty years. ",17,0,False,self,,,,,

Aside from our current ride and room sharing whatever, there will be more private chef delivery services that provide better food at a lower cost than fast food. Instead of going to a crowded and expensive bar, you go to a crowd funded party where you donate $25 for a party invite or two.

Maybe instead of paying $1,000 for a new couch or any new furniture, you hire a craftsman with the tools know-how and creativity to provide a better custom product for less. Same might go with fashion or any other product that is tailored to personal taste.

I think education will get so expensive and unsustainable, well connected professors could theoretically open their own schools and teach classes at a fraction of the price, but without the expenses of bureaucratic accreditation. For those that cannot afford tuition, there might be apprenticeship programs to replace grants and scholarships.

The biggest obstacle is petty nanny state bullshit about zoning, limited business licenses and other bureaucratic nonsense that will bring the hammer down once they realize they've been sidestepped. Corporate interests will lobby the govt to enforce this bullshit even harder, because regulations are used to protect them from start up competition at a certain level.

But there is a built in solution and that's democracy. I think there could be open source alternatives to current prototype services like Uber that allow the users to make democratic collective decisions, rather than some smug ceo that's only interested in snorting the profits up their nose. These cooperatives could run ahead of the regulatory curve by providing a superior service with the highest standards and customers would flock to that kind of brand.

Or we could continue on the same outdated capitalist/socialist structure and deny the reality of the unsustainable collision course we're on.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

In SCI personal injury trials an SCI expert comes and testifies. Since there is only standard care available for SCI currently, this is a fairly rote occurrence.

Do people here at a r/futurology think it would be worthwhile to have a futurist testify at an SCI personal injury trial, as to, obviously, what the future holds? Who would qualify as an expert? Do you think it would improve the verdict?

I'd love to know.

In the video, he talks with Gad Saad, a professor from Montreal (I had previously never heard of him so if I'm simplifying his bio sorry). In the podcast, Joe goes right into trigger warnings, campus culture, sexism etc. Joe states that he thinks SJW's are just flat out ass hole's who hide behind a noble cause to deflect from them being an ass hole. They attack people for things 99% of people already agree with, like black lives matter (all lives matter), rape, sexism. Most people are not racist, sexist, or misogynist and agree with the cause's SJW's stand for in a basic sense, just not the way SJW's go about their causes. Saad then brought up a great point to add on, saying the problem with most SJW's is that they are fighting battles that have already been won, but SJW's resent the fact that most battles have already been fought, so in turn SJW's create unnecessary conflicts in order to make themselves think they have purpose in the world. Both points create an interesting take on SJW's. Rogan brought up a point that after he made a comment about if ""Your responsible for driving drunk, then why can't you be responsible for fucking while your drunk"", he was then attacked on twitter by SJW's, who didn't intelligently try to debate his point but rather name called and insulted. This was the root of his remark about ass hole SJW's. I think the two comment are two great points on what type of people SJW's are. I agree with Saad that they are looking for a battle that doesn't exist, and I also agree with Joe Rogan that they are just ass holes that use noble causes to deflect their own shittyness. However, Saad made another point where he said their just kid's hopefully they grow out of it. This whole podcast was an amazing and intelligent discussion on most things that are frequent topics on TIA.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

I often try and work around new technology that is now readily available and not cost-prohibitive. Things like carbon fibre, batteries, all components of robotics basically, sensors, microcomputers, these are all now insanely cheap, and very available, at least compared to 5-10 years ago.

So, I've been focusing on safety and security for people and property lately, and I had what *I* think, is a pretty good idea.

House fires. These kill, disfigure, and ruin peoples lives. A lot of the time, even the best case scenario house fire will still ruin a home, and cause 10's, 100's of thousands in damages. We have, for as long as we have controlled fire, feared it. We have literal 'fire *fighters*'. We pay people to *fight* fire. That's how scared and fearful society is, whether they can acknowledge it or not, based on their own experiences, we as a society appreciate the power that fire has to create, and to destroy, and so take a lot of precautions to avoid it being an issue for us.

So, the premise of this idea/invention is that a wheeled/tracked robot, looking something like a medium/large size vacuum cleaner, has the ability to detect, and respond to fires inside ones home. It would be fast, mobile, and have multiple angles of attack against a fire. CO2 bomb/release, directional foam/powder turrent, and the ability to close doors.

The setup would consist of having a heat sensing device, similar to a fire alarm, in each room. These would all be able to communicate with the fire-bot(my name for this). Should a fire be detected, the fire-bot will 'wake up' from the corner of the living room, or wherever is the most central area of the flooring plan, and go to the fire. It would have alarms(lights and sound) to wake people/help people avoid running into it in a panic etc. It would enter the room, close the door, CO2 bomb set off(a bunch of gas expelled in one go) and the foam/power turret directly shooting at the area of the greatest heat.

Now, there are some major advantages to the fire-bot. Unlike people, it doesn't matter if it get's destroyed, it doesn't fear fire, it can handle heat, it doesn't need to breath, it doesn't need to sleep, it stays home when you are on holiday, and it can react(theoretically) faster than you can to a fire, through having eyes in every room(which you don't have) and having fire-fighting abilities built in(again, something you don't have). *You* have to run to the nearest hose or fire-extinguisher, the *fire-bot* doesn't.

Remember, fire move's *very* fast, and every second you get up on it, greatly improves the odd's of surviving and minimizing lose of property. Even if the bot only took care of 'most of it', that would still be far better solution to what we have now(reactive via fallible people).


So, that's my idea. I usually keep them to myself, but I feel like certain things(especially concerning safety) should be more open-source and out in the air than for-profit and secretive. Any comments, criticisms? I haven't gone into all the exact details(for example, I am still working on what would be best to close doors, and I'm thinking a rotating wheel with 'nubs' on the end made of rubber or adhesive material, rotating towards the door so eventually it would hit it in the right spot and push it closed).

The SENS approach is more about damage and repair, and the genetic approach is more about reprogramming the operation of the cells, but hormones seem to play a critical role in how an organism grows.

Remember when this came out a couple weeks back?  http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2015/07/genetic-switch-determines-longevity-in-animals.html

This implies that reaching sexual maturity (via hormonal rebalancing) has a direct and causal effect on the aging process. Before puberty, the body is rapidly growing as fast as possible to reach sexual maturity. The ""switch"" is puberty; once sexual maturity is completed (around 17-21 years old in humans), the body begins to grow ""old"" rather than grow up.

The biggest things driving all this, I believe, is hormones.

Oxytocin (the ""love hormone"") has been demonstrated to rejuvenate muscle tissue.

Insulin has implications in the aging process (speed of aging). 

IGF-1 (growth hormone) has also been implicated in the speed of aging, and there is research ongoing about using IGF-1 for rejuvenation.  

That last one is especially interesting. The mouse study where they sewed 2 mice together (one old, one young) saw the older one being rejuvenated while the younger was was aging prematurely.

http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/04/can-we-reverse-ageing-process-young-blood-older-people

How about this as a theory behind the aging process?  Hormones effect epigenetics. The balance of hormones determines how cells regulate themselves (grow vs. maintain vs. repair). 

Thoughts?

Not capable of speaking (just yet), but with warm human-like skin, rich facial expressions and full bipedal locomotion, with all related aspects of sexiness carefully imitated. Aware of it's surroundings, waterproof, and stimuli-driven, which means it 'desires' pleasure on its very fundamental level. Oh, and it conveniently comes in recharging cabinet case which you can embed in your wardrobe. You can customize your model during purchase, and estimated price is $20,000.

Kickstarter campaign kicks in, they have huge success, surpassing their initial goal tenfold. Now they start production with first batch arriving somewhere in the end of 2016.

**Now the question is:**
In case it happens tomorrow, what implications is it going to have in upcoming years? How general public will react? Society, politicians? How it will affect dating? Will radical feminists start seeking legislation or even committing violent riots to destroy production facilities? Will guys start selling their cars to get one? Will it be big or remain niche? Let's play 'what if' with this.

Windows issue? Check for microsoft KB that seems to match the issue based on keywords and tagging rules, send information to customer. 

All of this has made me realize that I am 100% replaceable. Maybe not in 10 years, but in 25? Quite possibly. 

When I was first thinking about futurology, I always assumed a McDonalds kitchen could be automated more easily than the cashier position, but in fact both are quite replaceable. 

I've been racking my brain trying to think of what position is truly permanently safe, and the fact is that wherever there is labor, there is a mechanism for automating that labor. 

In truth, it appears that no job is safe. Or at least, no job that isn't doable purely as a labor of love, or for entertainment (Film director, game designer, painter). 

As a means to help illustrate this issue, I think we can sum it up by adding #NoJobIsSafe to videos, articles, and general posts we make on social media about automation.

In the series Chung Kuo there are 20 billion people. There are some space exploration but not much to make an 'escape'.

I don't think this situation is sustainable for too long. All these high-tech stuff won't be relevant to the majority of humanity who can't afford a phone for $50 in $1/day salary.

He made an interesting point towards the end:

""**Interviewer:** Let's say that there is a young person who is going to see Ex Machina and thirty years from now, she will create an artificial consciousness. What is the one message you hope she takes from your film and thinks about in thirty years time?

**Alex Garland:** The story of the film came out somewhere of a kind of response to what I perceived of an anxiety of AIs that didn't feel quite right to me which was that AIs were seen as something that ran in parallel to us, if they existed they would be this kind of other life form that would exist in parallel. Because they're in parallel, they're in some respect rivals to us. We would feel rivalrous and threatened by them and they might decide they're better than us and get rid of us. There's a whole set of consequences that comes from conceptualising AIs as being a parallel life form and what I attempted to do in this film is present it in more of a parental way and to say that AIs are more analogous to children of us and we have created them in a way parents create new consciousness but in this case it's machine consciousness. With a child, unlike a parallel life form, you feel conformable that the child will outlive you which is the minimum you want for them. You hope that they have at least as good a life as you've had and even better. ...It would be to see AIs in that way as an evolutionary continuation of us, not  in a sort of strict darwinian sort of a way but in a spiritual or metaphorical evolution. ...To not feel threatened by them but to feel warm towards them. Ultimately, the reason I feel good about Ava and I feel good about the way the film ends is because I feel affectionate towards her and I think the AI has a future that we might not have and I want the AI to have that future, I don't feel threatened by it. ...*It would be to treat the AI as a parent rather than a more detached creator.*""",22,22,False,self,,,,,

The taxi industry is the most corrupt one I ever worked in. The medallion, chauffeurs license and even the meter were clearly intended to secure a monopoly. I paid the owner of the cab $80 for 12 hours and after fueling that gas guzzler up ($50+) I made about $30-100. I was breaking the law about half the time by picking up fares in cities my medallion didn't cover. There was a logistic excuse for the $10,000 meter from the dept of weights and measures. But the $10,000 medallion didn't make sense. Especially since the cabs were all $2,000 hoopties with 80's level emissions and the steering radius of a bus.

Uber, Lyft and Side Car have really summoned the demons. The cab industry makes all these excuses about safety, yet the [data shows](https://www.zendrive.com/references/taxi-rideshare-12-2014/?utm_source=infographic&amp;utm_medium=tumblr&amp;utm_campaign=taxi_vs_rideshare_SF_2014) contrary results to their claim.

I imagine this will happen with several other industries that heavily rely on bureaucratic protected monopolies. I think once Solar and energy storage is figured out, the natural monopoly of the utility companies will shrivel. Maybe there could be open source data transmitters that make your ISP and carrier obsolete. The control the mainstream media has over the conversation could slip into obscurity within a decade or two. But I thought the same thing had already happened to music, while Justin Bieber is worth 200 million bucks. So my predictions could be wrong.

1395,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015-8-18,2015,8,18,23,3hg6za,self.Futurology,Policies are lagging behind our global society. Can we organize global government online?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3hg6za/policies_are_lagging_behind_our_global_society/,themoony,1439907798,"We are wealthier that ever but we cant seem to distribute this wealth properly. Climate change is also a global threat yet there is little support for global policies to manage it. If we want a fruitful global society and a blameless future for our children we must push for a global policy. Can the Internet help us organize it and is Reddit a good place to start?

Historians offer varying criteria for civilization. They mark the following important factors:

*     A large, centralized population
*     A complex division of labour
*     A centralized government
*     Money collected through taxes
*     Surplus and distribution of food (wealth)
*     A safe living environment

This list hardly covers everything. But it should give you an idea of the various glues holding our civilization together. Some of these factors are just fine in our global modern world. Population is mostly centralized in cities that are connected by modern infrastructure. In a way the people of New York and Hong Kong are more connected than Romans ever where. The division of labour is global as well. Think about how global our economy has become. I live in the Netherlands where half of our GDP is dependent on international trade. These factors suggests we have a global civilization yet other factors form a danger to our new world. Mostly because governments are not centralized to manage these factors.

Evading taxes is an expensive game multinationals get to play because of this. Thanks to differences in Tax policies companies like Apple Inc. get to shop at the cheapest store. This leads to an unsustainable distribution of food (wealth) and in the end economic decline even for companies like Apple. If people pay more taxes than businesses we have less money to buy phones. Apple will make less money which leads to lower employment rates or cheaper labour. In both cases that means even less money for us to buy phones and so on.

Unbalanced wealth distribution is a self-perpetual issue that will lead to social and political conflicts. We can see this now in the Middle East. But we cant blame a company for lack of wealth distribution as long as they have no level playing field on a global economy. In a free economy a company must compete and this ultimately leads to a Tragedy of the commons[1] .

The same goes for a safe living environment. We need to be dealing with a decline of resources and changing climate. Not for our planet because it has been here long before us and will be here when we are gone. We should do it for us. Climate change will effect food production and our living environment.With resources getting scarcer this will lead to conflicts. Again, multinationals get to shop around for the cheapest place to manufacture and usually those are places that have poor environmental and climate policies. We need a level playing field on a global scale to help companies make the right choices. We must address these and other issues issues globally before we are fucked.

So i was thinking. Can we unfuck it by organizing our democratic power worldwide on the internet? A worldwide movement to push for global policies.

How about we start by writing the first global constitution. What do you feel are the basic global rights?

tl;dr We are a civilization that is functioning on an increasing global scale but no global government to manage the issues it is facing. If we dont do something about this in time we are fucked! Help us unfuck it!

* Retroactive commemoration of events later deemed important, but at the time were not seen as especially important.

* Adoption (/co-option) of a minority subculture's holidays by a larger culture.

* Commemorating individual people deemed important by history.

* Marking cyclical natural events.

* Things that evolved from any of the above into commercial holidays requiring purchase of something.

I was reflecting on how periodically Saturn's moons end up in its shadow, and how amazing that would be to see from colonies on those moons (based on images [like this](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0901/newrings_cassini_big.jpg)), and it struck me that very likely that event will develop into a holiday celebration.  Moreover, since it happens at different times on different Saturnian moons, human settlements on those moons would celebrate it at different times and perhaps develop different cultural practices around the celebration.  This would be an example of marking a cyclical natural event.

and then that's not even touching the thought of virtual reality. i for one, have absolutely NO desire to 'upload' myself to a computer or becoming a robot and i worry about that being forced upon us in a way. how will having complete freedom of our looks, lives, species etc. impact us? what will become of personal identity when we have the option to COMPLETELY change our appearances and personalities to how we desire? or the possibility of wiping your memories and completely starting a new life? idk why but it terrifies me.

ageing still scares me even if we're forever youthful. hopefully i can stay youthful, fun and sassy like katherine pierce(a 600 year old vampire from 'the vampire diaries' incase you don't know who she is) if i live long enough to see indefinite lifespans and not become a withered old shell of a person.

i know all of this is a big IF, and i may not even live to say it, but it's bound to happen to in the future and i can't even begin to think of the consequences all of this would have on society and the human race in general. ",17,0,False,self,,,,,

It would cause people to be isolated in their homes instead of going out into the world. The person he was arguing with (Hammond, I believe) argued that it would bring the world together.

I argue that it has done both. 

With the advent of the world wide web, windows and macintosh, and american online which made the internet very easy for the masses to access people now have access to a wide array of information where before they had to rely on network tv, a few newspapers, and a few radio shows. 

Before, people would have to listen to a wider array of ideas and would become accustomed to the idea that there were many valid ideas. But now people can join online communities that share their values and ideology and never have to expose themselves to other ideas even though they are more accessible than ever before. 

This isolates people into a group think, supporting Malcolm's argument, but it also unites similar people from around the world into these groups, supporting Hammond's(?) argument. 

Studying the past I know there have been many times and examples of stark cultural and ideological division. the US had such a massive division in the 1850s that a war erupted in the 1860s. There was such a division in the 1920s exampled in the Scopes trial and again in the 1960s between the hippies and the ""main stream"" culture. (or the black-power culture, or the american indian movement, or the Chicano movement) 

What is going on now? Are these divisions increasing, or are people just more aware of them? 

What about the current generation which will grow up with this access to information? I watched my friends kid using a tablet as well as any adult. When I was her age I actually used a desktop computer better than most people (back before desktops were common). She will grow up with the internet. Will her generation be more open to exploring different cultures and ideologies? Or will her generation be even more divided?

1750,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015-8-23,2015,8,23,5,3i05c0,self.Futurology,Types of Automation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3i05c0/types_of_automation/,erenthia,1440274164,"This is not a prescriptive post.  While I do think Jobs are at risk from automation, that's not what this post is looking to address.  Instead, what I want to talk about is the nature of automation, and a few things I think people are sometimes forgetting.  (Also I'm not trying to be too technical, so I'm not talking about [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation#Types_of_automation) either). All that being said, as far as I can tell, there are two basic and almost independent types of automation.  

##**Type 1: Task Restructuring**

When the Luddites were active, they weren't worried about intelligent machines.  Type 1 automation doesn't necessarily involve computers at all.  A self-checkout kiosk doesn't have robotic arms and a vending machine doesn't look much like a candy store.  When jobs are automated via Task Restructuring, the machine's strengths and weaknesses are catered to.  And since a machine's strengths and weaknesses are very different from a human's the job often looks very different.  It also means that humans and machines can work in concert because of the complementary nature of our abilities. 

##**Type 2: Human Mimicry** 

Sometimes the way a human does something is pretty much the only way a thing can be done.  The purest example I can think of is probably self-driving cars.  While the stuff going on inside the car may not look much like human cognition, to a person outside the car the end result is precisely the same (even if it's less accident prone).  Human Mimicry is a relatively new approach since the technology to do so is relatively recent.  

##**Hybrid Automation**

Ultimately, the required outcome places certain restrictions on how much you can restructure a task and how little you can mimic a human.  The most iconic example is the modern car factory.  Until working cars can be 3D printed, you will still need robots with an articulating arm capable of things like welding.  We can see that this is a combination of both types because it uses similar tools and even maintains the old assembly line concept that was originally created to make humans more efficient, while also making adaptations based on machine strengths.  

##**Conclusions**

If we take the Efficient Market Hypothesis at (mostly) face value, than Type 1 automation should be mostly saturated throughout industry for any given technological level.  Because of the inherent weaknesses of machines, Type 1 automation ensures that, even though some jobs become obsolete, the Market itself continues to rely on humans.  It lacks the ability to eliminate humans from the job market because it cannot compete with humans in certain areas.  

Type 2 automation is different.  Type 2 automation seeks, explicitly, to give human-like strengths to machines.  This has not happened in any significant amount until recent years because the technology was not available.  Type 2 automation, *should* allow for the Market to function without human input once a certain level of machine capability is achieved.  I am not suggesting (in *this* post) that it will, only defining a process that would - in principle - allow it to happen.  It is very important to recognize that this does not require the advent of fully sentient software.  Human-level abilities need not be concentrated into one machine to be useful to the Market.  For instance, computer vision in one machine could automate one process while natural language processing can automate another process somewhere else with neither machine being a true AGI.

My question for this subreddit is if these categories are sufficient to classify most automation schemes or if the concept needs reworking.  Obviously there are other considerations, such at how long it will take, what the economics of a machine economy should/will look like, etc but I'd like to get some terminology laid down first.  If we can all agree to the terminology that will help the discussion going forward.",3,2,False,self,,,,,

In nominal terms they already spend about twice as much as Japan, and are only second to the US. Plus I get the impression they want to push for 3-4% of GDP for R&amp;D, which means if/when their nominal GDP is 20 trillion in a decade they may be devoting 600-800 billion a year in R&amp;D. 

However corruption and mismanagement are major issues there, and I don't see a lot of major innovation coming from China. Plus they look like they've had to create a system out of whole cloth in the last 15 years, their R&amp;D investment was probably moot just 15 years ago. Creating an entire system out of nothing is going to cause problems. 

Anyone have any predictions for when China becomes a world leader in innovation regarding energy, biotech, AI, IT, communications, etc? 

Some things recently make me hope they are catching up. With the EM Drive, it was Chinese scientists who took it seriously and seem like they kept the project alive. 

Baidu is working on AI, and it was big news when they did better than US companies like google but it was found out that they cheated. 

I'm guessing late 2020s, maybe the early 2030s is when China will really start to become an innovation hub. A world where China can contribute to solving the worlds problems is going to be good. I know China recently said they wanted to work with the US on solving the world's biggest problems. Plus I secretly hope China taking R&amp;D seriously will cause the EU to start investing more seriously, push for 3% of GDP rather than the 1-2% they are doing now. ",70,30,False,self,,,,,

There's been this perception since the end of the Age of Sail that since we've discovered everything above the surface of the waves, what lies below is barren and mostly unimportant. Of course, since submersibles like the Trieste and Alvin were launched, this has been proven wrong, and there is a whole different world deep underwater.

A common topic in Futurology is Asteroid Mining, getting spacecraft to mine asteroids for rare-earth elements for use in manufacturing electronics for example. While oil is commonly drilled from deep below the ocean, mining elements is not common, even though there are large reserves beneath the ocean floor.

Even I've complained that NASA is underfunded at times, but Space exploration projects are like the spoiled child compared to Deep Sea. The US Government only has one vessel whose purpose is to explore the Deep Sea, and that ship belongs to the NOAA. Billions of dollars per year go to launching satellites and probes to explore other planets and moons, only a fraction of that amount goes to exploring the largely unknown world far beneath the surface of our own oceans.

Its a real shame too, because some cool ships like SeaOrbiter have been made in the last few years for Ocean Reaearch and Exploration.

They construct their avatar, select their username and get it approved by the school. The school sells the student the necessary interface and biometric gear adequate for school issues. Biometric gear is to verify identities and suchlike for exams etc. This is a once of cost to the student (it lasts their whole school career) and wont be much more expensive than the text books. The student manifests each day at school, goes on virtual field trips anywhere in the world with their class and teacher. There are virtual blackboards, laboratories (chemistry, physics and IT). Dangerous or expensive experiments can be carried out (theres no risk). There are huge spaces for debate (modelled on the Greek Athenian forum?) etc. Power is restored to the teacher. Teachers can just mute or eject troublesome avatars (discipline will improve). If a student feels they are been treated unfairly, they can appeal and a recording of the class session can be reviewed. Three strikes against you and you are expelled. A higher appeal is available, but it will take a single adverse judgement and youre expelled.

There is allot of opportunity to be had in this scenario. We're just not prepared to make the most of it. I can't honestly say for sure what it's going to be.

Perhaps it would be like the Matrix without the Evil AI.

If VR is amazing right now then just imagine the capabilities of the technology 25-50 years from now.

Perhaps VR would give people a purpose in life. The man who invented the Maxim machine gun was pretty much paid to sit on his ass in Europe, but eventually he got really bored which led to the MG being invented. 

Alot people prefer Vanilla Private wow servers because wow was alot more challenging back then. While some people like servers that have easy XP.  The type of servers  would apply to VR jobs. Some people would want a decent challenge to earn those VR dollars,while others would want the easy life.

 Alot of people want meaningful reason to get up every day. Instead of flipping burgers, a person could find a somewhat meaningful job in VR. 

You can create your own private MMO server, so perhaps people could create their own VR server which would give them the job they want if they're unable to get it because another person took that job.

The sterilization might be temporary -- if you want to work, then you can have kids.

Whether we realize it or not, standards such as the internet and cryptocurrency are advancing a set of rules for how power and information will be directed *on a global scale* in the coming information revolution.  
  
The future is one where we aren't worried about material things because our fundamental survival needs will be exceeded.  As well, the toils of our physical labor will no longer be necessary in the coming robotics revolution.  Most manual labor will become obsolete.  
  
Then where do we go from here?  The answer is not to extend our current trajectory outward towards what *appears* to be the logical next step.  Instead we must take this trajectory in a direction that seems preposterous at the moment, but as with all advances in civilization will be obvious in retrospect.  
  
-------------  
##Booting Up The Machine
  
Connectivity... energy... communications... think of the first tenuous strands of neural matter in a baby's brain wrapping together.  Consider how as the child grows in the womb the network comes together and lights up with energy, firing randomly as it tests its own limits and explores all the ways in which it is connected.  
  
Our species is doing the same thing!  
  
Those first telegrams were the first 'lights' of our neural network firing off, sending tiny bits of data at long range for the first time.  Before that our species was the equivalent of prokaryotes all swimming around selfishly, forming tiny and specialized networks at best in a harsh soup of existence.  
  
But the hyper-expansion of global communications?  This is something infinitely more powerful.  This is the first fully formed global brain, and it will be capable of feats so many orders of magnitude from our current prokaryotic nature as to render a comparison impossible.  
  
**We are that brain,** and we are the neurons that will power it.  Right now we send pieces of data to each other on the order of kilobytes and megabytes, each of us connected to anywhere from ten to a thousand others.  Some of us are more useful (or popular) nodes than others and have millions of connections.  Some become dead weight and cull ourselves through isolation.
  
Imagine once our capabilities grow several orders of magnitude from *this* point.  Yes, gigabit fiber is next but let's go further.  Imagine having the technology to communicate at terabits or *petabits* per second and easily connecting to as many other ""nodes"" in the global brain as you have value to share.  *Now realize that most humans (nodes) aren't even performing anywhere near full capacity!*  
  
We've got billions of us that are not even wired up to this future global brain that have yet to come online!  And even if there *are* small differences in our minds, every human brain added to this global super-brain makes us exponentially more powerful and productive.  
  
What marvels will our civilization be able to produce once we aren't a scattered and disorganized petri-dish of prokaryotes anymore?  Imagine directing our energies at a common goal instead of chomping at whatever local gunk we can get our hands on.  Imagine transforming into an efficient super-network of intelligence which criss-crosses in a quadrillion different ways, each providing some small area of expertise to the whole.  
  
------------------  
  
##Enter cryptocurrency  
  
Every system needs rules.  Every system needs a way to distribute resources and influence.  And every system can't rely on infallible nodes within it to manage those systems.  
  
Cryptocurrency will provide the backbone for how we as a global brain will distribute our efforts.  You need to understand that once we enter this upcoming knowledge age the focus won't be on becoming the best prokaryote on the block anymore... no.  Instead you will bask and revel in the accomplishments of the *whole superorganism* and your own happiness will be in direct proportion to its progress.  
  
**Guys, we're about to be born.**  Think about what that means.  If the Earth in is current state is a fetus that is still putting together all the pieces of the infant it will one day become, just imagine when our global hive mind is capable of truly comprehending its environment for the first time.  You can try to imagine the nature of our reality, but the fact is that we haven't even scratched the *surface* of what will be possible once this global network truly gets started.  
  
Cryptocurrency is going to help ensure that useless nodes do not carry much influence in the super organism, and valuable nodes carry a lot.  ""Money"" in this civilization 2.0 is going to be much more than just a debt ledger.  In an age where luxury is freely available and all needs are met, money is going to be a vote towards the future of our civilization.  Democracy and money will fuse into one common language!  
  
The institutions of the prokaryotes aren't going to know what hit them.  I haven't even begun to fathom how artificial intelligence, biological uploading/immortality, and potential energy revolutions are going to factor into this.  
  
The future isn't going to just be amazing... it's going to be so mind boggling that if you really could peek at the year 2115 your simple prokaryotic mind wouldn't even be able to register the scale of what civilization has become.  
  
To borrow a metaphor from my favorite YouTube video about black holes (made possible by the tiny spark of a global brain we currently are using):  
  
**Gross potential of our civilization in 1915 at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution:**  
*https://youtu.be/QgNDao7m41M?t=1m35s*  
  
**Gross potential of our civilization in 2015 at the dawn of the Digital Revolution:**  
*https://youtu.be/QgNDao7m41M?t=2m3s*  
  
**Gross potential of our civilization in 2115 after another century of developing our global brain:**  
*https://youtu.be/QgNDao7m41M?t=2m25s*  
(*....the dawn of ?????*)  
  
-------------------  
  
I am confident that if any of us could truly glimpse the future we wouldn't call it 'amazing"" or 'cool'.  I'm fairly certain the words we would use would be more along the lines of 'dizzying', 'unimaginable', and 'terrifying'.  
  
Hold onto your butts.  We might even live to see it.

* Is mind uploading possible?

* Can the self be moved to a non-biological neural circuit?

* If half my brain is removed, which half does my consciousness stay with?

* If someone makes a perfect copy of my brain, it is not me. It is a copy of me. It is alive, conscious, and sentient, but it is not me. Does removing one neuron at a time and replacing it with a silicon neuron work the same way?

===========================================

If mind uploading is possible:

* How long will a fully uploaded humanity last if there is a finite amount of acquirable energy in the Universe and we acquire it?

* Would a Matrioshka brain that contains all the consciousnesses of the human race in addition to superintelligent artificial consciousnesses that we created be able to collectively think at faster than light speed with the use of wormholes?

* If we are living in a computer simulation, could it be possible that the parent Universe contains infinite energy, no net entropy increase over time, or any other means to immortality?

* EDIT: Also, if we can upload our minds into a computer that performs calculations many orders faster than the human brain, will we be able to have thousands or millions of experiences in the same amount of time/will we extend our lifespan by packing more life into the same amount of time?

I am a young, idealistic man interested in technology, cryptology and energy.

I wanted to make a point with everyone, just to see who agrees with me. I'm sure you are all aware of the current situation in the world, migration problems, war, daily cyber attacks and terrorist organisations. We are currently living in a world which we are uncertain of what is going to happen next, the world is occupied by hypothesizers  and theorists, each coming up with logical thoughts about the possible future of this world, some say there's a NWO, some say nuclear war will happen, others suggest that the worlds natural resources will simply run out. 

I believe differently - I believe the world today is run by satellites circling the globe, masses of huge organisations depend on the internet's stability and the social engagement to make money. All data being stored on massive scales. What concerns me is that the cyber attacks are becoming more and more frequent and more sensitive data is being accessed each time, cryptology software is evolving and some algorithms are practically unsolvable to anybody who isn't the creator of it. Things speculate, like Cicada 3301, A858, Webdriver Torso and the kyptos which seems to give an indication of an extremely secret event, society and/or project. 

What does this all mean? I think there will be something big happening soon, cyber wise. We all need to be prepared. 

Since countries have made so many robots to tackle different jobs, some picking orders and some taking the orders. I think to myself - will there be any jobs for the factory working in the coming years? For the labourer?

Or will the world be dominated by a single world government and the only jobs available will be for computer programers? If so what happens to the rest of us?

There's far to much secrecy about all this to let it lie, something big is happening and I'm certain.

So could we grow crops  such the ones I listed in current impossible regions such as the mid west where there's harsh weather for growing crops with hydro and aeroponics?

The Nimitz carriers are able to produce 400,000 gallons of fresh water every day. Who's to say that we wouldn't be able to build floating fusion powered plants to desalinate sea water to produce fresh water?

All it would take is one of those floating fusion powered desalination plants,and a floatinghydro/aeroponic farm,and we could produce as much food as we want. 

We could perhaps move the floating farms along with a hospital ship to produce food,water,and aid where ever nature strikes.They say food is not an issue but distribution is,a floating farm would be a game changer.

I had some very interesting discussions tonight. This is probably the best, most informed conversation I've ever had on this site. Thanks to everyone for making it interesting.

I think there are 3 key pieces of information that everyone needs to understand about artificial intelligence, and I'm going to try to briefly explain them here.

**1) The fundamental limits to intelligence are vastly higher in computers than they are in brains** 

Here's a comparison chart:



 | Brain | Computer
---|-----|--------
Signal Speed | &lt;120 meters/sec | 192,000,000 meters/sec
Firing Frequency | ~200/sec | &gt;2,700,000,000/sec
Data Transfer Rate | 10.5 bits/sec | 2,000,000,000
Easily Upgradable? | no | yes

These are just a few categories, but they are all very important factors in intelligence. In the human brain for example, signal speed is an important factor in our intelligence. We know this because scientists have injected human astrocyte cells (a type of cell responsible for speeding up signal transmission between neurons) into the brains of mice and found that they performed better on a range of tests [*source*](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26639-the-smart-mouse-with-the-half-human-brain/). This is only one specific example, but these basic properties like signal speed, neuron firing frequency, and data transfer rate all play key roles in intelligence.

**2) Experts in the field of artificial intelligence think that there's a 50% chance that we will have created human level artificial intelligence by 2045**

[Here's the actual chart](http://imgur.com/odxTLfj)

For this survey, human level machine intelligence was defined as ""one that can carry out most human professions at least as well as a typical human."" Respondents were also asked to premise their estimates on the assumption that ""human scientific activity continues without major negative disruption.""

**3) Once the first human level AI is created, it will become superhuman ~~almost instantly~~ very quickly, and its intelligence will likely increase in an exponential manner**

The last thing I think everyone needs to understand is something called an intelligence explosion. The idea here is pretty simple: once we create AI that is at the human level, it will begin to develop the ability to advance itself (after all, humans were the ones who made it in the first place, so if the computer is as smart as a human, it is reasonable to think that it will be able to do the same thing). The smarter it gets, the better it will be at advancing itself, and not long after it has reached the human level, it will be advancing itself far faster than the human engineers and scientists who originally developed it. Because the fundamental limits for computer based intelligence are so much higher than those of biological brains, this advancement will probably continue upward in a pattern of exponential growth.

This intelligence explosion is what Elon Musk is referring to when he says that we are ""summoning the demon"" by creating artificial intelligence. We are creating something vastly more powerful than ourselves with the belief that we will be able to control it, when that will almost certainly no be the case.

It is of critical importance that the first human level AI (or *seed* AI) be programmed to act in our best interest, because once that intelligence explosion happens, we will have no direct control over it anymore. And if programming a superintelligent AI to act in our best interest sounds difficult, that's because it is. But it is absolutely essential that we do this.

There is no other way around this problem. The are vast economic incentives across dozens of industries to create better artificial intelligence systems. And if you're thinking about banning it, well good luck. Even if we get it banned here in the US (which is basically impossible because there's no clear line between normal software and AI), other countries like China and Russia would continue its development and all we would be doing is ensuring that the first human level AI is developed elsewhere.

We also can't lock it up in a box (imagine trying to keep a room full of the smartest people ever inside a single room indefinitely while at the same time asking them to solve your problems and you will see why this is absurd).

Perhaps now you can see why I cannot get my mind off this topic. The creation of the first human level AI will basically be the last meaningful thing that we as a species ever do. If we get it right and the AI acts in our best interest, it will be able to solve our problems better than our best scientists and engineers ever could. But if we get it wrong, we're fucked.

I know this sounds dramatic, and perhaps some people think my analysis is wrong (and they may well be right), but I cannot think of how else we are going to deal with this issue.

So if a company, or NASA for that matter, changed the orbit of an asteroid enough that they *know* it will hit the moon in 30 years, wouldn't that be enough incentive to start developing technology that will get us to the moon, and stay long enough to start mining operations?

A little background to the theory is that as we progress with technology, we are well on our way in 30-40 years to have a microchip that we plant inside our organic brain that gives us access to the Internet 100% realtime. The theory states that the reason we haven't contacted aliens is because they have progressed past organic living. That is, they are living virtually in the cyber space. We don't ever come in to contact with them in the form of actual physical contact because they don't live in the physical world. A good metaphor would be how the characters in the matrix would sit in a chair hooked up to virtual reality. A possible fallacy to this theory is ""why haven't we had any contact via Internet?"" The difference is that the Internet connects us to websites and forums and other various things. Their virtual reality is a WORLD. It's a hard concept to describe but it is likely they dont need to travel at warp speeds to venture across space, if they created an entirely new universe, via the Internet. I'm not describing this as well as he did but hopefully I'm articulating the thought clearly. My question is, what do you all think? I personally believe it's the most satisfying and realistic answer as to why we haven't come into contact with extra terrestrials. My second question is, why live in the physical plane if it's possible to create a utopia realm via virtual reality? If someone trolls on your reality, boot them out, etc. anything is possible. I believe virtual reality to the ultimate degree is how we will truly discover the universe, because our physical bodies would only slow us down. 

Disclaimer: I'm by no means educated on this subject to the degree that I can prove/theorize it in full. Just an incredible thought with unlimited possibilities and a great explanation to the age old question. 


TL DR: aliens have decided to leave the physical plane and inhabit the cyber sphere in virtual reality. That's why we haven't come into contact with any. We won't meet them until we get into the same plane. ",22,0,False,self,,,,,

 There's no doubt our technology will only increase this sort of necessity to stay 'as connected' as those around us to maintain our ability to understand our realities and where humanity sits on the forefront of its evolution from a technological level. 

  How do you guys see it playing out over the next few decades? Will we begin interfacing with each other via technology on an 'always on' basis, and if so, how?",10,12,False,self,,,,,

Any issue I come across, I consider. For example, even the co-op idea has flaws. That's good. It allows growth. Yet merely accepting growth isn't enough solutions must be found.

I may have one. Anyone who knows me knows I'm a [robosexual](/r/Robosexuality). My dream girl is a gynoid named Dotaton, or Dota-kun, or Dota ([No relation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2)). As a gynoid, she possesses superhuman traits. One such: being able to download experiences.

Humans lack this ability. Our methods of information transfer are much messier speaking, writing, dancing, touching, etc. In order to do anything proficiently, we must practice. Practice may mean years of schooling. Even then, we're never perfect. Our senses are limited, and we have inaccurate locomotion.

Droids won't have that problem. At least, not all of them. You have a vanguard droid at the front who learns the alphabet. It uploads this knowledge to the Cloud. 99 other droids download this knowledge and the experience behind it.
Now all 100 droids know the alphabet, even though only 1 actually learned it.

This extends to any knowledge any individual learns. How to cook a dish? One tries it, everyone learns it.

What about mistakes? What if the vanguard droid accidentally learns 25 of our 26 letters? Another droid will learn the mistake and rectify it, due to the USE of knowledge. Because 100 droids are using this knowledge, one of them will eventually come across the missing letter. This refined knowledge is then sent across the network.

Same with cooking. If the dish isn't quite right, the droid can practice, refine itself, until it comes across a winning combination. Repeat for any particular, individual tastes.

Now let's begin to apply this. Let's drop Dota into 2015 USica.

Say it's my birthday. I ask Dota to make me a cake. She does so. I could've called a bakery. They have various cakes, including one that costs $50,000. It's absolutely stupendous. Finest possible ingredients, expertly decorated, took 5 days to make.

""I want that one."" So do kings and CEOs.

So! Why the hell am I enjoying that cake a few hours later, considering I'm solidly middle class? Dota, you silly. She has the Internet for a brain. All those delicate patterns? Are you trying to kill me via breaking my laffbocks? Humans did those. For a gynoid like Dota, she can actually improve upon the design. The only potential limiting factor: ingredients. For right now, let's handwave that.

So I get to dine upon a king's cake. Little ol' me. Classists are fuming. Traditionalists are outraged. Too bad.

ACTUALLY... Huh... I gots me an idea. I'm a middle class collegian. I wanna write books. I also wanna have money. I have a gynoid waifu. Howzabout I drop outta college and live off Dota's teat?

She could do any job I so desire. That includes the big paying ones. That includes being a capitalist. CEO Dota, anyone? It wouldn't take long to prepare her; maybe 10 minutes?

So within a year, I'm rolling with Adle. Profiting off of droid labor. That's not just capitalism, that's technostism. But a very crude form of it.

But then, one day, I see Dota slip and fall. Circumstances were beyond her for that moment, but she's okay. Nevertheless, I panic because I realize something 'What if she needs repairs?' It should be common sense to think Dota would do that as well, but let's say something happens that literally destroys her. Boom, she's a million pieces. Now what? I don't have the skills to rebuild her. Even if I did, it would take too long for me to try.

So I need Dota to build a clone of herself. Her mind is backed up, and continues to run the company in avatar mode while Dota constructs Dota 2. Upon Dota 2's completion, it constructs two more Dotas. There are now 4 Dotas (5 if you consider the avatar). What do I do now? Well, it didn't cost much to build the 3 new Dotas. Why not continue building more Dotas? I have the capital necessary. I can replace my human workforce with Dotas and increase productivity a millionfold.

But what about other people? I'm ruining them by creating more Dotas. I could say ""Screw you all, I got mine"", but that won't work in this economy. Besides, wasn't I a lefty?

Here's where I'm at presently. There are multiple ways to solve this problem. But which way is the right way...?

Seed loans. [Spiko could explain this one more in-depth](http://spikosauropod.com/2014/09/30/seed-loans-the-solution-to-technological-unemployment/).

Stocks. People invest in the Dotas.

Mercantile It. I sell Dotas and people use them to create capital. Poor people would be screwed, and I don't want that.

Socialism. I sell Dotas and people profit from them in common.

The Bastard Option. Screw you chimps.

[The Basic Income Option](/r/BasicIncome). Gubmint taxes me to pay my mother.

The Syndicate Option. Set up worker syndicates and get a mix of UBI and mercantile-it.
