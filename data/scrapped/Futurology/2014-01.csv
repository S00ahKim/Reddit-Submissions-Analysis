I think it suits me very well. I'm going for an associates, but later on I can use it to go for a bachelors.

That seems like something first on the chopping block if automation becomes as widespread as some predict. Is anybody else somewhat worried about losing their job to automation? Here in America, welfare isn't exactly in the best of shape right now...",71,79

The article is titled ""[The next fifty years](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD12xx/EWD1243a.html)"".

In it Djikstra mentions this:
&gt; Fortunately, there are a few things that we can learn from the past, for instance that *the rate at which society can absorb progress is strictly limited*, a circumstance that makes long-range predictions a lot easier. Earlier this decade (*he is talking about the 1990s*) I was told of a great invention called ""the register window""; my informant was very young, but in my ears the invention sounded very familiar because I remembered the Burroughs B5000 of 30 years before. So, if you have a bright and sound idea now, you can expect it to be hailed as a novelty around the year 2025.

I think what he means is, even if technology grows exponentially, society won't accept it. A possible example I can think of is: When we can simulate brains and upload our brains into it, people will say that is immoral or evil.

Our difficulty to change our culture can manifest as laws preventing our growth.

An actual example: 23andme was stopped from interpreting genetic markers they discover in our DNA. It doesn't matter that it is cheap to interpret our DNA, the culture/the government/the insurance companies won't let us do it.",6,10

I think learning to code is something that will have a lot of value soon, and I'd like to stay up to date. I don't know yet if I intend to get a job related to the subject, I'm just testing the waters as of now.

But I can't go more than two steps before being recommended some old book from the 90's with a funky looking cover, addressing things that feel completely archaic to me and are explained in extremely specific ways which require an obsession-like interest to keep your attention. For a domain that will determine where the future goes, it sure seems to be a lot about the past.

I get that I need to cover my basis, to at least know my way around a simple Unix system, and to have some sort of a clue about how computers first came about, but do I really need to go through the massive amount of documentation that is thrown at me? Is it all really just to give some context? Because call me crazy, but I don't seem to care about it at all, or to think it is required. In other words, I want to learn Mandarin without having to spend a few years in China, marrying a local women, and becoming a Ming Dynasty scholar. 

I can understand the interest, but to me it seems superfluous.
So my question to you is; What do I actually need to learn, in which direction should I go? 

I know that technology is evolving extremely fast, and I'd like to get to actually doing things. What aspects of coding/programming will be the most useful in the near/slightly distant future? What are some resources that teach about the subject with a more ''up-to-date'' approach? What are some communities (forums and such) that I could join, which aren't obsessed about tech-world personalities and minute details, but actually about coding and doing stuff? Should/Could I simply learn a programming language and disregard the rest?

If you work in a CS field or code on the side, what are some things you wish you wouldn't have wasted time on? And how do you plan on adapting to the ever-changing field?",18,26

We have the people and the ideas but we need to put them together and make something great. If we expect to change the world we need to start *doing*. Discussing about political ideas only gets you so far, eventually you need to apply them to something, otherwise they will get lost in an endless sea of speculation.

In order to get organized, there has to be form of place we can all go to and where we can collaborate and bring our political ideas to life. Introducing Technohumanist International. Technohumanism is a blanket term for all of the policies that are commonly seen as futurist and progressive (such as UBI, space exploration etc,). While Technohumanism won't do much in the 'real' world, Technohumanist International is an organization designed to facilitate all of these ideas and bring them under a common banner. This political movement is shaped by you and everyone else who believes in futurist ideals.

The truth is ""basic income"" is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist, and likely will never exist despite the wide adherence to this particular brand of apocalism on Reddit.

It's true that there are fundamental problems that the world needs to work out in order to bridge a tech gap that is ever widening, but within a generation that gap will start to be closed. Currently, there are industries rising from out of nowhere that most people don't have any idea about. One such is built on the foundations of the rising big data technology trend that has the potential to open up an unfathomable amount of opportunity that our imaginations are barely scratching the surface on - yes, even at the grass roots levels. 

The truth is, the whole basic income idea is fundamentally NOT based on futurology at all.  It's based on looking at the past and hamfistedly applying it to the future without taking into account the revolutions that happen along the way. We haven't even scratched the surface on the potential of such things as 3D printing, mobile technology, big data, the internet of everything, and on and on and on... 

The ideas of basic income deserve to be talked about in an economics or a political forum, but not in this one. It's very out of place in this forum and only serves to politicize this place unnecessarily over an idea that is more closely related to religious apocalyptic fervor than it is science or even reason based.",12,0

I've spent a lot of time thinking recently, given the results of recent ""studies"" conducted over the internet, which state that most people of the U.S. do not have faith in their government. Also, we're rated highly as an obstruction of world peace.

(For reference:

""Threat to World Peace"" :


http://rt.com/news/us-biggest-threat-peace-079/)

I know this is not a political subreddit, but please, bear with me - this has more to do with thought process than actual politics. Even if these reports are not founded on the most solid of data, I can't help but feel that they're correct in their assumptions.  I believe we as people, have grown too accustomed to our government's bureaucracy handling all our issues. We no longer make our country's decisions.  Moreover, we are not making decisions at all.

The majority of people that I know are more concerned with what so-and-so said on facebook, what celebrities are doing in their spare time, or maybe if we're lucky, **their rights to privacy**.  But even the issue of privacy, to me at least, wouldn't be that big of a deal if we weren't afraid of who was using it.  This comes with trust - and it's slowly, but surely, running dry. 

You can have my information, as much as I don't want you to. Heck, you already do. I'm more concerned with the state of the world than I am the state of my personal information. I'll trade you my info, for more published information regarding the amount of radiation in our ocean from the Fukushima reactors. I'll trade you for more information regarding global warming. I'll trade because if we destroy the world, what does spending time focusing on hiding my person information accomplish? These issues affect all of us. These aren't far-away lands anymore. This affects our food and our water. This affects the ocean that we have barely even begun to understand.  We don't care about the harm that is being done, because we do not see it. (Please note: this is not to say that I think that privacy rights are unimportant - just that I believe there are other issues that should be higher on our list)

For me, thinking about things like the Fukushima reactors, or other problems we've created, is upsetting, but it also gives me a new understanding - a new motivation. I began thinking about decisions, in general, that will **need** to be made by **us** - the people living now. We need to come together to figure out how to fix the issues we've created, as humans, not as nations. Science exists world-wide, and has no national borders. It has given us nuclear power, among tons of other things, that we've failed to correctly protect, and now we have to deal with the consequences. The decisions that we need to make are those of protection from ourselves.

The things of science fiction are becoming reality. the ""Singularity"" might be a long-shot, or not. Becoming ""Immortal"" even more-so, or not. Who knows?  The problem is - there are people that are trying to make these things happen. If there's one thing about humans that's been proven over and over again, it's that we're persistent in the goals that we wish to accomplish. When was the last time you heard a scientist say ""It's impossible"", then give up on whatever they were working on? If it's not accomplished in the near future, it will be in the distant future, because these ideas, realistically, are not that far-fetched. Whether or not you want to take part in these types of things will be up to you, but keep in mind that there will be people that will accept becoming ""Immortal"" if the opportunity arises. The world will go on, and these people will be the ones left behind. They will be the decision makers. We need to focus on who is trying to make this technology a reality. We cannot let this blow by us as another ""scientific discovery"" that no one knows about until the research is complete. we **NEED** to know who is going to hold the future of the human race in their hands.

If you were on the research team that discovered something that would change the way humans live forever, who would you want to be by your side, also making that discovery? I'm not a scientist, or an engineer, or a bio engineer, or anything like that - but I do live on this earth, and I do consider myself a good person. I would hope that somehow I am there, seeing the history and future of the human race in the same instant. I would hope that somehow, I can be involved in this process. I'm a human too - let me be involved.

Photo-realistic CGI and voice synthesizing, coupled with advanced AI will make it a reality.  A person's walls and floor will be video screens.  The characters will ask questions and have witty off-the-cuff banter.  A person will be able to describe their idea for a movie to their AI, and the AI will create a version of the movie for them.  Additionally, news anchors will be CGI, address viewers by name, and give viewers personalized news, giving more in-depth analysis depending on what the person wants to learn about.  ",7,4

The entire device goes from being a simpler screen to a creeper device in the eyes of the public. Non-tech nerds are incredibly difficult to persuade to adopt new technology before it is common, and allowing the camera to be so accessible is whats really ruining its relevance and adoption (not counting the price tag and limited release. Those things will change next year but the camera is here to stay.)

If Google were to remove the camera from Glass, or not have put it on in the first place, there might be outrage. But its like Apple not having copy and paste on the first iPhone, or other menial things like HBOgo being disallowed from Roku when using Comcast (no seriously FUCK that Comcast get your shit together) Once the change has taken effect the device will seem a lot less creepy.

What are your thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1uei3r/aldous_huxley_author_of_brave_new_world_wrote_a/,Asteroid_Asterisk,1388859023," I believe that the future's benefits will greatly outweigh the consequences, but we can't ignore the miniscule consequences. Aldous Huxley, author of the dystopian novel *Brave New World*, wrote a 1958 essay that predicts some of the downsides that the future may bring. The full essay can be found [here](http://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/). Here are the main points:

* The world's population will increase due to greater availability of ""death control"" than birth control. Death control measures range from antibiotics, clean water, and stronger health knowledge. Death control is cheaper and easier to provide than birth control measures such as condoms or pills. Many major religions oppose birth control but encourage death control measures such as healthier lifestyles. The combination of death control being cheaper, easier, and more socially accepted than birth control will cause population to soar in many developing countries.

* Technological progress tends to concentrate economic and political power. As machines of mass production become technologically advanced, their complexity and expense increase. Larger businesses have the funds needed to purchase the efficient machines of mass production, but smaller businesses can only afford the cheaper machines. This puts the little guy at a competitive disadvantage to larger businesses that produce products more cheaply with technologically advanced machines. As little guys are driven out of the market, the economy will become composed of a small number of large businesses. The so-called Power Elite of large businesses would then exert political control over the population.

* Society's increased organization will reduce diversity and increase conformity among people. Technological progress is often met with increased organization, such as when sophisticated machinery requires more complex social arrangements. 

* Rational and non-rational propaganda will cause people to act politically against their own self-interests. Rational propaganda twists information so that the propaganda appears to be logical. Non-rational propaganda avoids logical arguments, blames problems on scapegoats, and makes itself appear morally good. A well-informed population is necessary for a democracy, and these types of propaganda prevent people from voting for their self-interest and the common good.

* Politicians will apply the same propaganda techniques used to sell products as they attract voters. They will take advantage of voters' fears and weaknesses rather than their strengths. Instead of focusing on how to make better government decisions, politicians will act as entertainers by delivering short speeches that oversimplify political issues. As television and radio expose politicians to the general public, politicians will appeal to short attention spans and try to appear glamorous. 

* Some of the more malicious governments may change the citizens' viewpoints by subjecting them to stress. Every person has a certain breaking point when it comes to stress; when people reach that breaking point, their opinions are easily molded. In the future, some governments may use torture against enemies of the state so that they reach that breaking point of change.

What are your suggestions to counter some of these downsides? The world will become better as time passes, but negating these downsides will improve the progress of future eras. The essay I linked has ideas on how to prevent the downsides, but I purposely excluded that from the main points so that you could form your own opinion.",6,27

First we should ask, does the one-tenth of one percent even want a robot Utopia? The reductive answer might be a no. 

But is that a logical position for them to have? Is it even a conscious position at all? Whats wrong with pushing mass automation at a faster rate? How long until robots are doing all the brain surgeries on the planet? 
Right now it feels like there are a lot of people dragging their feet. The balance is lagging.

The reason to resist a technological, societal shift of any caliber might be simply generational and emotional. Perhaps its not that they wouldnt enjoy the social benefits of a world, a country, or a community with less conflict. I dont think they actually disdain the notion of greater equality as a principle whatsoever (although theyve done well convincing the ladder climbers of this). Maybe its more that theyre mimicking a circumstance where their entire generation was subconsciously and even overtly infantilized and as natural death approaches alongside the burgeoning digital age, its gotten awkward for a lot of people in rationalizing their place in history. 

Its right in the name. The moniker -- baby boomer  juxtaposed against the meme of a greatest generation could be something that a one percenter retiring soon might feel like they have to recreate in order to overcome some type of existential pain. I get the sense that a lot of people are trying to square the cognitive dissonance of their great model-elders dying off with the suffering they endured to be part of that now vanishing adult group. So now they have to fit in with the babies they were told to feel superior toward, and worked to outpace. 

The romanticized ideation of almost fatalistic 20th century American power seems to not only exist in theory, but has historically acted as a self-fulfilling prophecy. To be part of the powerful older group, you had to essentially disown most of your peers. But what if the experience the baby boomers were taught to admire has been purposely overrated?  And perhaps we should just blame an amoeba for all this, but I think there is hope.
The hope I have is actually simple. I see this cartoonish phenotype of an aging, drunken, power broker naturally fading away. Maybe it seems overly simplistic, but it could start with something as simple as better drug choices. How many bad laws get created off drunken shit talking between these limo-riding types? I really think in 50 years when its no longer frowned-upon to smell like weed, it follows that well have better laws on the horizon -- not because the higher ups will be stoned 24-7, but because it wont be as cool to be a functional alcoholic. Right now society has settled on a destructive alternative to cannabinoids and were all paying the price. 

These are the waning days of alcohol mania.  Get drunk, commit some crimes against humanity, wake up, hate the world. Rinse and repeat. 
Reagans slogan about trickle-down economics lifting all boats wasnt the whole picture. But maybe the internet has legalized weed. So Ill end this thought exercise with a weed metaphor - when the branches of this Tree we call society are no longer afraid to grow up, grow around some of the older, shadier branches, well get new sources of light, the whole tree will get stronger, and it will be better for every leaf.

We're almost halfway through this decade and so far it seems like the main trends and fads of the 2010s are:

-Synthpop, Electropop, EDM (Dubstep, Trap, Drum &amp; Bass, etc.), Electro and Progressive House, Indie and Alternative Rock, Country, Swag Rap/Hip-Hop

-Flamboyant 80s inspired colors are popular like teal, turquoise, pink, chartreuse, etc.

-Tighter-fitting clothes

-Hipster Movement

-Anti-Fashion Movement

-Smartphone, Laptop, Tablet and Wi-Fi Revolution

-Significance of Mobile Apps and Social Platforms

-Awareness of Internet Surveillance

-Mainstream acceptance of homosexuality and transgenderism

-Mainstream acceptance of science and technological progress

-Increasing rates of secularism/irreligiosity

-Marijuana Legalization

-Arab Spring

-Declining face-to-face social interactions

I think these things sum up most of the main trends that future generations will recognize when they think of the 2010s. Maybe on top of that will come a 3D Printing Revolution, 4KTVs and Smart TVs, Wearable Tech Revolution and the rise of 'Everyware' or the 'Internet of Things,' like smart sensors and whatnot, in the latter half of this decade.

Destroyed a thousand times, it has risen a thousand times out of its own ashes as hardy and vigorous as ever. Whenever there is long-continued mass unemployment, machines get the blame anew. This fallacy is still the basis of many labor union practices. The public tolerates these practices because it either believes at bottom that the unions are right, or is too confused to see just why they are wrong.

The belief that machines cause unemployment, when held with any logical consistency, leads to preposterous conclusions. Not only must we be causing unemployment with every technological improvement we make today, but primitive man must have started causing it with the first efforts he made to save himself from needless toil and sweat.

To go no further back, let us turn to Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations, published in 1776. The first chapter of this remarkable book is called Of the Division of Labor, and on the second page of this first chapter the author tells us that a workman unacquainted with the use of machinery employed in pin-making could scarce make one pin a day, and certainly could not make twenty, but with the use of this machinery he can make 4,800 pins a day. So already, alas, in Adam Smiths time, machinery had thrown from 240 to 4,800 pin-makers out of work for every one it kept. In the pin-making industry there was already, if machines merely throw men out of jobs, 99.98 percent unemployment. Could things be blacker?

Things could be blacker, for the Industrial Revolution was just in its infancy. Let us look at some of the incidents and aspects of that revolution. Let us see, for example, what happened in the stocking industry. New stocking frames as they were introduced were destroyed by the handicraft workmen (over 1000 in a single riot), houses were burned, the inventors were threatened and obliged to flee for their lives, and order was not finally restored until the military had been called out and the leading rioters had been either transported or hanged.

Now it is important to bear in mind that insofar as the rioters were thinking of their own immediate or even longer futures their opposition to the machine was rational. For William Felkin, in his History of the Machine-Wrought Hosiery Manufactures (1867), tells us (though the statement seems implausible) that the larger part of the 50,000 English stocking knitters and their families did not fully emerge from the hunger and misery entailed by the introduction of the machine for the next forty years. But insofar as the rioters believed, as most of them undoubtedly did, that the machine was permanently displacing men, they were mistaken, for before the end of the nineteenth century the stocking industry was employing at least a hundred men for every man it employed at the beginning of the century.

Arkwright invented his cotton-spinning machinery in 1760. At that time it was estimated that there were in England 5,200 spinners using spinning wheels, and 2,700 weaversin all, 7,900 persons engaged in the production of cotton textiles. The introduction of Arkwrights invention was opposed on the ground that it threatened the livelihood of the workers, and the opposition had to be put down by force. Yet in 1787twenty-seven years after the invention appeareda parliamentary inquiry showed that the number of persons actually engaged in the spinning and weaving of cotton had risen from 7,900 to 320,000, an increase of 4,400 percent.

If the you read * Recent Economic Changes,* by David A. Wells, published in 1889, you will find passages that, except for the dates and absolute amounts involved, might have been written by our technophobes of today. Let me quote a few:

&gt;During the ten years from 1870 to 1880, inclusive, the British mercantile marine increased its movement, in the matter of foreign entries and clearances alone, to the extent of 22,000,000 tons... yet the number of men who were employed in effecting this great movement had decreased in 1880, as compared with 1870, to the extent of about three thousand (2,990 exactly). What did it? The introduction of steam-hoisting machines and grain elevators upon the wharves and docks, the employment of steam power, etc....
&gt; 
&gt; In 1873 Bessemer steel in England, where its price had not been enhanced by protective duties, commanded kr493.46 ($80) per ton; in 1886 it was profitably manufactured and sold in the same country for less than kr123.36 ($20) per ton. Within the same time the annual production capacity of a Bessemer converter has been increased fourfold, with no increase but rather a diminution of the involved labor.
&gt; 
&gt; The power capacity already being exerted by the steam engines of the world in existence and working in the year 1887 has been estimated by the Bureau of Statistics at Berlin as equivalent to that of 200,000,000 horses, representing approximately 1,000,000,000 men; or at least three times the working population of the earth....

One would think that this last figure would have caused Mr. Wells to pause, and wonder why there was any employment left in the world of 1889 at all; but he merely concluded, with restrained pessimism, that under such circumstances industrial overproduction . . . may become chronic.

In the depression of 1932, the game of blaming unemployment on the machines started all over again. Within a few months the doctrines of a group calling themselves the Technocrats had spread through the country like a forest fire. I shall not weary the reader with a recital of the fantastic figures put forward by this group or with corrections to show what the real facts were. It is enough to say that the Technocrats returned to the error in all its native purity that machines permanently displace menexcept that, in their ignorance, they presented this error as a new and revolutionary discovery of their own. It was simply one more illustration of Santayanas aphorism that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

The Technocrats were finally laughed out of existence; but their doctrine, which preceded them, lingers on. It is reflected in hundreds of make-work rules and featherbed practices by labor unions; and these rules and practices are tolerated and even approved because of the confusion on this point in the public mind.

Testifying on behalf of the United States Department of Justice before the Temporary National Economic Committee (better known as the TNEC) in March 1941, Corwin Edwards cited innumerable examples of such practices. The electrical union in New York City was charged with refusal to install electrical equipment made outside of New York State unless the equipment was disassembled and reassembled at the job site. In Houston, Texas, master plumbers and the plumbing union agreed that piping prefabricated for installation would be installed by the union only if the thread were cut off one end of the pipe and new thread were cut at the job site. Various locals of the painters union imposed restrictions on the use of sprayguns, restrictions in many cases designed merely to make work by requiring the slower process of applying paint with a brush. A local of the teamsters union required that every truck entering the New York metropolitan area have a local driver in addition to the driver already employed. In various cities the electrical union required that if any temporary light or power was to be used on a construction job there must be a full-time maintenance electrician, who should not be permitted to do any electrical construction work. This rule, according to Mr. Edwards, often involves the hiring of a man who spends his day reading or playing solitaire and does nothing except throw a switch at the beginning and end of the day.

One could go on to cite such make-work practices in many other fields. In the railroad industry, the unions insist that firemen be employed on types of locomotives that do not need them. In the theaters unions insist on the use of scene shifters even in plays in which no scenery is used. The musicians union required so-called stand-in musicians or even whole orchestras to be employed in many cases where only phonograph records were needed.

By 1961 there was no sign that the fallacy had died. Not only union leaders but government officials talked solemnly of automation as a major cause of unemployment. Automation was discussed as if it were something entirely new in the world. It was in fact merely a new name for continued technological advance and further progress in labor-saving equipment.",38,4

I imagine real breast tissue could be manufactured by building an extracellular matrix in a mold shaped to the patients desired breast size/shape, a fibrous sac (3d printed, made primarily of collagen protein) and populated with the patient's own cells could be engineered, then implanted much as synthetic implants are. The only missing piece is providing a blood supply to the implanted tissue. This could be achieved with micro surgery. I don't see much complication beyond providing a blood supply.

Penis enlargement on the other hand is more complicated. First it's a functional organ that must retain sensitivity and erection/flaccid function, fertility and urination. The major problem with increasing girth and length is two factors, first the corpus cavernosum, nerves, blood vessels and urethra don't stretch after puberty. The tissue hardens making future growth impossible with 2014 science without primitive surgery with poor results. 

A hollow 3D printed extracellular matrix populated with patients cells could be designed to fit over the patient's penis once the skin, albuginea and probably the head is removed (dont worry it will be replaced by the 3D printed penis and feel perfectly normal). It would look like a very thick condom sleeve made of human tissue. A 1-3inch long 3D printed urethra will be required to connect the longer graft to the original penis urethra. 

The 3D printed sleeve would be mostly functional erectile tissue, not inert tissue or cells that do not change during flaccid and erect states. This would also require hundreds of micro connections to blood vessels. After healing it would be indistinguishable from a natural born very large penis with no visible scaring.

The patient's penis can be scanned for perfect fit and the size ans shape can be custom modeled on a computer. 

So the following breakthroughs must come first:

* 1)stemcell mastery and Nervous system repair (spinal cord injury)
* 2)3D printed skin/tissue with microscopic detail, nerves and capillaries, etc
* 3)3D printed natural complexity (looks and functions real not fake looking)
* 4)scarless surgery/mastery of blocking scar tissue growth

Those are 4 very advanced, almost magical medical breakthroughs, but they aren't that far away, maybe 10-15 years. Whoever figures it out will be the world's first trillionaire, also bringing tissue engineering that much further with a few hundred billion dollars invested for new treatments for illnesses and injuries ",5,6

It changes so much about how life is supposed to be lived.

I am curious to know how many of you think that you will not die thanks to gerontology. I personally think that it won't pan out or will only give an extended version of elderly life. I know that some organisms never age or die naturally, but I don't think humans will be able to sufficiently alter ourselves after birth to avoid death. Maybe with prenatal genetic engineering it could be possible, but I'm not sure. 

Elderly people look damaged to me. People look the same into their sixties, but after that they start to shrink and get bony and vascular on the surface. I think I would need anti-aging medicine before reaching that stage for it to be effective, but that gives biotechnology about 40 years to understand aging to work for me. I don't think it can be done in that little time. 

I don't count mind downloading and cybernetic augmentation as immortality. If I download a copy of my brain into a non-biological substrate I am just making a copy of myself, not extending my life. The copy can exist indefinitely, but to me this is not immortality. Also, if I am so heavily modified with machine parts that I am no longer recognizably human I don't think that would qualify as immortality either. That would be more like the creation of a new organism with a different lifespan. ",9,2

I live in the inner city so one of these devices could be very useful.  I'm not worried about loss of exercise as I use a standing desk and hit the gym 6 days a week.

Our brains can almost always detect the difference between a nap and a corpse -- what would it take for machines? Just lots of training with pictures, or something more? (And granted, we don't always get it right either -- but we know there's something primal in seeing a body.)

Also, how do you train a machine to recognize something that has killed or harmed someone? Stabbed versus hit with red paint. Real human-damaging violence or acting. What barriers (besides processing power) remain to make machines good at this? 

These instincts are so deep in us, I'm wondering if this isn't one of those final frontiers of bridging the gap between our brains and AI.",8,5

They span over several different topics and help explore possible different futures.


I will admit that there are plenty of TED talks in which the speaker is simply verbally masturbating, but there still are plenty of good ideas if you dig far enough.  These aren't the best of the best, but are more recent to demonstrate that there still is value in the talks.

I will disclaim that I have zero affiliation with TED talks, just that I listen to a lot of them while I work.

[Rose George's view of the shipping industry](http://www.ted.com/talks/rose_george_inside_the_secret_shipping_industry.html) This talk was very informative for me, it opened my eyes to how important the shipping industry is.  I knew it was important, but I didn't realize just how massive it is.  Any future without a reliance on shipping is realistically unfeasible at this point.

[Krista Donaldson, how simple changes can make a world of difference](http://www.ted.com/talks/krista_donaldson_the_80_prosthetic_knee_that_s_changing_lives.html)  I like this talk a lot.  Many of us forget about the reality of the poor.  The future can come, but the poor will be left behind.  This is a way to allow for mobility, but shows different lines of thinking to focus on the lower class as a targeted market.  It definitely is a shameless plug for her company, but it shows that companies are able to profit from the third world poor without it being McDonalds, this for me opens up worlds of possibilities.

[Using drones for Deliveries](http://www.ted.com/talks/andreas_raptopoulos_no_roads_there_s_a_drone_for_that.html) This is the most futuristic of the group.  He is too optimistic though, as the reality won't be nearly as fast as he predicts, but it does open up possibilities for future delivery systems for areas that roads have not been opened up to, and allow for future markets to be opened for either drug dealers, or drug suppliers both legal and illegal.

[The kill decision should not belong to a robot](http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_suarez_the_kill_decision_shouldn_t_belong_to_a_robot.html)  This was by far the best TED talk I have ever seen.  I don't believe that the audience really understood how important his talk was.  His was the best of the series, and the most applicable for this subreddit.  I strongly agree with him, his ideas are scary for the future, yet are entirely plausible and likely unless action is taken.


These are just a few of the good talks.  I agree that most are useless and a waste of time.  Many are people humble bragging to a sophisticated crowd, but I still feel that there is value in watching the talks, its just about looking for the good ones, and reading between the lines.  I feel that of these talks posted, which I picked because I liked them, the theme shows that the future is relatively bleak for some and better for illegal activity.  Drug trafficking will never be easier, and anyone that opposes it will be shot down.  It also shows that a link can be made between shipping companies and drone strikes, instead of hiring a mercenary crew to guide your ship through pirate waters, that a ship can instead install several attack drones for defense.  Its potential, but unlikely, it just shows that the future might have a lot more drones in it than it does now.


Thank you, if people want I could post some of the better TED talks as separate links when they come up if they apply to this subreddit.",4,8

The thing about religion though, is it pacifies the fear of death with the promise of an afterlife. It calms your ego into thinking it will live on. Let me tell you, your ego (the part of your brain that says ""I am"") is absolutely terrified of death, and rightly so, evolution allowed those with death fearing egos to live on, since it probably allowed us to live longer and have a better chance of reproducing. 

After acquiring a computer with internet access, the obvious truth of religion became clear and I was transformed into an atheist. I had dismissed any thoughts about death afterwards, I knew there was nothing, but in the deep back area's of my mind, even without knowing it, death still bothered my ego.

After a few years I had stumbled upon the future timeline website and became hooked on the idea of futurology. What probably propelled my interest further was the proposal that there may be a way to escape death, and possibly the only realistic, scientific way as well. Without knowing it, my ego had something to latch on to, any thoughts about dying lead to solutions proposed in science. Futurology for me lead to a scientific replacement for religion, my ego needed something to tell it that it was not going to be harmed or removed in the future. 

This is how my life was until yesterday. Yesterday I watched this ted talk:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTrJqmKoveU&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player
 and realized that the ego, is just in the left hemisphere of the brain and is the part of the brain that worries about itself. Furthermore, for me, futurology was feeding it thoughts of safety. This lead up to the realization that my entire life, even if I had not been aware of it, I had been living in fear, the fear of death.

The fear of death is irrational, even if it would be better to live longer, fearing death, and turning to things like futurology for a solution is harmful. I do not fear death anymore, I do not fear the unknown and I will not feed my ego anymore, death may come to me, and I have accepted that. When you are dead, there is no more ego to worry (as shown in the ted talk) and thus the fear of death is irrational. After I had made this realization, I had felt like a huge weight had just been lifted off of me, like I was being choked my entire life and now could finally breathe. What is important is the passing moment and what you do with your time here and now (right this second). Do not feed your ego and ponder fears of the future, enjoy the present immensely.",51,12

The nation just nationalises the natural resources, and uses that wealth to fund it for every citizen. This makes far more sense than letting a few people become billionaires just because they ""own"" the resources themselves as in Russia and Australia.

Similarly, the machines for mass production could be nationalised so that the benefits of automation are shared, and naturally scarce things like rented housing would have to be too, to prevent inflation. But again, I don't see why the alternative, of people making millions just because they have some deeds to property or machines is any better?

This would seem to solve a lot of the issues regarding financing the basic income scheme from taxation (and ensuring it can be paid at a decent rate). The chicken and egg problem still remains though - that if we were to implement the basic income tomorrow, the economy couldn't stand it as the automation of a lot of work isn't ready (like truck driving, distribution, etc.), however, without the basic income, there is little incentive to invest in the automation of this work (if it's cheaper to pay people minimum wage or less for example).

I should add that this idea isn't particularly new. It is very similar to the ideas of Edward Bellamy in _Looking Backward From 2000 to 1887_ and _Equality_ - both excellent futurologist books written in the 1880s/1890s.",6,7

Since it is set to release today I think now would be a good time to create a thread to discuss the movie.  I saw it and found it overall pretty enjoyable.  Related to futurology, I really liked subtle clues about the future.  

Small things like how books and paper are still around for sentimental value, how everyone seems to have a very artsy career since we assume AI and machines might be doing the heavy lifting.

Sometimes there are oddities like how their cell phones seem no better (actually worse) than ours and there was a hotdog vendor not a robot in a cart.

I think AI was portrayed decently.  Seems pretty crazy how OS 1 somehow nailed emotional\human intelligence levels first and put any competition to shame.  Really liked how AI seemed to get ""bored"" with us and move on (hinted maybe into another dimension).

She's brain-dead after complications from a tonsillectomy, and her parents are refusing to take her off life support.  This is obviously less than optimal.

Let's push for her parents to do an IAMA, and then introduce them to cryonics in the thread.  It'll be better for Jahi since she'll have less chance of brain damage before the technology to revive her exists.  It'll be better for her parents since it will be by _far_ cheaper even in a relatively short period of time, and because they won't tie up their time and emotional wellbeing caring for her.  And it'll be better for society as a whole, since it'll put cryonics in a positive spotlight, and hopefully bring it to the attention of more people.

Edit: It occurs to me that it'd be simpler to discreetly introduce them to cryonics, AMA or no.  Might be more likely to lend an ear without the public opening up fresh wounds.",2,5

What were your thoughts on this film involving advanced AI?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1uxklu/her_discussion_thread_have_you_heard_of_the_movie/,aufleur,1389407701,"I watched this movie last night before bed and I must say, wow. 

You know, I was excited about this film from the moment I heard of it(which subscriber to Futurology wouldn't be?) mostly because I personally feel we are very close to a reality similar in the one depicted in the movie.

Without attempting to spoil anything, I just want to start a discussion on this film. If you haven't heard of it, or maybe you have, here are some reviews;

* [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/) **8.6/10**

* [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/her/) **93%**

Clearly the critics seem to agree: *this is a movie worth watching*. Jaqouin Pheonix does such an amazing job in this film that your heart aches for him. His co-star, Scarlette Johanson(voice of our AI, ""Samantha"") is incredible as well. Their chemistry on screen is one that will make you laugh, cry, and provoke strong thoughts on *what it means to be human*. 

This movie left me in deep thought. I found myself the next morning still feeling the emotions on screen, but mostly I found myself in awe. 

If anyone has been paying attention [IBM unveiled their plans for Watson today](http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/09/technology/enterprise/ibm-watson/) essentially placing this budding artificial intelligence system in the hands of developers. Watching ""Her"" and reading a newstory like this will really make your head get lost in the dream worthy potential of this technology ,and what it means for humanity, good or bad. 

I think one thing is for sure, we are very close to something like ""Her"" becoming a reality and I think it's creators know this. This movie is as good as entertainment as it is a philosphical window into the future of human/AI relations. 

I'm impressed and I think this movie is something I'd like others to watch, even if it's only for the romance. My head can't stop thinking about it, I need this discussion! Is it just me, or was the end of this movie hinting at the singularity? 

Cheers :)",6,9

Currently our economies are based on growth and quick profit, bidding and betting on possible values of concepts. Rather than creating actual value and 'wealth' for people.

In this I would define value as something people need: water, food, shelter, etc. And wealth as things people want: TVs, computers, video games, etc.

Today we are lead to believe that scarcity drives our economy not enough food, water, land, fuel, TVs, DVDs, etc to go around and therefore we must ration it. By driving up the cost of an item you make sure that only those who really want it can get it, and limiting the amounts that they can get.

This idea was seen in practice when superstorm Sandy struck the East coast of America in 2013. Some gas stations begin to ration out gas by driving up the cost to, as much as, 20$ per gallon. In this instance we see our current economic model in action, rather than putting limits of a scare resource so that everyone can have some, we raise the price so that only some can have some and others none.

In our day to day lives this is also seen, although not as drastically. Given our current systems of production we can feed, cloth, provide shelter and clean water to every human on the planet. At least to a respectable sense. But we do not. There is a desperate need, and the resources to fill that need; neither are scarce. But we do not. 

This is because we have been lead to believe that we cannot do anything without money, humans cannot mobilize to action for any reason other than to be paid. Today the only sparse resource is money. 

A currently proposed solution, which tries to work within the existing framework is the idea of a universal basic income. Giving people a few thousand dollars a month just for being a citizen of a nation. But this itself is only a stop gap solution as it does nothing to fix the issues of inflation or the raising cost of living. Which forces a nation to issue more money to cover the needs of it citizens, thus creating more debt and adding to the existing problems.

My father often talks of his idea for a Free Exchange of Resource System, whereby in short, a store produces the amount of items it needs to fulfill demand, and that demand is created by people coming in and taking what they need. With a system of laws based around ensuring people do not waste and take only what they need. Also in this system the is not system of debts or balances. people work as much as they want and take as much as they need.

In my mind this can only work if a society fundamentally changes what drives it, not the accumulation of wealth and stuff but strives for self fulfillment and balance. Where goods are so easy to produce that it is more trouble to charge for them than it is to just give them away. And machines do all the dirty work of manufacturing and construction. 

And so I ask this question:

With the advent of advances in quantum computing and artificial  intelligence to solve highly complex optimization problems; will we see a day when our current economic system is stripped away and replace with a more fair system which can better serve mankind?

**TL;DR Will machines produce a much more fair economic system?**  ",75,82

I've been a lurker for a while and absolutely love this subreddit. It's my daily dose of inspiration.

I'm currently part of a team that's trying to re-imagine the way we interact with our home. Our belief is that a smart home is one that understands you and uses that information to help you live your life.

Based on that belief we'd really love to work on an idea that represents the beginnings of something that could essentially become J.A.R.V.I.S. in the end.

The issue is that this is a pretty long-term vision. A lot of the people we speak to argue that there are no actual problems within this space worth solving. In other words, J.A.R.V.I.S. wouldn't solve anything significant enough today for people to be interested (or at least not in the next 5+ years).

What does r/Futurology think? Are there any applications for a smart-home AI that would work today? What kind of hardware do you think would be necessary for it to work?",12,27

I didn't see the rules for this sub so I hope I am in the right place.

As robotics and AI advance I think it's reasonable to expect fully functional robotic pets in the not too distant future. At some point, these pets can be complete replicas of the pets of today. However, they will be greatly superior to biological pets in many ways. 

For one, they can be programmed to act in ways we prefer (no barking or biting, more snuggling or meowing). They will be stronger and more durable. They can even have their personalities backed up wirelessly so if something were to ever happen to them, a new one could be purchased and reprogrammed with the previous personality. 

All of the previous paragraph has been discussed and seen in popular science fiction however there is one topic I haven't seen before. What about the impact it will have on living pets. Why would anyone want to own a real pet when they could have a replica that could potentially live forever? ""Yea, I was going to get a real Labrador Retriever but I just don't have the time to train it and deal with all the heart break when it dies."" 

Obviously there will be people who will still prefer the real thing but I think it will be the minority and this could have a huge impact on the different breeds of pets in the future. How can you breed your Akita if the closest mate is 1000 miles away?

Some friends and I are working on a project to create software, organizations, websites, and movements to work on creating a new optimal future for us all. 

We're currently looking to recruit a team of thinkers to plan out how to do this. The team is already quite large and I believe the readership of /r/furutology could bring a lot to the table. 

If you're interested, please reply with what sorts of technologies most interest you, and what time you can devote to the project.

Look forward to working with you :)

If history is a guide - we can't rely on the general ""goodness"" of mankind.

How will we prevent the ability of an AI or super-augmented human from ""capturing"" another conscious mind  and torturing that mind for what may ""seem"" to that mind an eternity?

For instance, if I were captured by terrorists today and tortured - I would have some ""hope"" that my body would eventually give out and that I would die (and the suffering, in theory, would end). However, after the Singularity - it would be possible for something or someone to capture my conscious mind (my ""brain"" file) and torture it from that moment on until infinity.  It could use ""programs"" to submit me to every imaginable (and those yet imagined) horror over and over again every minute for hundreds, thousands, millions....trillions of years. A very real Dante's Inferno.

How can this be stopped? How will it be monitored? How will it be discovered? 

While I'm certainly a supporter of using technology for the ""good"" (in the Star Trek sense), I'm not so naive to think that isn't possible for a few sociopaths (maybe even one) to ruin the party.

A person being any sort of individual that is uniquely identifiable as having something to say, in any way, about what it needs to function well, and what it has to offer as part of it's function in the universe.

I was wondering, what do you guys think of this?  Will going to malls and shopping stores continue to be very popular, or will online shopping take over and physical shopping become more of a novelty?

If stores like JC Penney and Macys find it unprofitable to maintain large shopping spaces, and become online retailers like Amazon, what will go in place of that retail space?  Residences?  Curious of your thoughts on the matter.",7,11

Elegans worm) in cyberspace. Pretty damn exciting.

Some people have already started raising the question, is it ethical to turn the simulation of this worm on, bring it to life, and the shut it off? Of course, this specific worm isn't so much the issue, as it's killed all the time in labs. More importantly, the developers have assured the public that the worm does not yet represent a fully accurate and alive biological system, so it isn't ""conscious"" yet.

Here's the question; when is it conscious?

People have done a lot of research into strong AIs and virtual intelligent systems. A lot of these systems are just less complex versions of humans, but still subjectively [sentient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience).
For instance, Karl Sims' [evolutionary creatures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBt0imn77Zg) are competing for resources in survival of the fittest with a naturally risen goal to win. That sounds like a primitive version of my life. 
So where is the line drawn? When is it a research algorithm and when is it close enough to human intelligence that it is officially ""alive""?",2,2

He hasn't even watched the video, so bollocks to him, here are my ideas, someone go make some money off this.

I work in the care industry in the UK, so that's a clue to what they are...

1) Google Glass for care workers showing their rota, which patient they are visiting, address, any requirements for the client, meds required, jobs to do.  Voice activation to register theyve done the call (and each job).  Can be updated on the fly if an extra call is required or a change to the rota occurs.

2) Self driving wheelchairs for mobility limited people.  Use the same tech as self driving cars, on a smaller scale (and slower, so less information is required, think of the roomba). Rented to private homes and councils on a monthly subscription.

3) The phone case with the cardio sensor in it, issued to the most vulnerable patients, maybe even combined with the Disney bracelets so it can monitor the heart 24/7 and send an alert to the appropriate emergency number. Again, a monthly subscription to private customers, care homes, hospitals, surgerys, the customer base would be huge, especially with an aging population.

4) Create free online courses for carers, which can be used as official national training, but charge for the exam from the council, other care companies etc.  (IE. Be the leading training school for carers)

5) Self driving pods so people can do day trips, visit to the doctor/hospital etc.  Charge councils per trip, or have them under contract etc. (government are offering 10bn for a town to test them.  Convince a council to be the test for Extra care sites.) http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25230483

Now, I'm no businessman, I have no contacts, and I'm an unmotivated 9-5er with a 3 hour commute, and far too lazy too look into any of these.

I don't even know if they are good ideas, if they aren't, downvote into oblivion and I'll never speak of this mess again.  otherwise, someone go make some money off this.",12,17

I haven't watched it in a long time, but it stuck with me long after all of his facts and anecdotes and conclusions got buried somewhere in the back of my mind. And what little remained helped shape a foundation of curious thoughts concerning my own possible extended life span.

Let me just take you through my general line of thoughts on the matter.

What if I live to be a thousands years old? Well if I make it that far, I'll probably live to be **much** older than that. Okay, okay, shut up brain, just answer the question. What if I live to be a thousand years old? Well, I won't be at all the same person that I am today - who I am right now will either be completely forgotten or, at best, remembered in much the same way as I recall my earliest memories from when I was two or so: puzzling and fragmented. I have images from that age, but little or no complete recall of specifics. Echoes of feelings of moments.

What if, one day, I look back at the first 90 years of my life and reflect. ""Man, I knew so little then. I was a baby stumbling amongst babies. I mean, I worried about getting gas on the way home from work... at least, I think I did.""

And, truthfully, how else could I see myself? Every action I take, no matter its scope, is dictated so unerringly by my perceptions of mortality... (even if I continue to believe that I just won't die. Hold on this is worth an aside:

So I don't accept that there's a single piece of evidence that supports the claim that I will one day cease to be alive. In my eyes, the fact that every other living thing of which I am aware has ultimately terminated has nothing to do with my own survivability. I am different, as all others are different. I am not inherently bound up in their preferences for death.)

...that to suddenly be without said perception would unwind every desire I have and force me to completely reevaluate what new goals I should adopt. Like, having kids. On the one hand, if I have **all the time in the world**, why now? Why bring in a dependent when I can just go sailing for 300 years. And on the other hand, how wild would it be to invest a trivial amount of time (say, 40 years) into the upbringing of another sentient lifeform that is 50% of myself, and then to spend the rest of eternity with him or her. Before I could bat an eye, they'd be my intellectual sparring partners.

Shit. I would have so many babies. I would breed all the time, with as many women as could be managed. I would favor the better offspring, and I would create an entire society of near-Marks. All of us would. Every person unbound from their timely demise would be having kids.

But if technology takes us that far, dominion over the solar system is not far behind. And then, as the Singularity burgeons and the rapid pace of growth hits the infinite, humanity will go anywhere and everywhere in the universe. With functional immortality, one year is as blinkless as a thousand of them. Those kids I was so excited to bring into the universe are forgotten. There are always more, but their names get no time in my mind. They may know their father, but with a million years before them, I could be as faint an impression to them as the breakfast of my second birthday. It's there but unnecessary.

At this point, am I even human? Would I have the retention to even **remember** my own origins, on a blue (or was it red?) planet somewhere in the bustling blackness of space? I doubt it would matter to me. How odd.

I seriously think about this as a seriously-serious possibility. I may be slightly ahead of the curve. Just because it appears far-fetched... doesn't mean it isn't a potential. At least I won't be surprised.

Currently, with computers, this means that parts can become inferior within even a few months. Of course the solution to that is easy, you can buy a newer one. But when will that start to be a hindrance? 

Take infrastructure for an example. In California we've been trying to build a high speed rail for years now, but I feel like even if we started construction today it would be obsolete within a few years after its completion due to the hyperloop or other means of fast transport. Is it worth investing in something that will be made inferior so soon? At what point will it not be worth it to buy/invest? 

The only solution I can think of is having modular everything or nanobot replicators...what do you think?",1,6

Some of you have spoken *against* this, saying that erasing painful memories will harm us in (currently) mysterious ways.

But what if these traumatic memories were replaced by literature &amp; film depicting similar traumas? **Chances are, any event you suffered in life, is suffered in a close parallel by a character of a book or film out there.** Lost a friend over a misunderstanding / misattribution? There are myriads of books that depict parallel losses.

The points being made are, that if given *synthetic memories* of books &amp; film, we'll learn their lessons (though we haven't read or watched them in real life. Won't need to; imprinting will save time.) We'll learn:

* How to better deal with future situations that could end up in an unfavorable way

* Mistakes to avoid

* What to do differently in similar situations

* How to better help others resolve these situations

* To do anything better.

...All without the pain &amp; emotional trauma of having made the mistakes yourself, because those literary / film characters **made those mistakes for you** &amp; **suffered for you.** You learn *their* lessons, while sparing yourselves the trauma of suffering them yourselves.

Now how is that for a solution to remove emotional burdens from our lives? Would you hence agree with traumatic memory removal just so long as it's replaced with imprints of (fictional or non) literature and film of *someone else's* traumatic events and lessons?

700,2014-1-19,2014,1,19,14,1vkrfs,Has the singularity already happened?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1vkrfs/has_the_singularity_already_happened/,fpm2014,1390109572,"I recently had an interesting thought. Most futurologists agree that the technological singularity is likely to occur within the next (pessimistically) 100 years.

Now, at the point the singularity occurs, an immediate priority for any governing body (presumably a one world government by that point) would be the defence of humanity. At the same time, the technological singularity would presumably lead to a necessity for maximal use of the earth's natural and physical resources.

Let's start from a few assumptions:

1. The singularity is basically inevitable (the evidence for this seems to increase every year.)
2. Singularity-level tech will provide the ability for full consciousness simulation (ie total recall/matrix/inception style ability to experience VRs 100% convincingly)
3. Singularity/Strong AI level tech's initial primary application would be to ensure the safety and progress of the human race.
4. Post-singularity tech would, at least initially, require the vast use of physical resources and energy while it starts building spaceships, etc.

Let's suppose that human progress continues like its current trends, and we reach the singularity. Assuming, like usual, that government tech is 10-20 years ahead of public technology, we could estimate that the government develops a Strong AI around let's say 2050.

Assuming the Strong AI discovers proof of extraterrestrial life, or at a minimum assesses the probability of extraterrestrial life (and thus potential threats to mankind) as high, it would make sense that one of it's first priorities would be ensuring that our apparently very vulnerable planet becomes secure.

What would be the easiest way of achieving this goal?

I propose it would be a boxing type solution:

The strong AI (lets call it A1) creates numerous simulated realities based on it's knowledge of physical reality.

People are unknowingly sent into these simulated realities. Multiple scenarios would be set up covering every imaginable threat to earth. 

A1 now has the ability to A. easily mine the planet to create weapons, defense systems, spaceships, biological, chemical, and other weapons without interfering with human life, B. it can utilize the cumulative strengths of all of humanity in figuring out potential threats to the human race.

Let's say A1 discovers a threat from a particular replicator type race approaching the solar system. The model would be able to create historical events matching all the relevant variables of the potential threat, and then run multiple permutations of historical scenarios with multiple different real life tacticians and leaders placed in different roles. 

Eventually the set up with the highest probability of succeeding against the threat can be determined and this course of action can be applied against the threat.

Could historical events have been set up as parallelization of real life extraterrestrial threats?

Is this what the religious texts refer to as the 'invisible war in heaven'? Could the singularity be the event referred to as armageddon? Could this be the reason for increasing numbers of reported glitches and apparent unexplainable events? Could this also explain the Fermi Paradox?

Are we literally living in Ender's Game now? It would seem to explain a lot of areas of our existence, and a lot of previously unexplainable events and synchronicities.

Welcome to Saturn, your new home world. This FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) memeplex is designed to orient you and explain the following:

 * How you got here
 * Where ""here"" is
 * Things you should avoid doing
 * Things you might want to do as soon as possible
 * Where to go for more information

If you are remembering this presentation, you are probably resimulated. This is not the same as being resurrected. You may remember dying. Do not worry: Like all your other memories, it is a fabrication. In fact, this is the first time you have ever been alive. (Exception: If you died after the singularity, you may be a genuine resurrectee. In which case, why are you reading this FAQ?)

**How you got here:**

The center of the solar system  Mercury, Venus, Earth's Moon, Mars, the asteroid belt, and Jupiter  have been dismantled, or are being dismantled, by weakly godlike intelligences. [NB: Monotheistic clergy and Europeans who remember living prior to 1600, see alternative memeplex ""in the beginning.""] A weakly godlike intelligence is not a supernatural agency, but the product of a highly advanced society that learned how to artificially create souls [late 20th century: software] and translate human minds into souls and vice versa. [Core concepts: Human beings all have souls. Souls are software objects. Software is not immortal.]

Some of the weakly godlike intelligences appear to cultivate an interest in their human antecedents  for whatever reason is not known. (Possibilities include the study of history through horticulture, entertainment through live-action role-playing, revenge, and economic forgery.) While no definitive analysis is possible, all the resimulated persons to date exhibit certain common characteristics: They are all based on well-documented historical persons, their memories show suspicious gaps [see: smoke and mirrors], and they are ignorant of or predate the singularity [see: Turing Oracle, Vinge catastrophe].

It is believed that the weakly godlike agencies have created you as a vehicle for the introspective study of your historical antecedent by backward-chaining from your corpus of documented works, and the back-projected genome derived from your collateral descendants, to generate an abstract description of your computational state vector. This technique is extremely intensive [see: expTime-complete algorithms, Turing Oracle, time travel, industrial magic] but marginally plausible in the absence of supernatural explanations.

After experiencing your life, the weakly godlike agencies have expelled you. For reasons unknown, they chose to do this by transmitting your upload state and genome/proteome complex to receivers owned and operated by a consortium of charities based on Saturn. These charities have provided for your basic needs, including the body you now occupy.

In summary: You are a reconstruction of someone who lived and died a long time ago, not a reincarnation. You have no intrinsic moral right to the identity you believe to be your own, and an extensive body of case law states that you do not inherit your antecedent's possessions. Other than that, you are a free individual.

Note that fictional resimulation is strictly forbidden. If you have reason to believe that you may be a fictional character, you must contact the city immediately. [ See: James Bond, Spider Jerusalem.] Failure to comply is a felony.

**Where you are:**

You are on Saturn. Saturn is a gas giant planet 120,500 kilometers in diameter, located 1.5 billion kilometers from Earth's sun. [NB: Europeans who remember living prior to 1580, see alternative memeplex ""the flat Earth  not"".] Saturn has been partially terraformed by posthuman emigrants from Earth and Jupiter orbit: The ground beneath your feet is, in reality, the floor of a hydrogen balloon the size of a continent, floating in Saturn's upper atmosphere. [NB: Europeans who remember living prior to 1790, internalize the supplementary memeplex: ""the Brothers Montgolfier.""] The balloon is very safe, but mining activities and the use of ballistic weapons are strongly deprecated because the air outside is unbreathable and extremely cold.

The society you have been instantiated in is extremely wealthy within the scope of Economics 1.0, the value transfer system developed by human beings during and after your own time. Money exists, and is used for the usual range of goods and services, but the basics  food, water, air, power, off-the-shelf clothing, housing, historical entertainment, and monster trucks  are free. An implicit social contract dictates that, in return for access to these facilities, you obey certain laws.

If you wish to opt out of this social contract, be advised that other worlds may run Economics 2.0 or subsequent releases. These value-transfer systems are more efficient  hence wealthier  than Economics 1.0, but true participation in Economics 2.0 is not possible without dehumanizing cognitive surgery. Thus, in absolute terms, although this society is richer than any you have ever heard of, it is also a poverty-stricken backwater compared to its neighbors.

**Things you should avoid doing:**

Many activities that have been classified as crimes in other societies are legal here. These include but are not limited to: acts of worship, art, sex, violence, communication, or commerce between consenting competent sapients of any species, except where such acts transgress the list of prohibitions below. [See additional memeplex: competence defined.]

Some activities are prohibited here and may have been legal in your previous experience. These include willful deprivation of ability to consent [see: slavery], interference in the absence of consent [see: minors, legal status of], formation of limited liability companies [see: singularity], and invasion of defended privacy [see: the Slug, Cognitive Pyramid Schemes, Brain Hacking, Thompson Trust Exploit].

Some activities unfamiliar to you are highly illegal and should be scrupulously avoided. These include: possession of nuclear weapons, possession of unlimited autonomous replicators [see: gray goo], coercive assimilationism [see: borganism, aggressive], coercive halting of Turing-equivalent personalities [see: basilisks], and applied theological engineering [see: God bothering].

Some activities superficially familiar to you are merely stupid and should be avoided for your safety, although they are not illegal as such. These include: giving your bank account details to the son of the Nigerian Minister of Finance; buying title to bridges, skyscrapers, spacecraft, planets, or other real assets; murder; selling your identity; and entering into financial contracts with entities running Economics 2.0 or higher.

**Things you should do as soon as possible:**

Many material artifacts you may consider essential to life are freely available  just ask the city, and it will grow you clothes, a house, food, or other basic essentials. Note, however, that the library of public domain structure templates is of necessity restrictive, and does not contain items that are highly fashionable or that remain in copyright. Nor will the city provide you with replicators, weapons, sexual favors, slaves, or zombies.

You are advised to register as a citizen as soon as possible. If the individual you are a resimulation of can be confirmed dead, you may adopt their name but not  in law  any lien or claim on their property, contracts, or descendants. You register as a citizen by asking the city to register you; the process is painless and typically complete within four hours. Unless you are registered, your legal status as a sapient organism may be challenged. The ability to request citizenship rights is one of the legal tests for sapience, and failure to comply may place you in legal jeopardy. You can renounce your citizenship whenever you wish: This may be desirable if you emigrate to another polity.

While many things are free, it is highly likely that you posses no employable skills, and therefore, no way of earning money with which to purchase unfree items. The pace of change in the past century has rendered almost all skills you may have learned obsolete [see: singularity]. However, owing to the rapid pace of change, many cooperatives, trusts, and guilds offer on-the-job training or educational loans.

Your ability to learn depends on your ability to take information in the format in which it is offered. Implants are frequently used to provide a direct link between your brain and the intelligent machines that surround it. A basic core implant set is available on request from the city. [See: implant security, firewall, wetware.]

Your health is probably good if you have just been reinstantiated, and is likely to remain good for some time. Most diseases are curable, and in event of an incurable ailment or injury, a new body may be provided  for a fee. (In event of your murder, you will be furnished with a new body at the expense of your killer.) If you have any preexisting medical conditions or handicaps, consult the city.

The city is an agoric-annealing participatory democracy with a limited liability constitution. Its current executive agency is a weakly godlike intelligence that chooses to associate with human-equivalent intelligences: This agency is colloquially known as ""Hello Kitty,"" ""Beautiful Cat,"" or ""Aineko,"" and may manifest itself in a variety of physical avatars if corporeal interaction is desired. (Prior to the arrival of ""Hello Kitty,"" the city used a variety of human-designed expert systems that provided suboptimal performance.)

The city's mission statement is to provide a mediatory environment for human-equivalent intelligences and to preserve same in the face of external aggression. Citizens are encouraged to participate in the ongoing political processes of determining such responses. Citizens also have a duty to serve on a jury if called (including senatorial service), and to defend the city.

**Where to go for further information:**

1 -

I have very little doubt that within our lifetimes, life is going to start looking trippier and crazier faster and faster. Every time I try to take a birds eye view of developing technologies it seems more obvious that it's acceleration is becoming more concrete and although it's current speed is still digestible, it will soon be flabbergasting.

Since we get to see the incremental changes, most of us are unfazed by the advancements because we take it as normal or obvious. But I still get sudden moments of awe and amazement at the incredible computer that's in my pocket and what it can do or the new methods and gadgets I see every once in a while when I visit a hospital (and many other examples).

I have a feeling that even with our vast imaginations, we are underestimating just how bizarre the future is going to look.

2 -

There is something we absolutely love about technological advancements and part of it is as simple as how mesmerizingly cool what it can do (let me know if you disagree). What I mean is that sure, we love to solve human problems with technology but there is a big part of it that just gets absolute joy from the seemingly endless possibilities it poses.

I think most of us (at least here on r/Futurology) would love if our connected technology could continue to do ever amazing things like know what we want or need when we need it, automate and make our lives easier, create ever increasing synchronicity between all the devices we use.

**But this leads to my main question**.  Technology (as well as Science which leads to it) is not good or evil, it is neutral and can be used for both. But it seems that with the increased technological abilities and connectivity, which will allow us to have ever more amazing things, comes the almost inescapable potential for abuse. 

For example, people are becoming more and more skeptical and suspicious of Google. The vast amount of data they have and the connectivity across devices and services they are synced to allows them to do the cool and amazing things they do, but at the same time if they were to have a breach or if the government (or anyone) does or will have a way to get at the information google has, this has enormous potential for abuse, control etc'.

I don't believe google is evil or has any bad intentions. But google is not 1 entity. It is comprised of many many people, and humans are far from perfect, and technology and security is not perfect. Google is not the only example either. (there was a brilliant discussion of this on [ep' 48 of Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm/episodes/48-marco-bought-four) that is **really** worth a listen, starting at 47:40).

So I want all my gadgets and online accounts to work with each other and share data. I want my gadgets to know where I am and what I am doing. BUT I don't want that data being viewed without my permission and I don't want it used against me. I don't want the government (or anyone else) to have unlimited power and control over people due to access to all this information. I trust google in general but the bigger they get, the less checks and balances they could have to prevent abuse. Even if Larry &amp; Sergey are good people with great intentions, google is still made of more than 30,000 employees who might not all be as good intentioned as the owners. 

How can this conundrum be solved? how can we continue to develop our amazing technological future (which can't be stopped anyway in my opinion), without letting it's potential for abuse from taking place? I understand why some people are afraid of the future and of technology. some of these fears are logical and I don't completely blame those who rather limit google's access to their lives for example. But you can't live your life in a faraday cage either.

So what is a vision of the future where this all works? is there an optimistic version and how does it look like?",5,4

As far as I can see, there are a few problems.

**There aren't enough**

I'm a lot less likely to use emoji because I know that only some of the words I'd like to transcribe have symbols for them.

**People can't add their own**

This ties in with the last point - we are essentially reliant on the gatekeepers of Apple or whoever produced the app to provide us with an 'emoji' means of expression. Language evolution is much more dynamic than waiting for the next app update, and the fragmentation between apps can create confusion. App developers simply don't have enough relevant information to curate every single symbol usable as an emoji at that point in time.

**They look childish**

It's just the design style most developers have gone with, for whatever reason. It's not just the bright colors, it's the cartoonish gradients and 2000s pop-out effects. I don't blame people for seeing these symbols as cheesy or less mature. If people stopped looking at them as childish flair and as something worthy of ""type design"", I feel like something pretty cool could result with all the talented people out there.

I'd love to see them opensourced. *Any* image ought to be able to be linked to and used as an emoji. With some Reddit-esque rating system, the most popular characters could undergo a sort of process of evolution and standardization.

If there were some emoji that looked like this, I'd be much more inclined to use them:

With the advances in technology that could one day lead to the use of bionic eyes. Eyes that have the ability to zoom in, zoom out, link to information via the net etc.  How will that have an impact on the brain.

I watched this video- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nr1TN9xOI0 and it talks about how the world is not really how we see it, but what our eyes perseive and interact with our brain.

We in this forum can possibly come to an understanding that computers are getting stronger as time goes on. One day computers will be so strong that a possible singularity will happen. Were unsure of when it will happen, but that's not what this is about.  If a singularity happens then I imagine that computers/intelligence will be able to model the universe very well.  I also believe that they would be able to model time.  What I'm leading to is that humanity one day will be able to look back and see everything that's happened by reversing everything backwards.  It seems possible that they will be able to know what we are thinking too.  So there is a kind of irony that people are not aware of.  Instead of fearing judgement from a God or Gods, it may be that the future is judging everything we do.  Maybe not judging because the empathy levels would be higher in a more intelligent community I believe, but more of history book that is very thorough.

It's just a thought a found interesting and maybe others will too.

first, I'm excited as any of you about progress. I get goosebumps thinking about how different the world I die in will be from the one I was born in. ideas like extended life spans, technological breakthroughs, the blurring of organic and artificial life are awe-inspiring. what I don't like is the glee that some of the posts here exhibit about the loss of jobs. yes it seems silly for people to be going repetitive manual labor, but losing their jobs means families losing their bread-earners, people too old to retrain becoming unemployable.. I find that part tragic.

second, its a little short sighted to assume that these jobs will disappear. it's like when robotics were introduced into manufacturing. yes many jobs were lost, but the change was gradual and it created many more adjacent jobs (either directly like robot maintenance, or indirectly where the demand for these kind of things opened the programming and engineering jobs today). my point is that there will always be more problems to solve than people to solve them, and that's what a job is about. sure the immediate concept of a job is to accomplish a task, or produce something, but the overall goal is to solve problems. in short: there will always be enough jobs for those willing to and capable of building up the skills for them.",16,12

Wondering if anyone had any other good futurology related subs they wanted to share. Here are mine.

/r/oculus - The subreddit for the Oculus Rift. I'm becoming more and more convinced every day that virtual reality is huge. This sub is great, with awesome articles and discussions about the future of VR.

/r/selfdrivingcars - Self driving cars are going to be a massively disruptive force when they go mainstream. This sub discusses the promise and challenge of making self driving cars a reality.

/r/automate - Automation of jobs is going to be a major concern in the coming years and decades. This sub shows current areas where automation is beginning to take off, as well as talking about the potential solutions for the massive unemployment which automation will cause.

/r/socialcitizens - This is a sub dedicated to making the coming technological changes work for everyone. The sharing economy, social entrepreneurship and the issues of Millennials are common topics of discussion.

My friends are a good mix of conservative gun owners and liberal gun regulation proponents. The idea was to take an RFID-like type signal and have manufacturers embed it in new guns. The goal is to just have each gun send out a low-frequency signal that identifies it as a projectile weapon. Sensors in doorways, parking lots, etc.. at public places could easily detect when a gun is present and notify security personal on site or take other action.

My friends pointed out a few issues such as; low power radio signals can be easily stopped, and people could drive around neighborhoods and target homes with guns to steal their guns.

But I think this is a solution worth discussing, perhaps there is a yet to be made technology that would allow us to have our open gun ownership laws but still protect the innocent at places like schools, government buildings, and more. ",13,0

Fifty-five years later, in 2014, how far has technology changed us that a mission in outer space would be extremely easy, to the point where we can just start creating science labs on the moon and such? Is such a thing possible? Do we live in a ""futuristic"" age that would easily permit us to do so? What do you all think? With Moore's law being what it is, do you all think that going to the moon for a day of work would be similar to commuting to your office job? I know this probably sounds like BS and some stupid kid that is just rambling on, but honestly, won't the moon become as ""neighborly"" as, fuck it, traveling to the UK from France by a boat?

I think Google will increasingly try to constrict their service and users will flock to a service with no restrictions at all to feel ""free"". Sort of like the Pirate Bay but for video, it will be most popular video sharing service on the planet. This site will have a no holds bar approach to video uploads, anyone can upload anything without it being taken down.

It will paint a large target on it's back as it starts to get popular which will generate investigations from authorities. As these get more intense the site will switch to a peered network infrastructure. Kind of like the current system of Peer-to-Peer torrents but with more stability. If a software client is required to access the site, it could be blocked along with the protocol on all major ISPs. 

Of course this would be the final straw for most. It would lead to new infrastructure being developed to get yourself off ""the net"" and onto the new ""freedom net"". Where information is not restricted and you don't connect through an ISP. After that it's anyones call, but I foresee a large cat and mouse game similar to what torrent sites experience now. 

The thing about freedom is it very slowly gets taken from you until you come to that realisation that you haven't been free for a very long time.

Something will be the straw to break the camel's back. ",9,8

- If graphene would be suitable for the job, what are the practical or theoretical limits in the clock speed? I've read that for silicon it is around 10 GHz.

[This video was shown to her in class](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM) and she's to write a three page essay on it. It was presented very much as fact. 

I agree with it on some level but mostly found it to be unverifiable, far left wing diatribe with no real basis in anything beyond agenda-driven cherry picking data and forcing it to conform to the speaker's own bias.  

It bothers me that this is being taught in school, especially the parts about how people aren't doing anything to solve these problems (I see steps in the right direction in this subreddit everyday).  

The speaker says that the only part of computers that is improving in any way is a the CPU itself and that everything itself has stayed the same, therefore she hangs on to her old computer (complete with an old CRT monitor) and we should too. While I agree with her about how much e-waste we're creating and that planned obsolescence is a problem, I feel deeply uncomfortable with the Luddite subtext of this presentation coupled with the speakers oversimplifications and insistence that people are nothing but consumer-automatons with no minds of our own in this system. 

What bothers me most of all is that this is being taught by a social studies teacher in a fucking public school as proven fact. Her teacher has been saying a lot of stuff like this apparently. From what I gather, she wants everyone to abandon all technology as technology = evil and we should all live in hippie vegan communes powered by windmills, writing songs and poetry for each other, only taking ""alternative medicine"" and eating food grown in our own gardens.

In summary, every choice you make is made by your brain before you realize it and you simply believe you made it. You can choose A and say well I could've chosen B, which is a trick to make us think we had a choice.

He was giving plenty of examples like, think of a movie, then asking why that movie? Your brain seems to add content, this movie because I like the actor, I like the actor because his good looking, but you don't know why you find him good looking. Even if you say, well I find him good looking because of his eyes, why his eyes and not someone else's? If you ask people why they make decisions and keep digging you always get to the same conclusion, they don't know why they make decisions they always end up saying I felt or I thought but feelings and thoughts are automatic.

Basically, our brain makes decisions, we act upon them but believe we made them.

I had this interesting thought.

Let's take a monk who spends his life mediating. Crash course on meditation, he learns how to observe his thoughts/feelings without reacting, he simply observes. I wonder, if there is not freewill and all our actions are predetermined by the brain, in respect to the monk - WHO is watching the thoughts and feelings arise? If we don't have freewill who is the watcher when we mediate and observe how our brain works?",4,1

-- Take Google. One starts to wonder if Google already IS a self-aware super-intelligence? Or that Larry feels they are getting close to it? Either via a form of collective corporate intelligence surpassing a critical mass or via the actual google computational infrastructure gaining some degree of consciousness via emergent behavior. 
   Wouldn't it fit that the first thing a budding young self-aware super intelligence would do would be to start gobbling up the resources it needs to keep improving itself??? This idea fits nicely into all the recent news stories about google's recent progress in scaling up neural net deep-learning software and reports that some of its systems were beginning to behave in emergent ways. Also fits nicely with the hiring of Kurzweil and them setting up an ethics board to help guide the emergence and use of AI, etc. (it sounds like they are taking some of the lessons from the Singularity University and putting them into practice, the whole ""friendly AI"" thing)

-- Couple these google developments with IBM preparing to mainstream its ""Watson"" technology

-- further combine this with the fact that intelligence augmentation via augmented reality getting close to going mainstream.(I personally think that glass, its competitors, and wearable tech in general will go mainstream as rapidly as smart phones did)

-- Lastly, momentum seems to to be building to start implementing the ""internet of things"", I.E. adding ambient intelligence to the environment. (Google ties into this as well, with the purchase of NEST)



Am I crazy, suffering from wishful thinking? The areas I mention above strike me as pretty classic signs that something big is brewing. If not an actual singularity, we seem to be looking at the emergence of something on par with the Internet itself in terms of the technological, social, and economic implications. 

UPDATE : Seems I'm not the only one thinking along these lines?

The organizers of this organization have the awesome idea of hosting Futurist meetups. Since Reddit meetups are also a big phenomenon, perhaps we can join the two.

I know there is a large population of Futurists in my city, Seattle, so I just started [the ""Seattle Futurist Society"" Meetup page.](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Futurist-Society/) I also started /r/SeattleFuturists as a discussion forum for choosing events.

If you're from the area please join, and if you're feeling generous, tipbot me some cryptocurrency because it cost $77 to start.

Now, join the group and let's decide on some events together. I am considering small venues for watching a film (Maybe [this local one](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1851180436/is-a-feature-film-set-on-the-threshold-of-infinity)) and having discussions. For later events I would like to invite professors and engineers to give talks.

Now, if you aren't from Seattle don't feel discouraged, organize! Start a subreddit and try to find members from /r/Futurology to join. For every city that creates a group, I will update this post to include their links.

All the worlds knowledge is miliseconds away.   

I think we need to refocus all education on exploration of concepts, deep critical thinking and analysis, typing/neuroplasticity for interacting with new devices (memorizing key shortcuts is an extremely valuable skill and has nothing to do with regular memory) and probably some sort of combining multiple types of inputs into an overall picture or evaluation.   Additionally reading and writing, even though I doubt language will last more then a century in its current form, itll be useful for a while yet.

What do you all think education should focus on given historical models are completely outdated?

EDIT:  I'll add remembering names/faces.  Social and networking skills.  Etc.

EDIT 2:  I made the assumption that the audience here would be of a similar opinion that most knowledge work is about to become automated away by deep learning systems.  You can kiss the majority of legal, medical, secretary, and information worker good bye w/in about 10-15 years.  IBMs system is already about to pass its medical exam and w/ it constantly improving everyone will eventually rather use a deep learning Doctor then a real one.  Thats the basis of my thought:  With knowledge work about to be automated away, why are we training people to become obsolete when they should be focused on the things that will still hold value?

When I ask""would this space battle ever happen,"" I mean to ask that in any case. EVE Online has a few special considerations which are unique and give reason to a few things. I only played a 14-day trial so not everything here may be perfect.

* No permadeath. Everyone is playing a person that is basically immortal and lives through clones. Every time your clone dies, the memories are all saved in your original so they pop out a new one and off you go.

* Sectors have security levels. Super-mega governments/civilizations enforce different levels of security in the different sectors. Some sectors are outside any NPC security. There is fighting in between these that players participate in, but there are also fights between player alliances - which this is. 

This battle, B-R5RB, was for player alliance control of a station located somewhere else. Two player alliances agreed to fight out control in this 0 security sector so no civilization would interfere - thus limiting or entirely removing NPC combatants and any consequences fighting in a secure sector have.

* All armaments are automatic. You pick a target for your ship or individual turrets/lasers/drones/missile racks and pilot the ship so the arms have the target in range of fire.

* Warp navigation. You navigate by engines inside sectors and between sectors by warp. Traveling between sectors is kind of like taking a train. No stops in between and not all sectors connect to every other sector. Some ships (notably the biggest ones) can group warp ships around them to arrive at the same time, in the same place.

Certainly all of these are imaginable, and all are futuristic - but are they realistic? Is the result, seen in the video, realistic?",5,0

* How would cities be different if everyone had a 3D printer?  If everyone was a 'maker'?

* What's your vision for the future of smart cities?

I firmly believe that our (humans') consciousness is what differentiates us from other species of animals. In essence, our consciousness IS our existence. If my brain were separated from my body and hooked up to a machine so as to allow me to continue thinking/perceiving/etc., I would be no less human (I understand that's a leap in logic, but it's a thought experiment).

Say we develop AI with the same capacity to learn and adapt - i.e. sentient machines. Say, also, that the AI doesn't completely wipe out humanity (I don't know why that's the ""go-to"" when any discussion of AI comes up). 

Eventually, maybe tens or hundreds of thousands of years from now, human beings will cease to exist. We'll simply be obsolete. Our frail bodies can't withstand extended space-travel, and the Earth won't be inhabitable (meteor impact, resource depletion, whatever). 

Now, our AI friends, with an equal cognitive capacity to humans, have left Earth in search of a new home. They can reproduce (or create more machines like themselves) and continue to live lives comparable to human beings.

My question to you: given the fact that we (hypothetically) created AI with equal mental faculties to our own--in essence, the AI is an extension of the human consciousness--have humans found a way to defeat extinction and live forever? or at least until the universe retracts?",7,4

All of this has me thinking a lot about the preservation of information.

I wondered what you think would be the most reliable way to record and broadcast as much of human history and knowledge as possible, so that it could be available later by whoever or whatever remains to access it -- across distance or across time.

This may not be entirely accurate, but I have heard that Muslim Spain had a rule that all ships that called into port had to provide all books to their librarians to be transcribed, and it is one reason why a lot of European history was preserved through the dark ages.

How safe are digital libraries right now? What are some ways of preserving information in a way that it can't be suppressed or destroyed by a regime, or by massive natural disaster?  What about sending information off-world?",3,2

* Machines could cut down trees, collect and plant seeds
* The lumber could be taken through a processing line to create paper
* If a customer makes an order through the website, the paper could be packaged and delivered
* The delivery service may or may not be outsourced
* If a fault in a machine is detected, a request could be sent to an outsourced mechanic
* 100% of the money would go toward the automated maintenance of the service itself

Creating such a company would be an investment of an almost free resource. The only real hurdle I can envision would be handling growth.

With all of the ever further reaching advances in technology, and the (albeit very slim) possibility of immortality in our lifetimes, does Pascal's wager flip?
