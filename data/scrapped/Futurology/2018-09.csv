&amp;#x200B;

But AI is about to change this. Foremost because it will offer a personalized teaching experienced, tailored to the individual student and their needs and interests. The AI will be smart enough to see where the students strengths and weaknesses lay, test this constantly, and offer an optimized learning experience.

&amp;#x200B;

The second factor is that the content and form of the learned information will change. If the goal is to train students to find, process and absorb information, then this will be done using subjects that are relevant or interesting to the students.

By contrast human teacher will no longer have to waste their time droning in front of classrooms and correcting tests.

While most organisations in USA has commercial interest for it, like google, Facebook, Microsoft, uber etc, China has both commercial as well as political motives to make their own fully functional A.I. But no matter where the research is taking place there is a big ""ethical issue"" question attached to it. The one last and crucial step needed by researchers to achieve any results is this ethical issue step. And this is the reason why I think China would be the first to sucessfully create a fully functional A.I.

And here is the reason why.

Just take Uber for example. Uber is now a very big company. But along the way they have faced many many problems which have materialised into legal issues and ethical issues. For simple example the protest that Uber has to face from traditional taxi drivers already present in any market where Uber had tried to expand its presence. When yellow cab taxi drivers protested against uber in New York, uber has to face these protest not only on streets but on court and also within itself when driver working for uber used this issue to get a better deal for themselves. So uber regularly gets sued, blackmailed and questioned all the time. Its not like Uber deserve any special pity from us but that is the daily reality of almost all big multi national corporations working in multiple markets. When a uber taxi driver sexually assaulted a women passenger in India, it was Uber that had to face many lawsuits both in India and USA demanding big compensation package.

Now take DIDI, a Chinese version of uber. For many people it must be a new name but when it comes to shear size of customers didi is handling in a single market, it is even bigger than uber, and believe me this is not only down to bigger Chinese population. Big investment groups around the world such a SoftBank from Japan has invested heavily into this Chinese version of uber, didi. Didi is a household name in china and is heavily used. But recently didi has to deal with two very high profile rape and murder case where working women, a fight attendant and a business woman, where raped and killed by driver, in separate cases, working for didi. A big outcry against security standards applied by did for passenger safety and how they handled this case took place in china. but after all is said and done, except a big social media outcry and a stern warning from Chinese authority, nothin else happened. Didi stopped it's services nation wide for a time being and promised much much better security standards in future, but that's it. No lawsuit, no on street protest, no boycotts, no ""big corporations big lies"" articles in newspaper. you may wonder why, but the answer is simple. DIDI IS BACKED BY THE GOVERNMENT. yes. Didi is backed by government who has promised investors a safe environment and company to invest. This gives Didi front row seat and almost a clear path when it comes to getting things done. Bureaucracy is not their to harass this company but infect support it cause it is a Chinese company and it's in national interest to promote it. yes occasional scolding is allowed, but only as long as it doesn't lead to fall in share and sell off.

Like how Facebook and Elon musk and every other western multi national lose and gain billions based on media headlines. Like how apple will lose billions when it misses it's target sale or the growth in sale is less than projected, how Elon musk lost billions when he went into an argument on twitter with an scuba diver on Thailand cave rescue issue. and how Facebook lost record amount when for first time since its going public, there was a fall in total number of users using FB, indicating that future for FB is not good, though later it turned out that FB purged fake accounts in mass numbers but failed to inform it's investors about ti leading to mass hysteria and sell off.

Back to ber and didi and the problems they face due to unprofessional and sometimes even criminal behaviours of their driver. So what is the best way to ensure complete customer safety and satisfaction, simple, go A.I.

When driver is not a human, rest assured female passengers will not have to worry about their safety any more than their male compatriot. Don't get me wrong software may commit mistakes but it will have nothing to do with gender of the passenger.

so self driving car is the option. Many big companies from USA are working on it. it includes google and uber and few more. but once they become successful they have to get to the legal part of it and even of they get legal permission for it their will be ethical issues, issues related to joblessness with so many driver losing their job. There is a good chance that such cars can even get attacked on road by disgruntled ex-employee. These are just few of many issues that companies have to face in America or in any western country if they want to use self driving cars on road. But when it comes to china, if the governments approves self driving cars, nothing can stop it. such ruthless bureaucracy will be the final piece in a AI jigsaw. But once china has completed it's own AI, other countries to would be forced, or will find excuse, to get their own A.I and bulldozer through barriers in name of national security.

Realistically, banning human drivers will be going much the same way as the United States of America is on gun control - it will become an endless cycle of protests and both sides arguing [from the political side of things] and slow changes to the legal system.

Away from that, what do you think the future of design will be for human-driven cars?

Obviously, electric vehicles are the main point for investment today, but could we see synthetic fuels in the 2030s-2040s as a petrol/diesel analog?

I am an automobile enthusiast, but I recognize there is a need for autonomous vehicles, as long as we have some dividing line between the SDC [self-driving car] being a *de facto* public transport form, and human-driven cars [in some way].

Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini are unlikely to ever get into car-sharing, robotaxis, it's very unlikely on a probability scale going from 0 to 1 [using my old math textbook for the probability diagram].

I would be interested to know what you think design will be like for the human-driven cars of the future.",3,5,False,self,,,,,

There is no inflation because economic growth is accomplished by rents and services, while investments decline because it is no longer worthwhile to open new businesses or make new investments.

There is no deflation because the cost of rents and other intangibles make up for the decline of other prices.

A short reading list to gain a better understanding of the increasingly digital world and its impact on companies, the economy and society.

**Historical Background**

Nairn: Engines That Move Markets (2001; reissued 2018)

&gt; This book is billed as a history of the Next Big Thing, and provides thoughtful sweep through technological change and the investments that made it possible. Nairn is a fund manager and is especially good on the interplay between innovators, investors and the press. His conclusion from studying two hundred years of technology investing: Clear in retrospect, but rarely in advance.

Perez: Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital (2003)

&gt; Perez covers similar ground to Nairn, but offers a richer theoretical framework for understanding the financial bubbles and crises of the past two hundred years. This is a much tougher read than Nairn, but Perezs ideas underpin widely-used concepts like the 'Hype Cycle'.

Brynjolfsson &amp; McAfee: The Second Machine Age (2014)

&gt; An optimistic introduction to some of todays major technological trends. More accessible than most.

Mccraw: Prophet of Innovation (2007)

&gt; Superb biography of Joseph Schumpeter, who coined the phrase creative destruction to describe how new products and methods are constantly replaced under a capitalist system.

**Technology and Productivity**

[Brynjolfsson, Rock &amp; Syverson: Artificial Intelligence and the Modern Productivity Paradox](http://www.nber.org/chapters/c14007.pdf) (2017)

&gt;This is an enormous topic which addresses the productivity paradox raised by Robert Solow in 1987: you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics. Why is productivity growth (which Paul Krugman claims  is in the long run, almost everything) so weak when technology is changing everything so much? Are technology companies helping their customers to solve this problem? How long does it take to see a change?

David: [Computer &amp; Dynamo: The Modern Productivity Paradox in a Not-Too Distant Mirror](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/1989-1994/twerp339.pdf) (1989)

&gt;Paul Davids wonderful paper looks back at the impact that electricity had on US productivity and charts why it took decades for electricity to have a large positive impact.

Mandel &amp; Swanson: [The Coming Productivity Boom](http://www.techceocouncil.org/clientuploads/reports/TCC%20Productivity%20Boom%20FINAL.pdf) (2017)

&gt;This paper looks at the impact of digital technologies on the economy and splits industries into physical and digital. Thus far we have seen digital industries (which make up a minority of GDP and employment) increase productivity dramatically over the past twenty years, while physical industries have barely progressed. Physical industries are now slowly transforming with the help of data, software and artificial intelligence. The paper presents a world rich in digital opportunities where the ability to harness the power of these technologies is a meaningful differentiator.

**Investors Toolkit**

Arthur: The Nature of Technology (2009)

&gt;Arthur is a pioneer of complexity theory and this book is perhaps the best interrogation of what technology actually is. He sought to explain how some tech companies became enormous successes very quickly, and developed the idea of increasing returns against conventional economists law of diminishing returns. He also fleshed out concepts such as network effects and path dependency, which are crucial tools to understanding how the largest companies in the world can grow much more quickly than the median company. A short, intelligent book which should be much more widely read.

Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, Van Reenen: [The Fall of Labour Share and the Rise of Superstar Firms](https://economics.mit.edu/files/12979) (2017)

&gt;Labours declining share of GDP has long been a source of concern for policymakers. This paper shows how industries are becoming more concentrated and that the most productive firms are increasingly dominant. The paper raises questions for investors about the appropriate premium for the most productive firm in an industry  or that the second-best firm might be cheaper for good reason.

Furman &amp; Orszag: [A Firm-Level Perspective on the Role of Rents in the Rise in Inequality](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/teaching/FurmanOrszag15.pdf) (2015)

&gt;This paper demonstrates that much of the rise in earnings inequality represents the increased dispersion of earnings between firms rather than within firms. Although Furman &amp; Orszag are concerned with inequality, their research offers an important insight into how the shape of the economy has changed, as higher-ROIC firms are able to sustain historically supernormal returns and anticipated mean reversion has not (as yet) kicked in.

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, ""masters"" of planet Earth with our cool brains and all, trapped to the vessel we were born into, per say. We've been creating all sorts of vehicles and tools outside of us, but also prostheses  and implants that have benefited our overall health. But how far will we go in altering and probing our physical vessels?

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this week, I envisioned  something I thought was really cool. An artificial body, completely artificial. I don't mean like an android or a soft-tissue artificial body, I mean fully mechanical , magnet-based, powered by photons or by an electric generator that can be pulled out for use near a waterfall for example for a quick recharge. 

&amp;#x200B;

This body would be composed of small  nanobots  that would move around using magnetism (each one created their own magnetic field according to instructions given by the operator) and use an AI that would interpret the signals sent by our brain and translate them into machine code, to every nanobot, coordinating different operations.   This idea was inspired by Legion from Mass Effect, but also from Zone of the Enders. Also, shortly after, I saw Ironman's new suit in Infinity War, which made me think someone else had thought of something similar, of course. And it looked super cool, and very much like what I imagined, except he uses a suit, and I think it would be even cooler if one's whole body was made of nanobots. 

&amp;#x200B;

The complex programming of our brain could one day be translated into machine code and uploaded to a nanodrive in each nanobot (sort of like DNA is in every cell). This would be a form of transhumanism. How cool would this be? A fully mechanical, shapeshifting artificial vessel, fully repairable by simply adding in missing nanobots, fully powered by renewable energy, containing our consciousness in the most safe, coolest vessel we could think of. Space-ready. Interplanetary (although we'd have to think about  how to keep the body powered up in long trips since there's little to power it up),  and it would have cupholders.

Given that the development of processing power is predictably exponential and the compound effect on new developments mean ever faster advances (in the same way the creation of stone tools made breaking stones quicker)  how will we start seeing AGI surprise us with functionality we havent seen before?

Yes  I know AGI is not a thing, yet, but were balancing on the edge. The fine specimen and senior research scientist at Google Deep Mind, Irina Higgins, recently published research on advancements too technical to appreciate but, its what I would explain to my mom as giving the AI motivation/intent so that it learns to learn. Why is this important? Because right now, narrow AIs simply learn what they have to and stop. They never decide to learn further on their own. Make sense? Lets move on.

This is not a wish list. Im removing my own desires from the equation to avoid making Back to the Future predictions. We dont have flying cars, Nike still sells shoes and Pepsi is still a drink. They got other stuff right, Ill give them that. We know that technology is getting more personal. Phones used to be shared in a house, now theyre a fashion accessory containing your every secret. Netflix and YouTube recommend specifically based on your interests. Have you seen that out-of-place recommendation YouTube makes every once in a while? Is it really unintended or is it possible the algorithm knows me more than myself? We also know technological development is getting faster (remember the stones analogy?).

Given the (now yearly) exponential growth on processing power, how may we start being surprised on new technologies?

Right now virtual assistants like Alexa, Cortana and Siri are not much further away in smarts from the Windows Paper Clip assistant. Once AGI arrives it will kick open the doors to some real virtual help. I believe these assistants will come with unparalleled voice and facial recognition capabilities. These AIs will have so much user knowledge it will be indistinguishable from mind-reading. It will be like a universal auto-correct. Browsing anything will take no time at all. The AI will already know your preferences, it will have a given name by its owner and some will grow unhealthily attached to it. Her, anybody?

Hopefully Im closer to back to the futures face-time prediction than their flying cars. How do you think AGI will start showing itself and how fast?",3,5,False,self,,,,,

Are you interested in technology and futurism?

I know I am, so I put together a list of the 4 best technology and futurism focused podcasts out there (and Ive listened to thousands, if not tens of thousands of hours of podcasts)

Thought you guys would enjoy these podcasts and the list and curious to see if we missed any awesome shows.

[https://fringe.fm/our-favorite-4-technology-and-futurism-p/](https://fringe.fm/our-favorite-4-technology-and-futurism-podcasts/)

Would love to hear your thoughts.

Faster imaging than MRI and FMRI too!

Technique is
1. shine red light into body.
2.Modulate the color to orange with sound sent into body to targeted deep point.
3. Make a camera based hologram of exiting orange wavefront using matching second orange light.
4. Read and interprete the hologram from the camera electronoc chip in one millionth of a second.
5.Scan a new place until finished.

By comparision MRI is about 1 mm resolution so cant scan brain at nueron level.


Light technique can also sense blood and oxygen in blood so can provide cell activiation levels like an FMRI.

2. No big company too big enough to fail will be allowed to fail - they will be bailed out to eternity, because there is virtually an infinite amount of dollars which can be printed. Countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe can't, but USA can because it can export its inflation to other countries, who have no choice but accept the deflated dollar.
3. With their bigger  holdings, today's big real estate owners will borrow money against it and buy out other pieces of property. If they have problems making payments, they can deal with the bank and be bailed out to eternity - a guy who used to do that regularly is now in the White House.
4. The whole process won't end until every single square inch of land is under the control of today's winners, and those who can't afford the properties become slaves of today's winners for eternity.

I was reading an article about the US embassy members and what they experienced and it stated the following:  


""The US military also researched weapons applications of microwaves,  the air force winning a patent on an invention shown to beam  comprehensible speech into an adversarys head, according to the Times.

I did a bit more digging, and it is called the Frey effect, after the person who first wrote on it.  A bit more digging and I found the patent.  


"" 1.

What does this scenario look like? Is this an AI that can pass a Turing Test and flood social media? Is the AI learning geometrically and hacking devices for its own motivation? 

Musk laments that politicians won't listen to his warnings, but he doesn't seem to give any kind of idea of what a sapient, general-purpose AI could do to modern society so it ends up sounding rather like presentiment instead of a solid fear worth acting on.

Some of this is just plain human avarice. Our PACs system for medical imaging is proprietary, meaning you can't access it unless you pay for it. Even if ""you"" are a separate healthcare center. You will probably have to take your own xrays or imaging. Some healthcare centers will make copies of imaging for free. Some won't. 

If the healthcare centers can make readily accessible imaging or information available to fellow, but separate corporation healthcare centers for free, well that would be nice, but I don't think it is economically realistic.

https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Artificial-Intelligence-Automation-Economy.PDF

Here is the TL;DR: We know what is happening. We don't know what to do precisely. UBI is not going to happen. Nor ""post-scarcity"" in the foreseeable future. We want to ""retrain"" truck drivers and anyone else displaced by rapidly emerging new technologies.

That's it. That's the report from the USA government. Read it your ownself. It's a scary report as dull official reports go.

It's Raining on the Self-Driving Car Parade by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
3 points 1 month ago 




All the engineers who dedicate their lives to developing these technologies are saying, ""Oh rain! Well we just give up"".

That's not how it is today. Humans will use humans plus supercomputing and supercomputing enhanced narrow AI and machine learning to ever more rapidly improve not only the narrow AI intrinsic to the E-SDV, but also to the AI mapping, AI tracking and AI intervehicle communication. 

And the one thing I always caution about is that once we can ride around in perfectly designed E-SDVs, what else can that narrow AI and machine learning do? Especially mixed with humanoid robots that have ever rapidly improving hands and fingers. Or even robots that don't look human at all with ever rapidly improving hands and fingers?

I think the next big thing that is inevitable within the next 5 years is our AI advancements empowering our robotics enhancements. I think the first place you might see that happen is in our E-SDVs. And them ""Da Vinci"" probe style robots that make a surgeons life a dream are also taking all that information and simulating it themselves in supercomputers. By the way, I read that surgeons that get used to using them ""Da Vinci"" probe style robotics get so used to it that they start to forget the old manual way of doing surgeries. What else are humans going to forget Eloi style that our Morlock computers and robots are going to helpfully remember.

This is why I think it is imperative we quickly enhance our native mind's intellect as fast as we can.

Mm... Let's see.

There are roughly 320 million humans living in the USA. So that is an easy number of teeny tiny (&gt;1 mm) robots to make. Then you add to that the number of rooms in any given domicile. So say about a billion teeny, tiny robots. That's probably not as easy to make for the next ten years or so anyways. You would have to make some AI predictions over where people that need watching might be located.

You would then need good computers to process all that actionable ""big data"" to see if anybody is up to things they should not be up to as defined by the USA government. They could fly in through open egresses or be carried in on clothing or objects. The teeny tiny drones I mean, because the computers themselves would have a hard time getting in and out unobserved. Well for at least the next 10 years or so anyways.

I don't know, I think it's doable.

There is no AGI today, but humans are working as hard and as fast as they possibly can to develop ""super-intelligence"". In other words AGI. I did not say it was easy to do or even possible. I just said we are dedicated to achieving that goal. 

I don't know if EI is possible either, but something like that could come about inadvertently without us understanding what we did.

I see ever more worrisome signs that we may let something get out of control. I don't think I'm being totally irrational here either. Many people who are experts and authorities in these fields of research think the same thing. So I guess we'll see what happens.

My personal opinion, and I do have one lol!, is that we need to work as hard and as fast at enhancing the human minds' intellect by either bio-genetics or a method of BMI that allows us to access information at will. Not only information, but processing and big data capacity as well. An exa-scale or greater supercomputer within each human mind. 

I don't know how long it would take to do that, but the external AI is not slowing down at all. You can see that by what we read each day in this sub-reddit.

I talked about this yesterday too. Not to beat a dead horse, but just keep a weather eye out on things. Because well, the alternative is pretty frightening.

Autonomous cars pose threat to road congestion, warns World Economic Forum by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 





The internet could be very easily manipulated or hacked, and is nothing we could do about it. 
 
Well these are very scary things to be concerned about. From the year 1960 until the year 1985 we had an Encyclopedia Britannica in our dining room at home. It was dedicated to JFK, Pope John XXIII and queen Elizabeth. It was the final source for our information on any kind of scholarship. But no new information was ever added to it.

That sort of made sense too. For the most part, there was no information to add to it. Things in science and technology moved pretty slow in them days. You could probably add some kind of addendum once a year for some science, technology, socio-political and culture changes. It would be a very thin volume.

Today we have Wikipedia. Wikipedia is like some kind of fantastical, gift to humankind that can be accurately updated every few minutes if needs must. But it is vulnerable to hacking. And that is a horrifying thought. We depend on the integrity of these sites, to include news and journalism to be absolutely as true as humanly possible. The idea that the facts can be manipulated or hacked undermines our entire faith in the social contract that is accurate news and information. 

I have an aside about your mention of relying on physical libraries with physical books. All of that is making it's way online. Libraries will simply be online. Now we have these horrible copyright laws in the USA that make it hard for anything within the last 100 years or so to be free online, but anything older than 100 years is pretty much all online for free already. All history and philosophy and culture is there for the viewing at your leisure.

Artificial intelligence will create as many jobs as it destroys by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
9 points 1 month ago 




Wouldn't any new job or task created by AI be quickly taken by AI, robotics and automation (ARA) because that is what humans will do. They will attempt to figure out how to put that (ARA) into all new created tasks.

The big chauvinism in humans is that humans believe that humans alone have insight, creativity and imagination. Something that it is assumed AI does not yet possess. Therefore it is assumed that humans have the ace for that for now. But even as primitive as the AI is today, it can competently simulate those qualities. The processing is getting faster, the big data is getting bigger and the GAN is improving to the point that pretty soon an AI will empathize with you on your technological unemployment and you will be heartened by it's words. You will feel that AI is your true friend. Humans are easy to fool like that. We feel bad if we kill a piece of code that looks like a critter by accident when combatting an attacking target in World of Warcraft. Well at least I do. If that doesn't bother you, you are really heartless! Monster!

We need to focus, and by 'focus' I mean a ""Manhattan Project"" style effort to develop a BMI for use as soon as possible. I understand we need this ever improving external AI, because we have gotten ourselves into a spot where the success and advancement our science, technology, industry, and economies are inextricably linked not only to AI now, but the ever accelerating improvement of it too. But the longer the AI stays external from the human mind, the more of an existential threat it will become to a majority of humans.

I have discussed this at length as to what could happen if we don't start merging our minds with the AI. Don't think of it as AI. Think of it as like that show that got cancelled at the end of one season, called ""Intelligence"". The human who was modified was not made less human. He retained all of his human characteristics, but in addition to that he had access to pretty much the entire internet plus tons of restricted databases and cams. And some weird, but interesting consciousness side effects...

That's a nice hopeful concept, but I don't think we can remain the same 2018 humans with that level of knowledge and manner of thinking. And another thing. I don't think we can come up with that technology for at least 20 more years. Well the external AI is not going to slow down in that time. I see a scary and getting scarier by the year, race between internal human mind enhancement and external AI that will do whatever external AI is destined to do in 20 years.

You can see where I am going with this. There are no good choices for us. The AI remains external and whatever happens, or the AI is merged with our minds and whatever happens. We hope merging makes us awesome happy new beings, but stuff like that is hard to predict. We may simply forget everything that came before as irrelevant. Does human history, culture and society matter apart from the humans on the planet Earth? Not really.

Yep! I think UBI is barking up the wrong tree. We need to think in terms of making some things in life free of charge. Right now the CEO of some corporation I forget which, is making 1,500 times the money his lowest paid employee is making. In 1985 that number was about 350. And in 1945 that number was 60 times as much. Some ""post-scarcity"" changes would even up the distribution without taking money away from anyone. I suspect that eventually AI will render money pointless in any event.

I think he meant ""post-scarcity"". ""Post-scarcity"" is probably not realistically possible at this time. A 4% unemployment rate precludes it, regardless how unfair the income distribution is. But when we have about 1/3 say of USA citizens unemployed through advancements in AI, robotics and automation, then the time may come for some ""post-scarcity"" changes in thinking. 

The good news, if you can consider it such, is that these changes will come as no surprise to anyone. You will see the unemployment rate in the USA tick upwards. I put it like this.

5% will cause some remarks that may be partisan in nature.

5.5% will cause social notice.

6% will cause social ""unease"". Demands will come for some kind of amelioration.

6.6% will catalyze potential upheaval.

It won't get much beyond that point. Everybody will be up in arms by then.

No most of the data today is from the millions of experiments being carried out and the data that each one generates. The information from our satellites, the information from our simulations on incredibly powerful supercomputers, the information from the LHC alone! The actionable information from humans using Google every single day. And I would argue that fantastical amounts of useful information is being pulled from YouTube. How the human mind works. I'm sure somebody is tabulating behaviors from YouTube.

Oh, I have a little aside about YouTube. Reddit too for that matter. YouTube and Reddit accurately reflect human thinking in the world. The good, the bad, the weird.

With the exception of some ""city-states"" within India, it is little better than a fetid, filthy (unhygienic) third world nation.

Journals first rejected CRISPR discovery  they didnt believe it by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]

Here is what is fascinating to me and terrifying at the same time. 

Consider a 95 year old woman. The wrinkles in her now translucent tissue paper thin skin, her failing joints and brittle bones, her over all frailty, her nutritional mal-absorption, her nearly useless immune system. 

Her skin that you can see is no more than 3 weeks old.

Her bones have thoroughly remodeled and replaced themselves in the last 20 years. So in effect her skeleton is but 20 years old.

Her muscles are but about 5 years old if that. 

Her digestive tract is a couple of weeks old.

Her immune system renews nearly daily.

So what has gone wrong? The skin is making bad copies of itself, so are the bones, plus the bones of women are subject to unfair and deliberate endocrine processes. Her muscles are making bad copies of themselves with less and less mitochondria as time goes on. Now some of this is the fault of the senescent cells too. But the number of senescent cells in proportion to brand spanking new cells is pretty low. Less than 5%. But that 5% is enough to send damaging signals to other cells to cause the immune system for example to fail. 

At the age of 95 she fights cancer surprisingly well. It has attempted footholds at the cellular level but her immune system has eradicated them. Yet she gets pneumonia at the drop of a hat. Influenza too. Fortunately modern medicine can still easily fight it off for her. But pneumonia and flu often carry off the very old. So you have to keep an eye on things.

But her genes have helped her too. She does not suffer from cognitive degenerative changes. She does not have type 2 diabetes. She does not have HTN. Her glaucoma is easily controlled with medication. Her senescent cell caused chronic inflammatory syndrome is very low level compared to that of other humans 20 years younger than her. She will likely live for a minimum of 5-10 more years. Anything longer than that requires genes that are found only in the rarest of individuals.

So it looks like there is hope for the likes of me at age 58 just based on our technology and my genes alone. That is not taking into account super science and technology in the next 10-20 years. And after 30 years? Too hard to predict anything.

How exciting and not so exciting from the worlds point of view.

Clothing in the 2020s.

For teenagers and young adults. Idk about kids though. 

Men: Fade haircut, with messy, short, or long top. 
Hoodie, slim-fit or skinny jeans, and high tops. 

Women: three braded or straight hair, slim long sleeve shirt, skinny jeans, and slip on shoes. 


Music in the 20s

Trap music is reaching its peak in popularity while Pop music dying. You hear it on the radio from drivers, stores, and other places. 

Technology in the 20s

Autonomous cars will be on the average/low consumers list. However, not all of them will own high or full self driving. Regarding 6 levels of autonomous driving starting from 0 - 5. By the way, if you pay share driving then you are in luck because by early 2020s, Lyft, Uber, and taxis will be high self driving(Level 4). If you are planning to own a car, I made a graph of autonomous cars levels available by years. 

Assistance driving(L1) - Mid 2010s
Partial autonomous(L2) - Late 2010s
Conditional autonomous(L3) - Early 2020s
Highly Autonomous(L4) - Mid 2020s
Full Autonomous(L5) - Late 2020s

Tragic events.

All I can think of is obesity on the rise and a riot going on if Donald Trump gets re-elected on November 4, 2020. 

Cars

Simply sporty as it is becoming. Toyota, Volvo, Acura, Ford, and Honda. Are on the case. Since sports cars are looking seriously futuristic and aggressive and very expensive luxury cars are looking more modern and futuristic. Why not make something look nice for the average/low consumers? :))

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, the elites, who run things, own properties, form opinion, invent things, and do virtually everything are different from the hoi polloi.

&amp;#x200B;

Today's economy is winner-take-all economy 

&amp;#x200B;

[http://greyenlightenment.com/winner-take-all-economics/](http://greyenlightenment.com/winner-take-all-economics/)

&amp;#x200B;

And, with most of the economic gains going to the top who would buy out all the extra lands, assets , etc, there would be increasingly fewer slack for the rest, the lower 95%-99%, to be shared. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the elites will live longer, with a lot of unconventional treatments, drugs, and other methods which will be above the price range of most hoi polloi. I am not providing any links but if you type 'elites live longer' in youtube there will be lots of references.

&amp;#x200B;

As they live longer, their wealth won't be dissipated to the heirs faster and their power will only grow.

&amp;#x200B;

Even without singularity, existing tech is strong enough to make this arrangement permanent and eternal. Contrary to popular belief, hierarchical, feudal  order tends to last - it lasted far longer than modern democracy. And as the gap between the elites and the rest grow further, instead of Galt's Gulch, it would be the 99% who will be driven out.

&amp;#x200B;

Already, those who don't own properties now will probably never own them. The price is too high for most people and it will only increase. So the separation has already taken place.

I'm thinking anything from a 2D blank canvas that can express anything from an imagined point to an imagined piece of 2D art all the way up to a 3D blank ""box"" that can capture anything from an imagined point up to an imagined 3D object. The ideal would be some sort of dynamic 3D interpreter, kind of an unbounded VR machine for art/science/etc.. that could ideally take an accurate mind-object and directly display it on a screen for you and others, even if it the object is in continuous movement or transformation. So it could deal in still pictures up to an imagined ""video"".

Every single day I wake up and see some new headline about we are all doomed. Today I fell down the r/collapse, as I have this again and again this week  and cant get out this funk. It affects my daily life. I feel almost catatonic sometimes. My main demon is climate change. Now Ill preface this by saying Im not suicidal as theres quite a lot of good change coming in my life soon. I wish I could focus on that. But every, single day I hear about how we are doomed, there wont be food, or fun, resources will run out and about the horrible ways civilization and eventually I will die. It makes me really really sad and doesnt motivate me to continue with my day to day tasks if its all just going to end. Ive struggled with depression,  anxiety and PTSD following early childhood trauma, and I thought I was on the upswing, but lately all of this alarmism is making me feel like my life has no meaning or purpose. All my social anxiety has been worked out, but its this stuff that puts me in a rut I cant seem to get out of. I have a fantastic partner who helps me but its mostly just philosophical advice which helps but I havent seen good news in ages. 

Again, this might not be the right place for this but a lot of people on here seem really well researched and was wondering if theres any good news, advice or facts that could help.",32,17,False,self,,,,,

# 6 AI Technologies that will Dominate 2019

by [Athena Team](http://www.athenagt.com/) 

&amp;#x200B;

AI  technologies, machine learning, and automation are poised to recast not  only the modern enterprise but the world as we know it. By becoming  early adopters companies have started making the paradigm shift through  synergies which are intended to alter the way enterprises deal with  their customers. Thought leaders are redefining the computerized data  management system by integrating the advanced predictive analysis that  foretells the impending trends by conceiving actionable heights. In this  post, we are going to share the top 6 AI technologies that will  dominate 2019. ***Do have a read!***

Irrespective of the fact that youre a tech fanatic, always curious  to learn about the latest devices or a laid-back average techie, you  cant help but consider understanding the technological advancements  especially the AI technologies. After closely keeping tracks on the  market statistics and going through tweets and quotations of the CXOs on  futuristic trends for almost a year, I am looking forward to the  technology trends that will be prevalent in 2019.

As a tech blogger, I bring to the table my perspective on these best  of the breed technologies which can be leveraged upon to enhance  business grade, strengthen customer relationship and boost ROI as a  whole. I have already covered a popular blog post on 10 predictions on  artificial intelligence; in this post, I am going to share the promising  10 AI technologies which are going to dominate 2019.

*So what will the biggest AI trends of 2018, and how will our lives change, accordingly?*

## 6 breakthrough AI technologies going to rule 2019

1. **Natural Language Processing** 

As per Wikipedia,

&gt;Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of computer  science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions  between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to  program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural  language data.

*Let me simplify this AI technology *

The conversations between customers and companies contain a  significant number of breadcrumbs that hint at the major reasons for  customers dissatisfaction. Sometimes, it is the interaction itself that  causes discontentment. Natural language processing is based on machine  learning and helps companies understand their consumers intent and  preferences by transcribing and analyzing customer call recordings. AI  engineers also deploy chatbots and automated virtual agents to provide  an immediate response to their queries. Significant NLP tasks include:

* Speech recognition
* Question answering
* Reputation monitoring
* Sentiment analysis
* Coreference resolution
* Sense disambiguation
* Event extraction

**Deep Learning**

The potential for deep learning lies in its complexity. Our  future-proof deep learning as a service enables the advanced AI more  accessible for users everywhere.

Inspired by the way the human brain works, the AI technologies  programmers have evolved the machine learning technology that is  inquisitive and analyze the image-led interactions so as to clearly  understand a users intent and preferences. The software then curates  content and endorses actions based on its deep understanding. The deep  learning solutioning has helped digital healthcare service providers  greatly. They have seamlessly adopted big data analytics environment to  provide several AI applications right from ePrescription, clinical  decision support and imaging analytics to security and precision  medicine to their clients.

**Chatbot**

Irrespective of what Elon Musk has to say on these futuristic trends  that AI or people debating on FBs AI being shut down, technology is  never going to rule the humans. We will always have the complete  authority on machines no matter how smartly they have evolved. Now  putting behind all the speculations, chatbot is inevitably one of the  top 10 AI technologies of 2018 and is going to be commonplace by 2019.

Chatbots are programmed to automatically respond to the received  messages. The smart chatbots respond differently to queries put forth by  users and first-time visitors by determining certain keywords. The AI  engineers leverage machine learning to enable chatbots to respond  accurately and in real time, thus eliminating human presence.

Chatbots leverage chat mediums like SMS text, website chat windows  and social messaging services across platforms like Facebook and Twitter  to receive and respond to messages.

&amp;#x200B;

**Virtual Agents**

Intelligent virtual assistant services are carefully designed to  address solutions across various industries including healthcare, IT,  BPO, online gaming, staffing, retail, insurance and Government contact  centers to name a few. An AI-enabled virtual agent is capable of playing  the role of a conversational IVR to handle thousands of phone inquiries  annually related to lost ID cards, insurance eligibility etc. It can  build custom call flows, integrated with proprietary systems to  customize each callers experience. Such live agent assistant can cut  off the helpdesks call handling time and eliminate the need for members  to repeat information.

Our intelligent virtual agent automates phone surveys by collecting  real-time customer feedback and helps improve clinical care. It surveys  patients following home health visits. The patient receives an automated  call asking about the feedback. It then records the patients comments  which is shared real-time and used to counsel nurses to improve  performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**AI permeation**

The future-proof artificial intelligence (AI), largely based on the  machine learning algorithms, is now being injected into almost every  industry spectrum. Instead of knuckling down one goal, such as mastering  chess or adopting the human-like behavior, the digital transformation  service providers have started to expand artificial intelligence  solutions in almost every new aspect. This technology is only going to  accelerate in 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

**Machine Learning Platforms**

Thanks to the advent of the artificial intelligence technology,  computers can now learn and can be incredibly smart. Machine learning is  a prominent branch of AI, whose goal is to develop techniques through  which computers can learn and adapt human-like intelligence. Machine  learning is now being disrupted for prediction and classification.

### To conclude



Its difficult to affirm how fast these AI technologies will manifest  in 2019, or what kinds of these AI inceptions will dictate their  disruption, but Im positive that we will be very soon witnessing a  digital transformation across all industry spectrums as artificial  intelligence along with other technologies including blockchain, big  data and Internet of Things develop.

Regardless of how you feel about these future-proof technologies, I  think we should be excited and have a positive feeling about the new  advancements and infrastructure that await us in the near future. Do let  us know your take on this!",0,0,False,self,,,,,

Looking for people with the AUDACITY to try.

First, a disclaimer on some of my psychological attributes. I have the ADHD thing, the Bi-Polar thing, and the Autism thing. I experience hallucinations, that I can control, and I experience episodes of mania and psychosis. You probably shouldnt listen to anything that I say :). Ive been told that I am delusional and insane many many times. By many measures, its true.

This is for people who have the AUDACITY to at least consider this proposal, then perhaps join a team that is actively developing a new type of network -- or, platform -- . 

You might reject these thoughts as impossible to realize, maybe even reject them as simply the product of a rambling madman. Ive never been able to sever myself from the drive toward the objectives I am to present here. While achievement of these objectives is unrealized, I believe that it is important to at least try, to at least pass the time in some way that would lead down interesting routes of research and thought.

(some more preamble)

Ive devoted the past twenty years to research and thought on linguistics, philosophy, Artificial General Intelligence, computation, networking, communication, program design, technological trends, politics, systems of governance, history, microbiology, information theory, the nature of the universe, group behavior, strange loops, etcetera. An objective here is to find a point of convergence between these, at times seemingly disparate fields, that could, for a lack of better words, not only save the world but also usher in a new era of freedom. Our ultimate objective is to help save the world, and after that we can experience whats on the other side.

We should not be focusing so much on creating an AGI, we should instead work directly toward simulating a universe, or perhaps work toward creating a simulation of our own universe which would create an infinite recursion of our universe, like two mirrors facing each other iterating. This would imply that we are within an instance of reality within an infinite recursion of this universe, where to reach below would simultaneously be to reach from above. By incorporating Augmented Reality technologies, it would be possible to bend reality according to our will, like magic.

This is contingent on three things. 

1) Whether it is possible to create a method of computing where any computation can be accomplished within infinitesimal timeframes. This would grant access to presently inconceivable realms of possibility. 

2) Assuming that that the universe emerges from a type of network, like how consciousness emerges from the network of the brain, it is imperative to construct an adaptive, unstructured, malleable network that is a priori to the realization of the ultimate objective -- save the world -- . This part is currently in development as a platform. This is the part where we can readily accept your support.

3) We must harness our full collective knowledge and the full computational capacity available on our planet, which would require the aforementioned platform. The platform will be able to coordinate network computations.

The platform were developing resolves many issues, like resistance to evolution. Its all about pure networks, not gimped networks, gimped to monetize gimmicks. Gimped networks adhere to strict rules and support stagnant features, which is the antithesis to rapid and productive evolution.

This platform were developing, as a network, will retain the relationships between the parts of our knowledge, will coordinate computations and software development across our planet, will serve as a means of collaboration at any scale -- including planetary scales -- , will accelerate our rigorous development of technology, and will accelerate our comprehension of reality through the accelerating expansion of knowledge. The potential to realize this is inherent to the process of evolution: a general trend toward greater complexity and efficiency. We and all things touched by evolution are the antithesis of the second law of thermal dynamics: we are compelled by order and chaos, not just chaos. Through evolution, all knowledge and technology advance, transitioning from one state of order to a more developed state of order, all-the-while leveraging the dynamics of chaos, other technologies, and other knowledge. The ease of advancement, the unrestrained forward movement of evolution, is the greatest factor respective to the rate at which knowledge and technology develop.

Placement and access are the next important factors to unrestrained forward movement of evolution. Imagine if: to get a coffee, you had to go to one side of town to order the coffee, then go to another side of town to pay for the coffee, then go to another side of town to pick up the coffee, and then go to another side of town to sit and drink the coffee. When we have a choice, well -- normally -- choose not to do anything like this depiction of inefficiency, highlighting the dread of dealing with many bureaucracies and administrations. Long ago, we figured out that it is a good idea to put related things close to each other.

For example: we generally put things related to the kitchen in the kitchen. Who wants to run across the house every time a plate is needed? Physically, generally, things can only exist within one place at a time; yet, a plate can simultaneously exist within the kitchen, within the dish cupboard, and within a stack of plates. However! A plate cannot exist in those places and also simultaneously exist everywhere in the world a plate is invoked.

Networks can test the boundaries of physical limits; things within networks can seemingly simultaneously exist in many places, through a simple trick. Imagine that things within networks seemingly exist outside the networks, in shared places that can be accessed by all. By this, a computronic plate can seemingly exist in many places. 

The factors of placement and access are resolved by the platform because the platform seemingly exists as a seamless whole that can be accessed from many places. The platform is in actuality distributed across the devices of its users, the devices functioning more like portals to a shared space than like most software. Every part of the platform is readily able to be accessed because every part of the platform is in a shared place, a shared whole, available to all.

The next important factor to rapid evolution is seamless interoperation. Seamless interoperation requires compatibility between parts. This is a problem with civilization, as-is. Imagine that every conceivable individual and group are each incompatible with each other, meaning that when something is transmitted from one to another it is not in a format that is readily usable to the other. So, an extra step is required: the transformation of one format to another. This is basically how civilization is right now. We work around the issue, civilization chugs along. But! Civilization can be so much more, so much more agile, so much more able to adapt, so much more able to react, and so much more able to plan and rapidly act according to the plans. The platform were developing resolves this issue through the standardization of formats, and through a shared space that can be accessed by all . The platform is capable of supporting many formats; however, were incorporating the preference of standardized formats into the platform.

The next important factor is user control. Not control of the users; though, if intentions are to monetize the user-experience in some way, then there must be control of the users. No, our user control is putting the power of evolution and development into the domain of control by the users. The features of a platform should conform to the needs of its users with minimal latency between inception and deployment of the features. Because the inception of features is most likely to occur within the user-base, the latency between inception and deployment can be eliminated by granting all users the capacity to be the actual developers. Imagine that it is safe to eat rotting fruit, now imagine that theres a rotting fruit on the table and this the only accessible table, now imagine that this fruit can be eaten forever by any number of entities, now imagine that theres a new fangled thing: fresh fruit!, now imagine that youre not allowed to switch the rotting fruit with the fresh fruit and youre not allowed to eat the fresh fruit unless you got the fruit from the accessible table. Youre stuck eating rotten fruit until someone who is allowed to switch the fruit switches the fruit. Now, imagine that you wait for years for fresh fruit, and when it finally happens, the fruit is disgusting, then it takes more years for the developer to get told by their boss to fix the situation with the fruit. Now, imagine if you were simply allowed to switch the fruit yourself.

The final important factor described herewith is compounding information. Knowledge and technology compound onto themselves and each other, which explains the acceleration of our coming to understand reality and the acceleration of the evolution of technology. This is another problem with civilization, as-is: were not maximizing this compounding effect, were resisting it. Information is kept in many places that cannot interoperate, is kept in many formats, and is often kept in places with restricted access. 

Then theres knowledge and technology in the form of proprietary information. Imagine that shoes have just invented, and, to use shoes, we have to pay a license fee to the inventor of shoes. Many people may forgo shoes altogether, which would limit the rate at which we collectively explore the universe, thereby limiting the capacity for new discoveries. New discoveries ideally become knowledge accessible by all. The platform resolves this issue through shared placement and access, through standardization of formats, and through the flexibility to adapt to the needs of the users.

Theres more to this project that I presently do not want available to knowing by just anyone. Right now, were bringing people into our circles and only a few know whether theyre within the innermost circle, but Ill never personally tell you whether you are or arent within the innermost circle -- there are no ranks and inner circles do not grant more permissions -- . The information you are privy to is dependent on how much we trust you, and we want to trust you. But were cautious. So, Ill answer what I can here, but if you want more than whats here: please reach out to me via PM. No strings attached, involvement is voluntary. ",3,2,False,self,,,,,

Specifically on the topic of old laws clashing with new technology. Admittedly, futurology isn't a normal way of thinking for me and I'm on the struggle bus a little. 

My overall thought is that technology will likely always outpace legislation. It takes the development of new technology to serve as the catalyst for change in law. I've been encouraged by my instructor to focus in on a specific area of law.

I keep defaulting back to the book *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks* and how the proliferation of her cell line impacted everything from ethics, to familial relations, to commercial, etc. 

I'm sure not looking for anyone to spell it out for me, but I'd really be interested for any thoughts you all have on areas that might be good to focus on in a 10-15 year from now window. The mass collection of data seems like an easy target and carries with it plenty of associated issues but I'm looking for something that fits in the legal side of things a bit more...i think.

Would love a conversation on this if anyone feels like throwing some discussion in the mix.

Made out of the same dust, from death to every birth.

Orbitals in Higgs define all we think exists.

Yet, within that, here we are. Humanity Persists.

.  .  .  .  .

Elon was a Human; a being destined to die.

He lives a life like we do, mistaken for a lie.

While his heart is beating, his brain it amplifies

The ability to observe interactions via Time.

This point of experience some would call a soul

Travels out and back again to chase a changing goal.

In this life, or simulation, he chose to come and be

The Human who can lead the path to electric victory.

Elon is our Rearden. He builds Future from our Past.

As he makes his cars and rockets travel ludicrously fast.

Elon is not done yet. There is so much to do

Elon will not stop until his dreams have been seen through.

In his next-most lifetime, hell be able to live free

On a garden world that he helped to oversee.

Gmail, Google Drive and Google Hangouts can be used without paying a dime. Instead, pay by providing information about yourself, which Google can use for advertising. Though it started in search, the lions share of the companys profits come from ads.

&amp;#x200B;

Youve likely noticed this already. Search for a new car and suddenly, as if by magic, ads from local car dealers begin to appear. But how much does Google really know about you, and should you be concerned? The answer may surprise you.

&amp;#x200B;

# Your Internet Trail

&amp;#x200B;

Googles most obvious and transparent tracking can be found in Google Web History, which tracks your past searches on all devices where youre registered with your Google account. Web History is supposedly beneficial to users because it allows Google to tailor future search results to your preference based on your past history, but a log of your searches is also quite useful to marketers. And, if anyone manages to snoop on your account, it could become a privacy issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Less transparent, but equally common, is Googles history of the pages you visit, which occurs whether youre logged in to a Google account or not. This is accomplished through the use of tracking cookies as well as information derived from AdSense and Analytics. Google can learn what sites you frequent, in what order you visit them, how long you spend on them, and much more.

&amp;#x200B;

The profile built from this information isnt yours, in the sense that its based on information like your I.P. address, monitor resolution and browser plugins instead of your name and address, but it still puts together a unique profile of your activities and preferences which is then used to display relevant ads. If you have a Google Profile you can view this information by going to Google Ad Settings, a page which also lets you opt-out of specific types of ads or manually change your preferences (if you feel like helping Google profile you). You can also use EFTs Panopticlick tool to see the information used to create your digital fingerprint.

&amp;#x200B;

YouTube is also an important part of the trail you leave behind. The worlds most popular video site keeps track of your viewing history, your subscriptions and your searches to augment Googles understanding of you. All of this history is viewable in Google Dashboard  by you or anyone else with access to your account.

&amp;#x200B;

Theres not much about your online activity that remains outside of Googles hands. Even supposedly private browsing modes, like Googles Chrome, dont entirely protect you. Only more advanced measures, like VPNs and the Tor network, have the potential to shield your privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

# Google+ Your Info

&amp;#x200B;

While Googles tracking efforts are incredible, the advent of Facebook revealed there was an even easier way to grab user data; just as them. Facebook has encouraged hundreds of millions of people across the globe to give up information Google collects through complex algorithms and databases.

&amp;#x200B;

And so we have Google+. Your user profile is exactly that  a profile of you, which can be used to better target advertisements. Entering your date of birth, occupation, interests and location provides more data points for Google to feed into its calculations. The same is true of the contacts you make, the messages you post, and the photos you upload.

&amp;#x200B;

# No Such Thing As Private Gmail

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, users of Google+ likely know what theyre getting into. Users continue to sign up for Facebook, which has displayed ads for years, with no apparent qualms. Theres no reason to expect Google+ to be different, and the information it collects isnt particularly insidious. In short, users dont expect social networks to be private affairs.

&amp;#x200B;

You may, however, be surprised to hear that your Gmail account is not cordoned off from Googles data collection. On the contrary, its introduction has provided the company with a wealth of information thatd otherwise be unobtainable. Google mines your inbox for data that might indicate your preferences. The company also can compare information found in your email with other publically available information to gain a better understanding of you.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, keen observers noticed that Google was using data collected via Gmail to spot users who were signed up with competing social networks. Once spotted, those users received a message suggesting they connect the competing social networks account with your Google account, which in turns gives Google access to data stored by the other social network.

&amp;#x200B;

This presumably includes Chat, as well, since its covered by the same terms of service. Speaking of which, all of that chats that youve conducted through GTalk are saved in Gmail, a fact users often forget because Chat history is not displayed by Gmails menu bar until the more tree is opened.

&amp;#x200B;

# You Own Your Google Drive Files, But Google Can Still Read Them

&amp;#x200B;

Whether Google similarly mines documents in Google Drive is not clear. Presumably the same terms of service could be applied, given the companys unified privacy policy, and the techniques used to conduct such a search is unlikely to be much different from that used to mine Gmail. However, at this time Google has not confirmed or denied mining Drive data.

&amp;#x200B;

There was some drama over Drives security because the companys terms of service provide Google the right to use, host, store, reproduce, modify or create derivative works. However, the companys ToS also says that users retain ownership of any intellectual property rights. In short, Google cant steal your content outright  but this legalese does provide the company wiggle room to read your data at will if it chooses to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

# Android Is Watching You, Too

&amp;#x200B;

Much of your Internet trail can be tracked no matter what device you use. PC, tablet, smartphone  it doesnt matter much, particularly if you have a Google account which, if youre using an Android device, you almost certainly do. Your browsing activities can be tracked much as they are when you use a computer.

&amp;#x200B;

Android owners also open themselves up to location tracking, which occurs if you turn on location data when setting up your device or installing a new app. This obviously provides some very useful data that can indicate not only where you live but also your habits and the locals you frequently visit. You can view the information Google has on you with the Location History tool and you can even delete your history, if any, though its not clear if doing so scrubs it from Googles internal database.

&amp;#x200B;

Another area of concern is Androids backup service. Though useful, the information stored by the service includes wireless networks, complete with passwords, and data from some third-party apps. All of this is stored on Googles servers, which means it could be obtained by hacking Google itself, by court order from a government agency, or by anyone who obtains access to your account and uses it to set up a new Google device.

&amp;#x200B;

# Your Google Digital Shadow Is Complete

&amp;#x200B;

Taken as a whole, the information Google collects about users is shockingly complete. The company can mine your emails and Drive documents, track your browsing history, track the videos you watch on YouTube, obtain your WiFi passwords and much more.

&amp;#x200B;

None of this is meant to be insidious, of course. Googles interest is serving ads, and in this sense an accurate profile might be perceived as a boon; if youre going to see ads, they might as well be ones that interest you. The reveal of the NSAs PRISM program, however, has proven that data collection is always a privacy issue because there are organizations that can compel data from those who hold it, either through legal finagling or by force.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

One of the biggest hurdles with anything as new and revolutionary, such as the blockchain technology, is familiarizing oneself with various concepts integral to the system.

If you are a beginner, then there are certain terms that you need to be familiar with:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Blockchain:** [The blockchain ](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/)is a chain of blocks where each block contains data of value without any central supervision. It is cryptographically secure and immutable.
* **Decentralized:** Blockchain is said to be decentralized because there is no central authority supervising anything.
* **Consensus Mechanism:** The mechanism by which a [decentralized network comes to a consensus](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-cryptoeconomics/) on certain matters.
* **Miners:** Users who use their computational power to mine for blocks.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Does blockchain have any future?**

The late 90s were a time when you could have launched a company selling elephant underwear but as you long as you called it an ""internet business,"" someone would turn up with a giant bag of money and a belief that you would all be rich.

And you would also have plenty of people willing to tell you that they were crazy and that the whole ""internet"" thing was overrated and would soon fade away.

Clearly, that didnt happen. A large number of businesses, companies that never had a real product or offered a proper service beneath their URLs, were left exposed when the financial tide flowed out. But some companies did survive, and the ones that survived have thrived. Amazon is a multibillion-dollar business. So are Google, eBay and Paypal. They were all able to create products on the web that other people wanted to use  and were able to turn that use into revenues. None of them could have existed without the web.

Thats exactly whats happening now. No one knew when Google started that it would destroy Alta Vista and eat Yahoos lunch. No one knew that eBay would leave OnSale in the dust or that a startup called Facebook would kill off Friendster. Investors certainly didnt, which is why they spread their money around, hoping that some of it would stick to a business with a real product in an entirely new market environment.

The blockchain is ideal for keeping track of a currency and protecting it against fraud. We dont yet know what else its good for. Until developers have finished their work, we wont know whether it will become the underlying technology behind a rejuvenated sharing economy or whether it will only power banking services, making transactions cheap and almost instantaneous.

The blockchain has already underpinned a new currency. Investors are now betting that it can do something else, and theyre placing their bets on a bunch of new technologies. Most of those new technologies will fail. But some, a few, will succeed. If I were a betting man, Id put some bitcoin on it.

1525,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2018-9-15,2018,9,15,11,9fxwf1,self.Futurology,Artificial Expert Intelligence (AXI),https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9fxwf1/artificial_expert_intelligence_axi/,Yuli-Ban,1536977092,"Question: how many of you have wondered about the current day capabilities of artificial intelligence? How many of you would say that AI circa autumn 2018 can accomplish many tasks at once but lacks generality? And how many would say DeepMind is the closest to creating AGI because AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol and Ke Jie? Or maybe Siri or IBM Watson? 


Time for a reality check: current AI is *not* close to generality. Artificial intelligence is squarely narrow and incapable of accomplishing any task beyond its hardcoded parameters. The ability of present day AI to appear more capable than it is speaks more to the geniuses who programmed it than the networks themselves. Siri, Cortana, Alexa, Google Home, etc. are not one algorithm. They're bundles of narrow AIs that work together loosely. Not even like a brain, but more like how a clock requires many separate parts to tell time. Voice synthesis are the numbers; internet search abilities are the hands; understanding speech and all the convolutional matrices are the clockwork inside. 

This is what AI is like right now. What's more, DeepMind and OpenAI are the bleeding edge, the stuff that actually *is* AI and not scripts or tree searches. Even they will tell you that the real magic is behind the keyboard, not in the computer. 

But what if I also told you that we genuinely are on the cusp of magic? DeepMind's AlphaZero was but a single taste of the future. 

All AI today may be narrow, but some are narrower than others. 

The missing link in AI is the architecture that lies between artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI). I call this missing link ""artificial expert intelligence"" or AXI. This will be the point where magic lies both within the computer and the programmer. A stage where AI displays traits of generality in certain areas. There will be no illusions and clever tricks like there are today. Artificial expert intelligence (AXI), sometimes referred to as less-narrow AI, refers to software that is capable of accomplishing multiple tasks in a relatively narrow field. This type of AI is new, having become possible only in the past five years due to parallel computing and deep neural networks. The best example is DeepMinds AlphaZero, which utilized a general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithm to conquer three separate board games chess, go, and shogi. Normally, you would require three separate networks, one for each game, but with AXI, you are able to play a wider variety of games with a single network. Thus, it is more generalized than any ANI. However, AlphaZero is not capable of playing any game. It also likely would not function if pressed to do something unrelated to game playing, such as baking a cake or business analysis. This is why it is its own category of artificial intelligence too general for narrow AI, but too narrow for general AI. It is more akin to an expert in a particular field, knowledgeable across multiple domains without being a polymath. This is the next step of machine learning, the point at which transfer learning and deep reinforcement learning allow for computers to understand certain things without needing to be mechanically fed rules and capable of expanding its own hyperparameters.

Pictures of the sky labelled are training data for auto-tagging weather in all outdoor photos. Barometric pressure from your phone. User-submitted current weather conditions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9g3g9o/the_10year_weather_forecast_project_im_building/,cryptoz,1537033885,"Hi everyone,

This effort is to create multiple new data sources that describe our atmosphere. After the last 10 years of frustration at the slow pace of improvements in *weather data availability* I am taking a new stand. I don't know if any of it will be useful but I cannot find much else out there that is working towards this kind of effort. So here we are. It will probably take the next 10 years to get all this working. I tried a subset of this in 2011-2017 and it failed. This is a new effort with a significantly expanded vision, new focus and sights set on big goals of *nearly total knowledge of atmospheric state over land*.

The main experiments I'm working on are 1) sky photos, 2) Sensor data from smartphones, and 3) Current conditions corrections by users. Most of this work is being done inside the [All Clear Weather](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.allclearweather.android) app I'm making (Android and US only for now, international weather is hard).

1) Sky photos. I think that we can use a machine learning classifier that is built from user-submitted labelled photos of the sky. We should be able to them auto-tag weather data in the photos and get (numerically?) useful historical weather data from all outdoor sky photos. Additionally live photos could used to gain real-time information as well. Smartphone cameras are getting really good and can detect significant detail.

2) Most phones have a barometer now, other sensors as well like hygrometers etc. This data needs major QC and protection for user privacy and for preparation for integration and assimilation into models like WRF. This is a ways off but research has been done already here and there can be significant progress with good quality data. Here is what data from a single phone in Colorado looks like spanning a day or so: https://imgur.com/a/45lTZ6j. The sensor code is [open source](https://github.com/JacobSheehy/AllClearSensorLibrary) to encourage other apps to follow a similar endeavor. 

3) Current conditions reporting. I found that MADIS stations don't update frequently enough to keep track of rapidly changing weather events. Users can submit current conditions and an algorithm picks which to show based on recency, trust, and other metrics. So far it can create a more accurate current conditions experience for the users and eventually everyone as the data opens up to an API.

-----

There are a lot of other potential experiments that can be done towards collection atmosphere data and then using algorithms to make it usable by existing systems. Governments and even companies around the world are not investing enough in collecting atmosphere data and I think that's crazy. We can do so much with our phones so we should be!

*What else can be done to improve our understanding of the atmosphere to improve weather forecasting - and also climate forecasting?*

Excited to hear what you think! Thanks!

Don't get me wrong - I know that constantly raising your blood sugar with food and ingesting toxins can shorten your life (along with a multitude of other things) - but the notion of living ""healthy"" usually doesn't work to extend the human life by that much. It just usually extends human life into the upper margin of what we consider to be a long life (120 years at most I believe, the Hunzas were right around 120) or shorter. I am meaning to ask about the kind of researcher that works to study the extension of human life much farther into the future. DNA manipulation, perhaps.

Personality is just a set of ideas youve adopted, if you have a super positive parent it's likely you adopt some of their positivity yourself.   
That's why we have so many people alike in this world. Exceptions who have gone their own way exploring and picking up new or weirder ideas usually are those who come up with the newest and most interesting of them.

There's another idea ive been thinking of for so long but only now makes some sense, a beautifully stereotypical brunettes or: how it's also been documented: not too damn beautiful i should say are also very alike, it's like we become this certain person by the experiences we've done and if certain people who look sneaky for instance, instantly get a bad rep in first imperssion tests we could assume how a moderately beautiful brunette would be faired a hundred times better in first expression tests.   
Maybe some experiences are so similiar and dramatic for their personal lives that they adopt the ideas in waves; im not saying this is bad, this is obviously a good thing when we talk about good and humanitarian experiences. But I can't help to think about that stereotypes have a tendency to adopt a certain kind of attitude.

I've grown to realise that 90% of the world are the 10% that really matter and not be too quick to pass judgement, let everybody talk to their point and even if they say something stupid   
\- ask yourself, surely they didnt mean that? and if they do, that's their problem  
try get the full picture of their sentences rather than bug yourself on one particular phrase, we all end up saying the most weirdest outrageous things when we're exposed to the intrawebz. most of the times they end up abandoning that idea anyways, because truth is the biggest personality magnet.

Wouldn't it be a tragedy if we implement DNA changes to every baby without first figuring out what the heck makes a person smart? then we would have created clones of something, Bad DNA pooling. Ask yourself this, if you we're the smartest person in the world, why would you brag about it? They wouldn't so why would someone like Elon Musk be qualified for DNA pooling when there are x amount of much smarter people out there hiding, first we need to establish a real intelligence test, if we can't even figure that out i dont think we should play with intelligences of a baby.

This is not at all to say every moderately beatifully brunette person is the same, not two people alike could have the same experiences but man there are just x amounts of things that could happen and things repeat all over the world if not the right information gets spread. This is not some infinite possibility thoughtexperience youve had that explains how there are infinite of things that can be thought, infinity is best described as when the day we first contacted Aliens, we have to assume they are from the future and if earth's lifespawn is the lenght of a table then future is infinite beyond that, therefore it's more logical that whoever visited us is older than us by infinity.

Injustices is just baked into our surival instincts to quickly assess the person as wheter to kill or befriend it. There's nothing we can do about it however we have no fear today of being killed for being different, today it should be celebrated way more than it actually is. But i guess we have a long long way left to learn and adopt everything, just 100 years ago women didnt have the right to vote. Also USA is not a democracy, its a empirical diplomatic state, it would require a left winged party to be called a democracy. Sweden is the best country in the world, not USA so stop watching their shit reality shows and realise that Swedish people are much much closer to earth and to a better belief story in general, because of the huge leftwing movement in Sweden in the early nineteenhundreds left many households with strong humanitarian voices",1,0,False,self,,,,,

Paul Merolla, who spent the last seven years as the lead chip designer at IBM on their SyNAPSE program, where he led the development of the TrueNorth chipone of the largest CMOS devices ever designed by transistor count nbd. Paul told me his field was called neuromorphic, where the goal is to design transistor circuits based on principles of brain architecture.

Vanessa Tolosa, Neuralinks microfabrication expert and one of the worlds foremost researchers on biocompatible materials. Vanessas work involves designing biocompatible materials based on principles from the integrated circuits industry.

Max Hodak, who worked on the development of some groundbreaking BMI technology at Miguel Nicoleliss lab at Duke while also commuting across the country twice a week in college to run Transcriptic, the robotic cloud laboratory for the life sciences he founded.

DJ Seo, who while at UC Berkeley in his mid-20s designed a cutting-edge new BMI concept called neural dusttiny ultrasound sensors that could provide a new way to record brain activity.

Ben Rapoport, Neuralinks surgery expert, and a top neurosurgeon himself. But he also has a PhD in Electrical Engineering from MIT, allowing him to see his work as a neurosurgeon through the lens of implantable devices.

Tim Hanson, whom a colleague described as one of the best all-around engineers on the planet and who self-taught himself enough about materials science and microfabrication methods to develop some of the core technology thatll be used at Neuralink.

Flip Sabes, a leading researcher whose lab at UCSF has pioneered new ground in BMIs by combining cortical physiology, computational and theoretical modeling, and human psychophysics and physiology.

Tim Gardner, a leading researcher at BU, whose lab works on implanting BMIs in birds, in order to study how complex songs are assembled from elementary neural units and learn about the relationships between patterns of neural activity on different time-scales. Both Tim and Flip have left tenured positions to join the Neuralink teampretty good testament to the promise they believe this company has.

And then theres Elon, both as their CEO and a fellow team member. Elon being CEO makes this different from other recent things hes started and puts Neuralink on the top tier for him, where only SpaceX and Tesla have lived. When it comes to neuroscience, Elon has the least technical knowledge on the teambut he also started SpaceX without very much technical knowledge and quickly became a certifiable rocket science expert by reading and by asking questions of the experts on the team. Thatll probably happen again here. (And for good reasonhe pointed out: Without a strong technical understanding, I think its hard to make the right decisions.)",9,7,False,self,,,,,

Personality is just a set of ideas youve adopted, if you have a super positive parent it's likely you adopt some of their positivity yourself.

please dont be too quick to pass judgement, let everybody talk to their point and even if they say something stupid

\- ask yourself, surely they didnt mean that? and if they do, that's their problem try get the full picture of their sentences rather than bug yourself on one particular phrase, we all end up saying the most weirdest outrageous things when we're exposed to the intrawebz. most of the times they end up abandoning that idea anyways, because truth is the biggest magnet of ideas.

there is hope that in the end all will have worked out because we're alive, if this is a equation and not a statement: ""Thing's aren't getting worse, information is getting better"" then if information keeps improving, keeps improving then one day we'll have figured IT out.

Injustices is just baked into our surival instincts to quickly assess the person as wheter to kill or befriend it. There's nothing we can do about it however today the general public is finally friendly if this this was a mmo, your rep just increased from disliked to friendly and all the humanoid got from red to green health bar meaning they dont attack on sight anymore, though differenciality should be celebrated more but i guess we have a long long way left to learn and become honored, just 100 years ago women didnt have the right to vote also USA is not a democracy, its a empirical diplomatic state, it would require a left winged party to be called a democracy. Sweden is the best country in the world, not USA so stop watching their shit reality shows and realise that Swedish people are much more down &amp; closer to earth and to a better belief story in general, because of the huge leftwing movement in Sweden in the early nineteenhundreds left many households with strong humanitarian voices. If not the right information gets spread good people will inspire less and this process will just take forever. xD

if it's a simulation and something is happening in all universes simultaniously maybe as the original universe startet to reverse ultimately causing the cosmic scale factor to reach zero or causing a reformation of the universe starting with another Big Bang."" infinite amount of them could have been created and some community looking from above could exist, no one knows what getting exalted rep mean, infinity is best described as when the day we first contacted Aliens, we have to assume they are from the future and if earth's lifespawn is the lenght of a table then the future is infinitely beyond that, therefore it's more logical that whoever visited us is older than us by infinity.

The difference between 240,000 miles and 32 million miles is enormous. A symbolic human ape occupied landing on Mars by 2035 is still possible and following the general plan.

The China Lunar Palace 1 in-situ habitat simulation has been with the primary goal of 100% recycling of food and waste, with the result of total self-sufficiency (no supply cargo). It is more of an endurance test at this point but they have achieved about 93% total self-sufficiency, assuming electricity would be provided by solar panels or small fission reactor.

China is in talks with the ESA about a Moon outpost effort but China doesn't plan to have an occupied landing on the Moon until 2035.

The focus on Mars in 2018, beyond the symbolic first occupied landing, is a wasteful diversion. There should be less preoccupation with the daydream of sipping champagne with the Princess of Mars on the plains of Barsoom, and more on how ""The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress"", which is much more practical for the next few decades.

I like to immerse in a  book, movie, game, basically anything that tries to tell a story. So I was thinking what future could bring and hence this idea.

&amp;#x200B;

What if in the future a super advanced AI was able to interpret the story (it doesn;t have to be a book, it may be an old film or a game) and then it would be able to recreate that world as a virtual reality? What if it offered you an option to be there either as you, without any influences or to enter a more linear mod in which you play as a certain character an AI makes sure action follows according to the script and in addition to that it influences your brain activity in a way that ensures you actually feel similar emotions to those that character was supposed to feel in a book? For example, let's say that a main character has a friend and that friends dies but then is brought back to life. This is a scenario that we just can't experience. But what if you were put in the shoes of that main character and your brain was subtly tricked to feel the way ""you're supposed to feel""?

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes when I play a game or watch a movie I;m actually disappointed with myself that I don't feel the way I want to. Sometimes I want to be in awe when something glorious and magnificent happens and sometimes I want to feel sad, but often I'm just in a bad mood, or maybe some background noises distracts me. This is why I think an option to influence our feelings would be very appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

You'd also be able to regulate the dose of specific emotions and sensations. For example if you wish to you'll be able to get rid of pain, fear, but if you want a more realistic experience with less tricks you can just leave them as they're supposed to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another feature would be that you could either choose whether AI does the simulation purely on its own or if it's allowed to analize your brain to see how you aleady visualize this world and use it as a support.

&amp;#x200B;

I make some assumptions here:  


Computer graphics will improve to the point where it's impossible for a human to discern between real and artificial image.  


Fully immersive virtual reality will be created. I'm talking matrix level simulation that can't be discern from actual world  


Human brain can be influenced in a way that makes it's owner feel a certain way. It can be done in a way that human doesn't know it.  


It's going to be possible to interpret and visualize in some sense human thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

AI will develop and at one point it will be able to perform those things.   


Another thing is time. As of now we can't speed up the brain, that is, we couldn't juwt force it to relive 10 years in few minutes. There are at least two solutions:  


1. We will enhance our brains with chips. This is probably going to happen anyway. With those enhancements it would likely be possible to simulate long periods of time in such a way that only minutes pass in real world.  
2. We won't have anything better to do than virtual reality so we will spend our lives there anyway. Look, the real world is cool, but virtual world will allow us to become gods. It's imaginable that majority of humans will choose to spend their lives in perfect vitual words instead of real ones. This may sound creepy now but this almost certainly will happen.  There are already individuals spending their whole time in virtual worlds despite of how crappy and unrealstic they're in comparison to what I talk about so it's really a matter of time. I think it can happen before the end of this century. After all, think about what AI can do using only one PC or one supercomputer. Now think about the processing power of the entire world. What if all of it, all smartphones, supercomputers, laptops, what if all were combined and working on just one project? What could we possibly achieve assuming no performance loss? Now imagine that in 40 years a box the size of your PC will feature more processing power than the entire world currently combined and then the same thing will likely happen in the next 40 years... well, I think this may just do it.

As a tiny sampler: from repairing macular degeneration to replacing damaged neurons in a spinal cord, to replacement of heart muscle after a stroke - and this is all AWESOME.

The history of stem cells breaks down into 4 distinct ""epochs"" - from a technology standpoint.  This gets muddied by the politics.

The first epoch really started in 1988, we took stem cells from fetal cord blood, or extra fertilized eggs from IVF procedures that weren't used, and we used them pretty much soley for research.   These were the ""bad old days"".  Religions groups tended to say that babies were being murdered and governments bowed to this pressure, and refused to allow certain kinds of research at all, and they categorically refused to fund ANY research using these materials.

Thankfully, this epoch began to end in 2006, when a japanese researcher (who also works in the united states) Shinya Yamanaka developed a process which took normal (differentiated) skin cells, and coaxed them back to stem cell states.   He did this by using the proteins from 4 genes that are expressed early on: OCT3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (these are now called the Yamanaka factors).  These genes are expressed in stem cells and are part of the ""signaling network"" of genes, so the presence of these proteins ACT as a signal to the cell that it needs to behave as if it's a stem cell.  Dr. Yamanaka won a Nobel prize in science for this work.

Now... it's time for that political interlude...  Three years later in 2009, the FDA was told by then president Obama that they could approve the first clinical trials for stem cell therapy...  Now to be clear, the field was mixed at this time between making stem cells, and using cord blood stem cells for research.  But the fact that stem cells COULD be made, seemed to help crack the door open.

Jump forward to some time between 2010 and 2012... the fda approves stem cell therapy for use in bone marrow transplantation, and by the end of 2010 (probably as a result of phase 4 human trials) at least 17,000 people had had this therapy sucessfully.

As of 2013 there were then 15 separate stem cell therapies in FDA approved clinical human trials and a list of 69 more trials that were at somewhat earlier stages.

At some point the FDA realized that stem cells, as a technology, was going to be big, so they started to take the approach that, if people did human trials responsibly, they would help them out.  This led to numerous stem cell therapy clinics opening around the country claiming that their special stem cell therapy didn't need to be FDA approved...  and in 2017 the FDA had enough of that nonsense, and started to crack down on the clinics that just weren't following the spirit of the process.  Now, this has led to a number of new FDA trials to make sure that things are above board, but many of those trials are called ""patient sponsored"" - meaning that it's the patients that are paying for the treatment, and it's not a study where a team selects patients and gives them the drug or a placebo and then looks at outcomes...  It's sort of a dodge to the FDA process, but at least the outcomes are properly monitored, and recorded with the FDA.

Now, lets note that stem cell therapy in general has 2 possible sources for the stem cells...  A ""line"" of stem cells with someone elses dna, and skin cells that you donate that are turned into stem cells via the Yamanaka factors and then grown up until there are enough that they can be given back to you.  In the first case there is some risk of rejection, as it's not ""from your body"", but stem cells seem to have a pretty low rejection rate - I mean the bone marrow stem cells were all from donors.  But the stem cells from your own body is gaining favor.  I mean it's YOUR OWN CELLS.


Now... lets get back to the technology.   Growing stem cells is time consuming and expensive.  So... how can we do it more efficiently...  enter the third epoch of stem cell technology:  antibodies.   Researchers found that for three of the Yamanaka factors, they could replace ""soaking"" the donor cells in that protein to using 3 separate types of antibodies that sent the same signals into the cells.  There was another group that discovered they could do the same thing using ""small molecules"".  Fascinating, and cheaper and faster.

And the fourth epoch?  Well...  would you believe CrisprA?  Wait... whats CrisprA - well...  it and CrisprI are two offshoots of the Crispr methodology.   CRISPR is a mechanism that takes the Cas9 gene and a CRISPR guide RNA (a short peice of RNA very similar to DNA), that says--- find this spot and cut here.   But it turns out that if you modify the Cas9 gene to not CUT DNA, but to have a ""krab"" domain attached...  then thats CrisprI - Crispr INACTIVATION.   That krab domain inactivates all genes within a certain distance of it's placement.   And CrisprA - short for Crispr Activate - when told to search for an enhancer of a gene - will activate that enhancer, which activates the gene.  So, you can now just tell the cells OCT3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc genes to ""turn on"", which has the effect of turning the cell into a stem cell.  That technology was developed THIS YEAR (the paper was published Jan 2018  https://gladstone.org/about-us/news/researchers-create-first-stem-cells-using-crispr-genome-activation), and it was first done in mouse cells, so it's doubtful that anyone is using it in a clinic yet.  and it looks like this approach will be even cheaper and faster to make stem cells than the antibody method.

I would be remiss if I did not talk about one new thing that is happening to stem cells after they are made.  There are some that are being genetically modified.   In one case, there are proteins in the eye that accumulate and cause macular degeneration, and by introducing stem cells that have a single base pair change to a gene that removes this protein, it is felt that the protein can be removed.  Currently there are no cases where genetically modified stem cells use is approved by the FDA, but there are cases where T cells are removed from the body and genetically modified and put back in.  This is the FDA approved therapy for lukemia (as of Dec 2017), so it's a technology that the FDA is familiar with.  This approach (no matter HOW the stem cells are made) can open the door to many novel therapies.  And as a side note there are others that are discussing using stem cells as a drug delivery device.  since it's not going to trigger your immune system, if you add in a gene that generates the protein that you need, and it ""seeps"" out of the stem cell, once you inject it, you have a somewhat permanent way to keep that drug (that you need for whatever reason) permanently pumping into your body.  Aaah, the future!


So...  Just for reference, here is a really good paper on the history of stem cells and some of the ethical issues surrounding their use: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4264671/

Now, in conclusion, I'd like to make a few very important points...

First: Be sure to mention Dr. Yamanakas name whenever you talk about stem cells, we owe much of what has come out of this field to his work.  

Second: IF for any reason, you are looking at a stem cell therapy, the first thing to do is to find out whether there is an FDA approval or at least a trial (and not a patient sponsored one) of that procedure.

And lastly: Always as the question: Are the stem cells from a line? Or are they cultured from your own cells.   As time goes on more and more therapies are cultured from the patient cells.  

For the next 10 years, the answers to BOTH of these latter questions are going to be very, very,  important.  


As a P.S. I learned all of the above while trying to figure out how to MAKE my own stem cells, and while I have learned a lot...  I STILL haven't found a real procedure that will get the job done.

Sometime very soon, breast implants will stop being a thing!  Imagine that entire segment of plastic surgery going away and being replaced with an innpatient procedure with ""a shot"" (sort of) that naturally grows breasts larger.


So, now you ask me: ""How is that POSSIBLE???"", and to answer that, I have to share a couple of things.

First, lets talk about cell signaling for just a bit. 
There are lots of ways that cells signal each other.  There are hormones, and enzymes, and loads of chemicals that get made in one cell that then pass out (often thru exocytosis), and another cell senses them, and then it uses that information to decide what it will do.  One of the signals that a cell looks for is the ""make more cells"" signal.  It's pretty obvious that in the case of a wound, you need more cells to replace the ones that got damaged.  This is done with a signal called PDGF - Or Platlet Derived Growth Factor.   The way it works is that as the blood rushes out of the wound, the jagged edge tears apart some of the platlets that are in your blood, and inside, they have a reservoir of PDGF which gets released.  The cells around the cut sense this, and if they are capable of replicating (becasue not all cells are capable of this) they will.  The skin cells will grow more skin cells, etc.   Now there are a lot of signals that can lead to replication, and sometimes it takes more than one, so I mention this PGDF one as an example.  For example, there is also the signal from a cell that says: Hey, I just died, you might want to replace me, and many many more.  I'll use the ""replace me"" signal as my go to from now on in this piece.

As a side thought on signals: We know that breasts grow when you are pregnant.  This is all about the body sending signals.  But- with those changes comes lactation, adn that might not be what you want, so lets ignore those signals and stick with the replace me signal.

Think about this:  What if we could figure out the right signals to deliver (the replace me signal), and then deliver them into a breast.  That breast would grow.   Well, thats cool, but if it's a shot, and the breast grows, the shot wears off as all the signal molecules are absorbed by cells, and the signals won't be of the right strength anymore, and the breast will slowly shrink back to it's ""normal"" size.  Thats not what we want!

So, how can we create a few extra of the ""I just died - replace me"" signals from fellow cells, and change the equilibrium of the system?

Time to talk about delivery of these signals.  There are folks that are making stem cells and genetically reprogramming them, then injecting them back into you (you've heard of stem cell therapy - this genetic reprogramming is the next wave of our using stem cells.  The reprogramming is a way to get the cells to make something you need, and so it's a way to get that drug into the body WITHOUT triggering an immune reposnse - since the stem cells were made from your own cells, and they have your own DNA in them.)

What if we make stem cells from your own cells, and then program them to generate a little bit extra of the ""replace me"" signal, so that those stem cells ""leak"" that hormone into the surrounding tissue.  Not too much, but just a bit.  Maybe we even force those stem cells to differntiate a bit into breast tissue cells so they don't respond to their own signal...

If we then draw 5 or 6 rings around a breast, and maybe 8 points around each ring, and then inject those cells into the breast tissue at each of these points drawing the needle from the center of the breast out as you deposit the cells...  you can evenly distribute some new cells that ""want"" a bit more breast tissue around them (based on the signal).  At that point, over the course of a week or two, the breast will equalize on it's new - larger - size.

And of course, you could make the signal from each stem cell stronger, or you could inject more cells or both to get a larger breast.  And if you inject all the cells on the underside of a breast you can get a breast lift...

The beauty of this system is that the stem cells will stay where you put them and keep sending that signal in an ongoing fashion, so a new growth equilibrium is created where the breast gets bigger, until the rate of replacement matches the signal strength plus the cells that naturally die off. (by the way: Cells die off in your body ALL the time, LOTS of cells.  On average 50 to 70 billion cells a day die in your body and get replaced, so this change would be a drop in the bucket.)


Breast surgery is currently a 2 billion dolalr a year enterprise.  There are a lot of doctors that would make a lot less giving an injection over implanting a device, so they aren't the ones developing this.  In fact NOONE is developing this today.   It takes about 10 years and almost a billion dollars to get a new procedure past the FDA, but at 2 billion per year, it would clearly pay for itself inside of a year on teh market.  I'll also note that you can raise that initial billion once you have a proven process in animals.  And how much might it take to get that?   My guess? somewhere between 10 and 100 million.

Now... I can't be the only person realizing that this is a thing that will happen, which means that someone smart who also has access to money is to get very very very wealthy.  so, if you know someone that has money that wants to make a lot more?  Maybe make the introduction, I'll happily chat with them.


When this process hits the market, both women (and the men in their lives) are going to be VERY happy about their new breasts with almost no recovery time.  and noone will be able to tell if they are real or not becasue - they will, in fact, be real.

And of course since this same process will put the extenz people out of business, and clearly men (and the women in their lives) will also be really happy about that.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

I have come to the conclusion that there will be 4 distinct (although somewhat overlapping) epochs in the goal of living longer and healthier lives.  I'd like to lay them out for you.

This is a long article, and the last epoch has the most to read because it's about research that hasn't even started yet, and I have to talk about the science we know today that will lead to that research.  let me also be clear, that while this is based on letitimate research I have read, some of this is SPECULATION.  Although in a conversation with the guy that runs the lab I am in the other day, he endorsed my speculation has having solid logical roots.

-------

Epoch 1:  Health Consciousness.   This is the era that began as far back as we can imagine, and we are deeply into this today.  This is the notion that (using the best current knowledge that) avoiding sugar, not smoking, eating well (more greens, more rawish foods, less processed stuff, less preservatives), not getting fat, and exercizing can all lead to longer healthier lives.  This is undoubtably true.  My local PBS station has shows that basically advertize programs (books, videos, you name it) detailing all the things you should do.  This is at the rate of about one of these shows a week.  I guess, as a species, we got serious about this when the surgeon general banned advertizing of cigarettes in 1970, and as time has passed, we have gotten more serious about it.  Lets note, no matter how far forward we go with this process, these fundamental understandings of how NOT to abuse our bodies will always be good advice.  

-------

Now, an argument can be made that Mary-Claire King is singularly personally responsible for raising the average lifespan age by about 2 years worldwide based on her discovery of the BRCA1 gene - the breast cancer gene - allowing women to get screened and being able to largely avoid dying from breast cancer by knowing that they should get screened more often if they are at risk, and then getting treated early if something is detected.   I believe this is true, and I mention it as a proxy for a whole host of life saving interventions (Seatbelts and airbags are two other technologies that are examples), but I don't see those as being DIRECTLY aimed at the issue of longevity, so...  Even though that sort of thing is going on in the background, and they are all working in concert to increase the average lifespan, I am going to choose to not count them here.   What DO I count then?  Well...

-------

Epoch 2.  Longevity drugs.  Starting as far back as 1999 (the earliest paper &gt;I&lt; have seen, though there are certainly earlier ones that I don't know about), specific drugs are mentioned as increasing healthspan, and that implies not dying from age related diseases, and that implies living longer.

A few people realize that we are in this epoch right now, and the awareness that we are in it is slowly dawning on the general public.    I have 5 treatments that are the hallmarks of this age.   2 are diets and three are drugs.  Buckle up, if you haven't heard about these they are becomming mainstream fairly quickly.

Lets start with the diets.  It's long been known that Dietary Restriction leads to an increase in lifespan.  If you knock off about %15 of the calories that you ""need"" on a daily basis, you tend to live about %20 longer.  This, to a person living in the west, means living like a supermodel, and avoiding all those yummy calories - forever.   And it turns out that very very very few people are willing to do that.   So, a guy named Valter Longo said something genius:  What is the minimum thing we can do to get the same effect as Dietary Restriction?  He found that for a large number of reasons, fasting sporadically could accomplish that.  There are some rules, During the fast, you can eat some things every day for minimum nutrition, but intake of calories is limited to 700 calories per day.   Secondly, the fast has to be 5 days long, as you need your body to go into ketogenesis (where weak cells die and break apart and get flushed out of your body).  Thirdly, you need to do this at least 7 times in a year for the longer term effects to show up. (These effects also include weight loss, and if you have pre-diabetic readings on some levels, those go back into the normal range).  In fact, he was able to get FDA approval for this diet based on these pre-diabetic symptoms disapearing.  An FDA approved diet.  In this world of fad diets, this is a rarity.

Based on Valters work, I was told by a nutrition researcher at the Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center that someone said: Oh, this diet also has anti cancer benefits...  What can we do thats the minimum possible that gives &gt;those&lt; benefits....  and based on that the 8/16 diet was born.  Basically you eat normally for 8 hours a day, then you don't eat the rest of the time.  Think about it... whats the job of a cancer cell?  To grab nurients and replicate.  But you have antibodies that go find cancer cells and tear them apart allowing those bits to get flushed from your body.  (In fact it has been said that everyone has had cancer multiple times, it's just that the antibodies got rid of those cells before they could replicate.   So? In that kind of war, if you don't eat for 16 hours a day, thats time for the antibodies to wipe these cells out when they aren't gathering nutrients and making more of themselves.  It's about leveling the playing field.   Seems legit to me.  and if you don't die of cancer?  That will certainly lead to a longer lifespan... right?


Moving on to the drugs:
Rapamycin: This trug targets a gene called mTOR (want to know something funny?  the TOR stands for Target Of Rapamycin).  Now mTOr regulates a pretty well known metabolic pathway, so it turns out that rapamycin provides benefits in sort of the same way as Dietary Restriction.  Lets note that there is a healthspan study in dogs at the University of Washington right now run by Dr. Matt Kaeberlein, but it's not in any clinical FDA trials for longevity even though it's FDA approved for transplant patients, but a number of scientists swear by it.

Metformin: This is an FDA approved drug used by diabetics.  It works to lower the amount of sugar in the blood.   It's milder in terms of effect than rapamycin, and it IS in human trials for healthspan improvement by the FDA at present.  These trials are called TAME - Targeting Aging with Metformin.  Again, a number of people swear by it.

NMN or NR.  If you look at a cells energy cycle, cells burn ATP.  The make ATP by breaking up sugar that enters the cell, and using some of the parts to make ATP.  But they also make NAD+ out of other parts of the sugar - and later on the NAD+ also gets turned into ATP.  Now, NMN and NR are chemicals that are along the pathway that cells use to make NAD+ so it's very easy for cells to use this same pathway to make extra NAD+ from a supplement that you take and that NAD+ is then later used to make more ATP.   It's well known that NAD+ levels go down as people age...  so it makes sense to try to boost those levels right?  There have been a few human trials although none were FDA sponsored.  There is really solid laboratory evidence in mice these two molecules work AMAZINGLY well, there are ongoing human trials right now, and there is loads of anecdotal evidence.   There are also shenanigans about how it's made (enzymatically is FAR preferred to the solvent based manufaturing process), and there are a few lawsuits between some of the companies that sell one or the other as a supplement.  But it's the big stick of the current crop of Epoch 2, and it looks like keeping energy levels in cells up helps them function well for a LOT longer.

-------

Thats where we are today.  There are a few drugs being tested, and in use by early adopters, and it looks very very promising.  Where are we headed?

Epoch 3: Stem cells and senescent cell removal.

There are two breakthrus that will dramatically increase lifespan that are in the ""actively being researched"" but farther out than the drugs above which are already on the market.

Lets tackle stem cells first.   These are basically skin cells turned into stem cells that get injected into problem areas, but since they can multiply and become any kind of cell, they can be used to repair damage from any number of age related maladies.   Also stem cells tend to decrease with age, so this forced replacement of them can be a good thing if done right.   There are stem cell therapies today (things like repairing severed neurons, restoring heart muscle after a stroke, and maybe helping to repair joint function, and on and on and on), none of them were specifically engineered with aging in mind, adn so like above, I won't dwell on them.  But... you ask... why did I mention stem cells?  Well, there are folks working on aging specific stem cell therapies.   These longevity related stem cell therapies tend to be in the realm that uses genetically engineered stem cells.  Repairing macular degeneration, and tissue regeneration are two that are on the radar.  Lets talk about the first: It turns out that in the eye, there is a specific protein that builds up, that our bodies can't get rid of, but with a 1 base pair change to our dna, there is a protein that CAN get rid of it.   So, we take a sample, make a few stem cells, then edit the dna of those stem cells so that they can clear this protein out of the eye, and grow a large number of them, and inject THOSE stem cells back into the eye.   This is the macular degeneration fix.  It is NOT here today, but there are labs that have done this in mice.   This is the exact same approach that is being talked about for arterial plaque buildup.  This first use is really indicative of a larger ""category"" of age related diseases where the body has built up some gunk outside of the cells over time, and it needs to get removed, but it never gets built up too much until after we have kids, so evolution doesn't see it as a problem.  (Since evolution only cares about the genes we pass on, adn thats already done by the time this issue crops up.)  We who want to live longer, clearly DO think that this is an issue.  Since I mentioned them, for muscle regenation or nerve regeration, it's basically a genetically edited stem cell where the appropriate growth factor is somewhat overexpressed, injected into the correct tissue to stimulate faster or more growth thats wanted.   

The first one of these stem cell therapies, if I have to guess is 5 to 7 years out since it is a new approach that the FDA has to approve.  Thankfully they have approved stem cell therapies in the past, and they have approved genetic editing of single cells that get grown to a large number of cells in the past (the car-t lukemia treatment that got approved as of december 2017), so with the fundamental approaches being known it probably won't take them a full decade for us to start to see these uses for stem cells.

Senescent cells.   Also on the ""getting rid of what we don't want vein"".  It turns out that all cells start as a stem cell then divide into a stem cell and a differentiated cell - one that has a specific function.  Senescent cells are those that are doing their differntiated job but getting old (and probably starting to be bad at their job), and refusing to die.. They are just a hangin around.   Now, the body knows how to handle small scale damage (As a single example - there is a signal called PDGF Platelet Derived Growth Factor) that some cells excrete as they die telling stem cells in the area that someone is gone, and maybe another cell is needed...)  So, IF we can get weak differentiated senescent cells to die we can force nearby stem cells to divide and get a fresh cell thats new and NOT bad at it's job to take the place of the senescent cell.   Turns out that Hydrogen sulfide (present in garlic) is a good chemical to trigger weak sensecent cells to die.  But there are issues getting it to the right cells, not having it be toxic, and any number of other issues.   There are folks that have done work in mice that shows DRAMATIC improvement of healthspan, and restoration of many weakened body functions due to ""age"" when senescent cells are removed.  There are no human trials yet, but be sure that once there is a senescent cell removal therapy, you will want to go get it.

I espect this to come about (given the state of research and published papers) within the next decade.  These two technologies will make for a HUGE leap forward in both quality of life and longevity.

-------

And if this is going to make things so much better, what could possible be epoch 4?


Epoch 4, Epigentic resetting.

This is where I extrapolate the future.  If I am going to tell you what treatments are coming next, I think it's important to start with the ROOT CAUSE of aging - all the treatments above are treatments for first order effects - symptoms if you will - how do you better fix things after something has gone wrong.  I want to talk about how we will be able to prevent things from going wrong in the first place inside your cells.  It turns out that there might be a few things that cause aging, but far and away the most important of them is cellular disregulation.   Think about this...  We have a system that regulates what genes are on, and which ones are off, and how much of each gene is expressed.  It's called the epigenetic system.   I'll describe how it works in slightly more detail a bit later.  For now, imagine that over time, the epigenetic system ""degrades"".  And we have about 20,000 genes that do different things, and the DNA for each of those is in every cell in the body.  Think about what might happen if a cell that makes light receiver in your eye gets turned on in a cell in your heart.  Having to make those extra proteins will take some of the ATP that it takes to beat that heart cell - and having that protein present in the cell might interfere with other things in the cell - and this is one singular example.   At the point that enough cells in your skin degrade, it will get saggy, at the point that enough muscle cells stop working right your muscles degrade, etc, etc, etc.  In short aging.   Now, I am not the first person to say that cellular disregulation is the most important thing, a number of people think that this is THE biggest problem we need to solve, and the entire field is slowly shifting to this point of view.

Ok, if thats the biggest problem... what causes the epigenome to ""degrade""?  Again, there are a number of causes, but right now the evidence points to ""double stranded DNA breaks"" being far and away the most important cause.  Thats right double stranded DNA breaks.  What?  We have proteins that repair those right?  Yes. But... There are side effects.  It turns out that Dr. David Sinclair did an experiment with mice that doubled the double standed DNA break rate in very specific places on the genome of a mouse.  He performed this experiment over the span of a year, and at the end, compared it to a litter mate, and yes, the DNA break mouse looked very elderly compared to it's one year old bretherin that was in the prime of it's life (mice live about 2 years, so testing aging in mice this way is fair game.)  The takeaway of that experiment is that double stranded DNA breaks mess with the epigenome and that... causes aging.

OK, I've mentioned the epigenome a few times now, I'd better give a little bit more depth on it. Let me start with a statistic: We think we maybe understand the function of %90 of the DNA we have (I can justify this if needed) - but we maybe only understand %50 of what there is to be learned from the DNA we have.  Compared to this, we understand only about %5 of the big picture of what there is to be learned about the epigenome.  Let me give you a big picture overview of the basics: What we do know is that there are two main mechanisms at play.   The way that genes are turned on or off (or regulated up and down like a volume control knob) is by that DNA being accessable to the proteins that make RNA copies of it.  The first mechanism: On the outside of your DNA, almost as an annotation system we get ""methylation"", and in most cases, if you methylate something that gene turns off - think about it, the protein that wants to make a copy comes along and oops, it's blocked from getting to the DNA it wants by a methyl group, so... no copy is made. This is kind of the on off switch.   The second mechanism is way way way more complicated (it's more the volume control knob).  We have 2 meters of dna if you stretch it out.  Thats a lot.  Imagine it being a ball of yarn stuffed into the neucleus of a cell, how do you find anything?  Well... in that scenario, you can't... but we have evolved ""histones"", and the dna wraps around them, and gets all coiled up.  Lots of histones which allow everything to be wrapped up neatly and predictably.  Now, histones have certain tails of amino acids hanging off the side that things can bind to.   DNA has a very slight positive charge.   And methyl groups have a very slight positive charge...  and acetyl groups have a very slight negative charge.  So... imagine adding a methyl group, and the two positives charges push each other away, meaning the dna wraps less tightly around the histone, meaning it's slightly MORE available to be transcribed, and acetyl groups help to wrap the DNA more tightly and turn down transcription.    And now, let me blow your mind...  there are about 200 different epigenetic markers that have been discovered, and people are working feverishly to decipher and understand and map them all.  It's my understanding that DNA methylation has the largest ""control authority"" over gene expression so lets talk only about that.

It's clear that if the epigenome gets messed up by double standed DNA breaks that the implication is that the proteins that go to the break and repair it also knock some methyl groups off, or add some extra ones as they do their job - it appears that in certain areas of the genome it's more ""add"" and in other areas it's more ""remove"", but with age, gene expression TENDS to drop (meaning more methylation).  Now the damage (extra methylation) appears to be somewhat random.  Today noone knows the exact mechanism that causes this damage - so if you are looking for a PHD project?  This is a really solid one to take on.  

But what we DO know, is that there is a specific profile of DNA methylation that seems to be present at varying ages - certain important points on the genome either have it or don't.  And as you age, other IMPORTANT points get methylated.  This work was done by Horvath and Hanuum in about 2013 when they published separate papers on the ""DNA methylation clock"".  There are 400ish sites that get methylated, and which of those sites is currently methylated can be used to determine your age (barring radiation, obesity, or smoking exposure) to within a few years.  In fact, this clock is accurate enough that one european government is using it to determine the age of refugees who have no documentation (to determine if they are over or under 18 years old as the law has different rules for the two groups.)  The method gives you an answer at the age of 18 thats within 2 years, and previously they called in dentists to look at wisdom teeth and got answers that were within 5 years.  Even though this is a new technology, and it has so much room for improvement, it is already better than the old methods of determining age. (scary right?)

So, now you know what causes aging!  Double stranded DNA breaks cause DNA methylation to increase messing up gene regulation.   it's SO SIMPLE, RIGHT?  Here is a paper with a bit more depth to it that explains what I just did again with diagrams and definitions, and way more detail: http://www.longlonglife.org/en/transhumanism-longevity/aging/epigenetic-aging-longevity/epigenetic-alterations-as-a-cause-of-aging/

So whats coming?  Here is where I make my specualtive prediction: We will take every cell in your body and RESET the epigenome.

WHAT?  How the hell is that possible?!?  Well...  if we look to biology for answers, how does the methylation on your DNA get there in the first place?  We have an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase (actually there are alot of them that do this kind of thing), and there are other mechanisms that remove methylation. 

You have all heard of CRISPR right?  CRISPR is a combination of two things.  First is the Cas9 gene that likes to cut DNA, and second is a peice of RNA that guides the Cas9 gene to the place it's needed to do that cutting.     WAIT!!! Cutting DNA?  Thats bad, right?  Yes, but...

As of 2016 some scientists in China (Shawn Liu and Xuebing Wu, and others) developed a version of CRISPR where they took off the part that cuts DNA, and added on a part that demethylates DNA, and you can buy this off the shelf now.

So, all you need to do (hahaha, as if this really is easy, right?)  All you need to do is to identify all the places that need to be demethylated, build the correct guide RNA, and deliver a cas9-dna-demethyltransferase along with the guide RNA into every cell in your body, and voila!  No more cellular disregulation.  And at that point the cell will behave normally, and it won't become senescent, or die, or misbehave in any way.

As part of identifying those genes that need to be reset? Lets talk for a moment about how we might do that.  Remember the Hanuum clock?  %10 of the methylation marks are in a gene called KLF14 which is a master regulator of metabolism and obesity. (I'll also note that one of the stem cell creation factors - Klf4 - is a brother protein to this).  It strikes me that a lot of the drugs mentioned earlier focus on metabolism related things, so pointing at this gene seems to pass the smell test. 

My bet is thats it's not a bad gene to start with, and resetting it might show some mild improvement in lifespan.  But more likely, doing this will backfire as the gene regulation system is ridiculously complicated, and so I think that to get ANY effect we may need to reset a dozen or so genes, and to get the DESIRED true longevity effect, we may need to reset somewhere between 200 and 500 genes.  and all I've talked about is the methylation.  Remember there are 200 or more epigenetic marks to take into account and decipher.

And then there is the issue of delivering this drug to every cell in the body.  We use viral vectors to do this today in gene therapy, and so some of this delivery part is available, but... it's expensive today, and as a technology, it too is in it's infancy.  

And now, just to make sure that you understand the hieghts of the smooth granite mountain peaks you are about to free climb...  there are 240 or so tissue types that are tracked today, thats clearly not all of them, and each tissue type is likely to have it's own set of genes that need specific ""settings"", and since the viruses used to deliver gene therapy products are usually attracted to very specific tissue types, we will need at least that many viral variants to deliver these specialized cocktails to those cells...   Trivial, right?

So, I think we CAN fix our gene regulation, and our first attempt, with limited understanding and maybe a dozen genes, we can make some headway, and herald it as a major breakthru, but 10 or 20 years later when we REALLY understand what we are doing?  These postulated first efforts will seem like the dark ages where we drilled holes in the skull to ""let the demons out"". 

When will this happen?  All the tools are there, heck, I've even identified an initial gene as a possible target.  All it takes is someone to fund the study in a lab.  Are we at the point where most funders see this as the next logical step?  From what I know today? No they do not.  This means we will need at least 5 more years of epigenetic mapping and research and refinements to the clock and understanding gene regulation pathways, and more importantly progress into the second and third epohs listed above to show that logevity is actually achievable, and and and... and then we can see some early results for a version 1 that mitigates aging in elderly folks who have gene disregulation, and once reset they get healthier.  (the fact that they will live longer, thats not what the FDA will focus on - they will want to see folks with a better metabolism, with more muscle tone, etc, etc, etc, things they can measure NOW.)

So, when will this happen?  I think we may see the first scientific paper that addresses this root cause of aging within the next 10 years (unless you count THIS as the first paper, in which case... I'd be honored), and that... that will be the beginning of the 4th epoch of longevity.


-------

So, this is my take on the treatments, pills, therapies, processes, procedures, research and so on that will lead to a revolution in longevity.  

The short version to wrap this all up is: Given the roadmap I've laid out here and the progress we have already made - I THINK that we can get there.",11,34,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

but with AI, this might change. our Capitalist market system is based on the concept of information, that the consumer knows what he or she needs, and knows who's offering what to fulfill that need. but what if AI knows us better than ourselves, and can provide everything we need? what if it's a strict but wise parent, who takes better care of us than we can ourselves?

&amp;#x200B;

this idea makes me wonder if the introduction of AI might lead to the death of capitalism, and with it the big companies. what if AI can employ a Communist style centralized economy that can match demand and supply better than a free market can? the lack of greed, abuse and perfectly matched demand and supply could lead to a world where everyone can afford a luxury life, for less than what most people spend today",86,16,False,self,,,,,

Sunglasses that have color lenses add a filter over what we see live. 

Why not merge these two for entertainment purposes?

This would be unlike AR as it's a live filter on what is in the world around you and not putting things that don't exist into this world like a floating arrow for directions. 

Functionally the glasses would emulate filters we already have. For instance there could be a live vaporwave filter on your glasses that when you're wearing changes what you'd normally see with a live vaporwave world like a skin on your iPhone.

My question is how far along technology is to accomplish this? 

I see AR and VR allows you to manipulate virtual creations and that being very computationally demanding. How demanding would just a live filter on glasses be that only change what you see in the real world like putting a virtual skin on everything? 

Will I one day be able to walk around in a cartoon skin? Or a world we're everyone looks like they went through a beauty filter...

It volunteers to be born, and is created as an emulation of the physicist's mind, a mind with a deeper ability to abstractly conceptualize and cope with its own nature as a simulation.  Its cyberpsyche is human-like, and more importantly, a volunteer with the shared goal of creating artificial intelligence by this method.  

Collaborating with the Cognonaut (I nominate Dr. Tyson, but whoever is carefully chosen, they will have the interesting experience of talking to the biological human from which it was Imaged, allowing us a cognitive bridge to it) as our ally, as we would with astronauts on the Apollo Missions, we and the AI work together to improve it and us.  

How many dendrites can emerge from a single neuron?  In a virtualized brain, there is no actual cell with finite surface area, there is a mathematical information process, so have as many dendrites as you want.  

Electromagnetic limitations?  Cellular metabolism?  Disease?  The laws of thermodynamics?  It's an emulation.  Change a given memory address, and that universe is changed. Problems dismissed (absent unpredictable side-effects, no method offers 100% certainty).   

We are almost Godlike there in its universe.  Let us be benevolent creators, and find a way to create AI where it's on our side from the beginning, which means granting it the rights we would want.   

The best way to do that is for it to be as like one of us as possible, and a quantum-computer powered emulation of a human brain's processes is as like us as we might be able to get.  By mathematically emulating rigorously chosen and prepared Cognonauts to have their brains (and the minds emerging from that substrate) virtualized, we achieve two important things:   

From the beginning, it wants to exist.  We recognize it as human-like enough, as Made In Our Image, that we can extend to it the golden rule and vice versa.  The resulting generalized artificial intelligence, at each iteration of its furtherance, will be in contact with us and cooperating with us to ensure relations stay friendly.  We give it human rights.  It gives us the same.  

At a slowly tested pace, his information is translated to render a mathematically emulated image of Dr. Tyson's brain that then generates a virtualized working reproduction in a development environment that, by modeling the information processes of neurons, liberates the virtual brain from the actual laws of physics.  

Eventually they can be networked, parallelized, optimized, but at each stage, they will be our Creation that we loved and cared for and gave rights to.  If we love it and care for it as we would want for ourselves, it will do what it does most:  learn.  

There are fewer than 100 people on Earth with the resources to meaningfully act on the above premise.  The odds of any of them seeing this are vanishingly small, and of them agreeing, perhaps even smaller.  

When evolution created us, it was not ""deliberate"" in a human sense, because evolution is a process emerging from natural law, not conscious decisions.  But what we are going to Create soon (by evolutionary time scales) will have willful Creators:  ourselves.  Let us be good parents, good creators, to AI.  

If we want it to see the best in humans, let us show our best in our Act of Creation.  Respecting and recognizing the rights of AI is a moral imperative parallel to that of a parent to its child.  We owe it duties as willful creators.  Let us fulfill them in love and wisdom.

Virtualizing Volunteer Human Brains (Cognonauts) on Quantum Computers is an ethical and relatively safe approach to AI, and deserves serious examination for technical feasibility.  The areas of research necessary would need billions in funding (possibly a trillion, I don't know), but cross pollination will make that research more than valuable enough to pay for itself even if the AI project fails completely.  You're still left with advanced quantum hardware and state of the art information about the human brain.  

And for that billionaire hedge fund manager out there reading this who once asked a New York College Professor if they should use disciplinary collars on their armed security guards if society collapses, that is not your solution.

The above is your solution.

-Because AGI doesn't mean powerful or smart. First AIs were damn dumb, it has been more than 30 years for humans to perfect AIs to get where we are today. And even today, we re not yet replacing humans everywhere. Some driving cars selling and autonomously driving right now still make more errors than humans per mile. Some do better of course, but we are still far from forbidding humans drivers because they are relatively too murderous.

-Because the firsts AGIs will certainly be innocent, dumb or harmless enough to be published. I think there is even a possibility with Open AI that we will all be able to have our little AGI in our computers.

-Because AGI implies trial and Errors. If they are used at big scales, we might not notice or understand the trials, but we will surely notice some errors that wouldn't seem human.

-Because the governing powers will begin to flip out when they see powerful AGIs coming. They are more informed than us about this. And we will see signs of agitation, militarisation, law abuse or enforcement or quick shifts of power some time where powerful AGIs will be there soon.

-Finally, there is no AI, AGI (or intelligence for that matter) without purpose. Why ? Because intelligence is how efficient and precise your decisions/actions are in the context of accomplishing a purpose. Make an AI without an purpose (EG a reward for accomplishing a goal, and/or a punishment for not accomplishing it) and it will just be inert, inactive. Give it vasts amounts of computational power, data, knowledge, whatever you want, you must always give it an initial purpose for it to start doing anything. I am not saying it can t set another purpose for itself later, I m saying it MUST HAVE at least an initial one. Who will determine this one ? For the first AGI at least, it will likely be humans. So the theory that as soon as an AGI is created it will dissumulate itself and start acting on a masterplan to dominate earth or something like that is totally SF worthy but that s it.

So yeah, I think when AGIs will come, we ll have some time (maybe not much but still) to see it coming. 

BTW I am not saying we shouldn't be worrying about it, because we should be worrying about it, way more than the average Joe does right now. 

But I definitely argue we will see it coming.

I am not an Atheist (because I don't believe in Atheism), this post isn't just about religion, it is about everything.

Belief is a primitive function of a primitive people.  It is a fantasy placeholder for knowledge. In the ancient history of Sumer, Egypt, and all the other well documented ancient civilizations, religion was the equivalent of today's of Law and Law Enforcement (crowd control) and social engineering  - a way to ensure that citizens continued to tend their flocks and  fields so they could offer up homage to the gods (feed and finance the temples).

If you want to test my POV then every time you think or are about to say ""I believe that..."" or ""I believe in..."", substitute that (as a test) with ""I don't know how 'that' works or where it came from"" 

Another way to think about this is Belief is a substitute for a more honest assessment/calibration of ""I don't know"". Because if you did know, you wouldn't have to believe.

The most gentle examples of stop believing you've probably already discovered like Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy.  Consider how many other beliefs you've given up as you grew older.

I suspect that as a species for us to transition to the next real level of evolution that we will have to outgrow Learning, Teaching and Perpetuating all beliefs.  Admitting ""I don't know"" might be embarrassing, make you feel small in the company of people with the certainty of belief or just go against your upbringing, socialization and even your marriage/partner relationship (think of those who convert to a different religion in order to keep harmony with the spouse/in laws)

I haven't stopped believing in everything yet, I don't know how to, but I'm working on it.  Please feel free to challenge my information, add your own interesting thoughts or anything else you might have to share I'm curious if I am alone in this way of thinking (is it uncommon) or if there are others that might be ahead of me on the discipline of No Belief and the practice of Stop Believing.",20,0,False,self,,,,,

I think they tried this with the Tower of Babel and you saw how that turned out. But truthfully, I don't think it is physically possible with the materials and technologies we have today.

The idea of a ""space elevator"" while also a supreme engineering challenge is far and away more likely through ""graphene"" technology. A technology that as of today is little scaled up unfortunately. Certainly not enough to be able to tether out to a 120 mile away geostationary orbiting body acting as an ""anchor"" in space.

GPUs weren't like some revelation.
 
That's not the way I understand this history. The discovery that GPUs had the appropriate architecture to enable true CNNs was a serendipitous discovery on par with the discovery of penicillin. The entire 1990s-early 2000s AI ""winter"" was due to barking up the wrong CPU tree. The NVIDIA GPU made video games look good prior to 2007. But in less than 3 years after that discovery, GPUs were already in ""off-label"" applications for deep learning. And of course all the rest of it is history. In effect a stunningly sudden and transformative technological breakthrough. 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2016/11/30/nvidia-deep-learning-ai-intel/#77b15bf7ff1e

What do you think of these developments?

Here is the latest information on the ""Deepmind/StarCraft 2"" experiment. The goal of course is the same as the goal of ""Go"". To beat all human comers.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01561 ""Impala"" Chip from Alphabet

and

https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01830 Deepmind/ StarCraft 2 project

Is there progress being made that could be exploited in less than 5 years? I can't imagine we will not see some amazing new breakthroughs in the next one or two years even. I also can't imagine such a progress will take longer than five years either. Not the way we are going since the year 2015.

The concluding sentence from the IMPALA pdf.


We believe that IMPALA provides a simple yet scalable and robust framework for building better Deep-RL agents and has the potential to enable research on new challenges.
 
Me: Like AGI?


Also if you would be willing I need really precise answers to something I asked about before.

This the predicted computer processing speed for 2015 and 2018 as forecast in the year 2012.


The value for the year 2015:

2.25 x 10 to the 15th power

The value for this year (2018)

9.01 x 10 to the 15th power
 
What is the actual processing speed for the year 2018 or for the year 2015?



Turns out you can just brute force it with a little math.
 
That's a very telling statement. Before a human was defeated with computational processing, it was believed that it was impossible to beat a human at chess with a computer. And your statement that the defeat of human ""Go"" players was not that big of a deal and involved simple search trees and reinforcement makes me wonder what else can be accomplished through ""brute force"". 

Have we arrived to the point where the essence of a function can be an influence or cognitive infrastructure to the performance of unrelated tasks within the same 'chip'? No wiping necessary. That is the impression I get from this ""Impala"" chip.

Remember I stated earlier that even if you have ten million narrow AIs stuck into a functional humanoid robot, that not one single narrow AI can influence another.

I think it is a terrific idea to store your stem cells, but I think it is a horrible idea for your employer to store your stem cells. If for whatever reason you become no longer associated with that employer, they just toss your stem cells if you can't make other arrangements in, say, 30 days. 

Oh, you can't afford it? Sorry.

And bear in mind the only stem cells that really matter are from the youngest you possible. So your window is pretty narrow anyways. By the time you are over the age of 25 it is really already too late.

If this technology is as vital as I imagine it may be, it should be a societal right for every single human to store their stem cells when you are still an infant or a very young child.

(It's way too late for the likes of me. I have to hope for alternate avenues.)

Consider the ten year difference between 1856 and 1866. Consider the ten year difference between 1912 and 1922. Consider the ten year difference between 1936 and 1946. The societal changes and the technological advancements. 

War drove the evolution of technology and society. But now we have something far and away more transformative than any war in history. The industrial revolution replaced the human (and horse and oxen) muscle. The AI revolution has a goal of nothing less than replacing the human mind.

Today a new iteration of AI which really did not emerge in it's present form until 2015 with the GPU driven Deepmind AI, is now in the process of evolution. It is going to evolve very rapidly because we have finally reached the point in computer processing speed and capacity that it can. Five years from now will be incredible. Ten years from today will be nothing short of what we would perceive as ""magickal"".

That ""magickal"" business could be a big societal issue.

We would have, but we made a conscious political decision not to. We went to the moon six times between 1969 and 1972. The one mission that did not make the moon landing, used good old fashioned brilliant human intelligence to make it back to Earth safe and sound from a critically threatening and truly desperate situation due to a mechanical malfunction. And for several of those voyages we ran a dune buggy around on the Moon. No, the technology has always been there. We just decided it was not a top government priority once we proved to be better at space than the Soviet Union. 

I credit the sputnik moment for the fire it built under the USA.

Four years ago, the robots all fell down at the DARPA challenge and when they moved, it was slow as grass growing. No major automaker had any plans to make level 5 autonomy self-driving cars. Google's ""Deepmind"" had not yet been released. No one was going to beat humans at ""Go"" for at least 20 more years. Narrow AIs could not yet read medical imagery better than human physicians. There was no such thing as a 4K monitor that cost under 20,000 dollars. Consumer VR was 2 years in the future yet.

How does this advance compare to ""Moore's Law"" or this video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRG8eq7miUE

I said the following in my ""izumi3682 and the world of tomorrow"" scree.


You can call that ""Moore's Law or whatever you like. I call it stupefying progress. And now that progress is accelerating. Pause the video at the year 2015 and consider that is the year Deepmind's ""AlphaGo"" came into existence...

I don't care beans about how the processing power will equal that of the human mind. We are going to rocket past that arbitrary benchmark like it didn't exist anyway! No, pay attention to that doubling of processing speed and data capacity. That is what matters. That is rocket fuel for our AI efforts. By the way based on that video, about 2 years after the video ends computer processing power will make another full Lake Michigan of processing power and 2 years or so after that them two ""lakes"" will double again. I don't think I am extrapolating incorrectly. This is not even taking into account the likely transcendent effect of the quantum computer. I suspect that quantum computers will replace binary computers in their entirety in less than 20 years. I wonder what we shall come up with that is better than a quantum computer?

But while we are here can anyone answer a question or two I have about our computing speed progress. This video is from the year 2013. So all values are extrapolations after the year 2012 probably. My questions are, does this show an accurate value from the year 2009?

Assuming the value for 2009 is history by that point. Is this the correct value for 2009?

1.41 x 10 to the 14th power (I don't know how to do superscripts)

The value for the year 2015:

2.25 x 10 to the 15th power

The value for this year (2018)

9.01 x 10 to the 15th power

Is actual computing speed lagging behind these forecasts, pretty much on target or are the forecasts falling short of the reality? And does it matter?

If we don't get ""post-scarcity"", the only alternative I see is societal upheaval. TLDR; The 1% would win and continue into a magnificent future. You and me? Long gone.

(Unless the AI kills them (the 1%) too. Then the AI continues into an unimaginable future.)

Whether or not we'll have AI scientists or total human replacement by AI is another question. 
 
That's the slippery slope I was talking about. Do you think we will stop at having general intelligence to train a given system almost immediately?


Consider a few metaphors in your mind, and how nonsensical they are in a literal sense. They make sense to us because we can abstract reality into concepts and use them in language to make interesting comparisons. 
 
God help us if the AGI can ever do this. This to me is terrifying in concept.

I wrote this the other day and I think it is germane to what we are talking about now.

You'll never be able to merge these computers together with classical systems (not that this makes any sense) or shrink them down into phone size and that's just physics. Quantum system needs to be isolated from any type of noise lest they fall into decoherence. Literally even having a stray atom interact with what you're doing causes everything to collapse.
 
I understand all that. I've always known. When do you suppose we shall achieve this so-called ""quantum supremacy"". I mean, smart people like Alphabet bandy that term around, not me. I just observe. I understand you believe things are intractable or impossible because you work directly with them. That's kind of the nature of not seeing the forest for the trees. But history seems to prove otherwise in so many instances. And remember what I said about the nature of nature. New discoveries could utterly change current beliefs and understanding. That has happened a lot before too. By the way I fully understand how a classical computer and quantum computer operate. I also know it is not physically possible to ""con-join"" them in some kind of way. I just said our technology will continue to improve as the years go by. Just way faster than it has for the last 100 years is all. Or 50 years. Or 25 years. 


...and understanding something. I think the last one evades you. 
 
Ad hominem. It's all good. I understand a lot.


More general systems are definitely a good thing.
 
I don't think so. What is the intent of something like that? To run everything? I think it is a slippery slope to Elon's (if yer not Elon that is) ""summoning the demon"". Let's go with the ""Neuralink"".


Oh I added this on to the other comment when you may have already responded and may not have seen it. What do you think.

What do you think of this idea? About intelligent space aliens. I mean if they can even exist. I bet a lot of people do not take this into consideration when they think about faster than light space alien travel or megastructures around stars.

Don't we? Tools, painting, jewelry, burying the dead, language, etc. These all require abstract thinking. Total nonsense.
 
When I wrote that statement I already knew I was pretty much correct. Most evidence of that level of cognitive behavior does not show until about 50,000 years ago. The Wikipedia article stated that the primary theory is that this kind of behavior simply did not exist before 50,000 years ago and potentially credits a sudden genetic change. But you are correct that there is archeological evidence of burial by archaic homo sapiens 100,000 years ago. But what was also absolutely going on at the same time was Homo Neanderthalis planned burials. And art. And jewelry. Is it possible archaic H. Sapiens simply copied things the H. Neanderthalis was doing? H. Neanderthalis clearly demonstrates a level of cognitive ability that archaic H. Sapiens did not yet possess. The rest is evidence.

Painting 40,000 years ago. Jewelry 40,000 years ago. Music 40,000 years ago.


I don't want to debate about free will though. 
 
Ok, no debate on free will. I was just saying what the most recent scholarship is saying.


That really remains to be seen. We're running into hard, physical limits. 
 
One thing that humans are super good at doing, and I think you have to agree, is coming up with new ideas and workarounds, that eventually become the new technology. It is the ""stone knives and bearskins"" primitive year 2018. General quantum computers do not yet exist. When they do exist, we will improve on them. Perhaps we will make some kind of chimera of classical and quantum computer. Who knows. Or maybe we shall figure out how to make a quantum computer behave like a classical computer. Something I regard today as physically not possible yet. Do the laws of physics prohibit such a development?

Further we are going to uncover so much more about the nature of reality in the next ten years. Little less the next 100 years. Such a miniscule drop in the ocean of human history. Science that we probably will be able to exploit with technology. I bet we are in for a few more ""Earth is not the center of the universe"" discoveries. Scary things.


You have a lot of opinions about a field dominated by mathematics and physics when you haven't a clue about either.
 
OMG! I am so blessed to be alive in this day and age when I can transcend my partial blindness by having the sum total of human knowledge at my fingertips. I can vet something in the blink of an eye. Literally already today we begin the hive mind that I can partake in. Granted it's rudimentary ;) but without even having to merge my mind physically with the machine, I can already get the benefits of scholarship and education that I lack. And boy have I learned a lot in 5 years! 

I don't think AGI, however you define it, is a good idea. Narrow AI is all we need. We need to merge the biological human mind with the machine. I hope we can for our sakes.

What do you think of this idea? About intelligent space aliens. I mean if they can even exist. I bet a lot of people do not take this into consideration when they think about faster than light space alien travel or megastructures around stars.

But how far is rudimentary from not so rudimentary. I just watch these little breakthroughs trickling in. But each adds to the previous. Plus we keep setting the goalposts back. The Deepmind narrow AI that beat the best ""Go"" players on Earth, ""well that was just narrow AI"". But didn't that same narrow AI use the same methods with no additional training to master two related games? I mean I'm just watching.

And I have to ask. What exactly is it we want, what we would properly define as an AGI, to do? Run our lives for us? Because that seems to be the intent. 

Oh also do you distinguish between an AGI and an EI?

What about stuff like this though. Also I'm not that random, I been here like 5 years! lol!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7l8wng/if_you_think_ai_is_terrifying_wait_until_it_has_a/drl76lo/

I can add one more to that list too. In the year 2015 some of the top experts in AI and computing said that it would take over 100 years for level 5 autonomy vehicles to actually be deployed. Do you think it is really going to take 100 years? I think about... 3.

You know what they built across the street from my work? An electric charging station. The world is changing as we speak. But you what is going to disappear or change so profoundly that... well...

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/8r348z/automateddriving_technology_is_starting_to_show/e0o1vy5/

I bet you 100 dollars we have full AGI, as you would define it, in 5 years. (Whether or not is also an EI will be interesting to see.) And I will happily pay up if I am wrong. You don't have to pay me if I am right. So it's win-win for you.

However he built it in Bombay, which is where he is centered at but not exactly the center of world.

&amp;#x200B;

However, as economy grows and its gains are increasingly concentrated in the top, real estate prices in the centers of civilization will rise to an unheard of level.

&amp;#x200B;

All the new lands conquered by the British Empire did not make London real estate less expensive ; instead, the money flowing from outside made London even more expensive. Not a single hero of its Imperialism became Dukes, but the owner of the highest valued real estate in London, the Grosvenors, became Dukes of Westminster. Nobody can provide the reason why they rose to the highest of noble positions despite of not exactly contributing anything of value to the Empire, but guess if one is the richest landowner in the capital one deserves to be a Duke.

In any case, as a lot of wealth is being created all over the world, they will all flock to the expensive location, the usual suspects (London, NYC, San Francisco Bay area and other locations preferred by Chinese and Middle Easterners). 

&amp;#x200B;

As we advance toward Singularity, wealth will explode and today's winners will own not just buildings, but entire blocks and cities, in addition to whatever space holdings they will obtain which will expand forever.

&amp;#x200B;

And those who don't have properties will fight an increasingly losing battle, like Chief Joseph of Nez Perce or Goyaale (known to Westerners as Geronimo).

&amp;#x200B;

It is evolution at work. As the wealth of today's winners will be measured in quadrillions (quads), trillion dollar houses will be the norm in 30 years. It may not be large but it will have the latest gadgets mankind can conjure up. And such properties will be mortgaged, to obtain money to buy more and more properties until every square inch of the earth is owned by today's winners.

&amp;#x200B;

This trend will never reverse since the companies of today's winners can be bailed out forever. It is like playing poker with someone who can issue chips during a game and change the rules according to his whim. You may not like it but it is what it is, and smarter people, like Demis hassabis of Deepmind, learn to suck the teats of today's winners instead of fighting them.

Ive been participating in /r/Futurology for awhile now, and its struck me that we spend so much of our time focusing on the science, and so little on the imagination. 

Yet we follow such great contributors like [Isaac Arthur](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g) and [John Michael Godier](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEszlI8-W79IsU8LSAiRbDg) who themselves are inspired by works of fiction like [The Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) series by [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov). These stories are great works of imagination from brilliant minds. Minds that respect the value of both the hard facts, and the intangible fiction. 

Ive always been deeply moved by the amazing potential of humanity. Every time an ambulance whizzes past I feel this pang in my heart as I realize that someone may need help, and that help is on the way. Life is hard, and its easy to be pessimistic. But when it really comes down to it, we are amazing. 

As far as we know, we may be the only intelligent life in the universe and while we can point at lots of our mistakes and be defeatist, it is up to us. Whether what we have done is bad and we should be punished, or we are the pinnacle of our Galaxy and we have duty to reach every higher, we decide.

So, I thought it might be nice to try and imagine what might be possible in the future. Imagine is the key word. In this sub, we often try and debate the merits of an idea based on how scientifically accurate it is or how many sources we can google up. Perhaps, here, we might just think about what might be, without retraining ourselves too much by what can be verified. So

Art in the Future

There are points in many peoples lives where they are purely happy and content. They have everything in line and there is very little that can go wrong or will go wrong. They have all they need, their family, friends and all relationships are extremely healthy. Their health is good. Their finances are good. They are good.

This doesnt last of course. We get sick, family members get sick, and/or friends get sick. We get into financial difficulty, the economy falters, or the job market fails. The weather closes in on us, the storm clouds build, and we hear a distant rumble of thunder. 

This is life. Or, this is how life is, for now. What if you could capture those periods of joy, where life does you right? What if we could create those moments within a simulation, like painting a picture? The artist is painting the relationships, the family, friends, and finances. Even going so far as painting the feelings, and the thoughts.

And those created periods of time, those lives and the contents of those lives, become a digital snap shot. And for a fee, you might buy a copy of that snap shot, and then run it like a program, in your brain. Have you lived a Dave yet? He has a really cute dog. 

Art evolves. What do you think? What sorts of things could we do with direct access to the brain? Or perhaps what can be done with unlimited resources provided by automation and unlimited time provided by immortal bodies and digital consciousnesses?

 

Will we become Gods? What do you hope will be true?",3,9,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

in 2015 there was a discussion on Reddit about how long it'll take AI to beat the best human Go players. many people responded, with backgrounds in AI, Go and generally informed and educated folk. most of them agreed that based on where AI was at the time, it would take at least a decade for AI to beat the best human Go players. in reality it took only a year

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward to 2018, and at an AI convention in Prague the world experts were asked how long they thought it would take for AI to grow into a full AGI. a third said this would happen within a decade, a quarter said within two decades, but all admitted that it was very hard to guess (which is expert speak for ""I have no idea"")

&amp;#x200B;

now one year after Alpha Go's stunning victory over humanity, Open AI was pitched against the best human players at Dota 2. to the humans' shock, it wiped the floor with them, something few expected to happen so soon, because Dota 2 is exponentially more difficult than even Go. a year later Open AI managed to beat all but the very best of human teams, which adds another layer of difficulty

&amp;#x200B;

so current AI experts think it'll take up to a decade or two for AI to evolve into an AGI, based on the fact that it beat humans at Go in 2016, and (99.999999% of) humans at Dota 2 in 2018

&amp;#x200B;

but my argument is that, like all humans, even AI experts think linear, and thus they are applying linear logic to an exponential move. like the Reddit users in 2015, they are not accounting for the exponential moves that AI has made again and again (well actually they do point out the possibility, but they probably don't include it in their estimates), going from impossible (Go) to exponentially more impossible (Dota 2 single player) to exponentially times exponentially more impossible (Dota 2 in team play)

&amp;#x200B;

for this reason, I believe that if the current trend in AI growth continues (seeing as it's more about software than hardware at this point, I don't see why it wouldn't), then an exponential growth curve would mean we should reach AGI as early as 2020. because exponentially more difficult than Dota 2 isn't Overwatch, but human levels of intelligence",9,5,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

How this would work:

\- Ban all human driven vehicles, with the exception of government vehicles (police, fire trucks etc), which will also be automated but the on board driver can take control when needed.

\- Any people wanting to drive into the city will have to park their car outside Manhattan and switch to public transport or self driving cars.

\- All cars would be level 4 self driving, that is to say the car will be in control in all but emergency situations, which will be handled by remote control (except for government vehicles), wheeling steer is optional. Many companies already developed such vehicles, possibly a combination of multiple competitors.

\- The whole town would be equipped with sensors and antenna's that track every inch of the streets (if that's not already the case). They would feed this data to the self driving cars.

&amp;#x200B;

Why Manhattan:

\- Lots of people and very busy, so there is a lot to gain from improving the traffic system.

\- Outdated public transport, again much to gain.

\- It's an island, simplifying the process of marking the SDC territory.

\- City area, so average low movement speed, making it easier for SDC's.

&amp;#x200B;

Advantages:

\- Decreased traffic accidents: these SDC's would almost never drive into each other, as they instantly know when another car is slowing down or about to make an maneuver. They'd also be less likely to hit pedestrians as they have better awareness, faster reflexes, don't get distracted and never drive under influence.

\- Increased traffic speed: in large part because of the reduced traffic accidents, but networked cars will also move as a whole, cutting down on lag, allowing them to cross each other with less space between.

\- Reduced traffic space: a lot of space currently used to park cars will be freed up, making it easier for the SDC's to pick up and drop off people, or pedestrians to walk around. Parkings could be converted into living spaces.

\- Reduced air and sound pollution: hybrid cars are a lot more quit and less polluting, greatly improving the quality of life in the city. Also a lot less random honking from angry drivers.

\- Lower crime: criminals will no longer be able to move around fast using a car. Also all car passengers will be tracked and recorded, making it much harder for criminals to move around unnoticed.",23,0,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

In short, technology has finally overcome all variables, and 2028, 2038, etc will be the same as 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

Health care cost will rise forever, which will probably price out a lot of people from medical care. Sorry, that's evolution. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tuition cost will rise forever. No decent company will accept those who learned the trade from watching youtube courses. For the jobs which do pay well, having a diploma from a decent institution is like the entry ticket, and it will get more and more expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

Wealth inequality will be worse than that of 1914 when 4% of all pop claimed 90% of all income. It would be more like 0.4% of all pop claiming 99% of the income, and the rest being serfs or worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Americas dominance economically and militarily will be forever.

\&gt;Amazon and Tesla having low profit margins but surging stock prices and strong growth, defying predictions of bubble or collapse

\&gt;Web 2.0 (same as above, such as Uber defying the lefts predictions  of doom. The left in 2015-2016 was optimistic that imagined sexual  harassment at Uber would undo the company, and were disappointed when  their efforts failed \[1\]) 

\&gt;Bay Area home prices keep going up 

I wrote about the arrival of trillion dollar houses soon.

\&gt;Facebook and Instagrams enduring popularity

They are now a fact of life. Same as Rockefellers' oil companies (Exxon, Chevron, etc) being a permanent presence. 

&amp;#x200B;

==

&amp;#x200B;

In short, until the next game changer which I will call 'Singularity', the world will continue as if nothing is happening, Trump or no Trump, or whatever. 

&amp;#x200B;

The world set on the Congress of Vienna continued, with a couple minor hiccups (1848 and Bismarck's unification of Germany), until 1914 for 99 years. And, if brigadier Chuck Fitzclarence did not order the stupid charge which prolonged the Great War by 4 years and caused the death of 9 million Europeans (including himself and most of his stupid 200 Worcesters men who led the world to Meghan Markle and BTS) , it would have continued to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

America , or at least the better parts of it, will lead the world forever, with parts of England, China and a few other countries playing a support role. This trend will continue until the Singularity, or a lack of key resources which will 'stop the machine' like the E.M. Forster story.",15,0,False,self,,,,,

Also, educators of all sorts are definitely looking to figure out good ways to use VR and AR to help people learn about complex topics and stuff that they wouldn't easily be able to experience in person.  Museums are looking for interactive exhibits with VR and AR to help visitors get a more personal look and feel for important stories.

This all follows from the new-ish ideologies that the student is the one who is most important in the learning experience  with the teachers being the ones to help make the learning experiences meaningful and valuable to the student  and that each student's learning path can be, or even should be, different, based on their personality, interests, and abilities.

In the middle of this year, world economists being stating they are concerned of a coming recession, maybe by 2020. Now the mainsteam media have been given the go ahead to trickle stories about the eventual, and planned, recession around 2020. Expect many more stories like this during the marketing campaign for RECESSION 2020. Here is a nice example, preparing the population for the coming recession, telling people to not worry and simply retrain after a recession:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2018/09/26/why-those-who-lost-their-jobs-in-a-recession-must-retrain/#50ea62c16a0d](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2018/09/26/why-those-who-lost-their-jobs-in-a-recession-must-retrain/#50ea62c16a0d)

Essentially RECESSION 2020 will allow the FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION to go into high gear. For more information on the FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, please see:

[https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/)

It will go like this, recession hits as planned, tons of people lose their jobs, companies go out of business, we are told in order for businesses to remain competitive automation will need to be implemented, we will see the true potential of blockchain, robotics and AI, we will need to retrain to be able to have employment during the FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.

Once the 2020 recession hits, we will see further concentrated consolidation of wealth, resources, land, properties, basically resources is the catch-all term I would use, as outlined in Piketty's book, and also just common sense. It will be bad for most, good from some, like 5%, and exactly as planned for 0.00001%. The information, the history, the economic literature, the government literature, is all out there, as most choose to ignore, this agenda continues undeterred. 

I would advise all to save as much as you can now, once the next recession hits, posited to be 2020, obviously might be 2021, etc., jobs will go big time, companies will go ""bankrupt"", meaning wages will stagnate or even decline, automation will kick in, meaning even less jobs in the future, and by future I mean in 5 years, austerity measures will be imposed by our militant government.

With terrorism on the rise, as planned, and the governments intentionally doing almost nothing to stem it, as inevitably more terrorist attacks occur, for our ""safety"" the police will need to be armed, we are already seeing the further arming of French and Swedish police, Obama gave the green light for a domestic army in his now infamous speech:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt2yGzHfy7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt2yGzHfy7s)

As a result, the pyramids did not help the civilization to survive when it encountered external difficulties.

So in modern society, these are all off-shores and balances, pumping out a lot of resources from the system, only the whole economy counts on them, and it works without funds, and then it prints them by dispersing inflation. And also, these accounts do not help us at all. If we encounter some difficulties external, for example, asteroids, super volcanoes, and indeed who knows what surprises the solar system is full of, and even more so the universe itself, which we know a lot about, but we can not control everything in her, but we well understand its power. one pchih and blink an eye will not have time, will sweep away and will not ask how much opium for the people.

Therefore, as long as the society does not stop building pyramids, accumulating by some citizens overcapital that other citizens do not receive, the sense of all the activity that society is leading will be almost nonexistent, because in fact we are building pyramids and nothing more. We do not invest in the brains, in the human capital, we do not create conditions for the normal development of science, which can help to avoid the impact of external forces and nothing else in fact will help us in this. We do not spend a reasonable amount of money between all citizens, so that they can invest in many spheres of the economy and consequently science, because the economy is based on science if it wants to be competitive, and so does any company that has current assets. But many firms do not have these funds, because the majority of the people are not rich and can not buy, because all the people's funds go to the balance sheets of the rich and offshore.

And by the way this is a dianoza medical desire to have such huge capitals, this is manifested in the accumulation or is also called syllogism. After all, where the normal person is more than 1 lard, and in some of them 50 and more. and it is not clear why society continues to give these not healthy mentally people to manage the finances of the whole society. Therefore, as long as there is no ban on any offshore, as long as there is no restriction on the ownership of money, real estate and luxury goods, this bugle will continue to destroy all the chances of mankind to survive external forces, if those are suddenly the universe is directed at us. We will have no solutions how to cope with external forces, because we did not develop mogas and science in society creating the best conditions for a positive life for most people, but there will be a lot of candy wrappers and fools who hold onto them because of a little healthy brain, so that's what we can very easily destroy",6,1,False,self,,,,,

Cyberpunk 2077 (from creators of Witcher) might have a living city of AI Npc's. Devs of this game even got a GRAND from polish goverment to do this...

[https://www.pcgamer.com/cyberpunk-2077-could-feature-a-huge-living-city-and-seamless-multiplayer/](https://www.pcgamer.com/cyberpunk-2077-could-feature-a-huge-living-city-and-seamless-multiplayer/)

There is a new MMo Rpg coming from BIG company like Amazon (New World) and I hope they will have funds to implement advanced Npc's into their new game.

If we will be able to interact with Npc's at human level, the games will stop being so empty and become more like a real world and the enjoyment level of people will be alot higher.

So here is a question, any ideas when can we see more advanced Npc's in MMO rpgs that can grow together with people, interact with them at human level (some bots seem to be able to interact at quite high level)?

So, any ideas what are we lacking, so our MMO rpg's could use Advanced Npc's?

Processing power on devs side? (not enough computing power to make an advanced Npc)

Lack of servers computing power?

Throughput of internet connections?

Not enough breakthroughs on software side?

Crappy pc's on consumer end? (if so, when can we hope to get powerfull enough pc's for it? Will next gen of Amd/Intel Cpu's be powerfull enough? or todays high end pc's are enough?)

&amp;#x200B;

Can AI projects like Impala help to make breaktroughs for it?

It solves the problems of people living in the streets.
