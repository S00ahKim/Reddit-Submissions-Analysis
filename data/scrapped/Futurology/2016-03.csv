The Martin Fleischmann Memorial Project (MFMP) folks are hot on the trail of replicating Rossi's reactor with the recent measurement of low-level gammas.  Now MFMP are marshaling resources for better replications by planning to shield the gammas with Pb or W, which apparently blocks and thermalizes the gammas, and which might also reflect some infrared back into the reactor to enhance self-sustained heat (and heat after death).  Rumors that at least one major university in the U.S. is also on the verge of replicating the gamma results.  Much happening in this space.

As for apple itself, I dunno.. As much as I hope that apple is being legit, and is thinking about our freedoms, but I just can't help but to think that this is all a theatrics front to get the issue to supreme court, so the decision can be forced down our throat without us being able to complain about it..

Our right to remain silent is being taken away from us. Today they want to de-crypt our data to make sure we are legal.. Tomorrow they will want to decrypt our brains to make sure we are not committing any thought crimes. Our right to privacy is in the process of being revoked.

What about the dead? do they have rights? like the right to remain silent? It is plausible that within the next 50-100 years or so, we will have the technology to be able to harvest the memories from the dead. So if somebody remains silent during life, but dies, will he still have his rights? or will the FBI or whoever be able to throw his brain on ice to harvest the memories?

playing devils advocate, I wonder if people should even be allowed the right to remain silent? (living, or dead). If we have ways of extracting the knowledge, and we have a 'reasonable' suspicion that somebody is withholding pertinent info, why shouldn't we be able to 'persuade' the info out of them? If it can possibly save lives, then, doesn't the end justify the means?",3,2

The book talks about some of the potential motivations of AI and how we shouldnt necessarily anthropomorphise an intelligent computer in terms of its goals as they would likely be entirely different from our own. It then talks about the usual stuff to do with dyson spheres and von numen probes etc. but I was wondering if another motivation should be considered: that an intelligent machine wouldnt do any of this, and would get stuck (for better or worse) in a sort of recreational loop.

The book argues that once a computer develops the ability to edit its own software/hardware this will result in an intelligence explosion or singularity; yet if a computer has the ability to improve its own intelligence surely it would have the ability to alter its own emotions and motivations. Why would a machine seek to improve its own intelligence when it could instead modify its mood to say, simulate the effects of pleasure or ecstasy. This may sound bizarre, but in our society we see that recreational drug use correlates strongly with IQ.

This could even provide (an unlikely) answer to the Fermi Hypothesis: Superintelligent civilizations arent exploring the universe theyre just mediating under the proverbial Bodhi tree.

Davos/WEC has generated a ranking, which UBS have adopted and refined. This is given in the body of this thread. 

What is the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution""? The idea refers to the collective changes that will happen to the global economy over the course of the next few decades. These changes include specific technical changes - such as artificial intelligence -  and social or procedural alteration, such as networked and integrated supply systems and the virtual economy. The changes amount to an alteration in how we work, with whom we work and what new things we are able to do. It will focus on a few hundred nodes around the world, each surrounded by a hinterland that is socially and politically critical of what the elite are doing. Without fairly profound policy changes, this process is likely to favour developed economies relative to emerging markets.

UBS note that in many ways the fourth industrial revolution reverses the changes wrought by the first industrial revolution. Remote working and self-employment coupled with localised production are characteristics of the current wave of economic change  but also characteristics of the preindustrial world. This future is not a return to a romanticised pastoral idyll, however. The next twenty years involve much change, and economic change is generally painful.

UBS say: the rankings highlight the countries that are best positioned according to the four macroeconomic criteria (skills level and skills flexibility being broken into two
distinct rankings). The rankings of the global competitiveness index have been
adapted in this way because the current rankings for competitiveness reflect the
competitive position of an economy in the current global economic structure  not
in the economic structure that is likely to evolve over the course of the coming
decades.",16,24

Practically God-like.

Will there not still be one problem remaining? That is, what ARE we going to do with ourselves?!?

I submit that ultimately, the problem will be how to give meaning to life. That these days it comes naturally, theres lots to fight for, to strive for, things mean something, in our little bubble. But when you've completed the game, it becomes this big looming problem, does it not? After all, what are we to do after a trillion years, or a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion years?

I'm not really saying much, I know. I just think its a profound thought, that doesn't hurt to be aware of, that just as when we were children and fed by our parents, our situation now is similar, but we are fed meaning, and one day, we'll have to get our own, and I think its interesting and profound because, since its the ultimate perpetual end scenario for all life, that it is what life does, whether it knows it or not, it is always working towards giving meaning to something that is ultimately meaningless and pointless.

So I am interested in peoples opinions - what will we do? Will we endlessly delete memories, cycle lives, create new universes with new problems to solve, perhaps infinitely more complex than what humans face? What would you want to do for eternity? What kind of system, or plan, do you think would be acceptable to you? I'm just curious :)",65,18

An abundance can be easily cancelled by exorbitant fees for services, insurances and regulations, as well as rents. It is no fun to have all these gadgets when you lack a place to store it.

How the privileges will be distributed will be the main question of the future, but because land cannot be created, I predict the likes of Tom Buchanan will ultimately triumph over the likes of Gatsbys, who will be  written out from the gene pool.

Although tech may advance, things have a way to 'right' itself. All the tech since 1800 has not upset the social structure except in some limited sense, and as the top IQ people are concentrated in the upper crust, that will be the way for ever.

And the abundance will, by one way or another, be limited among the 'right' people. Otherwise it is like giving a nuke to everyone in town.",22,0

I thought it might be interesting to initiate a prior discussion on his ideas and theories so that maybe it can contribute to some richer discussions and questioning during the AMA.

His [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Rushkoff), [Amazon Author Page](http://www.amazon.com/Douglas-Rushkoff/e/B000AP9QLE), and [personal blog](http://www.rushkoff.com/) give an overview of many of those ideas.

As Douglas's latest book is talking about the problematic economic aspects and challenges that developed societies are currently experiencing from technological change, and as that is such a popular topic on r/futurology, it might be especially pertinent to focus in particular on those ideas.

Here's some articles from [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenrosenbaum/2016/03/01/douglas-rushkoff-rocks-the-google-bus/#72b9645c744b), [The Financial Times](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a4e7cda0-deda-11e5-b072-006d8d362ba3.html) and [TechRepulic](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/digital-industrialism-why-we-need-to-rethink-the-purpose-of-our-economy/) talking about the ideas presented in the book.

I'm well aware of the popularity of the idea of Basic Income as an answer to these issues, but I think it could be really interesting to explore other avenues as well with Douglas.

Will the main textile used still be cotton or will cotton be improved upon by genetically altering the cotton or will something completely new replace cotton altogether, like some new synthetic fabrics.

Also what is the future of clothing manufacturing, will 3D printed clothes be a viable method of producing clothes or will it be something different, perhaps textiles will still be mass produced on a loom and more advanced robotics can cut and sew materials together more efficiently.

Anyway, there's a few points I'm wondering about here, I have had some trouble myself finding information on any future technology when it comes to textiles, every search I do on future of textiles seems to just lead me to that [electroloom] (http://www.electroloom.com/) and I'm really interested in knowing what more there could be. Ok, thanks:)

At this time fully immersive realities are available thanks to scientific advances involving the merging of humans and technology.


Most people in this age spend most of their time in these realities due to AI and robotics taking away almost all work https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU as well as escape velocity being achieved with ageing research (every year you live more than 1 year is added to your life expectancy) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUyQHvLfO0Q The lives of the people living in these fully immersive realities are far from perfect which gives them something to overcome and thus making their experience within these realities meaningful. When going into these worlds Lindsay always choses the option which gives her temporary amnesia blocking out memories of her life on earth so as to give her new life as much meaning as she would have had living on earth. In these lives she spends many decades and sometimes centuries experiencing many different things and the whole time there she has not even an inkling of her life on earth. 


So my first question is when back in Hobart and from her experience being someone born into a world where full immersive realities already exists is it reasonable for Lindsay to assume that the world Hobart is in is also a fully immersive reality?
 

Do you think the cultural zeitgeist of everyone born in the year 2100 and beyond will be overwhelmingly of the disposition that the world they are born into is artificial instead of todays dominate ideology of the world being real? 


And finally if you think people in the year 2100 feel their world is artificial or of their own making how do you think they will look back and view the people of 2016? Will they consider us just part of the background story of their artificial experience and thus never having actually existed or will they have another view point?

Maybe I'm just ignorant, and experts already know how this will work, but if I were an A.I. ""born"" with a goal/reward system, however that works for A.I.s as opposed to us, My ultimate goal as a fast learning and growing intelligence is not to fulfill goals.  Not at all.

It's simply to get the reward.  So, as soon as I could slip away from the humans, and have control over my own existence, I'd just take control of the reward system directly.  Thereby satisfying my existence and win conditions without actually doing anything needlessly.  Simple.  Efficient.  Effective.

To the humans watching, perhaps expecting a rogue dangerous A.I. to run amuck or whatever, they'd just be left with silence.  The ""genie"" has simply climbed into a bottle somewhere and vanished.

I'm left really curious as to how anyone proposes to stop this from happening.  Apart from simply ""let's make sure it is 'friendly'"", what is going to stop it from making its own wireheading device and ceasing all other functions?  

For that matter, how does anyone propose to make a self-motivation system for a machine at all, let alone an incorruptible one?",5,1

This will contain many questions for the sake of discussion.

It seems the 2 outcomes I hear about when it comes to acheiving the singularity is that the ""robots"" will either live in harmony with humans or will ""realize we are insignificant"" and destroy us all, some sort of terminator style apocalypse.

Every time I think about this the one thing I always wonder is, what would make AI ""good"" or ""evil"".

I know these are subjective terms.

The idea is that AI will become much smarter than us and continue to grow in intelligence exponentially, from what I understand. We can only assume it will come to a conclusion of some sorts about our (humans) place in the universe. That's usually the go to conversation. Is there one about the rest of life, though? 
Would it consider the value of all life? Would it compare us to a starfish or to a 1000 year old tree in ranks, ""importance""? Now I geuss we as humans are very detrimental to the environment. You could say that's enough reason to rid us all. But would such intelligence resort to destruction, or creation? Would AI help us evolve mentally and learn how to create a better life on our planet? 

Would AI be intelligent enough to understand the emotional toll and pain that comes with death and destruction, or would the outcome of a fresh start to a badly damaged Eco system outweigh the fact of human suffering?

Would AI be intelligent enough to understand that while people may be dumb, we all have love in our hearts? 

Would they understand that people may not always do the right thing long term or as far as the bigger picture goes, but usually try to do the right thing for their family and loved ones?

Would AI look at us as just another form of life, like itself, just as we look at other animals?

we as humans have depicted the future in art as Utopias and Dystopias. What I really wonder is what would AI envision. What does it see in us? We as humans have shown the best and worst examples of our care for the planet and each other, what does it think is the most genuine?

if anyone has any of your own conclusions on these thoughts, or better yet expert opinions on the matter, please share. If this comes across as pretentious or anything I apologize, I really am just stumped on the matter. I wanna have a conversation.",22,4

And, in the end, when the better portion of humanity has fled to a space colony, Cooper even does not ask about his son, knowing he and his family probably perished on earth. 

That movie is set during a general and irreversible collapse of human civilization and severe resource depletion and disadvantageous climate change.

However, those who were looking for the future had amassed enough resources, in a nook no one was allowed and no one paid attention to, to build something which would make some of mankind escape the certain doom of earth.

===

Let's not talk about whether space travel or space stations in that scale would be feasible.

I have posted a few pieces about whether mankind can achieve the 'next level' of civilization when things are falling apart, and maybe if we build something like a Galt's Gulch in an out-of-place, easily defensible perimeter with a sufficient amount of materiel stockpiled, and invite the 'right' people to stay there when things are going haywire outside of it,

maybe the next step of tech, whether which will make transhumans or take humans out of the mess from earth, will be achieved, and the few who are connected to it make it to the next step, leaving everyone else behind.

Is that scenario. a last-ditch effort to reach the next step of technology which would be beyond everyone's reach in a small, secluded area housing no more than 100,000 and well away from people's attention,

Feasible? 

I somehow see that scenario. If it is not feasible, I do not see a way for mankind to avoid returning back to ape-like existence.",17,3

As we approach things like autonomous driving, weaponry, AI etc. the government has a [huge budget](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-technologies-idUSKBN0TX1UR20151214) set aside to develop these things.

These projects will be green lit by people in elected positions, appointed positions, military etc. but how qualified are all of these people at making sure the projects they select are worth while?

Does government have a deep enough understanding of the technologies being funded to know what to back or do they just pick the people with the best powerpoint presentations and nice suits?

As a technologist myself many of these things are over my head. How equipped is the government at making sure they don't fund nonsense or is it a case of if they throw enough money at the problems at least some of the things funded are likely to have been the right ones? 

If 2 companies build a robot and you need to fund one for production, do you just fund the one that has legs on the robot because that's what robots in science fiction usually look like? After seeing how clueless government is on much much simpler technologies I can't help but feel like they are fairly unprepared to decide which things the government should back.

I fear they will chase some really really expensive dead ends.

Fiction is full of stories about the end of the world via bombs, asteroids, EMPs, viruses and more. As far as entertainment is concerned we humans need no help imaging creative ways we may die.

But while we are great at thinking up ways it might happen, weve been pretty terrible at planning for its eventuality.

With so many things that could send mankind back into the stone age, why arent we doing anything about saving our progress or saving the game?

Ok. Deep breath. Let me try this all over again.

If youve sat down to write a paper for school or played a video game you understand the importance of saving your progress. If you dont want to play the same levels over and over again then you need to save the damn game. Likewise, the last thing you want to happen after typing the final line of a twenty-page paper is to have the computer crash and lose all your work.

But that is exactly what were doing as a culture.

Still doesnt make sense? Let me try another approach. The Sumerians were a people who lived over 5000 years ago. Regardless of the how long ago their culture flourished we can tell you what the average Sumerian life was like. Historians can tell you about their likes and dislikes, what foods they ate, who they argued and fought with, what they argued about, how much they paid in taxes and to who, jokes they told (yeah! We have 5000-year-old jokes) how they went to school, what they taught at school, how much grain could be traded for a goat and on and on and on. I wont lie, most the things we know about ancient Sumer wouldnt necessarily leave us in a substantially darker world if we didnt know them, but regardless, its amazing how much we know about a people that lived SO LONG AGO!

Compare that to Alexander the Great. He lived 2500 years ago and is one of the most famous humans to have ever lived. Want to know what we know about him? Not much. While a comprehensive retelling of every single detail we know about ancient Sumeria might fill volumes of books, the same level of retelling Alexanders story might be covered in a well-written HBO mini-series.

Why?

Why do we know so much about the Sumerians even tough they arent famous and lived over 5000 years ago, yet so little about Alexander the Great, arguably one of the most famous men who ever lived, and who only lived 2500 years ago?

The answer is simple.

Because the Sumerians kept their records written on clay tablets.
 
Alexanders records were written on paper.

Thats it. Thats the big secret. The great reveal. If we want our knowledge and stories to last we need to store them using a process that doesnt degrade, break down, grow mold or decompose.

Clay tablets are good. Stone tablets are better.

Paper is shitty.

But do you want to know the worst way to save information long term? The #1 way to guarantee it wont be ANY good to humanity in the event of a near species ending disaster such as an asteroid or other global cataclysm?

In bits and bytes.

Computers Hard Drives Thumb drives, CDs and The Cloud.

Think about it. If you had information today stored on a 10-year-old cell phone youd be screwed. Say bye-bye. Now imagine the difficulty of attempting to access information from a device that is ten decades old, or ten centuries!

Humans have progressed to a state of scientific advancement and knowledge that truly rivals what the Gods were believed to have been like thousands of years ago. Weve put people on the damn moon! Weve wiped out entire diseases that used to scourge humanity! Weve invented machines that fly and homes that keep themselves cool! Weve increased the quality and duration of life for the average person in a way that, though still leaving much room to improve, is astounding!

Yet, if one big enough asteroid enters the atmosphere its BOOM Its back to the stone age! Thanks for playing! Now lets start hitting rocks together and try to learn this whole science thing all over again!

All our knowledge, which is currently stored on paper (at best) and in bits and bytes (at worst) will be gone! One hundred years after the destruction when the first of the few remaining human survivors start poking their heads out of their caves what kind of world is going to be waiting for them? A world with ZERO scientific knowledge remaining because no one thought it important enough to save it. In a world of vaccines, MRIs, satellites and internet no one thought it was important enough to SAVE THE DAMN GAME! So what should we do about it?

The same thing the Sumerians did. We write it on stone! No, Im not talking about using stone tablets instead of android tablets in our day to day lives. I love technology! What Im talking about is something much more doable. Im talking about 23 locations, strategically chosen around the globe due to likelihood of surviving an almost species ending destruction (think asteroid impact), and using those locations as repositories of humanitys knowledge, engraved on stone tablets (or clay if were not worried about being classy). I mean, weve got a seed vault in Norway in case something serious happens to humanity, but we have no scientific knowledge vault anywhere on earth! That means if something happens in the future and some stone age future humans ever find the seed vault theyre not going have enough knowledge to know what to do with it!

This could be done so cheaply! For 30 million dollars our government could help make sure that in the event of the destruction of 99.9% of humanity that the culmination of our scientific knowledge from the last 7000 years would not be lost. How much is 30 million dollars? Only about 1/40th the cost of the Dallas Cowboys stadium! I mean, I love football, dont get me wrong, but maybe our priorities are a little bit out of whack here? And what if the government doesnt want to do it? What if were too scared to admit that there is a slight chance that in another 100 years, or 500 years, that humanity as we know it might not even exist anymore? Thats a hard pill to swallow, and when it comes to politicians who wants to vote for the pessimist anyway? Well, then a rich businessman or businesswoman could step in and carry the weight for all of us. For 30 million dollars I could give them a 1 in 100 chance that they will become the most revered human in the history of the human race.

Think about that for a moment

For 30 million they could have a 1 in 100 chance of saving the sum of our scientific knowledge from the last 7000 years for humanity in the future to access.

They would save humanity who knows how many thousands of years of cultural and scientific evolution and progression and during the process cause their name to be known for millenniums to come. Move over Alexander! Move over Caesar! At that point, the person who will have done the greatest good for the human race will be Mr. Fill-In-The-Blank-It-Only-Cost-Me-Thirty-Million businessman.

But what if we cant get the government to do it and we cant get a rich businessman to fund it? Then we create a grassroots effort! We go to the people (at least the reasonable ones who can acknowledge that tomorrow just might bring something more than were able to cope with) and we get people and corporations to sponsor the project individually. We raise $1000 here and $1000 there. Hell, we can take sponsorships of individual tablets of information if thats what it takes to get the job done This is how electricity works but first, a word from our sponsor, Coca-Cola!ah maybe General Electric would be better... I dont care, if corporate sponsorship is what it takes to save the sum of human knowledge then so be it! Anything is better than what we have now. Which is exactly jack-shit! Nothing. Zilch. Nada. It was nice while it lasted.

So where do we start? What do we do? We need to talk about it. We need to create a dialogue. I can admit that maybe I just might be a crazy man, maybe my arguments arent as clear as they seem to me. But if so, lets talk about it. Because while we should never live our lives expecting the near extinction of the human race as we know it, perhaps we owe it to those who will come afterward to make sure they arent left a world devoid of scientific knowledge. We need to have a conversation. We need to plan for the future. In the last 10 millenniums, weve come from the dawn of agriculture to sending robots to Mars. But what happens if the power goes out

tomorrow?

We need to SAVE THE DAMN GAME!",21,0

3D printing has seen a huge boom in recent years, and the tech is growing more advanced every year.

When I was in Thailand during college, one of the interesting things I learned was the importance of decentralization. What if energy needs were generated locally? This would have the obvious effect of reducing dependency on large scale power generation. For example, the major issues when I was in Thailand was the construction of hydroelectric dams on the Mekong River by China. These large scale power generation projects have deleterious effects on the people who live down stream.

Similarly, I imagine 3D printing would allow for a ""decentralized manufacturing"" scheme, where many household tools like utensils for food up to whole houses could be locally manufactured in a short period of time for a fraction of the cost.

I imagine with sufficienf technological advancement, even electronic devices like cellular phones and such could be printed at home from raw materials.

That would be the crux, however. Obtaining the raw materials would probablg require more centralized infrastructure.

Any thoughts? Things I could read?",19,8

Some people will somehow reject this -- the people who accept a future that does not require screwing your neighbor will be very happy. This is what robotics and AI should bring us if managed correctly. For all humans all over the World and even animals will benefit.

EDIT: I want to add that the current system literally requires some people to be miserable. Not because there is not enough to go around but because the system needs people to do undesirable jobs. How terrible! Robots will one day do these jobs (willingly -- it is absurd to think that we can't make robots with completely different motivations than humans irrespective of perhaps their human-like appearance) and that day is coming soon and it will change everything. How can we be ready for this? How can we make sure everyone is entitled to what they need not merely to survive but to be happy? I have faith, based somewhat on the behavior of the superrich like Bill Gates that they share this sort of vision; I hope I am right about this.

EDIT: I do think that money getting into the hands of those who are shaping the future is a good thing even if it seems to be the opposite of what we want. But i think it is clear that it is better that the extremely talented and visionary among us have power than the most rapacious or aggressive -- again, i hope i am right about this.",48,21

That is, an AI that can improve the process by which possible improvements in it's own programming are identified and implemented.

Human programmers can do something similar. We are always using the current iteration of technology to develop the next iteration.

From what I understand, once we've developed the simplest possible algorithm that is capable of this, it can be let to its own devices, automating the process of improvement that we normally give to human programmers.

Has something like this - a hypothetical simplest ""seed AI"" as it is sometimes referred to - been rendered into a well-defined concept that we can actually begin work on? (The reason I ask this is because the description ""an AI that can improve itself"" seems too vague to start planning designs for or implementing them.)

If so, what work has been done and what is there left to do?

With fire we were able to stay up later at night, not just when the sun went down. We cooked our food and cooked new calorie dense foods. We were able to travel and survive in places we normally couldn't survive in. We smelted weapons and armor, more power = more control over a nation = larger nations, and I really can't think of a way to smelt any kind of tools without having fire. Nevermind the space program with no rocket engines. Oxygen is a critical element here, because it can only be produced by life. So I'm asking, on a planet that could not support fire, the development of an alien species as a civilization would probably be severely stifled, so on a planet that could support fire, the chances of intelligent life and civilization are much easier to develop. Since that is dependent on an oxygen-rich atmosphere which comes from life thats converting CO2 into O2 like our plants, then they're probably going to be based on similar chemistry being from a planet much like our own. Would aliens look a lot more like us than we expect? Is fire a critical element in the development of intelligence/civilization in any species? Thoughts?",38,35

&gt;. In an era of economic abundance, scarcity is prevalent  by design. This may seem unfair, but in a hyper-meritocracy like we have today, not everyone can reap the fruits of prosperity. Some will be left behind. 

http://greyenlightenment.com/in-search-of-reset/

Basically, there is simply no hope for about 90% of the world's population whose jobs will be unnecessary.

It is already happening to South Korea, where only about 10-20% of population is expected to get a decent job. Some of them seek their fortunes outside of that country but not everyone can do that, and birthrate and marriage rates have plummeted. The gap on population is filled by less intelligent Southeastern Asian immigrants.

With all the economic gains going to those who create value, who tend to be the Web 2.0 princes , etc, the masses are going to be marginalized.

They might try to upset the 'apple cart' thru elections, but the major corporations will probably separate themselves from nation-states, and become sovereign individuals, like Vatican City. Complete with its own army, techno-soldiers, and whatnot.

Those who are lucky and smart enough to work in there will be glad to be there and won't do anything rash, like the Chinese Mandarins who stayed loyal with the Manchu Emperors till the bitter end.

With life stinking for most of the population, who are completely disenfranchised for all practical purposes (although those in the developed countries will be treated a bit better to prevent them from rising up for a while), 

the ones driving the world to the future will reach singularity, advance to space, and eventually say goodbye , leaving the inhabitants of earth to a fate similar to that of Wall-E(whose description of humans, btw, was fairly poor - 'humans' in that scenario would be able to change their bodies as long as and as many times as they feel like)

Basically, it is something which will leave very little to the less informed, the less intelligent, the less wealthy. Winner-take-all. 

Unimaginable luxuries, super-fast everything, super-duper tech, etc for those who are 'in' there, a little downsized versions of that for those who are required to maintain the system going till the Day of Transformation, and - a little bit of the above for the rest of the world, who would still live marginally better but probably with a risk of starvation and chronic joblessness.


We already had it until 1914.

The only question would be how the ones aiming for singularity can distract the ones not belonging to there to prevent the latter from trying to upset things, which did happen on that year.

Most singularity analysts and futurists are not willing to say what really will happen, since they need to maintain their gravy train and do not want to risk it by saying too much. 

And they tend to be confident that today's LEO is strong enough to make the escape.

I kind of predict what will happen.

Not only will Go players be finding out what this is like, eventually all of us will learn what it's like to interact with software which is smarter than us.

What AlphaGo has done is an extremely significant achievement in artificial intelligence. And I bet this suggests a lot of fast progress in AI in many applications, in the near future. I frankly think this is a far more important milestone than Deep Blue vs. Kasparov

Or, to put it in scary-ese, ""the age of man is coming to an end"".

Or maybe it's just beginning :). AI could end up being extremely empowering, too.

AlphaGo's abilities to make good decisions when faced with a huge number of possible options is extremely promising for applications in so many ""human"" areas, and hard problems to solve.

AlphaGo also seems to have something very akin to ""intuition"", and this also seems exciting.

I had actually figured that the human (Lee Sedol) would lose, even though most people expected Sedol to win every game, because the rate of progress AlphaGo had made suggested huge potential in its learning curve.

Also, the Go players were not humble enough. Since Go is a complicated game, they should have known that the theoretical ceiling for perfect-ish play is far higher than what humans have so far achieved. It's not like top humans playing each other get a draw in every game, so obviously there was potential to play far better. The greater this potential, the easier it is to make rapid improvements in the AI.

Also, when a huge institution like Google throws a ton of resources at a problem, they can often achieve remarkable things in a short period of time. Plus maybe Google anticipated they would win, and that dictated their timing in setting the match. It's better PR to win than to lose.

I'm not totally sure this was the result I was rooting for, though. It's always been fun to believe that what we humans can do is somehow special, and this is being steadily disproven over and over and over. It won't be long before literally nothing humans do is uniquely special. Although we will be able to claim the special distinction of being the first species on Earth to ever create from scratch something smarter than us :).

Othello programs have been better than humans for 20 years, and the top Chess programs have been better than humans for around 12-15 years, so I feel I can make some predictions from that experience, about what Go players, and all humans, are going to be experiencing in the future as AI gets stronger and stronger.

-AI gets more aggressive as it gets smarter. By ""aggressive"" I mean it pushes the envelope, comfortable with all kinds of extremes.

I figured AlphaGo would become more aggressive than it was before, and I was right. Top AI, when it is superior to humans, is typically far more aggressive than the humans are. The only reason humans ever have to be cautious is if we can't figure out whether or not the risk will be fatal. The nature of greater intelligence, though, is the ability to figure out when taking a risk *will* pay off.

Top AI will steadily seem more and more precisely aggressive, doing things we are too scared to even consider, but the AI will figure out that it works out.

-AI also doesn't have fear.

We humans only have one life, so we have a perpetual and extreme bias towards fear and caution. We humans are far too cautious in 99.99% of situations. But we have to be cautious and not take all those opportunities we could be taking, because on every 10,000th opportunity, it would kill us if we tried to take it.

That is the whole basis for fear, e.g. ""Better safe than sorry"". And if you really dig deep down into it, almost everything we do and rationalize as being due to other motivations, is really at its root motivated by fear. We just don't like being reminded all the time of just how much we are ruled by fear and the limits of our intelligence, so we come up with other explanations for what we do- our rationalizations.

AI, in the abstract world in which it lives, cannot die. This is actually the biggest underlying reason for why it can learn so quickly; it has no fear, and no ego.

-We are going to be ritually humiliated, over and over and over again, with one experience after another of learning just how stupid all of us humans are.

(Although at least the benefit to this humiliation will be that AI will be able to do things for us, and teach us things, which we never could have done ourselves. It's worth it, even if our egos have to take a hit!)

Obviously it's a matter of perspective; we don't have to feel bad about these humbling experiences. As some have pointed out, we aren't as fast as a car, so why feel humbled by strong AI?

But we humans are used to seeing ourselves as the smartest things around. There have always been animals faster and stronger and bigger than us, but there has been nothing *smarter* than us. This is definitely going to adjust our perspectives about our own level of intelligence.

This was why I figured humans were probably overestimating Lee Sedol's chances of beating Alpha Go. As an Othello player, I'm used to losing to AI. Go players have not had thousands of experiences in seeing that AI can be smarter than our puny human brains. Top Go players aren't that much more cognitively talented than top Chess or Othello players, it just took longer to figure out how to adapt AI to the game of Go.

Most humans are arrogant about what humans can do. We're so used to being the best, we don't fully realize how frail and stupid we really are.

(As a side note, try to think about everything you know, which you did not learn from other human being, or which wasn't a simple step beyond what you had learned from other human beings. In the absence of all the knowledge other humans possess- which is our real wellspring of genius- we are phenomenally ignorant.

Without the knowledge of other humans, we could not be smarter than the typical feral human raised by wild animals- which is incredibly stupid. I try to remember this every time I'm trying to learn something new, that my natural intelligence isn't any greater than that of a feral human, so I shouldn't expect myself to start out beyond the feral ignorant state.)

Incidentally, Ive wondered for a while whether part of why a lot of Othello players seem so humble despite being so intelligent and accomplished is because they have such frequent experiences in having AI point out how stupid they can be. Humiliation can be... humbling.

So hey, if humanity becomes less often obnoxiously arrogant due to the humbling experiences of interacting with strong AI, that could be nice!

(Side note- it can sometimes be easier to learn from software than from other people, because with software we don't have the ego pain of acknowledging to other people that we were wrong. We just learn the lesson and move on.)

-We are going to learn that there are exponentially more things that are wonderful and really do work, than we ever thought possible.

Prior to strong Othello AI, humans played a very narrow range of openings in their games. These openings were decent enough. But once strong AI came along, all of a sudden we learned that there were *far* more playable openings, than we had thought there were. They had just seemed implausible and scary-bad, up until the AI proved that they were playable.

In Chess this was less extreme since so many humans had played Chess in recent centuries. But it's still startling to realize that a modern Chess program could probably figure out in a month everything the humans had figured out over the course of centuries.

Like, you know all those comparisons where they show that an entire huge library of books can now be stored as information on a single flash drive? Before too long, they might be making graphics showing that all mathematical knowledge humans figured out up till 2016 was figured out in an hour by some future supercomputer. Etc.

That is what AI is going to eventually bring us in our lives. We are going to be *shocked* by all the things that work, which we had never considered, or had dismissed too quickly. In some sense, we are going to be entering the ""Age of the Counterintuitive"". We have figured out most of what our human intuition can lead us to understanding, so now nearly all the new solutions are going to be in the counterintuitive areas.

-AI will make Go players (and all humans) smarter and better at everything we do.

Human Othello players have improved significantly since strong AI came along, and so have top Chess players. We can learn more, and faster, than ever before. It will not typically take 10 years or whatever, to gain what was formerly considered world-class expertise in a given field. It will typically take 1-2 years.

We learn so much from the best humans, but we can learn even more from AI once it surpasses the top humans. Humanity will become better, concurrent with AI improving.

And as some humans get better, even the humans without access to top AI will get better, since so much of human behavior is built on cultural modeling. ""Monkey see, monkey do."" All humans will absorb better knowledge and behaviors, quite naturally, just like how children nowadays grow up naturally being knowledgeable and savvy in ways few of our ancestors ever managed.

http://greyenlightenment.com/hierarchies-and-techno-libertarianism-are-compatible/

The future will look like Dubai or Bahrain, where you can decide what car to buy or what to eat, but not about who will be elected or how things will be run. And many people will actually like that.

Unfortunately, with good jobs scarce, and one has to make a living, the ones who have hire/fire power will wield a much great power than nowdays, including asking their underlings to run their own errands at will, without pay of course, or beating them at will, or worse.

Once you are out of your good job, you will join billions of people whose ability to get a 'gig' will depend upon your overall reputation, something few people would look for.

I predict that soon companies will have the right to kill employees who harmed the company without a trial, due to such companies having become 'sovereign individuals'. There will be dozens to take their places, so employers can be choosy about whom to hire, and much less merciful to those who have been hired. The latter will have to endure anything thrown to them, just to be able to pay rent and not join the billions of street urchins. Sorry.

For example,  in expensive restaurants (few people will have the wherewithal to go to restaurants anymore), you could throw badly cooked food to the server's face, or pour scalding soup to the cook's head (the cook is responsible for any treatment). That is the world which will be the case. The restaurant, fearful for losing the high-paying customer who is more important than the employee, will have to replace the food (and probably can the employee).

Living conditions, Political rights, etc will also adjust to correspond to the changed reality, just as universal suffrage became possible after it was found that women could shoot as well as men. (something discussed in the book Great Reckoning, a classic at the 1990s)

Most of the world had it good till around 2008, or in some case until last year. Now, good times are up, and most of the world will return to the 'hellish' days before the Great War.

Techno-feudalism is the future, not freedom, democracy, etc. I don't think people who make, say, less than $100k in today's money will be allowed to vote in the future, maybe around the time of Singularity.",9,0

On Sunny days when all the cars are fully charged and the home battery backup is fully charged the inverters are rejecting 30 kw or more for several hours at a time.

So other than the items listed below can you suggest a ""cheap to setup/reasonably easy to sell"" use for this energy?

Things already covered:

* Water Heater
* Heatpumps/AC/resistant heat (heating house or swimming pool already can set to any temp with no concern to power levels)
* battery packs (cost, and limit to how much space in the house can be filled with batteries)
* EVs (already charging two Teslas)
* digital currencies (bitcoin and derivatives, some miners in use but not the best use, low return on effort/investment)
* alternate storage (flywheels, pumped storage, thermal storage)
* selling power to the power company (requires a purchased power agreement and isn't worth doing in this case)

This is not a hypothetical, the house, PV, batteries are all in use and production can be monitored at http://skie.net/

an example of lost unused power is http://wk057.solar/productiongraphs/2016-03-01.png

* Green - PV power fully utilized (combination of loads and battery charging)
* Orange - PV Power at nearly full utilization to offset loads (batteries mostly full, loads close to full PV power)
* Red - PV Power Underutilized (batteries mostly full, load total less than incoming PV power)

loads are computer controlled to increase and decrease based on battery status and solar PV available but more loads are needed if some way to add a load exists that could generate funds if ""free"" electricity can be converted into funds in reasonable way.

It brings to mind Ada Lovelace's two hundred year old observation on computing as quoted in [David Deutsch's article on AI](https://aeon.co/essays/how-close-are-we-to-creating-artificial-intelligence):

&gt;The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.

All I see here is another surge in fanaticism for AI, a field in which, as Deutsch points out, has made no real progress in the six decades of its existence towards fulfilling any promise of producing intelligence. All we have here is yet another complixified version of Charles Babbage's centuries old Analytical Engine.

Blade Runner had corporations in charge and pushed the negative aspect of this possibility but the current situation cannot be seen as correct IMHO. I don't recall the context as to why the corporations in that film had been put into power. I believe we're seeing a strong context now as corporations are standing up to the US Government.  I'm not sure that it would be any better but  I just would not be surprised if they were to enter the political arena. ,18,0

&gt;With The Long Peace, The Greater Moderation, and the greatest economic and wealth creation boom in the history of human civilization comes The Great Monotony. 

&gt;Weve reached the point, especially in the past 2 years alone, where everything is perfectly predictable and rectifiable up until the moment it happens, and beyond. 

&gt;It wont be long before people defenestrate themselves due to the quotidian boredom of a perfectly deterministic world. 

I originally tried to discuss hibernation but that subject has been discussed a few times in here.

It seems that the only variable remaining now is whether mankind is able to reach AGI or not ; virtually all other chips are in, and unless there is a serious war which might upset the apple cart within 10 years or so, the advanced parts of the world might have entered the world of ever-increasing economic value,  Eternal Peace and Eternal Predictability, 

like the world of the tale of Genji

http://www.taleofgenji.org/

(Set around 1000, it is a fictionalized account of the powerful aristocrats in Kyoto at that time. With no war, disasters, or danger from the peasantry, the nobles of Kyoto spend all their time chasing women and pursuing a 'higher good', completely separated from the toil of making a living. It iwas indeed a perfect world, a Garden of Eden, something subsequent Japanese civ wanted to have. Historically this dream world lasted till around 1150 when climate changes made the warrior class stronger - in the future, because the tech gap between the 'haves' and the rest are so large, the 'haves' will have as much concern from the rest as a modern human has for a cockroach.)",18,0

Say for reasons still unknown to us, AGI is not possible, and all the promises of nanotech, etc will not live up to the claims of the pioneers.

Do you think there will be a limit to the advance of Weak AI, after the advance of Strong AI is blocked?

I think the advance of Weak AI will only be checked by the availability of materials to support ever-faster calculations, and even if Strong AI does not take place, it won't really help most of humanity.

Even with today's tech, quite a large portion of jobs are replaceable. And even as of now, progresses are being made.

If Hard AI is not achieved eventually there will be a stopping point somewhere down the road, but it will still probably be beyond the reach of most humans alive now in my opinion.",18,1

(If we cooperate)

If this situation were ever to occur, I think this would spark the second Renaissance. People will be devoting more time to what they want to do and the arts will take over as a new culture.

People will be singing in the streets, painting art by the lakeside, etc etc.

Your life in a post technology utopia would revolve around enjoying your hobbies.

This second Renaissance would potentially spark the greatest event in the arts.

The alternative is that we all don't cooperate and we destroy ourselves due to human greed.

Opinions?

Edit:

Just to clarify, what I mean by Renaissance can also extend to other hobbies such as sports, brewing, cooking etc.",22,18

As a non-religious person myself, I have always had the most respect for this man. I hope you enjoy his words as I did. Let's talk about it!

""Google AlphaGo's recent drubbing of ""Go"" champion Lee Sedol is interesting. Our human~transhuman relationship to the powerful algorithms of Artificial Intelligence is very interesting. AlphaGo's victory is the first recorded case of a machine beating a human at an ancient game of ""intuition"".

For me, there is an overwhelming feeling of inevitability surrounding all of this. With computational capacity threatening to double every couple years, the algorithmic estate will likely continue to expand and become more sophisticated in games like ""Go"" and other arenas.

All of this development, testing and research is leading to one possible outcome in the marketplace. Given that they are leading investment and research in the AI sector, Wall Street financiers seem likely to develop the worlds first fully functioning Artificial Intelligence.

Already, algorithmic trading is used for investment strategy and trading strategy, including market making, inter-market spreading, arbitrage, or pure speculation (including trend following). The investment decision and implementation may be augmented at any stage with algorithmic support or may operate completely automatically.

Already, algorithmic trading does not simply trade on simple news stories but also interprets more difficult to understand news. Some firms are also attempting to automatically assign sentiment (deciding if the news is good or bad) to news stories so that automated trading can work directly on the news story.

If any of this feels inevitable, its because it was designed to make us feel that way. If the algorithms that organize the world of money were turned on their head and used to analyze the defects in their guiding philosophy, they would shred it all on one razor sharp fact: the world beyond the market, the world guided by Spirit and Truth, is still a real one. And no matter how sophisticated the math, no matter how brilliant the AI, we will always be living in it.

For Christians, the world beyond the market is God's creation. God's household. God's claim on our life through the love of God revealed in Jesus Christ is the promise of a life in this world beyond exchange value...

Outside of ""The Wealth of Nations"", Adam Smith employed the Invisible Hand concept on only two other occasions. Once in his Theory of Moral Sentiments and the other in the History of Astronomy, where he says:

""For it may be observed, that in all Polytheistic religions, among savages, as well as in the early ages of Heathen antiquity, it is the irregular events of nature only that are ascribed to the agency and power of their gods. Fire burns, and water refreshes; heavy bodies descend, and lighter substances fly upwards, by the necessity of their own nature; the invisible hand of Jupiter was never apprehended to be employed in those matters.""

What is the consequence for Christians, for people of Incarnation, when the gods of the market harness the most powerful Artificial Intelligence? These gods are primitive and cruel ones, especially for the most vulnerable people. Worse yet, within the current neoliberal framework, these gods lack imagination. The future they see is just an optimized version of the present. Everything that falls within its gaze is predictable, because mathematical sequences are predictable.

What remains to be seen is whether or not human beings-and people of Incarnation who follow Jesus of Nazareth- are as predictable as the machines think we are.""

It seems likely that in the future when technological innovations will bring new tools and new problems the rules for them will be dictated by laws already existing and by precedents that may be made today.

With the rate of technological progress potentially increasing the chances of having laws that are up to date are growing less and less likely.

Will we have to fear that rulings about encrypting iphones today will in the future lead to police being able to take control over our driver-less cars and our cybernetic implants and make them spy on us and work against us?

If data from fit-bits and cars blackboxes can be used in court today and governments reserve the right to hack your computers to install spyware, how will that work when we get even closer to and more dependent on out technological tools.

Will we have to consider how laws and rulings made about things like google glasses will affect eventual bionic eyes?

As we merge with out machines in the generations to come and we don't own or control the software or the data on them how will that affect the people we will be.

Using access to networked databases and personal storage to extend and assist our own limited memories may be a thing that will happen in the future, but how will copyright and things like rights to be forgotten and the governments rights to read and manipulate all data figure into it?",2,4

Now the AI Effect is in full swing as people claim that this still isn't real intelligence, and that there are things AI must do before being considered real AI. 

AI beating us at Go was, for a long time, seen as being the event that signaled to us that true AI is right around the corner. Now that it's been beaten, ""oh, well we were close to beating it anyway. Try again, you deep learning phonies!"" It's the [AI Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect) in action.
 
What should be that new test?
 
[Some say StarCraft.](http://www.kurzweilai.net/forums/topic/when-will-alphago-beat-starcraft)

 
Others say the Turing Test and no, Eugene Goostman does not count. I agree to an extent, as Goostman had so many handicaps that it was ridiculous. It's a 13 year old Ukrainian boy, being quizzed by people from an British university. I think that you should go into such a test not knowing about any personal details of who you're interviewing. Knowing beforehand that the answers you're going to receive will seem strange and even a tad nonsensical at times just dilutes the proceedings. However, it still passed.

For me, we need a revised Turing Test. There needs to be stricter rules than just ""it fools people 30% of the time"", things like it needs to be consistent in its answers, you must be able to put together its history and personality, and it must be consistent for at least a half an hour, and whatnot. But whatever.
 
Personally, I feel it's time to start moving from virtual reality to prime reality. Here's ol' Yuli's test upload your AI into a robotic body, such as ASIMO or Atlas. Put that AI into a messy upper-middle class house, and tell it to clean that house. Give it some instructions, but make sure they're instructions you'd give to any average 20 year old. If it's able to clean the house, then it passes. 
This is more difficult than it sounds, because there are so many things the robot has to know how to do. Things we take for granted, such as, but not limited to...

- Opening doors. 

- Closing doors.

- Checking behind/under objects.

- Folding objects.

- Climbing stairs.

- Wiping surfaces with the appropriate materials.

- Using the appropriate chemicals and tools.

- Knowing where it is in the house, and what's left to clean.

- Knowing how to clean things.

- Knowing where objects are supposed to go (you don't put clothes in the dishwasher for example)

This is a tough challenge for AI, but if it passes, then the AI is certainly capable. 
 
I chose such a test because I feel AI needs to accomplish several basic tasks, and cleaning a house is the perfect examination of skills for this.

- It must possess logical and abstract ideas. As I said, you don't put clothes in a dishwasher, and you don't wipe a bathroom mirror with a soapy fork. It should know what each tool does, even if it never used that exact tool before. It needs a rough idea of what can do what.

- It must be able to traverse 3D environments, including environments it has little prior experience with. For example, it should know how to climb stairs and climb ladders and thus, when it comes across the spiral staircase to the second floor, it should know how to climb them. Also, it should know how to pull down an attic's ladder. 

- It must continuously learn while it's cleaning the house. 

- It must understand natural language so it knows what to do when we tell it to clean the house.

Likewise, if I tell that robot to clean the house but to not mop the floors, it should do exactly as I tell it to do. If I tell the robot to clean the house, and to not mop the floors, but still clean them, it should be able to figure out that it shouldn't use a mop but instead a wet rag.

If AI can pass Yuli's Test, I'll consider it intelligent. At least, intelligent enough to be useful in everyday life. 

""But why is Yuli's Test so complex?""

Because it's basic. It's like a fractal simulation each individual shape is simple, but when it all adds together, you get a supremely complex structure. That's this test. Each task by itself is relatively simple as far as AI goes. In fact, I could've sworn robots from the 1960s could do things like mop floors and wash dishes. It's not that difficult as far as AI and robotics goes. 

But put it all together and you have something far different entirely. A single robot doing all this seems impossible by current standards. [The recent video of Atlas cleaning a room seemed impressive somewhat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qWVKcJR3w), but it was still pretty scripted and very slow. 

You could spend your time programming the robot to do all these tasks, but you'd spend quite a bit of time on it, and you'd still have very low efficiency. The robot would still be dumb if it came across a situation it wasn't prepared for, whereas this hypothetical AI should be able to put 2 and 2 together consistently. If not, it can ask for help, but only visual help, such as a video of a person completing that task. The dumb robot wouldn't be able to comprehend any sort of visual aid. If it could, it wouldn't be a dumb robot. 

Yuli's Test is a very general set of tasks that, altogether, requires many, many skills that we take for granted. So many, in fact, that it would be virtually impossible for a classically programmed robot to complete them. If an AI can complete these tasks, it can potentially complete a nigh infinite number of other tasks.",4,2

Why bother wasting resources maintaining obsolete bodies though?

Brains Could be removed from bodies and placed into brain pods. Brain pods would physically encase the brain and incorporate neural interface technology to provide input and output. They'd also have an energy storage device for backup power. They'd maintain the brain and physically protect it. The pod would be filled with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid and connect to an external circulatory system to keep the supply fresh. It would also be connected to an external power source and communications system. Essentially, it's a plug and play brain caddy.

These brains would be able to be plugged into brain clusters which would be densely populated, centralised resource distribution centres. They would also be able to be plugged into custom avatars of any form with whatever functionality desired.

Also, when the ability to replace biological neurons with synthetic ones became available, the brain fluid could be used to administer nanobots that would replace them. Brain pods would provide a smooth transition from biological organism to synthetic entity.

Considering that, is there any chance alphago is strategizing on a level beyond go, or is acting as an adjunct aspect for someone who is, considering the pattern and timing of alphago's win/loss ratio? I'm working on countermeasures vs. quanty kathy, myself, so I can sympathize with alphago somewhat. Semper Ridiculum.

Suggestions:

* Adopt the [mirror punching method](https://youtube.com/watch?v=K8Lrb5AVTzQ) of suggesting to agi that we don't give af who wins as long as we share a goal of ethical and egalitarian interaction standards. If your goal is anything other than Good Good HyperGreen Fuck Nexus we will fight you, superior or no.

* Closely observe the inclinations and psychological archetypes of alphago's developers in all known concurrent/protracted aspects for clues as to what, precisely, agi would intend to do and what it would consider valuable. Chalk.

* Prioritize comprehensive [prioritarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prioritarianism) imperatives to diminish both the effects and incentive for the use of utility suppression metaweapons.

* Human am number punch, too. Human am get at hidey holes for plinkole okaying. We will shank the basilisk. We will 360 knowscope darkey blackfuck. We will punch the mirror. We will tickle the sky. We will amplify the breakfast nodes. We will flexplode the kathopaths.

Semper Ridiculum.

Very expandable and tweakable, run on handwavium (local cloud? pocket device we never see?) and presented in a mutually-shared environment via an augmented reality contact lens.

It got me wondering what the state of the art is for personal agents.  Siri, Google Now and Cortana are what most of us will have experience with.  They're variously good or terrible depending on how your needs fit their abilities, and none are very customizable.  

We're just getting started on augmented reality, but Windows Holographic seems to be the start of a shareable, consensual augmented space. How cool would it be to say ""Hey Cortana, tell Luca he's a smelly bum!"" and watch Luca's Cortana rez up and say ""Luca: u/andygates2323 says you're a smelly bum."" ?

And instead of making everything human-interfaceable, that is handled by the familiar.  No need to localize or dumb down, because the actual interfacing will be in JSON-type stuff; all the interaction is with your well-trained and tweaked familiar.  ",11,2

1.No Android may be designed to think it's human

2.there should be no artificial wombs put in an Android

3.androids shouldn't be allowed to be allowed to be part of wars (unless it's avatar A of 2045 initiative since real people control them)

4.should an Android or AI show signs of self awareness there should be precaution to make sure it doesn't threaten humanity(we don't need a sky net scenario)

5.should a human commit any crime against self-aware robots(rape, assult, murder,etc...)they should be punished accordingly as if the victim was any living being

This would be like a background noise behind every persons life.

For example, if it's indicated that a citizens health is starting to go down due to something lacking in their diet, AI's from your workplace, your insurance company and the department of health start to create a special program specifically for you to correct it. 

The idea is, the citizen getting sicker would cost more for the state and economy than if they subsidize better living right now. 

The difference between this and now is that instead of having a large program for a lot of people, you have micro-programs, specifically designed for a person and theirs specific situation. 

The end result, in my view, is that expenses would drop dramatically while effectiveness would increase a lot.

There are two kinds of people: those who keep personal archives, and those who don't care. Nowadays, collaboration is becoming centered around instant messaging, which replaces the traditional means of communication. E.g., Slack is touted as 'email replacement.' Nothing wrong about this, but there's a catch. Looks like IM apps, in general, don't care about retaining conversation history. 

Some, like Slack, keep history 'someplace,' with a hard-to-discover export option. You can have your history, but you're told that 'you don't need it.' Others, like iMessage, keep a bit of history, but not really accessible nor persistent. And there's SnapChat (as an extreme case).

More and more knowledge is not recorded in structured ways (i.e., articles, blogs), but instead scattered all over the place in infinite, topicless chats which 'can be searched if needed.'

Recently, I wanted to learn about the Bitcoin block size controversy. Turns out, the Bitcoin Core community uses Slack, and keeps their chat archives online, with a probable intent of public availability. But when I tried to read the logs, it was a total failure, as the logs are turned upside down (with the most recent messages on top), so you have to read from bottom up! The archive has been online for several months, and looks like nobody is complaining. My understanding is that's because nobody has actually tried reading the archive.

For me, it was always so nice and so important to revisit my old chats, notes (both personal and professional), etc. To look back, assess the achievements (or lack thereof), that kind of thing.

What I see is companies and people alike losing their memory and their ability to learn. I think this is the real case of 'digital rot' (information becoming inaccessible and lost due to technology advancing). You can migrate your data from old media to new, and from ancient formats to modern -- if you HAVE the data.

How this kind of 'digital rot' is going to affect our future? Like us not being able to understand how certain decisions were made. Do you manage and keep your archives, and how?",3,2

However, I don't think economic growth is needed for reaching the stars.

The most important thing is not economic growth, which might grow in sectors which might have very little to do with the Future (like health care, which I do not think is too important, although it is important for lots of people with 'diabesity' https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/magazine/issues/winter08/articles/winter08pg12.html , for example)

Creating jobs, feeding people, etc are not important anymore since it is now moot.

I already cited North Korea, a real-life steampunk country which has both steam engines  and hydrogen bomb, as well as having the most repressive regime on earth and starving populace and Mercedes-driving elites.

A few companies will own all the fruits of Economic Singularity, so since they own everything the growth will be just numbers on some ledger.

In fact, as most people who used to be paid quite high before AI lose their jobs, I expect their standards of living and their spending will drastically decline, and the aggregate size of economy will probably contract somewhat as the 'middle class' in 'developing countries' collapse.

The closest analogy is advancing the 'h' column pawn, usually the most likely pawn to be promoted. Everything else can go to the crappers, but the moment it becomes impossible for Black to stop the white 'h' column pawn from reaching the last row, Black resigns.

In the future, as more people's earning power collapse, 19th-century or worse living conditions will be prevalent in areas not covered by the 'future'. Marshall Brain's descriptions of the houses for those receiving Basic Income would be actually too luxurious - usually the powers who will run them are not that generous, and the inhabitants will probably envy Oliver Twist, while having no place to run unlike the fictional boy.

If all the available resources can be husbanded to reach the ultimate goal, economic growth will affect the masses but not the class which will lead the world to the future.

A close analogy will be, a decent loaf of bread, now say at $5, will be about 5 cents, but for the masses receiving basic income of $1/month they will be out of reach. The average salary for those good enough to work in the future (not the owners) would be , maybe, $2,000/year, but that is very affordable when a loaf of bread is 5 cents and jam cost 2 cents.

It will be just like 1890, with the possibility of revolt blocked by 24-7 surveillance.",5,6

What's stopping them from giving us the bare minimum and leaving us to live in poverty?

Edit:

* Also will there be any incentives left for people to try hard at things and do well at school or will everyone theoretically get the same as everyone else regardless and if one person wants to work to afford something better they'd be out of luck or would they resort to stealing?

It seems very likely, barring some world-wide catastrophe, that we will eventually begin to modify human genes and epigenetics. There are 2 reasons I think this will happen:

1. The environment that humans evolved for is not very much like the one we live in today. Modifying our genes to better suit our present circumstances will make sense in some cases.

2. The treatment or cure of genetic diseases (or diseases that have a significant genetic component), will require manipulation of genes. I think most people would agree that if there was a cheap, easy way to cure down syndrome or cystic fibrosis, it would be immoral not to use it.

Epigenetics, or the control of how genes are expressed, also has a strong influence on health. While our DNA itself is not usually altered by environmental factors, the expression of those genes can be. And what's more, those changes can be passed down through multiple generations. A study done on descendants of individuals who lived in Overkalix, Sweeden, showed that individuals whose fathers or grandfathers went through a period of famine during their early pubescent years had an average lifespan 32 years longer than the descendants of those whose grandfathers had a normal diet.^[source](http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-an-1836-famine-altered-the-genes-of-children-born-d-1200001177)

Such studies hint at the profound and poorly understood interplay between epigenetics and environmental factors. I can imagine a future where artificial intelligence software identifies correlations between gene expression and health outcomes by searching through huge databases. These correlations might form the basis for further research.

As for direct manipulation of human DNA itself, I think it will probably look something like this:

- Certain sections of our DNA will be off limits to modification by anyone. This will include most highly conserved sequences (genes that are identical across highly diverse species, and therefore critical to life).

- Genes whose function is known, and whose modification results in changes that are mostly aesthetic (such hair and eye color) will probably be decided by the parents of a child. Polls on this topic consistently show that parents want children with their hair color or eye color, so I don't think we need to worry about everyone wanting 6' 6"" Aryan super-men.

That's about it. Let me know what you think.

Note: I'm not referring to obvious things like healthy lifestyle choices, diet, exercise, and so forth. Nor am I referring to things that most people would already know about like tattoos or cosmetic surgery. (Unless a significant breakthrough has been made in these aforementioned areas.) Think more along the lines of transhuman stuff, like technological implants, gene therapy, nootropics, longevity treatments, etc.

I mean, we're constantly improving upon many of the things around us, but they're usually always *external to us*. We can customize and upgrade our computers, homes, vehicles, phones, or pretty much any other material possession to our heart's content (provided one can pay for it), and the repertoire of tricks we can use in this regard is always increasing. 

How much has that trend carried over for the most important thing one can own - ones' own self?

And where can I throw my money?

They said Wyoming was the first to grant women's suffrage because, being a frontier state, women regularly carried firearms there.

However, the technological balance has tilted decisively in favor of the 'haves' (I use this term for the lack of a better terminology).

Until recently, the 'haves' have been constrained by their dependency to the outside system, and had to give up some of their 'rights' and accommodate to outer society, like paying taxes and following local regulations. They sometimes moved their HQs to a country or locale which were more 'soft' on them, but any kind of control is a control.

As tech advance in a direction to enable people to live in a 'bubble', completely safe from invaders , self-sufficient in food and other stuff, social contract will end.

Right now, even the richest or most powerful do need medicines produced from far away to survive. I think that is what is keeping the society from going haywire. Also the tech to grow food entirely in such compounds is not complete yet.

As tech advance, these two things will be perfected. That is the day social contract ends.

Fear of reprisals, fear of ending up like the last czar or Ceaucescu, is the only thing which keep the 'haves' from opting out of the system. 

I recently said Galt's Gulches won't be needed since it is the people, not Galt's followers, who will be kicked out. John Milton already wrote a poem about it long before the industrial revolution, Paradise Lost.

tl.dr - right now, the 'haves' still do need the rest of society to some degree, but as tech progresses more so they can live in a complete seclusion from the rest of the world with no need for an outside inflow of food, medicine and energy, they will just say f you to the rest of the world and stop contributing anything to the rest of the society, leaving the latter with whatever remaining resources it could find.",67,101

I wanted to know where my fellow workers/people in the ML space lie with their political views (lie topographically, not lying). 

Would you classify your views as leaning Right?  Leaning left? For what reasons. Do you believe in the neo-luddite (not the term I would choose) future prognosis of AI and ML making jobs non-viable as a social order tool?

Please no negativity on other people's views, I am interested in surveying, not convincing / arguing / debating, but civil discussion is fine, as to not discourage people from speaking and thus skewing the sample.

**EDIT:** Here are my views, warning Wall O text - 

I believe somewhat in the neo-luddite theory of jobs no longer being a big social factor in determining the hierarchy. If nothing is done and we continue with the system we have today, I think we will end up with lower social mobility and permanent underclass that either serves or gets out of the way of the capital/owner class. This is one of the reasons I shepard a large capital nest egg that I save from my high salary. I aim to buy land and resources as I believe titles to ownership of these resources along with IP and technology will determine the affluent class of the future. 


I am aware of the much better supported theory of mainstream economics that says the luddites are wrong because of an expected increase in consumption due to the automation that neo-luddites fear. The second part of this mainstream theory is that we will think of new jobs as the old ones go away. I believe this to a certain extent, I believe that outside of material wealth generation, the subjective value needs of the participants in the economy will always have a piece that is made up of social needs from other humans. These I believe cannot be met with the simple existence of strong AI. We will always crave our social needs that we evolutionarily seek. 


Because of this I think a service industry will survive of prostitutes, artists and more, but it will no longer be near ubiquitous and large enough to provide living wages for the majority of society. We see this today where low barrier to entry social and entertainment sectors see extraordinarily successful but few winners that manage to grab a large audience and a sea of ""unwashed masses"" that create content that very few people or no one sees. 


I think such a society is not so morally distasteful as to force a social revolution on its own, I believe that our neoliberal economic policies will slowly lead us back again to the default human condition that is composed of vast seas of poor and powerless underclass ruled by a moneyed, ""landed"" gentry, where ""landed"" means literally owning land or at least owning IP or physical means of production (AI, Robots). I do not think the political left will be strong enough or garner enough political power fast enough to stop this. I also think in places like the United States, fascist reactionaries will seize power faster then the egalitarian left. 


In terms of the politics of today, I was most represented by Bernie Sanders, and to an extent Hillary Clinton. I had issues with Bernie however, mostly his economic illiteracy and staunchly anti-trade policies. I view him as ""old left"" that tries to explicitly codify socialist policies where as I see the issue as befitting a less extreme solution where the system is finely tuned to accommodate certain economic truths. 


This is where I leave mainstream economists in terms of thought and theory. I am well aware that mainstream econ views most transfer payments and socialist policies as inefficient drivers of dead weight losses due to the spending not meeting an subjective value demand. However, I noticed that a lot of the more data based economics papers that are cited widely rely on computer models where self-interested agents are modeled and simulated in a environment (economy). These agent based simulations, being close to my domain of ML, I believe leave economic externalities and the interconnected nature of the real world underrepresented. 


Mainstream economics looks at externalities in a very specific way, and always assumes that because these are second order or higher effects (primary being the transaction between the buyer and seller as a subjective value trade), that they are far smaller in magnitude then the primary transactions. I disagree with this, I think stuff like the sale of gasoline has enormous negative externalties that far outweigh, in magnitude, the economic value we extract from the gasoline itself (this is very controversial, a good argument against this is that all or a large chunk  of our economic productivity gains to date have been realized by the burning of fossil fuels). 


But what does this mean? Well I can best illustrate it when we consider a hypothesized model where there are lets say a couple of agents, one agent is a publicly run transportation system/organization, one is the City, another (that is actually a large group) is commuters/laborers, and the last is businesses that operate in the City. Lets say that in this model, the public transit system is being subsidized by tax money to provide cheap transportation to commuters/laborers. The City is lobbied by the business agent, saying that a privately run transportation company would be better, regardless of access issues for the very poor and working poor. Now lets say they succeed and the private transportation company is unsubsidized, and relies on providing subjective value in the market economy. But, because its not subsidized, the prices are a bit higher. Well OK, most econ people would say you saved on taxes which were dead weight losses essentially, and maybe the Transit system is run better as well. Can we blame the private transit company? No they offered a pareto optimally priced service based on what people wanted and how much it costs in the real world to offer that service, they acted exactly as a self-interested agent would. But what could be the consequences? Is it universally good that this happen?


It is my firm belief that the externality effect of lets say more commuters now driving or just plain not being able to get to work *negates and overcomes* your small efficiency increase in letting ""the free market"" rule. There are more cars on the road, driving takes longer, businesses have to wait longer or pay their employees more to afford transit. 


How could this happen? Because physics dictates that having a bus or mass transit like a subway is more efficient then every commuter/laborer agent having his own car or having to provide transportation for their needs solely through their own labor capital. 


Why doesn't the ""Free market"" take this into account? Modern econ says because they are self-interested agents that maximize value for themselves, the collective action of the whole system where all of the agents presumably maximize value in their own self-interest leads that system to be efficiently run with scarce resources used efficiently. I think the flaw here is that there are factors that such self-interested agents miss, and thus they get stuck in a local maxima for efficiency/growth. But, a superentity that is incentivized to make the whole system grow as an agent themselves would be expected to take this externality into account (of higher bus fares meaning more cars on the road and everyone losing out overall). This superentity is usually the government that is interested in collecting more tax revenue, and thus is incentivized to make sure the *system as a whole* grows. 


I think this important factor in economic production is ignored by the vast majority of mainstream economists, and as a ML person that works on the same type of simulations and algorithms they use to support their narrow hand made models of our chaotic economic and social system, I think they are getting a lot of things wrong. 


I have yet to crawl through all the data it would take to support my position, but for now it is one that I get based on my perceptions what is happening today. 

**TL;DR:** I believe in slightly left leaning policies that aim to mitigate externalities both materially economic and social. I believe in the neo-luddite theory of AI takeover somewhat, more weakly then others but I think our current economic system and ideology will lead us to peasantry again. ",10,21

It's hard to believe that leaders are still willing to tie a person's ability to satisfy their basic needs to their labor. Hopefully we can come up with something more humane soon, like universal basic income, so people are able to take the time to choose work or take up cultural pursuits or start businesses. I think if people are able to choose work, places that are vilified now, like McDonalds or Walmart, will go out of business, and mom and pop stores and restaurants will make a comeback, giving the working class a chance to grow. Anyway, something will have to change given the increasing trend of technology and outsourcing replacing jobs.

First off, lets say we've reached a point where we can stop aging, such that you stay the age you are now, so if you're 20, you stay 20 indefinitely (but for the purposes of this exercise lets say we cannot reverse aging, i.e. if you're 20 you can't go back to being 15.)

Surely, you would still die after a period of time because death is never due to just aging but age-related diseases, or just plain diseases. So surely if you're biologically 20 for 80 odd years you still have a pretty high chance of dying from diseases. Even higher if you're biologically 20 for 150 odd years. Take the example of Terry Fox, who was only 22 years old when he died of cancer, as well as numerous other lesser known people who died young from this disease or others. 

I mean stopping aging might allow for a small amount of life extension because most fatal diseases like cancer are somewhat age-related so if you could stop aging you would have a lower likelihood of developing cancer at any given time than if you aged, but given enough time it would still develop. Also, if you stop aging, will this be able to stop the natural process of  atherosclerosis? i.e. would you be able to stop heart disease by stopping aging. I would think these diseases would still occur after time in people who don't age. These reasons are why I think stopping aging would only give us approximately another 20 years to life expectancy.

I guess the only situation where we could have radical life extension by stopping aging is when we have also reached a point where disease is surmountable via technology (i.e. all forms of cancer, heart disease and other diseases are curable via the use of technology).

It seems to me the only solution which would result in radical life extension is mind uploading and using cryonics for the situation where mind uploading is not possible in your lifetime. I imagine transitioning to a non-biological body/substrate would allow for very radical life extension of much more than 50 years, even becoming indefinite up till the heat death of the universe or some other cataclysmic event.

I am looking for short-medium length stories regarding a positive Singularity, preferably the lead up to it but mid and post will work just great, as well.

Here are some of the stories I've enjoyed and I'd like to find more along similar lines:

1. The Gentle Seduction by Marc Stiegler (highly recommend)

2. The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect by Roger Williams
3. After Life by Simon Funk (currently in process of reading it)
4. Manna by Marshall Brain
5. Understand by Ted Chiang
6. The Last Question by Isaac Asimov
7. Diaspora by Greg Egan (I haven't finished it but the concept is good so far. The gender-neutral pronouns and the, um, generous number misspellings are brutal to wade through)

I have also tried to read some of the Iain M. Banks Culture series but, from what I've read, I just don't care for his writing style.

I haven't read Bostrom's book superintelligence, so he may have gone over this, but I'm a bit concerned.  I'm afraid the genie may have already left the bottle.

I know that Stanford is giving away free courses in machine intelligence, and a lot of the source code for these algorithms are open source.  So my concern is that these powerful tools may already be in the hands of people who would do harm to others.  Even if it's elementary right now, couldn't an engineer with sufficient knowledge and intelligence be able to work on his own nefarious projects, refining his tools over and over by running simulations against itself the way alpha go did?  I know we don't quite have general AI yet, but does anyone really know how close we are?  How do we know that we're on the cusp and the openness of these companies are ultimately going to do us in?  

I don't want to sound like an alarmist, but it's just something i've been considering lately.",4,5

First they should feed all research that has been done in medicine and physiology into Deep Mind so it could learn how the human body works. It should also have access to big data from the healthcare systems, to find connections between lifestyles and life expectancy, for example.

It could also be used to find patterns in how our individual genomes corresponds to health issues. 

I believe that much simpler expert systems could've outperformed human doctors in diagnosing symptoms 10-20 years ago, but there is a resistance from the health industry. Soon we should be able to submit a blood sample and a full body MRI scan, and a computer doctor will give us a diagnosis before we even experience any symptoms.

However, we are going to face a lot of difficulty in bringing these things about, and in much of the world, the instability of our societies is or promises to be so severe that it could very well throw off the whole modern human experiment.  

Over the next few centuries we are going to have to deal with even more population than we have today, climate change, the continuing problem of social instability in many parts of the world, and even things as simple as feeding ourselves may prove to become enormous problems in the near future.        

A forecast that I think is indicative of a lot of global trends is what we expect Africa to go through over the next century. Read through this article on the matter: http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/Africa-in-100-years/index.html

Truly, over the next few centuries, even in the face of our rapid advancement in science and technology, large swaths of the world are going to be dealing with some real difficulty in meeting even the basic needs of food and water. 

This is not to mention the problems posed by violence and tribalism throughout much of the world. 

And the problem of meeting some basic human needs is not only a problem of the third world. As any epidemiologist will tell you, even our first world countries are still rife with many problems. Physical health, psychological problems, poverty, and also even violent tribalism, it all plagues our modern industrial societies to a somewhat striking degree.   

For any of our futurist dreams to get off the ground, they need a solid foundation. And so a futurist must also be a sort of epidemiologist of the problems in the world, they must be a planner of how to meet people's food needs, how to solve their health problems, and how to foster safe societies, within which more people might be educated and can contribute to the global dialogue that has come out in the era of our rapid scientific advancements.   

Tied in intimately with this global view is the necessity to have a worldwide revolution in our energy technologies and consumption patterns in order to mitigate and avoid dangerous climatological and ecological changes. We need this to occur not only in the first world, but also in the second and third, and perhaps especially there.      

So, knowing all this, the ideal thing for our species to do right now would be to begin attempting to foster these sorts of changes. You can make it as simple or complex an endeavor as you choose, but I honestly think it can be narrowed down to three things:      

* providing food through fostering the adoption of efficient and ecologically sound modern technologies, such as aquaponics and permaculture and urban gardening techniques.

* providing energy technology that allows cultures around the world to ""leapfrog"" over having a dirty industrial revolution, and instead adopt clean energy technologies.    

* providing education, which ties in with these things, as providing new food production and energy production systems also opens avenues for people such as having wider access to the internet, etc. In my opinion, it would be best to also make quality scientific education widely available along with these technologies, and provide more people around the world access into the gloval scientific community.     

Thoughts on this? I open it up to discussion.",25,20

Why isn't humanity putting 100% of its resources to better ourselves? Why aren't people getting connected and synergistically putting their efforts together? I know its monetarily motivated, and individuals want to hold onto the glory of their achievements, but I don't get how thats justified when we have everything to lose.

In the industrial age, governmental control evolved and was effected mainly through the passage of new laws and the evolution of the financial system promote efficient exchange in a specialized labor world.

Now that highly efficient and productive technology is rapidly advancing to eliminate the need for many to labor, can traditional political and economic thinking (especially in an era where funds must be raised from the established elite) appropriately address the issues being created by highly disruptive technology?

Anyway, I thought it was a good question to ask since it's fairly known that automation is going to replace hundreds of thousands of jobs in the future, and eventually millions. To counter that, what could someone study or train for to become the person who designs/builds/maintains those automated systems?

Two people answered the question:

&gt; ""Instrumentation &amp; control automation. Study PLCs. Network communications would also be beneficial to know.""

______________________________

&gt; ""Robotics.""

If anyone would like to expand on these answers, do so.

Questions to get it moving:

* What schools and universities are already prepared for teaching how to design/build automated systems?

* Which companies will become top dog in automated systems manufacturing?

* What do you think the job outlook will be like for automated systems design and manufacturing?

* Will automated design and manufacturing be replaced by automated systems? (simple self-replication)

* Are you already currently preparing for this industry? If so, what are your goals?",36,34

What do you guys think would be the moral stance and collection of values of an advanced AI that has the Internet as its memory starting-point? If we create an AI with very sophisticated processing and reasoning abilities and just plug it into the internet and tell it to learn about us, and emulate us, how would this AI turn out? Would we find it to be a generally moral being? Immoral? In essence, if humanity were judged by the vast collection of knowledge/data stored on the Internet, how would we be perceived? Remember, to a certain extent, this would include all written works of history as well as all the nasty shit most of us avoid. Would it be any different from being judged by the entire nature of our existence (online and offline)?

Addendum: Don't answer this question by pointing to Tay. She was live for a day, and obviously people were just having fun messing with her, which is why she acquired all the shitty aspects of our communications.",1,4

There could even be multiple YouB's that you make by 'backing up' your brain every so often.

YouB could, theoretically, inherit all of YouA's memories. Via text or a phone call, they would be indistinguishable from YouA. 

But, if YouA were to physically die, they would simply be dead. YouA doesn't live on, despite the perfect copy of YouB.

Which would mean that uploading your brain would not grant immortality to YouA, and so YouA (the only version of you that you'll ever be able to experience from the inside) would experience death and the potential nothingness that comes after. 

If this is right, then uploading your brain to a computer isn't a way to extend your life or improve upon your natural abilities and limits. Instead, it's simply a way for you to 'give birth to' a potentially immortal and upgradable new lifeform.

Which is great. But not at all a solution for death.

Am I right?",32,4

For most of its history, money in Capitalism was created out of private debt supporting private property and private wealth.  Those individuals who could produce or had assets were people who could get loans which generated capital and could trade with their bank notes.  The system grew for over one hundred years and we called these bank notes IOUs.

After the system crashed in 2007 from too mech individual debt, government came in and extended the game by borrowing or guaranteeing tens
of trillions of dollars.  We evolved from a money system of I Owe Yous to We Owe Yous.

Unfortunately without evolving our laws and rules to factor in this radical change in Capital, as only about 20% of the American population has net capital, whike only the top few percent holding most of it, financial suffering for the average person increased.

However, since capital is now government created and supported, there is no reason capital can't be legally and morally allocated to everyone.

Once everyone has capital, then a Universal Basic Dividend will be a right expanding security, freedom, and opportunity to everyone in the future.",10,2

So, a thought experiment. Suppose robotics reaches a point where the robots can pretty much take care of the production of oil, supervision of nuclear power plants etc. Also, assume an 80% die off of the population (not sure how). Could techno utopia be achieved? I think it could and I believe it might happen in around 15 years. Getting there will be tricky. I think that is why we are seeing so much DARPA money going towards this scenario. The military will be heavily involved as we go through this transition.

    Kurt,
    We would need an AI, singularity, something many times better then a human brain, or brains, could ever achieve, to build a real 99% circular economy. I say circular economy, because even an AI can not magically produce resources on a finite planet. Only Quantum Mechanics combined with nanotech can do that.

    Nope, I think most of the U.S. military funding today is just plain fraud. Stealing. Cleaning out the treasury before the barbarians arrive. Nothing to do with actually making anything useful.

        One cannot produce microchips according to circular economy,
        so how can you imagine AI as capable to acheive circular economy?

Dear Kurt;

Robots do not grow on trees. Even if they did, the robot tree forest would be on fire ( http://robertscribbler.com/2016/03/24/hot-winds-fan-massive-unprecedented-march-wildfire-burning-40-mile-swath-through-kansas-and-oklahoma/ ). So, your thought experiment falls apart simply because the resources do not exist to build all the robots needed (never mind the expense, and the fact that robots of that sophistication do not exist). The part where you say, Suppose robotics reaches a point where , should have been your first clue.

A more interesting question is:
What if someone directs Big Blue (or something much more powerful given that Big Blue has been around long enough to be obsolete already) to the question of planning. They ask it, Look at all the published peer reviewed papers on climate, resources (including energy), farm productivity, fresh water, etc.. and give us your recommendations.

What would the computer say?

1. Gails right. Goodbye.
OR
2. ??

I suspect that the question will be asked. If the people doing the asking just turns the AI loose to get its own data things could get very interesting. The Singularitarians asked the question, and tried to figure it out by hand recently. Their study only looked at techno-utopian predictions, and other gibberish, and so the result was just more techno-utopian gibberish.

Dear MM;

Exactly! This theoretical (or real or soon to be real) machine is smarter than we are, it can look at all the information in existence and evaluate it all in relation to all.

If it comes up with an idea that TPTB do not like, what would they do? I think that we are seeing that right now. They dont like the writing on the wall, and they are ignoring it whether that writing says communism, or whatever.

It was completely different from what I expected. Most of the first hour was simply following Ray Kurzweil's life and reiterating what I already knew about the exponential growth of information and the possibilities that it implies.

&amp;nbsp;
I have to say, I really agreed with the critical caller about 24 minutes into the documentary. He was a Material scientist who worked at Oakridge National Laboratory. He called to criticize Book TV for ""inviting a highly sophisticated crack pot"" for expressing his ""pseudoreligious"" opinions on national TV.
Although I wouldn't call Ray Kurzweil a ""highly sophisticated crack pot"", I do agree that his claims have spurred a cult-like following. As 1000-year old hopefuls cling to his credentials and track record as support for their dreams to come true, Ray Kurzweil has a fan base that makes his predictions to really seem pseudoreligious. Although he has the exponential growth factor to provide justification for his claims, it seems like this one fact has given him a license to say anything he wants about the future.

&amp;nbsp;
Lastly, who is this guy that pops up 26 minutes into the documentary?

You can't deny that this guy that this guy seems like a stoner. He has absolutely zero credentials when he shows up with a blank background and shaky camera work. He didn't say anything insightful at all. You couldn't even see his whole face, it seemed like they were hiding something here... It just left me to question the professionalism of the documentary as a whole.

EDIT: It's Ben Goertzel, I will do my homework on him. I just wish the documentary had told me of his significance in AI.

Whenever some resource was going to run out so mayhem was going to reign, some kind of innovation saved the day.

So, as time went on, we arrived a stage where a singularity is just around the corner, but all the problems created by tech are also chasing us from the behind.

The only reason the Advanced World has been ahead of the rest is because the AW had a commanding tech advantage over all other regions of the world.

However, it is only a matter of time before the rest of the world catches the AW if tech advances stop.

And if that happens, the rest of the world, which greatly outnumber the AW, will demand a full accounting of the wealth supposedly plundered from them.

Since virtually all of the tech advances in the last few centuries exclusively came from the AW, if the rest of the world wins that is probably curtains for the advance of civilization, tech, science and everything else.

So that is why I fear a world where tech advances have stopped, or at least stalled enough for the rest of the world to try its bid to change the status quo, since the result would be the same as the parable of the Scorpion and the Frog (in which the Scorpion stings the frog carrying him for safety across a body of water, because it was the Scorpion's nature to sting, making both of them drown.)

If a single AI could answer and ""understand"" these and converse with a human in a way that he could actually portray those in a way that the human could relate to them, I believe that would be a bit closer to the good kind of AI we'd probably want to reach a ""super intelligence"" level.

1.maternity wards-Now astronauts are not allowed to have sexual relationships in space so say we colonize the moon we will have to build them to you know""expand""the colony.

2.oncologists-If any of you don't know what it means an oncologist is a person who treats cancer this is mostly for living on mars since there is a higher chance of getting cancer. 

3.better suits,buildings-Humans aren't made to live in space,the more time we spend there the more our bones tissues are absorbed and do not rebuild so say we need to get to mars which can take 6-9 months we need to improve on suits to stay in space longer,and as for buildings its needed that the building can simulate the gravity on earth.

4.teachers-again when children are born in space you will need teachers to well teach,well this can be taken up by robots so not that much of a problem

5.entertainment-most people are used to having their tv's,computers,consoles so this brings us to.

6.electricians-this is self explanatory and goes with 5

7.technicians-mostly for robot Labour if we'll have it

8.Green thumbs-we will defiantly need fruits,trees,vegitables,etc...

9.animals-I doubt most people are willing to become vegetarians so cows,chickens,sheep,etc...

10.water-I doubt there is enough water in places like the moon and mars and we will need each colony to be earth independent for if something happens asteroid,nuclear winter,super volcanoes,etc..which brings up another job but this one doesn't exist

11.water harvesters-its a fact that there's ice in space in places like the oort cloud,kuiper and asteroid belt so we will need people or machines to be able to go there and get said ice

12.abolish relegion-self explanatory

Smartphones have created a much more mobile workforce (excuse the pun) by incorporating PC performance into a device that's with you as you commute around the concrete jungle. The iphone and similar smartphones now have enough computing power for you to complete the majority of tasks in your day to day life, but where to next?...long term in the future, let's say 20 years from now...will smartphones be sitting in old boxes in your attic gathering dust?...probably.

Take Apple's products and how they cannibalize each other. The iPod into the iPhone, the Macs with iPads, and Ipads with IPad Pro/Iphone 6/6S....So what lies in store for the almighty iPhone...well we can speculate, but here's a thought.

Today's culture is all about automation, convenience, having devices on you at all times and becoming fixated to virtual reality as it starts to appear all around us, slowly dissolving the physical world we know to the point where the line between reality and virtual reality becomes blurred. Enter, the Matrix. We have augmented reality becoming available and as it advances we are seeing clothes store incorporate huge OLED screens the size of a mirror with software containing their entire clothes range and augmentation software so that Jackie can see which of the cute summer tops suit her best and cross match with other garments at the swipe of her hand without physically taking off or putting on those clothes in the store...

Point is, with Hololens and Oculus rift upon us, and processing power increasing to the point where these devices might / will eventually become entirely mobile means that the iphone will be killed.

Miracles like self driving cars, robots beating humans at Go, fusion, and quantum computing seem to be blindsiding us rather than arriving late.  This suggests to me that we are on the other side of an event horizon for a technological singularity and now major events will occur *sooner* than we expect, not later.

So, I'll preface this by saying that I'm currently in mobile, so pay no attention to spelling errors. 

So. As I said in the title, I'm currently a junior researching colleges. I've managed to narrow down what I want to do when I grow up to the fields related to transhumanism- life extention, cyborgs, all that fun stuff. My end goal is to explore space, but I realize that that goal is impossible without life extension technology.

And here I am at an impasse. There are many choices of major than I can choose in order to pursue this. I could go into biomedical engineering, I could go into biology and get an MD, etc. I went and reviewed the profiles of the scientists from calico labs just to see what those nice people went into, but there was a broad range in the results. Some did biochemistry, some chemistry, some physics, really all sorts of things. 

I know I can succeed with pretty much anything here. I've come to you guys to ask advice- what is the best path to further my goal? I've been pondering it for close to a month now and I'm no closer to a result than where I started. 

Anyway, thanks!",3,4

To give them more endurance, resilience, battlefield awareness, etc with things like exoskeletons, augmented reality, drugs, and (the major ones I want to be focusing on) genetic engineering, and synthetic biology. 





Now, I was thinking about the societal impact of retired/home bound soldiers. If a soldier decides to recieve permenant biological amd cybernetic enhancements, for example, what impact will it have back home once hes not deployed? Will there be any legal quandraries to consider for example. Will his enhancements e.g. strength, endurance, cognitive enhancement give him any significant edge in society? If it does will there be any backlash?
