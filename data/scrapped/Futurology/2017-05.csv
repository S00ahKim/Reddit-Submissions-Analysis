1)UBI will curve some of the symptons and none of the real problems with social inequality. If your under some notion that poverty causes poverty or some other crazyness you might believe UBI. The reality is UBI doesn't make it easier for the poor to compete in society but harder. 



2) There will be a massive problem with predators. Unlike those financial predators that lurks at places like say malls, these come within. What happens when it becomes the thing for aggressive members of a neighborhood to start creating protection rackets. 

3) Poverty is caused by an inability to compete and this doesn't solve the problem of what people are suppose to do with their time. Work isn't just about collecting a pay check. People need to have a sense of value within their social community. That value doesn't have to be anchored in coin but it has to be something that society agrees upon. Without society saying thanks this is important people decline on a social level, people that are conscientious tend to fall into despair and people that are not tend to turn to self destructive behavior.  

4) It'll replace the bureaucracy that actually creates jobs.Yes you might hate the bureaucracy that is involved with social services but those are jobs, generally jobs that are not easy(atleast politically) to automate. 

5) Wages will be deflated very quickly. In fact one could argue that wages may deflate so quickly that the money instantly goes back to the 1 percent. 
 



6) UBI advocates are motivated by political agendas. You get people at both ends of the political spectrum for a reason. Classic welfare programs work and fail for a reason. Instead of improving these systems both parties have a direct interest in moving in the UBI direction. For right wingers they get to fulfill this fantasy of deregulation, for the left its just moving onto a new idea before resolving the problems with an old one.

7) UBI will lead to an inevitable fragmentation of society. Without a shared economy people will become more class based. Because at the end of the day it doesn't matter how much money you receive but where you get to spend it. One could easily imagine a world where the checks in one neighborhood spill into the rich just as quickly as they do now. 

8) UBI is a minor solution to a much bigger problem. It alleviates enough of the problem that its viable but not enough that we can live in a secure world. Our big bargain chip against the corporations is that they need our consumption, when we give them a way out its too late. 

9) It's totally untested. It's an idea that has ""pilot"" programs galore. But economic activities are gauged by the decades not months. When you get a regular country(not one propped up by oil money etc) your likely to get a completely unknown result.  

10) Finally the big reason is because it replaces better options. What possible ways could we regulate automation? Restricting technology? Land grants? Regulating economic acitivity? A massive uptick in public spending? The creation of entire westworlds?

Therefore, since total sales for 2016 were 17.6 million cars and trucks sold, it follows that there are approximately 4.4 million new cars and trucks being leased each year.

A quote from a recent news article: ""A lease is often a much better, and more affordable, option than a purchase. ""

http://www.whio.com/news/local/reasons-why-people-don-lease-cars-and-why-they-really-should/nRriZSj2yfEuYDNrXpM3iP/

Another quote from a different news article: ""Despite today's low fuel prices, fuel economy remains among the most important factors for car shoppers.""

http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1109986_aaa-interest-in-electric-cars-rivals-interest-in-pickups

My questions are: why don't car companies who are leasing their electric vehicles shout from the top of their lungs that driving a mile in an electric vehicles cost 50%+ less than their gas guzzling equivalent once the car is driven off the lot?

http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/01/f28/eGallon%20methodology%20%28Updated%20January%202016%29.pdf

Wouldn't the 4.4 million people who are leasing their vehicles save quite a lot of money by leasing an electric vehicle instead of leasing their gas guzzling counterparts? What other information would increase future demand for their EV leases? In other words, How would I get more people interested in leasing electric vehicles in the future?

Lease an all-electric car for next to nothing? How I did it.

Note: Kelley Blue Book estimates that the average sales price reached an all-time record high of $35,309 in December 2016.

There's a link in the sidebar, below the rules section, that takes you [here for more information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/wiki/moderator)

We had a lot of people who applied, who didn't have enough experience, but we would love to see re-apply again, when they did. The link above lays out exactly what the criteria for that experience is.

At the moment a bit less than 10% of people who apply, match the experience we're looking for, but there is another 10-20% of people, who we feel could make the grade, with just a bit of work.

With that in mind, you'll see we have a section where we talk about how we can help such people, if they are interested, with a 3 month probationary period.

If you think you fall into that category - please get in touch with us.

We certainly don't feel like we have enough Mods. In particular we can't give the attention needed to the comments section in the busy posts that get on r/all or the Reddit frontpage.  That's typically 1000's of comments every day, that ideally we would like to see reflect **only** high quality, intelligent, insightful conversation about the futurology topic being discussed, with all chit-chat, memes, &amp; low grade comments removed.

We've also loads of side projects, like reviving our monthly Mod Podcast &amp; doing regular AMA's, that we just don't have the time for now, until we get more help.

Please ask away, if you've any questions about all of this &amp; Mods will answer them here.",36,97

Title: **""Elon Musk Says Tesla's Solar Roof Tiles Have 'Infinity' Warranty""**

What actually happened is that he joked about the tiles being so tough they could have an infinite warranty, *but then he said giving them an infinite warranty is not practical*. Typical salesperson talk  la ""They will last *forever*. Actually they won't. Now buy the product I want you to buy."" How is it possible that this kind of completely made-up story with this headline is allowed here?

Another example: https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6970lr/elon_musk_robot_software_will_make_tesla_worth_as/

Title: **""Elon Musk: Robot software will make Tesla worth as much as Apple""**

Actual quote: If were able to maintain a 50% growth rate for 10 years and achieve 10% profitability number and have a 20 P/E, our market cap would be basically the same as Apples is today,

So basically, under very specific circumstances that don't seem realistic, Tesla could potentially be worth as much as Apple is right now sometime in the future. Well, you can say the same about literally every company if it maintains a specific growth rate, profitability, etc. for a certain period of time. But again, the title presents this as a fact (""Robot software *will* make Tesla..."")

This is completely unfeasible with existing materials (and everyone knows it, in fact it's usually the first thing anyone says about it). Luckily, we don't actually have to use this design if we want an elevator to orbit.

In 1982, an engineer and physicist named Paul Birch wrote a series of papers describing what he called an Orbital Ring System, which used Kevlar cables attached to a dynamic structure in LEO containing a superorbital mass stream. He outlined two possible sizes: 180 million tons, and 180,000 tons. He described the latter as a bootstrap ORS. Using today's launch costs, it would cost about 360 billion dollars to put that much material into orbit.

The cool thing about it is that you could use it to boost the materials to upgrade itself to higher and higher capacity, so within a few days you could exponentially reach the full sized model one thousand times as big (or one year if you approach it linearly).

By now you might be asking the obvious question: Are smaller sized models such as 180 tons possible? Nobody seems to know the answer to this. If so, you could use the same exponential bootstrapping approach to reach the 180,000 ton version, then reach 180 million tons just as quickly from there.",16,4

Here's his talk: https://www.ted.com/talks/ray_kurzweil_get_ready_for_hybrid_thinking

1. before, there were farmers making everything by hand

2. inventions made mass production easier

3. capitalists invested in factory owners

4. factory owners had the capital to start factories but they needed workers to operate them

5. farmers go to these factories

6. all the goods were mass produced and therefore cheaper

7. everyone still had their jobs

You may be thinking, ""Well that's different, one job traded for another! Robots will take our jobs and we're not going to have anything to do!"" Wrong. Like the farmers, humans are going to be used as a resource for other things, much like the farmer turned machine operator. We're simply going to have to get smarter to do the jobs robots are too dumb to do, and therefore our society will become collectively more intelligent as the less intelligent fall behind. This is the cycle of capitalism; the market always adapts.

UBI is a fundamentally bad idea, seeing as there is no exchange for that income. As of now, currency is obtained through labor. We give up our time in exchange for the currency that we need. UBI simply gives us money at the expense of the taxpayer with no merit whatsoever. It's also bound to instantly fail, because nobody will bother working (see: welfare recipients) once it is put into place. The economy will crumble with the poor eating right out of the hand of the state whom steals from the last remaining taxpayers.",37,0

I don't think that quoting recent developments is working to show people what is going on in the world, so I decided to compile a list of **consequences** or, let's say, effects. These are consequences of the development and pretty much prove things are nowhere near slowing down for several cases. I am planning on formatting and putting this up in a better way later but I decided to propose it here first for comments.

For completion sake, I will also add a brief explanation why the data is relevant. Data are for the years of 1800, 1900, 2000 and 2015 unless otherwise specified. I also rounded up most numbers because specially for 1800 and 1900 data is not really accurate.

**All data is world averages**

* Child mortality (death within 5 years old) - Long the ""evil"" of nature against life, Child mortality is a direct consequence on sanitation, preventive care, diagnostic medicine, immunization, inoculation, nutrition and several factors in life.

&gt; 1800 - 43% 

&gt; 1900 - 36%

&gt; 2000 - 5.5%

&gt; 2015 - 4.25%

* Life expectancy at birth - As with the above, shows progress on multiple factors of life leading to an increased life expectancy and often quality of life.

&gt; 1800 - 29

&gt; 1900 - 31

&gt; 2000 - 65

&gt; 2015 - 71

* Population - World population always stood pretty stable until we hit the 18th century, at which point progress on medicine and improvements on agriculture yield and sanitation allowed it to boom.

&gt; 1800 - 980mil

&gt; 1900 - ~1.65bi

&gt; 2000 - ~6bi

&gt; 2015 - ~7.1bi

* Top cause of death - Data on this is hard to come by, and I found only for 1900 and ""modern day"", if anyone can have a better source please provide. The relevance of this is to show that the cause of death changed from infectious diseases to age-related diseases. [According to a study, all causes together showed a decline of 64% between 1900 and 2010](http://demography.cpc.unc.edu/2014/06/16/mortality-and-cause-of-death-1900-v-2010/)
 
&gt; 1900 - 1 Respiratory (Pneumonia, Influenza, Tuberculosis - all infectious), 2 GI diseases (infectious), 3 Heart diseases

&gt; 2010 - 1 Cardiovascular (Heart + Stroke), 2 Cancer, 3 Respiratory

* Human Development Index (by Prados de la Escosura) - HDI is an average of multiple indexes on societal quality that usually focus on health, education and security. The index goes from 0 (terrible - non existing quality) to 1 (perfect society)

&gt; OECD countries:

&gt; 1900 - 0.25

&gt; 2000 - 0.74

&gt; 2007 - 0.82

&gt; Latin America (underdeveloped countries sample):

&gt; 1900 - 0.08

&gt; 2000 - 0.48

&gt; 2007 - 0.52

* Literacy  -  good index of how information is available and ease of spread, with a fast increase on late 20th century due to globalization.

&gt; 1800 - 12%

&gt; 1900 - 21%

&gt; 2000 - 82%

&gt; 2014 - 85%

* Internet Access - since we are talking about access to information, Internet Access is one of the best current measures, since before it we had to entrust libraries and written encyclopedias that usually were outdated.

&gt; 1997 - 2%

&gt; 2000 - 7%

&gt; 2015 - 40%

* Transatlantic vessel speeds - a merely machine calculation for passenger transportation between NY and London.

&gt; 1800 - 10km/h (estimated - steamships)

&gt; 1900 - 40km/h (cruise liners)

&gt; 1980 onwards - ~1200km/h (jet airliners at mach 0.81 at FL 40, this speed is ground level)

Note: The reason for no improved speed since 1980 is the sound barrier. It is still too **expensive** to build commercial airplanes that break sound speed, but it is technologically possible and it is getting cheaper and more available every year.

* Computers per capita - how economically available computing are for the general population

&gt; 1990 - 0.7%

&gt; 2000 - 31%

&gt; 2015 - 38%

* Technology - transistors per CI - Moore's Law disbelievers will get surprised by this but I am ""sorry"" to tell it is still holding. The reason for the perceived slow down is that *consumer* computers stopped being economically viable past a certain stage (circa 2010) but top level computers (the fastest computers, for instance) remain speeding up steadily.

&gt; 1971 - ~2.000

&gt; 2000 - ~300.000

&gt; 2015 - ~7.000.000 (moore law's confirmed holding up to 2016)

* Technology - Top storage capacity for consumer disks - also show how economically available the technology is, and it is actually holding a logarithmic scale that seems to be getting even faster

&gt; 1980 - 1Mb

&gt; 2000 - 10Gb

&gt; 2015 - 10Tb

* Human Genome Sequencing Time - this one is very interesting because require advances in chemistry, data acquisition and processing power, and the development is impressive.

&gt; 1994 - 10 years

&gt; 2010 - 4 days

&gt; 2016 - 26 hours

**In short - in all aspects, progress is steady, no slow down detected, and in some cases it is speeding up faster than predicted**",26,34

tl, dr:
70% of all jobs will be replaced by AIs.(And I might add that out of the remaining 30% of jobs, about 99% of them are jobs you or I don't want to do now.)

Thanks to all the space junk, power satellites can't be built in the low orbit.

If humans try to build them in the orbit higher than the lower one, too much radiation will prevent it.

So AI will have to be used. He is saying that AI is already directing deep underground mining machines.

The people in that doomsday blog drove him out (although he will return later as he has done many times in the past), but I agree with his premise that the biggest reason to reach AGI is to facilitate space conquest, which is mankind's biggest issue and something which has to be done before resources on earth run out.",18,6

It's not possible to have a labor market because the production would be automated so radicaly fast that people would not be able to adapt: a post-work society is needed for us to allow AI to be. 

How do we do it? I don't really care, but employment and the relation with income must me transformed, radically. But let's say someting about dates. According to the Law of Accelerating Returns, by the next decade we will have enough computational power to virtually do everything a brain with a body can do, even if it's not conscious nor ""alive"".

If you want something to last, it has to be built upon sound values. Those values are eternal; they are RELIGION! People have been thinking about this for as long as they have been around, and certain values have stood the test of time. Those that are not of value wither and die, and those that are, flourish. If we build an AI on unsound moral values, it will consume the earth, and hopefully end there. There is an argument that the reason we haven't been visited by aliens is because we have to abandon religion, and stand on our own two feet, so to speak. I see the reasoning, but I reject this idea. I believe any AI built on unsound moral values will end in disaster for its self and its creators. That is the true great filter, and it's coming fast. Perhaps we're in a simulation to find those values.

It is said that it's impossible to travel the speed of light ... but no.  Thats ridiculous.  Light travels the speed of light.  We've been sending information, data, around at the speed of light for decades.

Traveling across the stars won't involve giant colonies of humans on space ships...thats ludicrous, especially after the thought you'll read below! 

It'll be far easier for mankind to learn how to replicate a human body and mind using machinery and materials.  We would send a machine to a planet, and create clones of people by uploading schematics of human beings to the machine.

I think the idea of cloning is something that isn't talked about much in science fiction, although it is probably one of the more feasible scientific feats (even more so if you include transferring your mind to a machine).

Couple the aforementioned clone-o-matic machine with a way to manipulate particles, and you can turn 180 pounds of rock/dirt/air into a person, without the need to fly carbon-material with you.

The human race is now spreading itself around the universe with 1 single cloning machine, and a matter manipulator.  I'd recommend we start studying alchemy on an atomic level.  Changing water to wine, or lead to gold is great, but being able to change an H to a C would be a much grander, and more realistic goal.  (a REAL star trek replicator, right?)

What do you think?  Crazy? Or Crazy on to something?

We first tried to keep the market running by giving credit to consumers, specially by providing access to houses, cars and degrees etc. Then, we provided with more debt to private banks in order to keep wealth creation and GDP growth and also to avoid citizen's defaults (haha). We give free money to the states too, in order to avoid a social revolution, keeping social spending at a rational level. Finally, the ECB is giving free credit directly to companies. 

So, the States saved the banks in order to save citizens, then the Central Banks saved the states, then they saved the companies then... Then They'll have to save consumers directly.

I predict that deflation will be a thing in the years to come, I mean, serious deflation: but the states will not be able to provide a Basic Income to boost consumption and keep peace because they are tied to their debts and deficits. What's the next step then? A card given to everyone to spend money in a less work dependant economy, given by central banks by fiduciary money.

So, that's my prediction: before 2020 the Everything Bubbkle will explode, correlated with a decrease in labor income and labor offer leading to a brutal deflation. So, the states will fail to agree a debt relief due to geostrategic interests and Central Banks will have to take control of the situation by giving helicopter money.

Do you imagine to have a free Money Card with your photo and name and instead of reading ""Mastercard"" or ""Visa"" to read ""ECB"" or ""FED""? Sounds crazy, but that's my bet.

Thanks for reading :)

945,2017-5-9,2017,5,9,3,69zvp5,My local Walmart just opened an automated grocery pickup service. (Update),https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/69zvp5/my_local_walmart_just_opened_an_automated_grocery/,NazzerDawk,1494267535,"Here is the original post, to which this is an update:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/619hqw/my_local_walmart_just_opened_an_automated_grocery/


I finally got the chance to use the service again. I intended to make a video showing the experience, but unfortunately my allergies were making it a challenge today. Maybe next week, I certainly intend to use this service again. 

Anyway, I went to the pickup location again, and the process was much smoother. I entered an order claim number into the kiosk, it opened the doors again, and in three batches, it presented me with my groceries. 

A few things to note that are new in this occasion:

The baskets that your groceries are given to you in have vertical slots set into them that allow walls to be inserted between items, like eggs, that might by more fragile. This is a smart element, one that some of my friends asked about but that I didn't have an answer for last time I used the service. Also, none of the eggs were broken, which means that, based on my experience with eggs at most grocery stores, someone must have made some effort in selecting the eggs, probably swapping any broken ones with eggs from a donor carton. 

Frozen items are placed in the basket with a lid to help keep them frozen. While it seems like the building stays cold enough as-is, this added element is essential to make sure sensitive frozen items stay frozen during the hour or two that the order is in the building. 

Anyway, I really appreciate this service, since shopping with my daughter in tow can be troublesome, and this allows me to get groceries in a 30 minute window while she and my wife get a nap in. 


If this service expands (I bet it will, it's pretty badass tech for little old Oklahoma), you should all check it out and give it a try. It's totally worth the shot. 


P.S. Shout-out to the fellow I mentioned in the previous post, the project leader who helped load things into my car when my last order failed to complete. He mentioned that he saw my reddit post, and was a pretty cool guy. ",5,3

980,2017-5-9,2017,5,9,8,6a1xw6,Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors- The best energy solution for immediate climate goals &amp; inter-planetary societies of the future,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6a1xw6/liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactors_the_best_energy/,the_buddhaverse,1494287994,"After researching the pros, cons, and unknowns of 4th generation nuclear power technology and comparing it to advancements made in solar, wind and other ""renewables"", I have come to the conclusion that Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors deserve the next wave of interest and investment from the public and private sector for a few key reasons.

First, I must clarify that the R&amp;D into improved and efficient solar, wind &amp; renewable energy production is most definitely valuable and necessary to power the energy demands of the near/distant future while meeting crucial emissions reductions deadlines. However; the advent of emerging tech like robotic automation, AI, quantum computing, blockchain and more (along with 9 billion people on Earth in a few decades) will quickly &amp; significantly raise clean energy demands which I do not believe can be met with these renewables alone. Furthermore, as humans pursue a desire to explore and establish colonies the moon, Mars and deeper into space, the energy demands required to power these ventures simply cannot be met by these sources.

Enter Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors, and the evidence suggests that they are the safest and most efficient method of providing virtually limitless power from an abundant fuel, anywhere in the galaxy. Arguments against these reactors in my opinion boil down to a lack of research into its commercial viability (which can be overcome with a shift in education and political will), and the issue of molten salts being both highly corrosive and radioactive which in combination makes it more difficult to engineer a reliable design for long term functionality.

Beyond that, it appears that the virtues far outweigh the cons and current unknowns as compared to all other forms of energy production:

 Fuel burn-up is extraordinarily high. LFTRs could fission about 99% of their U-233 liquid fuel, compared to a few percent for solid fuel.

 It's easy to clean up. Solid fuels build up fission products, or new elements generated by the splitting of atoms, which poison fission reactions and often end up being treated as waste. Liquid fuels, meanwhile, can be processed ""online""  and the fission products continuously removed, refined, and sold.

 There's less waste and it's shorter-lived. For the above reasons, hundreds of times less radioactive waste is left over from LFTR operation compared to LWRs. And what remains requires burial for about 300 years, as opposed to 10,000 years.

 LFTRs operate under safe, normal pressure. All commercial reactors compress water coolant to extreme pressures  upwards of 150 times that found at Earth's surface. One small breach can lead to a catastrophic explosion. If a LFTR pipe breaks, however, molten salt will only spill on the ground and freeze.

 Environmental contamination is far less likely. LWRs can release gases, fuel, and fission products into the air and water. Molten salt freezes and traps most contaminants.

 LFTRs can be made small and modular. LWRs require giant, reinforced-concrete containment vessels that scale with their operating pressure. LFTRs require small containment structures, so they could be made small  possibly to a size that'd fit inside a semi-trailer.

 They should be much cheaper and faster to build. LFTRs don't require many of the expensive safeguards that LWRs do. Their potential to be modular could also lead to mass manufacture of parts and reduced cost.

 LFTR is immune to meltdowns. Molten salt that overheats will expand, slowing down fission.

 The design is ""walk-away safe."" No nuclear power plant today can claim this. LWRs require backup power systems to cool solid fuel at all times. If power is knocked out to a LFTR, a freeze plug melts and lets the molten salt fall into underground containment units, where it freezes and stops fission.

 Electricity output is better. LFTRs are so hot, operating at roughly 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit, they can use more advanced heat-to-electricity conversion technologies.

 The excess heat is very useful. It could boil and desalinate ocean water into drinking water, help generate hydrogen for fuel cells, break down organic waste into biofuels, and power industrial processes.

 The ""kindling"" to start a LFTR is flexible. Burning up old nuclear weapons material is possible, since fissile U-233, U-235, or Pu-239 can be used to start the reactor.

The list of benefits goes on, and until we put more research and investment into the technology while making it easier to navigate the regulatory landscape to do so, we won't ever discover its true potential. 

Now if we really are able to make solar power and battery storage technology amazingly efficient and cost-effective soon, that is absolutely great news and we should continue to pursue its research. However that is not to say that it should replace all other forms of energy production as solar does not work everywhere in the world, and is not nearly viable enough to support space travel, life on the moon and Mars. Solar research should not cannibalize advancements in LFTR tech, and our society will never be able to reach its full potential without it. Arguments against LFTR due to pricing need to take into account the subsidization of renewables and an entrenched regulatory framework that makes research into 4th gen nuclear costly, time consuming and far more arduous than its competitors. With a shift in understanding and political will, the energy production playing field will even out and speed up the time necessary to overcome our current engineering roadblocks to successful commercial-scale LFTR production. Just because solar is perceived to be ""ahead"" of LFTR's currently, it is not cause to abandon LFTR's altogether.

Therefore, LFTR energy production should be put at the forefront of solutions to our global energy crisis and plans to reduce emissions, along side solar/wind/other renewables, and not discarded due to fear and lack of understanding. Not only does rapid investment into the technology while phasing out LWR's of the last century greatly supplement energy production while dramatically reducing carbon emissions in conjunction with renewables, but it brings us that much closer to becoming and interplanetary species capable of deep space travel. Thanks for reading and please share your thoughts on a cooperative energy future utilizing all that next-gen tech provides for us.",7,6

So I've been playing around with the numbers, comparing Mother Jones' famous gif/video to a list of the world's fastest supercomputers. 

The two line up almost perfectly until the late 1990s...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRG8eq7miUE

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_supercomputing#Historical_TOP500_table

Then something strange happens. This video, detailing the progress of Moore's Law *falls behind what has actually happened!*

It happens with the 1997 data point. The video says that the fastest supercomputer should've ran at around 500 gigaFLOPS. In fact, we achieved teraFLOP computing in 1997. While it says we'd have a 2 teraFLOPS supercomputer in 2000, we actually had a 7 teraFLOPS supercomputer. So we were about 2x as faster than predicted, and then a bit over 3x. That's pretty incredible, but surely we must've slowed down by now.

NOPE!

In 2009, we should have had a 141 teraFLOPS supercomputer. We actually had a 1.7 ***peta***FLOPS supercomputer. It increased to a 12x difference!

It isn't even funny how distant it is now. We should have a 2.25 petaFLOPS supercomputer at the present. Instead, we're at 93 petaFLOPS. So we're closing in on a 41x difference.

It's not until 2018 that a ""slowdown"" appears we're 22x ahead instead. And that's considering we reach 200 petaFLOPS, which is the expected increase.

I'm not entirely certain we'll remain there, but we'll see. But the point is: supercomputers are progressing faster than Moore's Law should allow them. Yes, that's despite the 3-year Tianhe-2 stagnation. If anything, that was a period of time meant for Moore's Law to *catch up* to real-life progress. 

Regular computers, on the other hand, have long since stopped progressing at a Moore's Law pace. The economic benefits are no longer there to keep things moving at a traditional pace PCs typically don't have the necessary coolants to handle anything above 4 GHz, and consumers have moved en masse to smartphones (which are seeing Moore's Law-esque growth). Only gamers and professionals really use desktops in any large number anymore, but there's simply not enough of them to continue pursuing such extreme growth. Smartphones will pick up the slack, and supercomputers will keep up the Law until further notice.(don't tell PCMasterRace!).

It's almost like the difference between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. We don't know where all the middling black holes went, but I'd imagine it's a similar phenomenon at work.


It should be noted that this is using the popular definition of Moore's Law, not the *dictionary* definition. If we went by the dictionary definition (doubling the number of transistors every 2 years/18 months), Moore's Law died out years ago. So that raises a bit of an interesting scenario where we're still reaping the benefits of Moore's Law despite the fact the Law has broken down. The cause is gone; the effect is still there. We've simply changed the cause.

**TL;DR**: Several years ago, Mother Jones put out an article that contained a now famous infogif. Said infogif showed how the necessary computer power to match the brain was equivalent to the number of fluid ounces needed to fill Lake Michigan. They used Moore's Law to plot out the progression of computing power. We followed said infogif almost perfectly up until 1997, at which point we sped past it at an exponential rate, peaking at a 41x difference where we are and where Moore's Law says we should be. [We in 2017 are currently near where we should be in 2024](http://i.imgur.com/CFHYBVo.gifv).",11,12

That being said, the potential for this technology would be incredible, as we would have the potential to ""learn kung fu"" in the matter of minutes...or be able to apply that to just about all knowledge of our current world (though we probably would be limited by the storage space in our minds eventually).

Of course, the dangers of such a technology would be just as great as the benefits, as malware and unauthorized access would become a real threat to human existence.

Overall, it seems like it would play out much like the plot to Deus Ex: Human Revolution, if anybody has played the title. Thoughts?

It is a robotics falling into a category between animate blobs that spawn by being wholely divided, and the androids with wires as much as blood vessels in man, a central processing unit for a brain. There in the category between is the robot with semi- and autonomous parts; they process some signals for commands autonomously, they receive power independently and from a readily available source that is nonconstraining - and possibly of a minimal burden. Androgynous traits are in our mathematical concept of counting. The natural numbers are the single expansion of singleness, much like the self of others' is the expansion of the self of one's own. The future robot, however, may well transcend this singleness of the unit - much as it appears to be doing in actual technology, with computers and phones connected by the internet. It is possible the meaning of self and identity can be fractured by the manifestation of this multiplicity in the units of devices.",3,2

But it's not, it's an entirely new species that's being developed from scratch, using mechanics and electricity rather than biology.

A good example of this concept is the video of AI learning to do things by itself, through trial and error. That's how humans learn most of their skills, and now AI is doing the same.

Be it video games: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44

Or moving around without hitting stuff: https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/crashing-drones-teach-fly-better/

The difference is that AI can learn way faster, because

- it can practice 24/7

- it can share its learned knowledge with other AI

- it can learn in both the virtual (a simulator if you will, but one that can operate at increased speed, allowing an AI to play a million games of Go per second for example) and the real world

This allows it to evolve at a much greater speed than any biological species. For example it did in just a few decades what took us millions of years. It went from being just a few gears to being able to drive a car in traffic.

Essentially 50 years ago it was just a cell, 30 years ago it was plankton, 10 years ago it was a fish. Today it's starting to reach insect level of capabilities, soon it'll reach mammal levels, and humans aren't much beyond that.",18,17

So that sick and elderly people are helped in time.-------------------------------------------------------- 3) Each passenger can be given health monitoring band or ring that monitors their pressure ,heartbeat, skin resistance ,stress level to know health of the passengers due to a)length of journey, b)stress of journey and effect of food intake and stress of journey on their health.so railway can tweak journey experience for passengers better.--------------------------------4)Before giving health monitoring device to passengers their iris scan info is taken. and when passengers look through window of train monitoring device in window registers who is looking through a window in train (by matching iris scan data already stored in database)and notifies health monitoring ring or band that passenger has and that monitoring device inturn records effect of outside view on passengers mental and physical health so railway knows the interest of passengers and effect on passengers related to the region that the rain is passing through..so next time AUGMENTED reality glasses can be offered to passengers in exchange for a reasonable charge so that passengers can view outside scenery with digital effect and enhancement.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----5) Lots of accident proof airbags(like that exist in accident proof car for passengers safety),that is to be inflated at accident time to cushion passengers from collision at accident time,should be placed inside all paces inside railway bogie. thermal imaging will detect the location of each passengers inside bogie during accident time and inflate the air bags near passengers at accident time in split second within accident to cushion passengers against collision with the help of central processor, so this way all bags inside bogie are not inflated only those required are inflated. This will help in rescue operation later.-------------------------------------------------- 6) A mobile app can be offered to passengers by railway company which not only contains vital information about railway but will also have social interaction platform through which any passenger inside the train knows which person of what background, interest and age is at which place inside the train they are riding. Then they can send their interest each other through the app and if both like each other they can meet inside train for chatting, exchanging thoughts.",5,1
1622,2017-5-14,2017,5,14,17,6b2vj4,What if the future isn't the consensus one that now dominates /r/Futurology?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6b2vj4/what_if_the_future_isnt_the_consensus_one_that/,OliverSparrow,1494749207,"What if the future isn't the consensus one?

Reddit Futurology has a strongly stated consensus future. In general, this future applies only to the US, but it is also airbrushed onto the rest of the world, usually without further consideration. It is a  future that is driven exclusively technology , with three chief elements. First, advances in IT. These have one effect, to destroy jobs. Second, the universal and unstoppable use of renewable energy. Third,  transportation which is to be based on electrical vehicles. This is garnished by redistributive schemes and by a ubiquitous Musk. 

You have to ask two questions about this. Is it a sufficient description of the future, and is it right? Let's take those in order. 

*Is it sufficient?*

The US now generates a third of global output, the industrial countries about half of it. By 2040, the industrial world will fall to a quarter and the US to perhaps an eighth. US or OECD preoccupations will not then set the global agenda. So what is it that will do so?

First, there will be about 3 bn members of the global middle class. These will be  the producers, consumers and opinion-formers, and two thirds of them - at least - will live in the emerging economies. They will be the product of at least three generations of urbanites, accustomed to crowded concrete environments. They are keen to distance themselves from the masses, whom they encounter as servants and through plate glass. The urban proletariat of these nations may well be entering a phase of organised labour, and these two groups will be in bitter political conflict. A large pool of low-skilled, rural workers nevertheless undermine organised labour's attempt to raise wages. Nationalism is used to counter internationalist labour movements, and inter-country warfare is far from rare. 

Against this background, the old rich world has about 1.2bn citizens, of which at most three quarters (800 million) are of working age. More probable figures for the rich-world engaged work force are around 600 million, or a number equivalent to half of the rest of the world's graduates. These countries are under economic siege from emerging country commerce, from its new and efficient infrastructure and from its formidable technology. Its few responses that it has are encoded in adult education, is automation and innovation. It is utterly dependent for its prosperity on its high-skilled elite. How large a proportion of its population that elite can be depends on whether automation is used to raise skills or to replace them, and how much effort goes into improving the education level. However, we do not know the limits to human education, the ties that this has to natural ability, whether than natural ability can be expanded and in general, how ""upgradeable"" a population can be.

So no, this is not a sufficient description of the future, or even a glimpse of its most important points.  We do not yet know what we will learn about what it is to be aware, to be a human, to be individual, what this will tell us about deep religious and moral concerns. Ethereal  though this may sound, blood is spilled and wars fought over far, far less. 

Details: 

Energy. Renewables, cried to the skies on the subReddit, are currently less than 1% of commercial primary energy. There is an article that should be read by all enthusiasts, [here](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/05/wind-turbines-are-neither-clean-nor-green-and-they-provide-zero-global-energy/). The future of energy for the forseeable future is natural gas. If that is so - and domestic heating requirements make it almost certain in the higher latitudes - then the need to deliver everything in the form of electricity goes away. Electrical vehicles may have a social role to play in reducing urban pollution but they offer virtually no consumer advantages. 

Space: an interesting theatre for science, but utterly irrelevant to the politics or economic development of the next thirty years. 

Role of the low skilled in the developed countries. Bleak, becoming bleaker as they compete with the mass of elderly needing health care and support. States already transfer up to a third of gross product as social transfers. (The US is anomalously low, at a fifth.) States have three options: to continue to provide a now-dwindling stream of subsidies-in-idleness, to pay people to undertake socially useful but non-monetised work (workfare) or to wall off those unable to make a contribution, much as China keeps its low skill population in the countryside. None of those options are compatible with a democracy that allows populists to enter debate, and the mechanics of democracy are likely to alter considerably. 
 
*Is it right?*

First, the core preoccupation: will automation destroy jobs at a greater rate than new ones are created? Despite relatively fast rates of destruction of jobs throughout the Twentieth century,  this has not occurred. Current statistics do not show a leap in productivity: rather the reverse. In general, jobs demand higher skills than was once the case, but the universal lesson is that automation and technology augments jobs, which is to say that people doing work do more complex and useful things as a result of technology, but they are not replaced by it. 

There are two ""takes"" on this, the string and the rubber band. In the string model, the capacity of the entire population rises. Positive signs are, for example, the Flynn effect, whereby IQs have risen on average by 30 points since 1925. That is, the average today would have been seen as ""gifted"" in 1925. By contrast, the rubber band has the lower ranges of the society fixed, whilst the higher reaches are upwardly mobile. Hauling up increases the abilities only of the elite. Evidence of this is the growing income disparities in virtually every nation on Earth. Whichever of these is true, governments have no option but to haul upward, and populations no option but to try to raise their individual capabilities. 

Second, the obsession with renewable energy. The link that I have provided points up the tiny fraction of primary energy that is supplied by renewables. Even in countries that have put effort into this - the US, for example, the largest renewable supplies remain hydro and biomass, [as this figure shows](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/8e/cc/ef/8eccefd329d33ffe398fbbdabe24c890.png). Solar and wind are essentially negligible, at 2.3%. (2.2 out of 97.2 quads in 2015). This may grow, but it is not going to replace the 97.8% of other energy sources any time soon. We need a new energy source, but I suspect that these are not it. Solar, in particular, is so far down its cost curve that room for further improvement will await technology breakthroughs that will take decades to commercialise. 

So, perhaps I'm a depressing fool who has entirely missed to point. Maybe. But to those of you who subscribe to this model, recall that Pollyanna ended up a paraplegic with delusions of saintliness.

As we reach faster and faster to the Singularity, the views of those with means towards the less fortunate, the less wealthy, and the less intelligent are getting cold and hostile every day.

Today's capitalized society is inimical, merciless, and leaves no room for the unfortunate, the downtrodden, and the ones who can't make their own living or can't afford to live in a more expensive society where the fruits of economic growth are monopolized by those at the top.

The winner's today's society, who will be the winners of the future and will join the new civilization, do not have any mercy, heart, time and money to waste on the less fortunate. They only care about their increasing net worth and new tech.

Old historians might remember that the entire Fifth Avenue was the street of huge mansions, where centi-millionaires (worth maybe $50 bil+ in today's money) held expensive parties , more than an entire working class neighborhood's entire income, virtually every day.

We are going back to these days. Sorry.

As singularity is around the corner, the view that the poor, the less intelligent, the less lucky, etc are different species from the winners of future will be more and more prevalent, and will become mainstream.

That means laws which will apply to the 'citizens' will not apply to the 90-98% of 'helots', who own very little property. 

It will once again be OK to bring one's children to stroll at nighttime, and loiter outdoors for the night, without having to worry about crime as the crime-prone people and panhandlers are mercilessly thrown outside from the city boundaries to places no same person will go to and care to learn about.

The City of Future will be very technical, with most needs taken care of by automation for those who can afford it. Human jobs will be done by the more skilled of the 'helots', who will be housed far away from the city border, and bused for 4 hours each days from their shantytowns to the City with something like the device from Escape from New York installed so if they try to do something rash to the citizens a microdevice will explode, severing their aortas immediately.

(Elsewhere I wrote that the nanny who let Eric Clapton's son fall to die should have been executed. No one recorded what happened to her, but in the future world she would envy the dead as the dead child's family would reserve the right to do what they please to her)

No homeless, no criminals, no miscreants. Citizens having unlimited rights to deal with them any way they feel like it. 

Such will be the future which will separate the winners and losers once for all. Unbelievable horrors and unbelievable sufferings for 7 billion + humans who won't be part of the future. 

However, the city people, rich, inimical, and smart, will have no time to hear their story, since they know these people are destined for extinction by Social Darwinism.",0,0

Furthermore, I could see the benefit of somehow providing all humans with something along the lines of a Universal Basic Income. 

The problem I see is that in most scenarios I have read of, government bodies would be in control of virtually all aspects of such a Universal Basic Income. This would give them even more power and control over the people, the economy, and potential dissenters. As a libertarian leaning person (on many matters at least), I fear the idea of the government getting control and having responsibility over yet another massive program. Not only do I question the very concept of the government having the right to be involved in such a redistribution of wealth, I fear the potential abuse. 

What's really more appealing to me would be a massive revitalization of the economy and an emergence of many new industries (perhaps the construction of sea steading nation states, colonies in space, or anti-aging clinics) that could increase the buying power of every dollar a person earns. The simple truth is that someone who flips burgers at McDonalds today, working the same forty hours a week (if they can manage to find a full time position) only has perhaps one forth of the BUYING POWER as their grandmother or grandfather that worked the same job forty or fifty years ago. What the average person makes on a starting income isn't enough to survive on. Many of my ""conservative"" friends don't understand this. They complain that people shouldn't ""make a career"" off working fastfood. I try to tell them that fifty years ago someone working full time at a restaurant had significantly more buying power than someone doing the same job today and COULD AFFORD A MODEST LIVING. They also try to mock the protesters who are attempting to get paid $15 an hour for fast food work. I tell them in response that even at $15 dollars an hour they wouldn't have the same buying power as their grandparents. My friends don't deny this, because they know it is the true, but they don't address the issue.

So in my futuristic dream world, I'd like to see the dollar have MUCH more buying power than it does today. Perhaps so much buying power that a starting part-time job could allow someone a comfortable (yet not glamorous) lifestyle. If this isn't possible, however, then I can understand the need for some type of UBI. However, with a government that's already corrupt and out of control (Republicans and Democrats BOTH seek to control us economically and socially in too many ways), I fear giving politicians or government agencies ANY MORE POWER. 

Could the UBI be distributed by a fund composed of voluntary donations from wealthy individuals, companies, and corporations who recognize the disparity between the top 1% and the bottom 99%? 

Could the UBI be simply composed of FREE GOODS AND SERVICES somehow donated by corporations and businesses, perhaps as an incentive to attract further business (the purchase of more premium goods and services)? 

I'm willing to consider all sorts of ideas -- as long as the government doesn't get to be involved in any way, shape, or form. ",29,1

Id like to debunk this idea and give everyone a crash course in AI: the technology that drives Tesla. 

First off, its a neural network. Theres a fundamental difference between the two. AI is a general form of Machine Learning (teaching the computer to do something) that is task oriented such as a bot in a game. In other words, the bot finds a path, avoids objects, and attempts to attack a player. Conversely, a neural network adjusts its behavior based on a set of information known as the training model. 

How is a training model built though? Its actually pretty simple, okay thats a lie. A very high level explanation is that a developer provides a series of fields that the neural network. Using these fields and setting various options about how the neural network interprets data a prediction is made based on given values. 


As for this blackbox concept, it is RIDICULOUS. Ill break this down into 2 explanations.

1.) Its just math and probabilities, seriously, thats it.

2.) Its linear algebra, differential equations and complex statistical models. It is gradient descent. So by the logic of these articles saying Neural Networks are a black box I guess a TI calculator operates like one as well.

Once you have this not only can you view how it responds to test data but graph it's response over time to view its accuracy. So this idea that it changes its response every time and that it could make erratic predictions is nonsense. So long as the trained model remains the same the prediction will as well assuming as data is identical.

I hope this demystifies some of the claims about how a Tesla operates autonomously. If youre interested in knowing more about this stuff just look for classes in Python and Tensorflow. Or for a mathematical explanation there are some great articles like http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.161.3556&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf but this is a very technical paper. 

For those already familiar with these concepts I was discussing primarily unsupervised learning as that is what Tesla likely uses.

This government would not own any land, instead only its occupants would own the space around them up to a certain radius depending on status.

Smartphones make this possible.

So a citizen of average status might have a 100 meter radius of space ownership around their person at all times. A person of greater status, who has not more money, but more experience, knowledge, accomplishments, or wisdom can potentially have a 1 or 2 kilometer radius of space ownership. 

If you don't have a cellphone on you, you can't track where your land is. So the whole concept relies upon GPS locating your person to allocate the land that belongs to you.

This would allow users to overcome laws based on land ownership - their personal laws over-ride laws of the land, as the virtual micro-nation is at the highest layer of legal enforcement.

So for instance if I declare in my micro-nation that marijuana is legal for recreational use, but John Smith doesn't and he enters my radius territory, the laws conflict and a notice will pop up on John Smiths phone. As long as he has the phone on his person, he will be violating the laws of my micro-nation. 

Could an app be set up this way and how would the US government stop something like that? If in the terms and conditions declaration from the United States is declared, and all cloud servers are hosting the App from a non-US location, or even a distributed server which is fragmented to servers across the globe, what could they do? Any user of the app would be a citizen of a country which exists not on physical land, but of the physical space of their person, hundreds of thousands of which all have independence.",10,8

Eventually, all of the world will be owned by techno-giants, who will make their own laws and exclude the masses who are doomed for lifetime misery, if they are lucky. (The unlucky ones will end up like the Seminoles in Andrew Jackson's march.)

Tesla's factory works like the factory of the future,

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/18/tesla-workers-factory-conditions-elon-musk

as expected. 

Life will suck for those who will be working in the techno-darlings' factories, just like it sucked for the factory workers of the 19th century.

Why? There is no need to treat the workers well. They are well-monitored by cameras everywhere, and if they are not efficient they can easily be replaced by others who are going to get increasingly desperate for jobs, since  there will be no opportunities. No new business possible, since everything is already owned by the elites and no permits will be given, plus they can't compete with already established system and are dependent upon distribution networks who can name their prices.

Three guys, John D. Rockefeller (North America), Calouste Gulbenkian (Middle East), and Robert Nobel (Russia (although born in Sweden) - he was the older brother of the Nobel Prize founder, and probably 100 times richer), controlled all of the world's oil until 1918, when the Russian Revolution and the collapse of Turkey ended the power of the later two.

We are going back to such world - about 10 - 20 tech moguls controlling everything in life, and the rest of the world (except some lucky people who invested lots of money on them beforehand) living like, well, tenementers.

That helps the Singularity since more and more money and resources can be poured into such projects, and governments will put priority on future projects before social programs.

It is an evolutionary processes - the world will enter Civilization 2.0, although the masses, who won't be part of it, won't benefit from it.",21,10

[Orions Arm Technology Timeline](http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/486e75a54a1ae)




2000 c.e - Human Genome sequenced.

2003 c.e - Chinese launch their first manned rocket, the Shenzhou V, and becomes the third Earth polity to put a man in space.

2007 c.e - Dawn solar powered ion drive space probe is launched by NASA to study Vesta and Ceres.

2011 c.e - Dawn spacecraft enters orbit around Vesta and begins a 14-month survey mission.

2015 c.e - Dawn spacecraft enters orbit around Ceres.

2020 c.e - Primitive neuro-technological interfacing increasingly available for non-medical purposes. Consists primarily of non-invasive, wearable technology. Limitations in the technology keep it niche but garners much interest and funding. 

2025 c.e - Neuroscience makes headway into simulating complex neural networks from animals. At the same time AI science improves allowing for more sophisticated smartware. Both fields still need many decades of development before they can produce fully digital intelligence. 

2028 c.e - First meso/microscale robots commercially available; nanoscale component manufacture in widespread use.

2028 c.e - Regenerative medicine products increasingly play a role in healthcare. Routine replacement of some organs possible.

2029 c.e - Ruth Duorkin demonstrates the most sophisticated mobile life support systems yet seen; is remembered by later generations as first successful cyborg.

2029 c.e - Multiple tele-operated robots (tele-nauts) of various designs deployed on International Space Station and in orbit in several capacities. Use of teleoperation greatly reduces costs and increases the scale and range of missions that can be ""safely"" undertaken.

2032 c.e - First minor optional human genome tweak improvements available. The techniques are widely controversial and heavily regulated (even banned) in most nations. Whilst certain improvements in health are possible, many tweaks, selected by correlation to desired traits, have little to no effect. In addition, the risk of miscarriages or cancer through genetic damage remains low but significant. Despite the downsides, ""black clinics"" (often employing questionable quality control procedures) flourish in some parts of the world, offering illegal embryonic enhancements. 

2032 c.e - Orbital Internet created to allow high bandwidth, high reliability communication between and among the surface and orbital installations and craft. In particular the Net allows greatly expanded use of telepresence systems in space.

2033 c.e - Autonomous cars represent a significant percentage of car ownership. Some nations introduce policies favouring them over manual cars.

2035 c.e - Self-contained autonomous robot systems (homebots) with generalist capabilities available commercially.

2035 c.e - Orbital Internet expanded to the moon using a series of satellites in Lunar orbit and receiver/repeaters landed around location of first planned installation. Teleoperated robots and fully autonomous robots (with limited functions) begin lunar development.

2037 c.e - First Mars mission - Discovery and Endeavor launched for Mars - arrive in 2038. Teleoperated robots play a role in exploring various areas of the planet and are used exclusively to explore both moons. After initial mission, exploration beyond the Moon reverts to unmanned probes for another 25 years.

2038 c.e - First ""permanent"" tele-naut operated base begins construction on the Moon. Base is entirely designed to be operated by telepresence and has no accommodations for biont inhabitants or visitors.

2040 c.e - AI science achieves semi-sentient algorithms. Whilst not yet sophont or capable of human equivalent general intelligence these programs were capable of impressive feats in specific fields. Increasingly human labour was replaced with cheap SSAs that required only a few humans to supervise, troubleshoot and input specific parameters for work. Coupled with a natural language interface SSAs could even appear human, albeit with noticeable social deficiencies and lack of creativity.

2040 c.e. - First ""permanent"" tele-naut operated base begins construction on the Moon. Base is entirely designed to be operated by telepresence and has no accommodations for biont inhabitants or visitors. - Precooled air breathing rocket engines allow for the first trans-oceanic hypersonic airliners as well as reusable SSTO vehicles. Initial costs are high but dramatically decrease the launch costs to space. 

2043 - A room temperature superconductor is discovered on an orbital research platform. The new material is comparatively simple to make, but requires free-fall conditions to synthesize. Interest in space development increases markedly.

2047 - First mass driver built on the Moon using tele-naut construction crews. Used as a proof-of-concept of the technology and to launch both raw materials and eventually finished goods to several locations in the Earth-Moon volume as the drive to make space development self-sustaining continues.

2048 - Personal transport market dominated by autonomous cars. Most nations have regulations prohibiting the use of manual cars in many cases.

2049 - A method of cheaply mass-producing woven carbon nanotubes in free-fall conditions is invented. The resulting lines, tapes, and cables can be produced in lengths limited only by the tensile strength of the material itself.

2050s - Energy becomes the most important concern on Earth, as fossil fuels are becoming exorbitantly expensive. All through this century wars are fought over the dwindling fossil fuel supplies. Fission reactors are the most important source of energy in many countries, particularly fast breeders using uranium and thorium, but renewable sources of energy including mass produced photovoltaics, solar furnaces, and wind power are increasingly prevalent elsewhere. Hydrogen and biofuels are manufactured widely to replace expensive oil. The fusion program finally starts to produce commercial power in the late 2050s. Despite burgeoning energy costs the success of the new tele-naut dominated space missions fuels interest in space exploration. Developments in propulsion technology and robotic manufacturing allow for even cheaper space access. 

2051 - First inter-city Vac-train system developed in China with plans to extend through Asia to Europe and Africa as part of the Silk Road Development program.

2053 - First magbeam projectors built in Earth orbit and on Luna. Each projector uses a large solar array and superconducting storage rings to produce the 82MW of energy needed to accelerate a 10 tonne transport craft on a tenth-gravity continuous boost trip to or from the Moon. 

2055 - First High Energy Laser Launch systems deployed to boost cargo into LEO. Later designs employ a combination of magnetic acceleration and laser launch to boost crewed modules into orbit.

2057 - First commercial fusion reactor (a D-T inertial confinement design) comes online in France, supplying 300MW of power to the European grid. 

2058 - Automated expedition sent to Mars on low energy transit to deliver a mag-beam system to planetary orbit to service the second Mars expedition.

2059 - A coalition of several major corporations and investors launches an automated probe to intercept a small near-Earth orbiting asteroid, mine it, and return the results to Lunar orbit. Built as a proof-of-concept mission, the probe returns 100kg of asteroid material where it is picked up and delivered to labs in geosynchronous orbit. 

2060 - First human equivalent artificial intelligence (AI) developed on distributed supercomputer clusters. For a while classification as human equivalent was doubtful as the AI were quite toposophically different from baselines, this hindered effective communication. 

2061 - First ""permanent"" Lunar Base expanded to accommodate bionts. In practice, consists of a small cluster of habitat modules that are occupied for 1-3 months at a time several times per year. Operations using tele-nauts, evetntually including some operated entirely by AIs back on Earth, as well as purely robotic labor, continue year round.

2061 - First orbital bolo satellite deployed to boost cargo and passengers from Low Earth Orbit to Geo-synchronous Orbit. Lost orbital momentum is made up using an electrodynamic tether system. 

2064 - Direct Neural Interfacing cranial nerve implants commercially available. Costs are high for both the interface and the surgical implantation, in addition some models are shown to cause neurodegenerative diseases after years of use. Nevertheless for those that can afford it these early DNIs offer a significant boost to personal capability. 

2064 - Second Mars expedition, this time using mag-beam boosting systems to reduce trip time to 90 days each direction. A crew of 50 makes the journey to the red planet. The first Mars base is established, with 10 members of the expedition staying behind to begin exploration and research until the next transport vessel arrives to relieve them and rotate in the next crew of 25 explorers.

2065 - First GEO bolo satellite deployed to both catch incoming modules from the LEO bolos and to launch payloads toward the Moon and beyond.

2072 - After twelve years of exhaustive experimentation with AI and human intelligence augmentation the first AI with superior intelligence in all areas is created and quickly dubs itself superturing. Temporarily, fears of AI are heightened but as the nascent superturings are shown to not think in radically different ways to humans, as well as the increase in technological development from superturing holding institutes, these fears abate for now.

2074 - Smartswarm, a variant of smartdust with destructive capabilities, is an early non-replicating form of military nanotech. Military robots have now replaced 90% of soldiers worldwide.

2076 - Project Thistledown uses the magbeam system on Luna to launch long duration probes to Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Using a combination of hybrid magnetic-solar sails and onboard fuel to maneuver and decelerate, the probes deploy a variety of orbiters, landers, and balloon-based flyers on arrival. While the exact mix of secondary craft varies with the destination, a common chassis is used for all probes. The various landers and flyers have limited lifetimes generally ranging from 3-5 years. However, the main orbiting platforms have operational lifetimes of 20 years or more and provide an ongoing observational capability for much of the solar system.

2080 - Heaven habitat constructed in geo-synchronous orbit by an international coalition of nations and businesses using tele-naut technology. Used as a combination hotel, resort, research complex and light manufacturing facility as it develops over time. Becomes effectively the first extra-terrestrial colony with an eventual permanent population of 500. 

2080 - Chinese Gobi colonisation project begins with the dual aim of transforming the desert into habitable land and developing a model for self-sustaining high tech extraterrestrial colonies. The project continued for many decades and in combination with international sister projects in the Antarctic, Atacama and Pacific spearheaded CELSS technology and colonial economic management.

2081 - Automated mining of half a dozen Near-Earth asteroids begins delivering commercial quantities of material to the Earth-Luna volume. Most is used in space-based manufacture, but some particularly valuable rare-Earth elements are shipped back to Earth-surface for various applications.

2084 - Human intelligence augmentation shareware becomes available, principally memory and concentration boosters. Initially dangerous to mental health the establishment of reputable regulation bodies and strict testing protocols fosters greater safety and consumer confidence. While costs for DNI installation have fallen they remain prohibitive prompting fears of a wealth-induced intelligence gap. Various governments and businesses look to subsidise installation for their citizens and consumers.

2086 - First Lunar ""City"" (Artemis), population 200. Primarily consists of researchers and workers performing tasks considered too delicate or real-time dependent to use tele-presence technology operating from Earth. Much of the population's work consists of supervising robots or operating tele-presence tech distributed across the Lunar surface. The remainder of the population consists of support personnel of various sorts. 

2099 - First crewed fusion drive spacecraft using a D-T z-pinch design. Transit times to Mars are greatly reduced, and expeditions to the Outer System begin to be discussed as .01g brachistochrone (continuous boost) flight profiles become possible. However, the majority of traffic, and especially cargo, continues to use mag-beam propulsion.

2100-2120 - Several key breakthroughs in genetic research occur. Comprehensive models of phenotype expression from genotypes are developed allowing for the physical consequences of genetic engineering to be accurately modeled. Synthetic intracellular delivery systems allow for precise and safe insertion of novel DNA into somatic cells, continual doses can alter the DNA of every cell over time. An international framework of regulation along with effective business models incentivise the development of reversible somatic tweaks, eliminating early-adopter concerns. Taken together these began to enable a vast diversity of morphological experimentation and freedom, and heteromorphic phenotyping (""exotics"") becomes popular with transhumanists and biopunk groups and individuals. However social and cultural resistance remains strong, especially amongst those who have no wish to augment themselves but risk being pushed out of the dwindling job market by enhanced humans. ",1,7

2268,2017-5-20,2017,5,20,5,6c62o4,"Implications of Elon Musk's ""ideal factory.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6c62o4/implications_of_elon_musks_ideal_factory/,KubrickIsMyCopilot,1495224249,"For those who are not familiar, Tesla is building a battery factory in Nevada that upon completion will be the largest building in the world by footprint.  Its appropriately wide-eyed name is ""Gigafactory 1"" - the ""giga"" referring to its intended multi-gigawatt output, and the 1 promising that it is just the first of many.  As of today, said factory is about 1/3 complete and already in active production.

But the factory itself is not the most interesting thing about it: Rather, it's the idea behind it that is generating shockwaves among futurists.  In multiple tweets and guest interviews, Elon Musk has discussed the general concept of a factory not as it has been - an expensive sequence of Frankenstein contraptions cobbled together impatiently and then ignored once they operate *adequately* - but as a product in itself that can be integrated and honed toward the utmost limits of physics.

This thought was the origin of Gigafactory 1.  It is Musk's pilot experiment toward an automated *general manufacturing* facility; something so efficient, so tightly interwoven, and operating at such blinding speed compared to today's factories that (in the very long-term) analogies to a **chemical reaction** become conceivable.  Such a thing would be so exotic compared to the human-centric factory that Musk has said its interior would look like an ""alien dreadnought.""

Such a dizzying concept seems like the product of a very active imagination, but in fact arises from the simplest of origins: Musk has a philosophy of starting and ending with the basic laws of physics.  Mass.  Volume.  Speed.  Energy.  Time.  Unit output per unit volume per unit time.  Everything between input and output is just details that can be computed and focused toward the optimum.

It sounds so simple that it immediately raises the question of why it isn't already a universal standard.  The answer is equally simple, and depressing: Big Business in general does not operate on the principle that it exists to make things, but rather to increase the market value of its stock in the quickest and most convenient ways possible (even if this sacrifices long-term potential).  

That has led to all sorts of short-sighted decisions that *hamper* innovation rather than improving it - particularly widely-distributed, outsourced supply chains where accountability is impractical, it takes forever to propagate ideas, and any link in the chain can sabotage change for its own interests.  

As a result of such outsourcing excesses, the very first principle of Musk's ideal factory is not a new concept, but rather an old one that had been abandoned in the modern corporate environment: Vertical integration.  The more steps in the process you can include inside the black box between input and output, the bigger the value that can be added by optimization.

However, privately-held Big Business is aware of and practices vertical integration, yet has failed to produce such Ideal Factories (IFs).  This is because businessmen as a general culture are by and large believers in profit-maximization ideology, and view production solely as a means to profit rather than profit as a means to production.  So their innovations are usually aimed to create merely *relative* advantage over competitors - just enough to leverage market share - rather than **maximum absolute progress** that exerts a pressure on civilization overall.

Those are the two epiphanies represented by the IF concept:

* Vertical integration can maximize the speed and potency of technological advancement and cost reduction.

* That potential only occurs if the optimization principle of the vertically integrated process *is* technological advancement and cost reduction, rather than profit maximization.  Profits will occur as a helpful side-effect that accelerates the process, but are not the central objective.  

Now let's imagine that this Ideal Factory experiment succeeds (knock on wood), and the world gradually becomes covered in these ""alien dreadnought"" factories churning out pretty much everything we want or can imagine at blinding speed and absurdly low cost.  Let's ignore / sidestep the social implications and the measures that will be necessary to ensure an equitable distribution of the benefits, and instead just focus on the next *technological* step from there.

Once you have an optimized black box, the natural next step is always **expand the box**.  So first you have an Ideal Factory into which raw materials are fed and out of which an end-product is spat like a machine gun (Musk has stated this rate of production as a literal goal - the rate of fire of a machine gun).  Factories that make different things will have a lot of commonalities, so then naturally you back-branch them together and now you have multi-output Ideal Factories.

At some point, a single IF complex turns out such a large spread of what people consume that you begin to approach a new quantum level of manufacturing: Not just an Ideal Factory, but a **General Factory** (GF).  This is a factory that makes more or less *anything*, as efficiently as physically possible (or at least as close as practical reality permits).

As massive as an IF seems today - Gigafactory 1 will probably seem tiny compared to more evolved iterations - we can expect that a General Factory would be even more profound.  In fact, we can see the shape of the level *after* the GF in its own likely immense dimensions: Since it would occupy such a tremendous volume of resources and employment (despite the effects of automation on labor), the GF begins to resemble an economy unto itself.

When the black box expands to include raw material inputs (e.g., mining and agriculture) and energy (as Tesla is already doing), you no longer have just General Factories, you have General Economies - an economy where production is continually optimized toward the limits imposed by physics, and this optimization itself becomes increasingly automated.

At this point life would look very strange indeed: Absurdly wealthy and yet terrifyingly ephemeral, as the pace of change becomes so explosive that people don't even bother trying to track it - they just enjoy the ride, and periodically suffer the cataclysms.  This is not the ""Singularity"", because the same patterns recur no matter what level you're looking at, so events will be comprehensible in isolation - just not their exact causal relationship.

BUT we're still not done - the potency of this idea is such that there is still a ways to go in exploring it.  What's the next step above an economy?  That would be an ecosystem or **biosphere**.  All the time that this process is unfolding, the artificial process is replacing, subsuming, or forming symbiosis with the natural environment until a functional unity is achieved.

There is no exact dividing line, but at some point a General Economy is a General Biosphere, where the entirety of life on a planet is integrated into a technological process with rational optimization toward (let's hope) philanthropic objectives.  

And the thing about a General Biosphere - just like a General Economy in earlier eras - is that it will be replicable.  That it *will* replicate inevitably, almost like cell mitosis on an astronomical scale.  A General Factory can seed a city; a General Economy can seed a nation-state; and a General Biosphere could conceivably seed an entire world all at once.

We can imagine an era where General Factories power colonies on other worlds at a ""slow"" pace of growth; General Economies are established all at once in new places, radically expanding the pace of solar system settlement and perhaps (more slowly) beyond; and then General Biospheres go on to seed well beyond even that.  Such thoughts induce giddy vertigo, so it's understandable why Elon Musk's companies are such an addictive topic.

Now, this all a lot to deduce from someone talking about running a factory more efficiently, but it's all there - vast implications packed into simple ideas.  

Musk has tapped into some mainline insight about what increases the potential of humankind, and is pursuing the immediate steps along the only path that doesn't end.",24,55

It would appear that major financial centers and global cities such as Hong Kong, London, New York, Singapore, Dubai, ect. have at least a third (and increasing) percent of their population which is foreign-born. Many of the new global elites, especially millennials, have a nationality which is becoming fuzzier and more unclear. Maybe they were born in one country, raised in another, educated in another, and find a career in another. They possess or have possessed passports multiple nations. They speak a number a languages, and may marry and have kids with people who posses a different nationality. 

Urban culture is continuing to see a convergence. You can find similar elements of design, many of the same things in all the major global cities. More and more, millennial elites are beginning to wear the same clothes, eat the same food, list to the same music and watch the same shows. For them, nationality seems to be more of a trivial matter than something which is held close to their core identity. 

Now extrapolate this forward. What will their grandchildren's world look like? Is nationality even relevant in 50, 100 years? What seems more relevant is one's human capital, employer and/or business affiliations.",4,10

As today's social and economic class are becoming permanent, a system to exclude those who are not going to participate in the future will probably be implemented by those who are tired of supporting the freeloaders.

Trump's plan of slashing medicare and medicaid is the first baby step for that direction. 

The taxpayers, who would be fewer and shielding more burden, will resent having to support all these people, and they will revolt. Most likely establishing their own tax-free zones.

However, there might be a better way to deal with it.

As opportunities close because the financialization of everything sets society like clockwork with little chance of participation from the rest, I think a measure to exclude the masses from having a voice will be taken.

The areas of former CSA was about 770k sq mi. Not a small area by any chance.

When CSA collapsed and union army took over, blacks had the votes and with many former CSAers kept out from general affairs, the blacks ran things. There was even a black member in the Senate. 

However, the Union forces withdrew in 1877, and those who loved Civilization quickly took back control, and introduced Jim Crow laws to exclude blacks from, well, anything worth having.

That was not racism, but an attempt to hold Civilization intact. As a result the Great Migration took place in the 1920s, exporting the problem to those who created it. 

The lesson of how a defeated people managed to exclude a large group of population not likely to contribute to Civilization will be re-learned during the Grand Transition to Civilization 2.0, when it would become necessary to restrict political, economic and consuming power of the masses, about 7 billion strong, in order to ensure we reach the Future.

Stalin's forcible removal of people likely to side with the Nazis during World War II, or Roosevelt's removal of Japanese-Americans during the same period, was necessary to eliminate any chance of mishap. The fact that they largely remained loyal to their countries was not something which could be proven at that point, and no one wanted to take the risk.

As more and more people are excluded from the Future, resentments will grow. Some people suggest throwing them cheap entertainment to kill the time, but they cost energy and resources.

There will be no changes. Today's social institutions and ideologies will be here to stay. Today's rich will stay rich forever, and very few of today's poor will become rich. Sorry.

It might be beneficial for Civilization,and for the sake of future, to introduce a general Jim Crow laws to the poorer and less technical people of the world , without discriminating for race, age, sexual preferences or personal beliefs, in order to concentrate resource use to those who do matter and minimize any political upheaval which might slow technological advances.",0,0

We may probably still have the DMV, justice system, highway patrol etc. but in a smaller capacity.

I can see the advantages to driverless cars / robotaxis but there are some marques/brands that are not suited to this - Ferrari or Lamborghini would probably not want to invest in SDCs. Even as a car enthusiast, it could benefit me - but may be not so in somewhere like Highgreen [a rural part of Sheffield bordering on Barnsley].

I have read a car is often idle 95% of the time on average, but that's the main point there - on average. Obviously there are some circumstances where a vehicle isn't idle 95% of the time. I am sure there are some situations where people don't have a vehicle idle for 95% of the day but can't quite work out which ones though.

Then again, we have other things that are idle a lot of the time but sharing them is problematic - e.g. clothing, kitchen utensils, gardening equipment, television, bathroom/shower. Outside of your household you're probably going to find it difficult to share a television and owning it is cheaper than renting it in some cases.

The reason society likes the car is probably the man vs machine aspect and treating it as a form of artwork - engineering, design, marketing etc.

In the future, owning and driving your own vehicle could be seen the same way as craft-beer enthusiasts are today [craft-beer enthusiasts vs people who buy generic Aldi-branded beer and just want cheap beer and don't care about the brand, same for car enthusiasts vs people who need a robotaxi to get from A to B and are not car enthusiasts].

Also, what parts of policing could or should not be automated for various reasons?

I would be interested to hear your opinions and thoughts on this.",2,2

At some point these machines and systems might become autonomous to such a level, that the creator cannot take full responsibility for it's actions. [This article in The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14322334/robot-electronic-persons-eu-report-liability-civil-suits) discusses this scenario as well as the[ new rules for this scenario the European Union has been working on](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20170110IPR57613/robots-legal-affairs-committee-calls-for-eu-wide-rules). 

While the machine/system might be legally autonomous in this scenario, it doesn't mean humans will be completely out of the picture. Consider an autonomous soda vending machine. It will make decisions on what price it is selling its stock for and how to market it. Though it employs people (or other autonomous entities) to restock or repair itself, yet is [autonomous](http://btcgeek.com/dawn-of-autonomous-corporations/) to make contracts with whoever it deems most suitable. Additionally it might have a debt or pay licencing fees to its creators. Next to this it pays taxes, insurance and maybe the 'robot liability fund'.

If it would become reality that many of our day to day dealings will be with such autonomous machines or services, how would this change society? I would like to get a feeling what reddit's thoughts are on this!",2,2

Assuming it does clear the bar, does it do so as well, or better, than renewables and batteries?

My intuition is that it's not -- that the environmental footprint (especially carbon) of digging up coal, turning it into methanol, and burning it to propel vehicles can't compare with solar/wind + batteries, if it even presents an improvement over the current system.

They are well known for flaunting their wealth, not hiding their disdain for the lower classes, and being shameless over their attitude.

And they know they are untouchable.

They are our future leaders, and will lead Civilization to the next level and will join there, while the hapless 'peasants' have no place on it.

They know they won, they know their wealth won't end (they tend to own prime real estate, as well as stocks, etc in leading companies), they know they will rule and those who criticise them will be on their knees, and they know the future is for them, not for the peasants.

Being freed from guilt, obligation and other 20th-century stuff is a necessary step towards entering the future, and smarter people are trying to emulate them, not fight against them which is futile.

Smart, ruthless, status-conscious and shameless youths led the civilization during the Bell Epoque. If it continued we would have reached Civilization 2.0 by 1985.

However is there a practical application where you can literally get 10x type improvements in material weight, costs enabling things like super light cars, Very high buildings or wind mills and all developed at a fraction of the cost. 

Or have we reached some physical limits and/or practical resource limits that inhibit further development. Something like fusion energy where the promise is there but cannot be fulfilled anytime soon.",15,11

I think it will probably be:

**Manual-driven cars** [safety reasons, driverless cars, car-sharing].

**Advantages**: No accidents in the real world, virtual neighborhoods for driving can be programmed as needed with geography and weather conditions to people's liking, profitable for manufacturers.

**Disadvantages**: Finding a server to host it on, connection speed, possible loss of interest in real-world human-driven cars and real roads.

We already have racing games today - but that's 3D gaming rather than virtual reality [not counting Grand Theft Auto, which I've only occasionally played].

VR and AR have been widely discussed - [example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4oy2zs/vr_will_become_mainstream_if_it_embraces_porn_and/), [example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6bjh92/vr_panic_virtual_realitys_side_effects_could/).

Legal issues are another consideration that the VR industry may have to consider - what will the justice system need to do to keep up-to-date on this and how would a crime in a virtual world be dealt with [e.g. ""virtual car theft"" as an example].

I would be interested to hear your opinions and thoughts on this. 

This is a bit of a change from discussing automation and basic income as a topic - I'm trying to look more in-depth at this.",25,14

Let me ask you this, do you know your phone displays thing on the screen and allows for interaction based on touch input? It gets worse... do you know how your toilet flushes? No? Another idea that came to my mind, as technology becomes more complex, we put them under layers of abstraction so as to make its functionality accessible to future developers. At some point, there must be some kind of a climax or turning point to this trend. If people have no idea how any of those abstraction layers work and are unable to wrap their head around what is actually happening, any future technological development or improvement on said technology will become impossible.

This leads me to believe humans will not be able to progress scientifically until we improve our ability to comprehend greater levels of complexity and higher dimensions of reality. We'd have to evolve ourselves using transplants and sacrifice our humanity to let us function like previous humans did in a less complex world, by making making the current world look less complex, by making our minds more complex. I believe this is somewhat related to the concept of  singularity.

(The Speculation game is strong here) Otherwise, those living in the future are doomed to live in a reality they couldn't possibly comprehend and the world humans created would be more confusing than the natural world before science could explain its phenomenon. Scientists and engineers would not be able to work with what they got and abandon their work until technological advancement would just stop. Perhaps they would abandon the layers of abstraction set in the past for a more simple reality that is easier to control.

TLDR; Imagine how little you know or care about how your technology works now, the future will be 1000x that.",16,8

Possible new solution proposed, all ideas welcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6dkah7/what_should_be_the_solution_to_robots_replacing/,expatfreedom,1495839500,"Operating under the assumption that AI and robots will displace over 60% of human workers in the next 50-200 years, what is the best societal and economic solution to cope with this problem?  I think UBI would be ideal but how do we implement that if say, 80% of people are not working? This means they are not paying income tax anymore, so governments will have to get the majority of their taxes directly from businesses. However, is this even theoretically sustainable in our current form of capitalism?  


I mean let's assume robots can grow the vegetables and create lab grown meat, then deliver the food with self driving technology, unload and sort it with warehouse and stocking robots, produce the food and take orders with a kiosk or online, deliver it to you with drones or use an automatic checkout system in the store. This is a scenario where we conceivably do not need humans in any part of the equation.


So if there is no longer meaningful or necessary work for humans to do, this rules out retraining for different jobs as a solution. And due to the fact that not everyone is creative enough or talented enough to start their own business or become an artist, we will likely need to redistribute the money from the businesses to the consumers in order to combat inequality and ensure that consumers are able to buy the things they need so the corporations can stay in business. 



I see a number of possible scenarios or outcomes, and I gave my personal opinion following each description. Please provide the most feedback on NUMBER 8 as I think this may potentially be a new idea. 



1. Complete economic and societal collapse. So many people are unemployed that eventually they riot over extreme inequality, and inability to buy anything like food or consumer products, let alone a house. This is a very real danger if no action is taken, and inequality has historically been one of the biggest reasons all civilizations collapse or end.

2. The government reacts to public outcry and bans all AI and robot workers to keep people employed. This is unproductive, and criminals dont abide by rules so this creates an environment where only criminals and the government have access to AI and robot technology which is a very dangerous scenario. 

3. The government forces corporations to continue hiring X number of humans, and possibly even forces people to work if they want to receive their UBI or basic income. This is terribly inefficient for the businesses, and it forces people to continue to work meaningless repetitive or dangerous jobs like coal mining or fast food and sweat-shops. 

4. Government taxes corporations with high automation rates. Im not sure if this is sustainable at all. And as many comments have pointed out, companies will simply move their factories to other countries without automation taxes. 

5. A consumption tax(?) I have no idea how this works at all in the distant future but Ive seen it proposed in a lot of comments. However, if everyone is technologically unemployed and has no money to buy things, how can enough money for a UBI be taken from what they buy if they cant buy anything? 

6. Full on robo-communism or robo-socialism where the government owns at least some of the means of production and provides goods as a public service. (Basically everyone gets free food, transportation, and housing provided by the government owned robots) I dislike this solution because I think it completely undermines the efficiency and motivation for new innovations that exist in a free market economy. The benefits of this option are that we may produce higher quality goods that last longer due to planned obsolesce becoming obsolete as profits are no longer the main driving force. 

7. Within a capitalist system corporations voluntarily give their profits back to their customers because they realize its necessary so they can continue buying more products. This seems a tiny bit far-fetched, and it also seems completely unsustainable and nonsensical to me. 

8. I think this may be a brand new idea and I dont know if it has ever been proposed or even considered, but what if everyone lives off of the return on their investments in the automated corporations?  Obviously each citizen will need a large portfolio in order to make this possible, but if Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg and the government and/or corporations get behind the idea would it be even theoretically possible? Is it better than a UBI based off of taxation if every individual family manages to save up around 1 million dollars to invest and then live off those returns after being technologically unemployed? Theoretically mega-corporations, the ultra wealthy, and/or the government might be able to set something like this up where they invest insane amounts of money and divide the returns among the poorest citizens. Charitable organizations could be set up to allow corporations and the ultra wealthy to donate and receive tax breaks, and this would be in their best interest to prevent riots or social turmoil, and to enable the masses to continue consuming. Is this sustainable, or a theoretically viable solution? 



When I say ""sustainable"" or ""unsustainable"" I'm referring to whether or not the system makes sense in a scenario where 60-90% of people no longer need to work. For example, if I'm unemployed and need to buy food, how is that money that I spend going to be replenished and somehow returned back to me so that I can continue to buy more food?

Paying a minimally functional 10K (poverty for an individual currently 11.8K) thus runs 4T, and paying a comfortable 35K runs an uncomfortable 14T (current USA GDP about 18T (estimated 34T by 2050), current budget around 4T).

Direct assistance (social security, unemployment, etc.) is about %3 of budget spending (direct medical assistance about %6). Deleting old social programs to fund new ones will thus return only modest savings.

Housing/Community and Veteran spending are another %6 each, not a ton of leeway there either, and the rest of the budget is even less flexible (half is military, for example).

Bottom line: We're going to need new revenues for this. What is your vision of the fairest way to tax us all to fund a UBI?",60,13

Goggles with special HQ lenses and eye tracking and highly sensitive controllers that you have to physically move to create virtual change.  You need large open spaces that you can freely move in for some experiences and for others there has to be other people around to waft smells towards you or fan winds or create fluctuations in temperature.

Why are we not simply developing technology that can integrate with the most powerful computer every one of us has: Our brains?  It could act as a sort of lucid dream activator/enhancer.  Close your eyes and suddenly you're fully immersed in an open world where anything is possible.  Any scenario or place or object or feeling you could imagine, there at your fingertips for you to experience with all five senses.

It may require a chip of some sort implanted beneath the skull, and I'm not saying that developing this sort of tech would be faster than the road VR is currently on, but to me it just makes more sense to aim for this rather than some sort of special body suit covered in sensors that you have to walk around in.",3,0

Incredible computer graphics were already possible in the last century.

I had a Commodore C64 and later a Commodore Amiga. Before that some Pong game for the TV set and an Atari 2600 VCS game console.

Making the kind of computer animations you see in movies and even TV ads was a task for specialized companies with fast computers and a lot of time at their hand.

Today I can download Blender, watch a few tutorials on YouTube, and then make something simple in a fraction of time. At home!

I could make an animated Snoo (Reddit mascot) that dances with a goat and Reddit couldn't stop me. They could prevent me from making money and even sue me if I would share it openly. But if I really want to I can make it.

What's stopping me from working on an AI? And at which point would a DIY AI be illegal? ",8,5

There were perhaps 150,000 such people in France, and no more than 2 million who qualified around the entire Western World. 

A notion fit for perhaps 2 million peoples can't work on a world with 7.5 billion people. 

Plus, the emergence of transhumans and genetically enhanced humans would mean that a complete redefinition of 'human rights' is necessary.

Equalitarians will try to make 'every person is equal', but the current scientific discovery of the genes related to intelligent shows that some people are, indeed, born better than the rest.

Obviously, people should be treated differently according to ability and property, and if enhanced humans and transhumans occur, they should be treated better than ordinary humans since they can do more stuff and can advance civilization faster.

And, I am afraid to say, the rights of billions of people not likely to advance the future might have to be abridged.

Smarter humans, enhanced humans and transhumans should have more rights than the rest because of their ability.

18th century notions of moral and ethics can't be carried into 21th century and the next level of civilization. it will be very necessary to redefine 'human rights' as tech makes most human right issues irrelevant.",38,2

3372,2017-5-29,2017,5,29,16,6dz0dj,What is the problem with the simulated universe claim as proposed by Elon Musk and Nick Bostrom?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6dz0dj/what_is_the_problem_with_the_simulated_universe/,truth_alternative,1496044165,"The claim is that as the simulations become more and more life like, we will one day create universes in computers which will not be distinguishable from the reality=&gt; hence we must be in a simulated reality.
If we look at transportation and observe that we are travelling faster and faster as the technology develops we could also claim that one day we will be able to travel instantly from one side of the galaxy to the other by teleportation.
This claim would be false.
Similarly. If we look at the simulations getting more and more realistic as technology improves we can also claim that one day we will be simulated ourselves as well.
This claim is ALSO false.
Just as travelling faster does not necessarily mean that we will be able to teleport, building mire and more realistic simulations does not necessarily mean that we will be created in them.
Both claim s are illogical and false.

**Terms**

Some explanation of the terms used in this post .

**Simulation Type 1**: A simulation where one exists as a human being of flesh and blood in base reality but can plug in and out of the simulation. (like Neo is experiencing in the movie Matrix. )

**Simulation Type 2**: In this type , you exists only as code in the computer. There is no real version of you in base reality. ( like The agent in the movie Matrix)

**Simulation Type 3**: Its a simulation running on its own in a computer. We are only observing it from outside but we are not immersed in it. No sentient beings IN the simulation.Like a weather simulation on a super computer.

**Simulation argument**: A collection of propositions about the possible outcomes for the future. It makes no claim about what will happen , but just gives us what the possibilities are.

**Simulation Theory**: A theory built upon Simulation Argument trying to predict what will happen in the future and claiming that we are most probably in a simulation.",71,0

It featured Tsuhan Chen displaying self-driving car technology on a Buick Regal sedan.

The episode was later edited into a four-part, 60-minute special in 2007 [airing around February 2007] which aired on ITV4.

Does anyone remember this episode? I can't find it anywhere on the major video-sharing sites - YouTube, YouPak and Dailymotion don't seem to have it.

It also illustrated other interesting futurology topics - cars driven by thumbprint or facial recognition features and an interview with Laurens van der Acker, Dutch-born automobile designer.

Has anyone seen this episode, and will they rerun this again in the future? [it hasn't aired since 2009 though, and ITV4 aren't airing Police Camera Action currently].

Does anyone here want to see this episode if they could, as an interesting look back at the issues covered?",0,7

3428,2017-5-30,2017,5,30,4,6e2eom,"Why hasn't there been any effort to create a city-state dedicated to science yet ruled by a technocracy? Wouldn't an independent state solely focusing on science, research and technology be vastly more effective than what we have today?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6e2eom/why_hasnt_there_been_any_effort_to_create_a/,Ouroboros612,1496087047,"Note: English is not my native language.  
  
First an important note. Yes, science is a method. But in today's world science is done in individual ""compartments"" by many countries and institutions with their own governments. To me this way of improving technology and research seems ineffective and slow **compared to the alternative**. I'm not saying it is an ""either / or"" scenario but why hasn't there been a global effort to create a city state dedicated exclusively to science?  
  
If humanity cooperated to make an entire self governed city dedicated to science, research and technology I think the progress rate would be tenfold of what the human race can accomplish today.  
  
Such a state, once the best and safest location has been chosen, would be free of cultural, religious, historical, political and traditional influences, with a requirement that all such are ""left at the doorstep"" upon entry.   
  
Most importantly here, it would be free of **government influences** which could hinder science, research and technology in any number of ways. Big pharma companies ironically being a threat to medicinal research just being one example.  
  
I'm talking about a futuristic style technocracy where each major field had their own part of the city.

I believe that a basic income is necessary in a world becoming more automated and Ai driven. Now the Fins are using euros as the base currency in their experiment, I would propose using a government endorsed crypto currency as the block-chain system would allow for a more observable method of tracking the flow of data. My idea and not totally sure if others have started implementing it would be to tie the generation of income to energy. In simple terms it would be a solar panel for example connected to a computer that monitors and then exploits the power generated and converts say one joule into one coin. These coins can then be traded to offset amenities or purchase goods and services. Now this coin / joule would behave differently from other forms of currency in the fact that it depletes over time through its very nature. So it would be ideal as a form of basic income as it cannot be used for say hoarding or long term investments and therefore promotes a constant flow of expendable income. Some key points would be for every transaction a coin would reset it's timer so that only stagnant coins would depreciate and eventually disappear while those in the flow remain fresh and constant. The trace ability factor through the block chain would also mean that it can't be over exploited by alternating the current, for example the coin can not return to sender without devolution. Now a loaf of bread for example is 1 euro on the general market, to purchase this you would trade your coins against the central energy lender who in turn converts your coin back into energy that is sold to companies using the amenities to produce goods. The central energy lender I believe would be publicly owned and funded, possibly utilising a keiretsu model of a green bank that handles and invests in only renewable forms of energy and aids in the transactions on general market.  Also as a basic income, I would not expect a user to be able to buy a tesla vehicle for example but simply aid with electricity bills, water rates and certain locally produced groceries. I'm intrigued to see what my fellow redditors think about this idea and whether you may have some ideas of your own or interesting links to help get a better understanding. This is all hypothetical ofcourse. Thanks again.",10,10

**What is the future?**

Take a second to imagine a world where you can tell a computer your new business idea and it will research the idea, start the business, operate the business, and optimize the business completely on its own, without any human interaction. When we have reached this point, the need for human critical and logical thinking will cease to exist.

The scary part about this is that many of you will live to see the day that world becomes a reality.

Now, that is a bold claim, but I make it because my company is one of many that is working to make it true. And today, I want to walk you through what we are doing so you can see the future like I do.


**Why Im even talking about this**

My name is Nick Szabo, and Im the COO of Swizzle Global. Ive spoken around the world on the future of artificial intelligence and cognitive technology, mostly because of the work we do. At Swizzle, we use cognitive technology focused around natural language processing to analyze customer feedback, and we are currently using deep learning techniques to build an AI that will automate the whole process. We have helped companies around the world, from banks to game companies, from Korea to the US.

Recently I gave a speech at the Guiyang China Big Data Conference about the future of AI and cognitive technology, and I wanted to share my talk with you here. So this is my speech, modified a bit to be more easily read. Enjoy!


**Cognitive Technology vs Artificial Intelligence**

Before we start, we need to understand the difference between Cognitive Technology and Artificial Intelligence. Though these terms are often used interchangeably, they are very different.

On the path to true AI, the first step is to make people smarter using technology. We want to really optimize the way humans work, so we can make the best decisions possible, based on all of the variables.

Now, you are most likely aware that this is what we have been doing for decades with computers and big data. But in the past, computers were only able to help us with things that are quantitative in nature. Things we can assign numbers to. We can run really well made math equations (algorithms) on huge data sets and find incredibly valuable information, but when it came to finding important insights in things that are difficult to quantify, we were stuck. We still needed people to read words, look at pictures, listen to audio, watch videos, and learn from mistakes. And that is a problem, because we now have more words, pictures, audio, and video than we can deal with. And mistakes have never been costlier.

This is where a new wave of technology comes in. Cognitive Technology.

Basically a bunch of really smart people figured out how to make programs that can read, watch, see, listen, and more importantly, learn. This type of technology opens up a whole new set of data, and lets us make incredibly smart decisions based on an awesome number of variables. And with the learning aspect, we can even leverage our past decisions.

Cognitive technology gives humans the ability to make decisions based on significantly more data than ever before, but the key thing is that the humans are still making decisions. This is the big difference between cognitive technology and AI.

An interesting side effect of cognitive technology is that, in order to create programs that can understand unstructured data, or data that isnt numbers, we had to give programs the ability to actually learn. But now think about this. The whole point of this technology is to help us, humans, make smarter decisions. Now that we have programs that can learn and understand all sorts of inputs, we can tell the program what the decisions we have made based on the data the system gave us. And the program itself can start to learn why we made that decision, and can start to recommend future decisions, based on that knowledge.
Eventually, the program will be able to recommend the same decisions a human would, except it will be able to calculate more variables, be able to make those decisions faster, and be able to optimize to a superhuman degree. This is when we hit Artificial Intelligence. A machine that does not help us make decisions. It makes them for us. When we reach this level, we will see a whole new level of job automation.

Weve seen this kind of thing before. Over the last century, manual labor has been steadily going to computers and robots over humans. They are cheaper, faster, more reliable, and dont need vacation. Any job that is repetitive in nature has been in danger of being automated.

But those of us in thinking jobs have felt safe. Those of us who make decisions, well, computers cant take that! Right? AI is changing that. Actual artificial intelligence is coming that will automate thinking and decision making jobs. And when that happens, we are not ready.

This is a scary future that most people on this planet do not actually think will happen. My team and I, though, are actively working on bringing this reality to life, and we are not the only ones. Today, I am going to walk you through what we are doing, so you can see the future like I do, and see how quickly it is coming for you.


**Use Machines to make People Smarter**

As I said, the first step towards getting rid of all of our jobs, is to make us better at our jobs using technology.

At Swizzle, we focus on cognitive technology built around text analytics and natural language processing; Teaching computers how to read. The problem I solve is actually pretty simple. Companies today get TOO much customer feedback. Between emails, reviews, comments, forums, telephone conversations, blogs, and so much more, companies are buried in what their customers are saying. Inside of this feedback is incredibly valuable information, but there is way too much to read, so they are stuck.
For example, we just helped a large bank. Their mobile app is ranked as one of the top 3 apps in the world, so you can imagine they get an insane number of app store reviews every day. Inside those reviews are bug reports, potential new product suggestions, marketing insights, PR problems, and so much more, but you can only read a small fraction of them. Using traditional text analytics solutions, like keyword analysis and sentiment analysis, they are able to see that some words have negative sentiment, but what does that really mean? Of course, a human could read the reviews and tell you what you should know and what you should do, but this kind of technology doesnt dive deep like that, and a human can only read so much.

Our solution is to use cognitive technology. Specifically, we created a system, called SIMON, that can learn what we are looking for, read for us, and tell us what we should know. The way it works is we pull all of the banks app store reviews and plug them into our Swizzle SIMON system. The system then identifies which reviews are the most important using algorithms we have made, and gives these reviews to a human, our data strategist.

The data strategist then teaches the system why those reviews are important and what they mean. SIMON can now run calculations to learn why those reviews mean that, and take that knowledge and apply it to the rest of the reviews. When it finds new problems it doesnt understand, it can work with the human who teaches it more. In the end, Swizzles system identifies, categorizes, and summarizes all of the important information that is inside the app store reviews, and gives it to the data strategist.

It is really like a human working with a computer as a team.

Now with this system, the data strategist knows everything he needs to know inside the reviews, and he has trained Swizzle SIMON to understand the reviews. For the bank, our data strategist understood exactly what they could do to make their app even better. He knew found who the banks customers think the biggest competitors are, and why. He uncovered buried testimonials where clients ranted and raved about how amazing the bank was. He knew what users really wanted to use the app for, and how the bank could help them. He knew every piece of important information inside the whole history of the apps reviews as if he read and remembered every word.
With this information our data strategist was able to talk to the bank, help them improve their product, and put together a report that summarized just what they needed to know. Using Swizzles SIMON, it was as if he downloaded all the reviews into his brain. Pretty cool, huh?


**Use people to make computers smarter**

So now the bank has a report and understands everything they need to know about their past reviews, but they still need a way to keep up to date on what people are saying in reviews every day. Just doing a report every few months is a quick way to stay out of touch with your customer.

Thankfully, a side effect of using our system as a tool to help the data strategist is that the data strategist taught Swizzle how to truly understand what that banks customers are saying in app store reviews. And remember, the amazing thing about cognitive technology is that it can learn. We showed Swizzles SIMON what is important, why it is important, and what that particular banks customers mean when they leave a review. Now all we have to do is connect to the app stores API and feed reviews into our system as they come in. Swizzles SIMON is now constantly reading reviews, analyzing them, and organizing them into what is important or not.

Then, every week, SIMON creates a report of what is important to know, how previously identified problems are doing, and new information. This report is sent to our data strategist, who makes a decision as to what the bank needs to know, and trains Swizzles system further.
To the bank, it is as if the data strategist is constantly just reading and remembering every review. It really is amazing, and keep in mind, this is not theoretical. This is what is happening right now. Today. The next step is where things get fun.


**Artificial Intelligence**

The next step on the path of us all losing our jobs is to move from Cognitive Technology to Artificial Intelligence.

See, this whole time, the data strategist is not only training Swizzles SIMON to understand how to read these app store reviews, he is also training it how to interpret those reviews into important insights. Because this technology can learn, we can feed our client facing insights and recommendations into our system. SIMON can take this, and learn how a human interprets the data, and it tries to make those insights automatic. Feeding insights to our data strategist.

Of course, these arent perfect yet, but soon, we will hit a point where the data strategist will not need to give our system feedback. Swizzle will run automatically and provide actionable insights of the same quality our data strategist does now.

Whats more, you have to remember that this system is constantly reading reviews. It will be able to see the results of its recommendations, and learn how effective they are. Swizzles SIMON will be able to constantly find better and better recommendations as it continues.

We can even train this system to know what teams need what information. If it finds a bug, it can tell the development team what they need to know to fix it. If it sees a PR problem, it can tell the PR team how to get ahead of it. If it notices a UX problem, a security alert, a product improvement idea, or anything, it can notify the right team, and give advice to take action on.

Think about what this means. When we achieve this, there will be no need for anyone to read any app store reviews at that bank. There will be no need for anyone to look at any graphs, or analysis of keywords or sentiment. There wont be a need for someone to interpret the results into something actionable. To communicate the customers will into actions. There wont even be a need for customer surveys. The bank will have a system that does all of this, figures out what needs to be done, and then notifies the correct person on what they need to do.

And remember, this is the step we are working on right now. This is happening today, not some distant future.


**Automate Everything**

Now lets go even further and see how many jobs one AI can take.

Instead of looking at just app store reviews, remember our product at Swizzle is to analyze all customer feedback. Lets take emails, marketing engagements, comments, forums, blogs, survey data, telephone transcripts and more. Lets put every means of communication our banks customers have through the same system we put app store reviews through.

Swizzles artificial intelligence now takes in every piece of customer feedback available. Analyzes it. Categorizes it. Understands it, and builds actionable informative data from it. Swizzle uses this information to provide detailed recommendations on how to optimize your offerings, your messaging, your communications, and more. It can be asked detailed questions about your customers. Who they are, what they like, what they hate, what they want. Will they like this product or this? How should we approach them? Who are my competitors, etc.

It can learn to identify PR disasters, before they happen, and help you get ahead of them. It can learn to identify new competitors or threats, recommend new products, or help you perfect your current products. It can do everything a human could, if that human was able to ingest EVERYTHING your customer says about you. Except it can do it for real, it can do it faster, it can do it better, and it can do it cheaper.

When Swizzles AI can take in all customer feedback, it will have the capacity to replace human decision making in marketing research, customer analytics, product development research, parts of customer service, and more. You will now have a singular, intelligent entity that will take over listening to your customers, and recommend what you should do.

The next step is team Swizzle up with all the other AIs.


**Who else is building AI?**

Because, remember, this path I took you down is the path of one company. It is what we are working on, and it started with us just trying to make app store reviews more useful.

You know we are not the only one solving business problems with cognitive technology. Other companies around the world are working on technology to help businesses with business intelligence, marketing automation, product development, financials, and so, so much more. Every aspect of running a business is currently being taught to a computer somewhere in the world in hopes of making things easier and more efficient. And every one of those companies are pushing toward automation. And that is happening right now!


**An intelligent company**
They are all building AIs that will perfectly optimize their section of business. And when they all succeed, how long will it take for someone (or something) to piece it all together? To take all of the different AIs, make them communicate with one another, and make one, incredible company that does not need humans. It will be able to research new ideas, start new businesses, operate those businesses, and optimize them without any human.

Every aspect of running a business is currently being taught to a computer somewhere in the world in hopes So you ask me, what is the future of AI and cognitive technology? It is beautiful, amazing, optimized to a whole new degree. And it has little place for humans.


**My Advice**

Does this scare you a bit? My advice? Find all the different companies out there that are automating various aspects of your business. Go out of your way to engage with them. Take some risks and try to find what parts of your business you can automate. Keep an open mind and try to trust technology more. If you get ahead of this, you'll lead the way. If you try to follow, you might never catch up...",5,13

The reasons for this involve its gross levels or pollution, an industrial policy in which regions compete to attract manufacturer and a state-sponsored export drive that amounts, in the eyes of some, to dumping. 

The result is that China has been flooding the world with very cheap solar panels, allegedly sold at under variable manufacturing cost. This policy could not survive indefinitely.  Suntech was the worlds largest solar panel-maker, producing enough solar cells each year to power 1m US homes. At its peak, it was worth $16 bn. In March, it filed for bankruptcy and is now worth $180 mln. 

Both the EU and now the US have threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese producers. U.S. producers have seen business shrivel, with 1,200 manufacturing jobs lost and a 27 percent wage decline in the four years to 2016. U.S. solar cell plants went from running at 81.7 percent of capacity in 2014 to 28.9 percent in 2016, the filing said.

Chinese overcapacity is down to local government policy. Each region competes to offer 'sweeteners', generally tax credits, to investors, and as a result over-capacity has grown in virtually every branch of its industry. Arguably, as many of these firms are highly indebted to the same few banks, it stands close to a crash, with solar panels a fleck of dust in the overall implosion. That said, it is extremely unwise to assume that current solar prices are indicative of real global costs of production, or that the 2012-17 trends can be extrapolated. ",0,1

The automation can reduce jobs, but it can also increase the access to the jobs too, and this is what the news about automation is not seeing.

Automation provides better jobs. Instead of assembles, the people work in customer support, design, maintenance, sales, management, etc. The automated countries like Germany will keep those jobs, the ones who do not, will be in bad shape and just consume what others sell to them.",0,7

2) Advocating to bring to public awareness the world's major challenges. We ignite the futurist mindset in those who no longer want to be bystanders. 
3) Building global labs where futurists of all types are able to produce solutions, that are not solely reactive to the present, but to architect new systems that make the broken ones obsolete.

First of all, UBI reqires an elite upper class that makes all the money and pays for the UBI. So there will need to be an upper class and a lower class. 

The upper class will be permitted to have their own private schools and gated communities. The lower class will attend public schools payed for by the elites. These schools will teach a particular history and social studies that frames things in an appropriate way for the lower class. 

All students who wish to receive UBI will, of course, be required to devote a few years after graduation to military service. This will be compulsory. Besides, school will have prepped the young minds and already educated them on our terrible enemies and the need to fight them back from our door step. 

All the factories will be run by robots, and all police and security will be done by robots, drones, etc. No one will wonder why the gated communities of the elites are guarded by high-tech droids armed with heat seeking missiles and Gauss guns, while the human soldiers sent off to war fight with the cheapest equipment available. Satellites in orbit will be able to put a laser through the brain of anyone who enters the gated communities without authorization.

No drones or super-solder robots fight in the wars, they are exclusively for policing and security. Wars will be all humans, all lower class (except for officers who will direct things from safe bunkers 2 miles below the surface of the earth). The war will be perpetual and the casualty rate will be ~100%.

As IQs go up for those with great nutrition and access to reading materials (in a lead free environment - see Chicago public schools, parks and housing as examples of a national problem in the USA), these folks will continue to produce higher IQ children. Those infected with lead poisoning or poor nutrition up through the grandmother's lifespan will have reduced IQs. If these citations are challenged, I'll be happy to provide the peer reviewed research. But we're talking about the future - not the past.

My point is that the introduction of a Universal Basic Income will happen before lead remediation and increased nutrition occurs. 

As every ounce of collateral produces thousands of tons of financial products, collateral and financial products represent vastly different amounts of value. I could cite BIS or the Federal Reserve data if this last citation is questioned.

To repeat my point:
Due to systemic factors that are less likely to see timely solutions, UBI will produce effects before impacts that lower humans' IQ.  

The expansion of financial products value versus a unit of Fiat currency's value means that every dollar created and used creates dollars for those who can invest in financial products. These two rates of value creation are extremely different.

I think it is painfully obvious those advocating for UBI refuse to acknowledge increasing IQ before dumping dollars. 

Bifurcating society into collateral (chattel) class makes sense only for those who can trade off of collateral. Those trading FOR collateral are very valuable for those who trade collateral based products.


Am I repeating thoughts you've already had?
