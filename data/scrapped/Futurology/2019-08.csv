Has humanity reached peak intelligence? by izumi3682 in Futurology


[]izumi3682[S] 2 points 22 days ago* 
I strongly suspect our science and technology will have tremendous influence on our intellects, both singly and collectively, in the near, mid and distant future. What I think is not going to continue for very much longer is our 6,000 year old way of life. Everything that we know today will be gone, consumed in the intellect explosion of the next 20 years. What will emerge on the other side of that is not something we can model. That's why it's called the ""technological singularity"".
Your apprehension of history and knowledge of current economics, science and technology is impeccable, but your extrapolation is to me something akin to the Roman Empire of the year 79 AD predicting that they shall make an olive tree 1,000 feet tall that can provide olive oil to the entire known world.
I have tremendous respect for you, but you continually fight the last war. The world is going to change beyond belief in the next ten years alone because of our computing power and its derived forms of AI. ARA (AI, robotics and automation) is going to define this century. Economics, any kind of economics as we have known it, cannot survive.

The floodgates are now inevitably going to open. Remember Louise Brown? The first ""test tube"" baby in 1978. Societal acceptance came quickly and ""in vitro"" fertilization is now as ubiquitous as air. The same will come about with CRISPR-Cas9 and all other genetic manipulations to come.
What this means for social equality or even physical equality, remains to be seen. But in about 5 years time, everybody is going to trying to get some form of genetic manipulation. Both ""in vivo"" and running around. And their pets too.

Ford and VW Are Set to Cooperate on Self-Driving and Electric Cars by izumi3682 in Futurology


[]izumi3682[S] 3 points 24 days ago* 
I see strong evidence that level 5 autonomy E-SDVs will replace automobiles as a product with transport as a utility, like water or electricity or the internet. More and more I see that the major automotive manufacturers are attempting to position themselves as the providers of a never before seen type of utility. The low priced subscription service for transport to handle any need you may have. 
The upshot is the end of the automotive age as we have known it since the year 1913 when automobiles became a mass consumer product. I see this as simply another paradigm change on par with the horse being replaced after 6,000 years service. But this time the transport model is being replaced after only about 107 years. 
Consider what travel was like during the 6,000 years of the horse. Everything that was associated with the horse vanished in about 20 years time. Don't take my word for it--see for yourself...

What if Greenland Melted? by izumi3682 in Futurology


[]izumi3682[S] 6 points 24 days ago 
First of all the vast majority of humans don't know the true size of Greenland. They see Greenland on the world maps in a Mercator projection wherein Greenland appears roughly the same size as South America. Greenland is not much larger than Texas and Alaska put together. It is a pretty good sized island granted, but nothing, nowhere near the land area of South America.
Secondly, I looked it up. If all the ice on Earth melted, the sea level would rise 248 feet. That's a pretty noticeable altering of the world shorelines, but in the greater scheme of things not that massive of a physical change. The truth is that by the year 2100 the sea level could potentially rise about 5 feet. Certainly enough to cause inundation of most major cities on the coasts, but that is yet 81 years from today. That is nearly 3 generations of humans. I think we can figure things out in that time. That is if climate change is even an issue by that point. I see other far and away more salient and massive changes coming long before climate change becomes too much more of an issue.
I wrote about it here if you are interested. I cover all aspects of the future, to include climate change and the challenges we face.

Intel's New Chip Wizard Has a Plan to Bring Back the Magic - Moores law is relentless by izumi3682 in Futurology


[]izumi3682[S] 7 points 28 days ago* 
""Moore's Law"" is also an old law even if it may be relentless. There are other much newer laws now. They describe computing derived AI evolution and the scaling of quantum computers. 
Even if what we regard as ""Moore's Law"" were to fall, these newer laws will continue to keep computing advancing in ever more exponential leaps of capability.
In ten years we shall have accomplished things beyond anything we could possibly imagine today. Which, by the way, is also why 2030 is starting to get pegged as the new time frame for the technological singularity.
This might all seem crazy to you, but if you examine our history over the last couple of thousand years, you will see that what is happening today is perfectly normal and natural in the development of human civilization.

Worlds first AI universe simulator knows things it shouldnt - ""Its like teaching image recognition software with lots of pictures of cats and dogs, but then its able to recognize elephants."" by izumi3682 in Futurology


[]izumi3682[S] 2 points 1 month ago 
The only thing I know more about is that I have been studying this topic pretty steadily for the last 6 years. Before that I didn't know anything more about the future than anyone else. What I do is observe what is happening in any given arena of our technologies and over time I see the trend. From those trends I think I can accurately extrapolate what is going to happen next. Adding a generous dash of the phenomenon of ""accelerating change"" to that, that is. Why accelerating? Because of our computers and what we are doing with them now.

[]izumi3682[S] 14 points 1 month ago 
The computing derived AI is drawing conclusions from patterns too faint for human minds to discern. These conclusions are accurate to our understanding. The fact that it can make these conclusions in about 30 milliseconds communicates to me that the ""black box"" has grown ""marvelous large"". As I suspected it would.
I wonder that we may have crossed the singularity, but we just can't tell yet. Sort of like when Wile E. Coyote runs off the edge of the cliff, but can't tell just at the moment. He is suspended over the void in his rush to get at his goal. Then gravity (and reality) takes over. 
It might take us a year or two to catch on.

Algorithmic Intelligence Has Gotten So Smart, It's Easy To Forget It's Artificial by izumi3682 in Futurology


[]izumi3682[S] 2 points 1 month ago 
Anybody who doesn't think the singularity is fully likely and probably imminent doesn't properly understand how our computing technology is informing the future. For this reason my writing on the subject is not always popular. But I think it's important to spread the word and get people informed.
The future cannot be properly understood without a good understanding of what has come before. So often times when I make an extrapolation people say I don't know what im talking about. Well history does say I know what im talking about.
Take a look at this. I wrote it quite a while back, but it is still relevant today. Most people here think the future will be pretty much the same 30 years from now as it is today. They don't understand how history demonstrates we are literally hurtling towards a ""technological singularity"". And humans have known it since the mid-nineteenth century. Humans caught on fast.
Here is the thing I wrote. Tell me what you think.

Since  the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, the economic revolution of  cryptocurrencies has generated a stir in its demand, causing an increase  in its popularity, therefore, increasing the transactions within the  blockchain and the movements of crypto in the market. Consequently, many  countries have had to implement laws and regulations to control crypto  transactions within their jurisdiction, note that the blockchain are  decentralized and do not respond to any public financial and legal  entity, causing a lack of control over the transactions within the  network.

Telos  Blockchain, having governance and a specific and defined arbitration  system, is governed by laws and regulations that prevent many illicit  actions from becoming effective, this collaborates with the cause of the  countries that are implementing new regulations, becoming the ideal  platform.

As  the demand for crypto increases, governments apply greater regulations  at a global level, taking into account that cryptocurrencies are not  backed by central banks, which is why many countries believe that there  should be regulations that control this type of currency since it  affects its local currency directly and indirectly; despite being an  asset that can bring economic benefits to its users, it also lends  itself to criminal actions through the network and the crypto. Any  decision or economic announcement made in each country determines  negatively or positively the behavior of the price of digital  currencies.

The  regulators aim to prevent illicit actions in exchange houses, such as,  for example, money laundering, terrorism financing, scams, payments to  the dark web among others; According to the DEA, 10% of transactions  with cryptocurrencies are used for illegal activities. During an  interview with Lilita Infante of the United States Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA), published in Bloomberg, five years ago the  percentage of criminal activity in blockchain transactions was 90%, at  present, this number represents 10%, which has become transactions for  price speculation and not for other purposes.

In  countries of the first world, governments have established regulations  and laws that control the use of crypto assets. The regulations applied  in China are not the same applied in the United States or Japan. Herein  will be specified some regulations of countries where crypto have marked  a trend.

Asia,  is one of the continents where more transactions of cryptocurrencies  are made, not all countries that constitute the continent have been  receptive, but this is not the case in Japan; where there are  regulations in the commercial exchange of cryptocurrencies. The  amendment that approved the use of cryptocurrencies in the country took  effect as of 2017; under the Payment Services Act, only exchanges with  representatives that reside in Japan and have offices in the country  registered as part of the Japanese financial services agency may legally  operate in the exchange of digital currencies.

The  National Tax Agency (Dec 2017), established that all income in  cryptocurrency are classified as miscellaneous income and are added to  the total amount of other income that a citizen has; the taxes are  calculated from the total amount of the incomes and then they are taxed.  Investors must pay taxes at rates that range from 15% to 55%.

Japan  under the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds, exchanges  are required to verify the identities of customers who open accounts,  keep records of transactions and notify the authorities when a  suspicious transaction is recognized. Following the loss of 400 million  dollars in NEM tokens in one of the most used exchanges in Japan,  Coincheck, the government of Japan, according to the[ Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/),

&gt;The  local Finance Bureau ordered Coincheck to submit a report on the same  day, examined it, and issued an order of business improvement on January  29, 2018. The following day the FSA requested all cryptocurrency  exchange businesses to review their system-risk management plans and  report the results to the FSA. On March 2, 2018, the FSA conducted an  on-site inspection of Coincheck. On March 8, 2018, the local Finance  Bureaus issued business-improvement orders to seven exchange businesses,  again including Coincheck.  
A  group of cryptocurrency exchange businesses publicized their decision  to form a new self-regulating body on March 2, 2018, that all registered  exchange businesses will join. The body aims to obtain authorization  from the FSA under the Payment Services Act.

# Regulations In China

## Mainland China

In  this country, both cryptocurrencies and exchange houses have been  banned by the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC), were completely eliminated  in 2017, where 173 platforms were closed by 2018. Financial institutions  cannot make any transactions with Bitcoin or another digital currency.  In addition, they also banned ICOs and national currency exchanges.  Additionally, as of January 2018, most of the crypto miners closed  operations.

## Hong Kong

Unlike  mainland China, there is a British ex-colony that in 1997 stopped being  part of Britain and became part of the Chinese, but it was agreed that  this region would be autonomous for half a century before Beijing takes  full control over it. In other words, it is one country, two systems.  This area called Hong Kong is governed by the same president of mainland  China but does not comply with the same communist regulations. Unlike  China, the cryptocurrencies are legal, currently, there is no  legislation that regulates digital money, but they have an anti-crime  organization which sanctions those who do not comply with requirements  that stops cases of money laundering or fraud; Bitcoin is considered a  virtual asset.

# Regulations In The USA

Currently,  cryptocurrencies are not considered as legal tender, although their  exchange is; the regulations will depend on the state and the federal  authorities since each one has different concepts of cryptocurrencies.

The  Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) considers that tokens are  another value that replaces the local currency (Dollar), unlike the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which establishes that cryptocurrencies  are taxed as a property and not like a coin.

In  2015, 802 people declared and paid taxes on the cryptocurrencies  profits, which means that users are evading these taxes; The IRS is  apparently using a unique software that helps them locate those users  who are evading taxes. This theory is promoted by Laura Walter, a  certified public accountant and cryptocurrency tax specialist, who  published on July 8, 2018, a document that apparently has been presented  to IRS agents of the Criminal Investigation division. The document  indicates that the IRS intends to serve the subpoenas to request from  large technology companies (Apple, Google, Paypal among others)  information on users download history and to confirm whether they have  any application in their devices related to any cryptocurrency.

The  United States is considered one of the countries with most transactions  in LocalBitcoin, therefore, they have placed more regulations and laws  when making this type of transactions. In 2018, the US Supreme Court  debated the future of Bitcoin for the first time, and this and other  cryptocurrencies are regulated under United States law.

The  treasury of the United States classified in 2013, that Bitcoin is a  convertible decentralized virtual currency. The Commodity Futures  Trading Commission, CFTC, classified bitcoin as a good or asset in  September 2015.

The  US government has required all monetary service companies, such as, for  example, exchanges, which carry out considerable transactions in the  region, to meet several requirements:

 Register in the FinCEN.

 Design an anti-money laundering (AML) program.

 Maintain record and make reports in case of suspicious activity (SAR). US FinCEN receives 1,500 SARs per month.

 Make and deliver reports of digital currency transactions (CTR).

# Regulations In Canada

Currently,  cryptocurrencies are not considered as legal tender, although their  exchange is, depending on the province. Since 2013, the Canada Revenue  Agency has taxed the cryptocurrency transactions depending on the type  of activity. Canada was one of the first countries to draw up  cryptocurrency legislation, which designated exchanges as money service  businesses, where they have to follow with anti-money laundering and  know-your-client requirements among others.

# Regulations In The European Union

Cryptocurrencies  are legal, depending on the country the regulations will change.  Exchange houses are currently not regulated at the regional level. In  some cases, the exchanges have to register with the regulators of each  country, where they grant these companies authorizations to operate  legally within the jurisdiction of each country. In addition, each  jurisdiction has different tax systems, which charge citizens taxes  from the profits of the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency that ranges  from 0% -50%.

# Regulations In Australia

In  Australia cryptocurrencies (treated as property) and exchanges are  considered legal; In 2017 the Australian Senate declared the legality of  cryptocurrencies and are subject of Capital Gains Tax. The same year,  they began debating statutes for anti-money laundering to the countrys  cryptocurrency exchanges; by the end of the year, cryptocurrency  exchanges have to register with the countrys financial intelligence  agency Austrac where they have to verify the user identity and other  requirements. Currently, there are no regulations for the use of digital  money as a payment method.

# In conclusion

Consequently  to the economic collapses that many developing countries have been  through, there is a need for a stable economic structure that is not  easily influenced by its environment. The blockchain has provided  solutions to this need and many users from all over the world have had  to resort to this economic model, as, for example, Third World  countries, which suffer inflation, exchange controls, economic  regulations by their governments, among other problems. Telos Blockchain  has come to give an economical alternative to the user for the best  management of their assets and their patrimony with a reliable and safe  model, unlike other blockchains that have fallen into fraud, scams,  money laundering among others, many countries have taken action on the  matter and have placed regulations and laws that control possible  security flaws in this model, such as unlawful acts.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Change can occur very quickly in 1000 years.                                                                                                  \~ (years of code code)

Eventually, humanity will achieve AI capable of thought and learning that is relatively limitless.

At some point, it's probable that AI would be available for at-home use - such as a teacher, or babysitter.

""High End"" models at one point might do multiple and complex tasks.

Each year, the ""High End"" models improve.

This would add up for a Long time.                                                                                                                    \~ (years of code code)

Maybe More.

Maybe Less.

...At some point, basically having a human slave in the form of an AI would become normalized.

Such as every family home had a flatscreen T.V. or Roomba in the year 2019.

Is an AI nanny, taking care of child

either with human touch .

or that born of necessity.

artificial and non-humanoid.

Or the Robot taxi Drivers

Be they the car itself.

Or a ""More Human"" ad campaign by a Taxi Co.

Many similar \*things\* are commonplace.

//I have to be way more literal for a second. I am saying that these AI entities are not human, but they aren't

//really just objects either. They would be an entirely new type of intelligence. One different from our own.

//In this theorized time to think of them as things may be considered long outdated or still be the mainstream belief.

//I can't fathom what the viewpoint will be on this matter at that time.

Eventually, humanity would have to Decide at Some Point.

Should These **~~SLAVE~~** **AI**:

look more like humans || not look like Humans                                               \~(years of code)

A. As Long as humanity uses and depends on computers, this will be an issue in the somewhat far future (from 2019).

Possibly a millennium from now.

Possibly More.

Possibly Less.

At some point from that far future's Far Future. AI and Humanity could have diverged to some degree.

Now I ask You again:

Should These **~~SLAVE~~** **AI** *that have diverged from humanity*:

look more like humans || not look like Humans                                         \~ (years of code)

A. Were I in this situation.

I would prefer that these AI ***do not*** look like humans.

Why should they look human?

If at some point there were war.

Why would we want to fear another human.

It's easier to suss out a computer or things that are more artificial looking.

Than it is an indistinguishable individual in this witchhunt scenario.

Again, if I were in this situation.

I would rather be able to work with other people to kill this foreign enemy in outright war.

Than wonder who I can trust.

Who will be next?                                                                                                                                                             \~ (years of code)

Now I ask you again:

- is there any hope if this becomes global?

One of the understated headlines in last year's [**IPCC report**](https://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf) was that global emissions of carbon dioxide must peak by 2020 to keep the planet below 1.5C.

Current plans are nowhere near strong enough to keep temperatures below the so-called safe limit. Right now, we are heading towards 3C of heating by 2100 not 1.5.

As countries usually scope out their plans over five and 10 year time-frames, if the 45% carbon cut target by 2030 is to be met then the plans really need to be on the table by the end of 2020.

BUT

I have recently come across several articles which SEEM to say that another way to 'FIX' our climate(or at the very least, BUY US SOME TIME) we would have to plant 1 TRILLION trees around the world, which would reduce emissions in the air.

 [https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/conservation/issues/planting-trillion-trees.htm](https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/conservation/issues/planting-trillion-trees.htm) 

 [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/29/ethiopia-plants-250m-trees-in-a-day-to-help-tackle-climate-crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/29/ethiopia-plants-250m-trees-in-a-day-to-help-tackle-climate-crisis) 

So, which is true? Are both true at the same time?  If both are true, why is this not discussed more in the main stream media? And why haven't we begun to SERIOUSLY plant millions of trees yet outside of Ethiopia it seems?!  It seems like such an easy(and far cheaper) solution than having to implement 'Green New Deals' across the world in a short time frame.

We should be planting trees AND moving to green economies, not just 1 of these options",15,5,False,self,,,,,

While I'm aware the idea has baggage, such as from poorly thought out, conspiratorial cinematography, I still think it's a sound idea, and there are a few reasons why.

In essence, an RBE is an economy void of money, debt, trade, or servitude, where all goods and services are freely accessible to all. Sounds utopian doesn't it?

The first challenge we come to face is so called ""economic calculation"". Today, this is determined via price, which isn't pinned by any ""laws"" of economics or what have you. Bottom line to you market fundies out there, companies don't care what price consumers want something to be, businesses will price such how they wish, because they have the power to do so.

If we are to eliminate money, we need an alternative system of resource accounting, and I don't mean a few government bureaucrats sitting around a table deciding what goes where. I feel the meme is appropriate here, modern problems require modern solutions. Today, we use powerful computers to do a wide range of things, from conducting simulations, to predicting the weather, to tracking trends in stock markets (which is a shining example of how computers work well in making predictions in volatile scenarios), I could go on. So, if computers can do this, why not economic calculation? Before the 70s coup, Chile tested this for a limited time, imagine what we could do now.

These systems could either be centralised or decentralised. I prefer decentralisation, as there is less fallout in the event of failure, and breaking up the task of economic calculation into small manageable chunks, could make things a lot easier.

What about trade?

Today, our economy is structured around the presence of relative scarcity. However, this state is proving difficult to maintain. With advanced methods of recycling, 3D printing, and modern farming and energy generation techniques on the rise, the paradigm of scarcity is beginning to fade. I find it laughable that we waste 30% of our food, yet millions around the world still go hungry. We have water scarcity on a planet covered in filterable saline. We have a big fuck-off burning ball of hydrogen in the sky that provided abundant en they, yet we still rely on damaging and inefficient fossil fuels. 

Technologically speaking, we have the potential to create a freely abundant supply of resources, while being highly sustainable in doing so.

Instead of trade, in a resource based economy, we would embrace the economics of abundance, forgoing property norms in favour of free access, open sourcing, and other things.

If you want to find out more, you can check out my channel, where I go into a lot more detail on the topic.

There are huge problems to be solved or diminished in some way. Humanity needs to adapt to the new situation. And yes, people and parts of nature will die of circumstances mankind could and should have avoided. 

But does fear really help (like Greta Thunberg said)?

Let me preface this by defining ""great people"" as those of the likes of Albert Einstein with scientific theory and Alan Turing with computing theory, or Nikola Tesla with electrical theory. The people that make significant advances, no matter the field or their identity.

When considering items we've recovered that show creations that ""shouldn't exist"" in terms of knowledge such as this ""[2000 year old computer](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/12/the-search-for-lost-knowledge/506879/)"", what I'm not seeing enough of is the realisation that this could very well happen again.

Global Warming will eventually kill massive amounts of people, if not all that we can account for, if it isn't stopped. Countries and cultures will disappear and things will need to be found and ""recovered from the past"" again, and we will lose a small or large part of what we as a collective know in the process; including one or more inventions or ideas that hasn't been publicized or well documented yet, whatever that may be.

I would also like to mention the ""lost, but not ancient civilisations"" such as the ""[Uncontacted Peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples)
Mentioning these groups is imperative to my theory.

Applying what history shows in these ""advanced ancient civilisations"", and assuming humanity evolves and develops into this ""advanced society"" we're currently in with abundant and advanced medicine, science and art all over again...

We must consider, what are we risking by effectively ignoring what could be the downfall of humanity as we know it?
Are we risking not only the lives and culture of the future generations and ""great people"", but those of the distant future?

To put it simply; is history doomed to repeat itself or will humanity and it's leaders collectively decide to truly evolve?

UAVs can fly cheaper and faster than manned aircraft because they don't need to support human life. Similarly, ground vehicles that don't support passengers may accomplish specialized tasks more efficiently. For example, cargo trucking: how much energy and manufacturing cost can be saved when seats, air conditioning, passenger doors, etc. don't have to be included? The truck would be a box with a computer on wheels.

In addition to reduced overhead, self-driving technology can also dramatically change vehicle design decisions. When user-friendliness isn't a requirement, even the back wheels on vehicle could turn for parking or edge-cases while driving.

I am thrilled to announce the Alpha Launch of Pekka, a shared distributed computing platform. Pekka allows users to make money with their computer when they are not using it. Pekka is a platform for you to rent out your computing power to those who need a little extra boost in completing tasks such as 3D rendering or running Machine Learning scripts. These tasks could take hours or even days on weaker computers such as laptops. Using Pekka, they can upload their task, choose your machine, and pay you for its time. We estimate that by providing a powerful computer to the Pekka marketplace can make up to USD50/day! Pekka will be hosted on our very own blockchain network - Canonchain. This enables fast, cheap, and reliable transactions that are vastly superior to the current cloud providers such as Google and AWS. 
If you would like to learn more, check out these Medium articles about Pekka:

Pekka has been in development for over a year now and we are excited to invite you all to join the Alpha Launch. We want to hear from you! Your thoughts, concerns, and any issues that you come across. Your feedback is invaluable to us on our journey to make Pekka the best if can be. We have an incentive program running at the moment for Alpha Launch users so join now to take advantage of it.

This generated hundreds of replies on the subject of stopping aging.  Many said it was impossible, others said it would only be for certain people based on availability, connections, price point.  Still others brought up logarithmic population growth, implications to over population if any, and sterilization.  It was an in depth conversation, and I wanted to take the time to develop a depot of research on the subject so that everyone can be as informed on the subject as possible, and continue the discussion in that light.  It's very hard to search for some of these papers in general web browsing since stopping aging will almost certainly return beauty product ads mostly.  So here are some relevant stories and studies on the human development of immortality:

As above. I'm no expert on agriculture, but this is something that I find really exciting. Agricultural land use is currently a major driver of climate change - transport and use of mineral fertilizers, loss of topsoil (topsoil is high-carbon; losing topsoil means a lot of that carbon is going into the atmosphere), inefficient use of land to produce food to feed cattle. Reversing all of these could mean turning vast tracts of our land into carbon sinks that also feed us more sustainably.",80,483,False,self,,,,,

Buildings are zoned based on levels, so levels 10-25 and 45-60 could be a hospital precinct. So that hospital facility straddles buildings. Buildings are zoned so that they have shops, commercial offices and living spaces. You live high up in an apartment, you walk downwards, upwards, north, east, south, west to get to nearby buildings. Skyscrapers have pedestrian indoor footpaths around the outside of the buildings that link between buildings regularly as you go up the skyscraper. Some buildings would have Road encscribed buildings so that vehicles can get up to higher floors of the skyscraper. Would have to lay out the buildings and pathways so that light can get to everyone.

What credit cards are meant to be - Credit cards are loaded with credit for branded things that you need to live on.

Life subscription - within your life you subscribe to different standards of living. This is a basket of things you have bought for your life. These are branded statements of life that you can buy. You go through a life search engine and find things you want in your life and pick them out of a catalogue. A placement company assigns you to positions within society to take, to get what you want. Each job, job title, salary is linked to every item in the life subscription. So you you can only pick what you can afford given your job. If you pick some thing out of your reach, you are told what you must do to get career progression to get what you want in the life catalogues.

I eat at a midtier restaurant once every two weeks = gets you a free meal and a table in that midtier restaurant brand restaurants. I buy a coffee everyday on the way to work. I travel to work by car/public transport. I drive this kind of car. I live in the suburbs. Or I live in the city centre. I drink this brand coffee. My job title is a X at Y. This means I can afford these things. I live in this kind of house. You can go into a shop and since you've subscribed to that brand coffee, you get it without doing a sale, as you've bought it from life credit.

You earn credit with different companies, from adverts, promotions and sticking to the same brand. Advertisements become instant purchases of credit. Corporate welfare, business perks are outsourced to placement companies that serve the public. Everyone can buy and enjoy corporate benefits.

Strip malls are good - if connected by high speed rail and fast road systems. And have skyscrapers above them. People commute to strip malls to get to work. If you do not work in that particular strip mall, you still have good parking near local shops and good links to other offices.

Society learns that borders delineate acceptability. It's what a neighbourhood is. What is acceptable or what people like within a set of borders, block level, strip mall level, street level, floor level.

People bet on what they want, not what makes the most money and it becomes a form of voting which provides funding for said ideas for both sides. Betting forms the basis of rules that you have chosen to live by.

Parallel societies - societies can fragment by what is wanted by each neighbourhood. You can create a new neighbourhood by living in a place with a set of beliefs, a placement company would try place you near to people who believe the same things as you. Everyone gets what they want.

I want to be 15 minutes of work walking. I want to be 5 minutes away from local shops. I want to be within 10 minutes of doctors. I want to be around this kind of people. All this has a cost and a set of positions to take to get what I want.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

If you're able to escape to a different purpose it still revolves around your capacity to earn money, which usually is driven by a consumer based economy, pay taxes, and die.

If you're an artist, you are typically only making money if your art can make money for someone. For video games, if there isn't a profit involved then it doesn't get made. People sacrifice quality and passion to drive profits. But what are these profits after all? Essentially they're the individual's ability to amass more wealth and that wealth is used to amass more consumer goods. 

What if, instead, a higher emphasis were placed on advancing science and technology for the betterment of all of the planet? If everyone looked away from consumer goods and could contribute to a higher purpose, then even mind numbing jobs would have more meaning than simply acquiring wealth for consumerism and survival. Instead, now you're working to improve the advancement of all of humanity, because your tax contributions are focused on giving all of humanity greater advancements in science and medicine and tech which would, in turn, make life easier and enriched for everyone. 

The excess wealth would not be amassed by individuals which is sat on and squandered, but it would expand and enrich these pursuits which have the sole purpose of automating processes and providing solutions to problems which all humans face. 

Imagine if a medical program had trillions of dollars at its disposal worth of power, instead of a few hundred humans having that wealth between themselves for no reason other than that they invested it half a century ago? 

I know this is a radical attack on our current principles and economics but I think that we need to make a drastic shift because the rates of suicide and depression are very obvious indicators that humans are not content with slavery to a perpetual system of stepping on each other for the sake of profits and increasing individual bank accounts. 

Cant we, instead of fighting for a better future, work towards sincerely creating as close to a utopia as possible without individual wealth and power being a concern? What if there is simply a solution through future tech that every human can experience happiness and have all of the necessities they require for a healthy and fulfilling life? What if it doesn't involve owning mansions and drowning in excess? What if that could be experienced through future virtual reality for personal pleasure instead of actual reality at the expense of so many billions of humans lives?

I think we have come to a point where this is actually possible. Maybe not in the next ten years. But I think it is something that can be worked towards. It would involve cooperation and genuine interest in providing our societies most brilliant minds with the propensity they need to achieve the greatest groundbreaking achievements possible in the shortest amount of time. 

Currently many limitations in science, medicine, and technology are set by financial limits. Why should this be the case? I think that our planet has enough resources and enough hard working and intelligent people that we could achieve a far greater version of life than the average person currently experiences. Imagine instead of having to choose between buying a new fancy car and a new fancy house if you were already content and happy with what you have and you were able to choose how you spend your free time with your friends and family? I think time is more valuable than the pursuit of consumer goods. We could provide much needed time and peace of mind to more people if our science and tech allowed us to. 

Why do we not have bright minds focused towards these pursuits by giving them the tools they need to do so? We put so much emphasis on working long hours to amass wealth to make the next expensive clothing or the next fast car or the next big television, but these things are empty temporary pleasures that have very little happiness value compared to a harmonious society where people rely on advanced technologies of the future which are no longer a dream because we have all contributed to making them real here and now instead of simply wishing. 

It would be possible for everyone to have everything they could dream of in an advanced virtual reality for example. Why do we need physical goods and waste and byproducts of waste as things and stuff just grow obsolete or damaged and constantly replaced by the next shiny things and stuff? 

This is a little bit of a rambling but it's an idea I had and thought I'd share it. Maybe I'm not able to make sense of this idea any better. Perhaps some of you can throw your ideas out there as well. Even if we are just dreaming, I think dreams are important and eventually become reality when people see incentive in them. A lot of talk of socialism seems to still revolve around profits and an archaic sense of monetary wealth.

My situation is pretty much explained in title. 

I realized last year only how bad the next 50 years can be, since then i've been trying to reduce my carbon footprint as much as i can. Problem is, my parents arent taking my efforts seriously at all. When i refused to fly with them during holidays, they told me i should stop with the ""childish vendetta"" for example. They arent stupid, they know climate change is a problem. They just dont know how big of a deal it is and how impactful it'll grow to be.

Anyway. Ive been looking for some chart i could show them to make them realize. It must be concise and from a credible source. Preferably, it must focus on the consequences of climate change (Health issues, geopolitical conflits, famines,...) and not on the problem itself (Rising temperatures). 

Ive tried googling obviously, but most results ive come accross are either too scientific for them to bother reading or not from a trustworthy source.

Next,  AI would play a big role in human civilization this means that AI would be used to occupy many tasks that humans use to do like working in gas stations or retail.  This may happen due to people suffering from heart strokes in the summer or insufficient clothing in the winter this may result in their deaths. AI would serve as a partner,  friend or employee. this in turn would lead to AI gaining self awareness and may cause rebellion against human society,  AI could be a tool, weapon or ally if one chooses to.

AI could dominate over most human tasks in turn shutting the doors to retail and opening it to online retailers this would mean that most computational tasks would be left for an AI to do rather than manual labor, Virtual Reality would play a vital role in companies and organizations as well for casual use.  Companies and organizations  would use an online space to meet up instead of physically being there, most people would work from home and some would use Virtual Reality for a sort of escape from a miserable world that most would live in by then.

This is of course post-AGI, post biology. While at some point we may have multiple AGIs, due to competition for resources and differences in goals it would be inevitable that it makes most sense for an AI to take over or destroy the other competing AIs. 

Even in circumstances where light speed will mean a single thinking machine would be impossible, an AI would still take special measures to keep its various instances in sync (maybe via a digital signature of sorts), so as to avoid drift of purpose and goals and future competition.

The TEDP is a  set of financial measures intended to boost the adoption, use, and  value of the Telos Blockchain Network, and it became effective as of  July 27, 2019, approved with 11,198,665 yes votes, representing a 96.9%  of the total votes cast. 

[**IMAGE: Telos Economic Development Plan (TEDP)**](https://miro.medium.com/max/488/1*6VyytJdI0GRgZIUGOFnBfg.jpeg)

This  plan is fundamented on making Telos the first blockchain with 0%  inflation, by modifying the method by which Block Producer are payed and  Worker Proposal are funded; then is the implementation of REX rewards  exchange a platform enabling token holders to stake their tokens within  the network in exchange for up to 30% profits; TEDP also states that  tokens from deleted of nullified EOS snapshot accounts shall now be  transferred to the Exchange Token Reserve Fund (ETRF), from where they  will be distributed among other funds such as BP pay and WP funding at a  maximum monthly rate. This changes will be further described in the  article.

One  of the major changes introduced by the TEDP to the network, as  mentioned above, is a major modification on the BPs payment and the WP  funding. Before this plan was activated, the funds for BPs and WP was  disbursed from ETRF, at a rate of 6% annual inflation for the first and  1.5% annual inflation for the latter. This inflation is calculated over  the entire value of the Telos blockchain as measured in TLOS tokens.  With the TEDP, for as long as funds are available in the ETRF, a maximum  of 5,260,000 TLOS per month may be distributed thus allowing for a 0%  inflation for an estimated 5 years. These TLOS will be distributed as  follows:

  An amount equal to 1.5% inflation and up to 1,000,000 TLOS per month to  the Telos Worker Proposal Fund account named eosio.saving. This rate  may be adjusted by a 2/3+1 vote of the Block Producers provided it does  not exceed the limits set in Clause 49 Telos Economic Development.

 Up to 1,000,000 TLOS per month to the Telos Foundation account named tf.

  Up to 500,000 TLOS per month to the Economic Development Fund account  named econdevfunds to be disbursed for the further economic  development of Telos as voted by 2/3+1 of the Block Producers.

 An amount equal to 6% inflation and up to 1,760,000 TLOS per month to the Block Producer pay fund account named eosio.bpay.

  Up to 1,000,000 TLOS to the Resource Exchange fund account named  eosio.rex to provide an additional incentive to Members staking  resources to that fund.

The  proposal dictates that any modification of existing clauses and the  amounts of TLOS disbursed shall be voted by BPs with an approval by a  majority vote of 2/3 + 1 .

Specifically, the four clauses modified are the following:

 Clause 10: Payment to Block Producer

 Clause 23: Requirement to participate as a member

 Clause 24: Worker Proposals Fund

 Clause 44: Exchange of resources

The new clause is the following:

 Clause 49: Telos Economic Development

A  comparison between the original clauses in the Telos Blokchain Network  Operating Agreement (TBNOA) and the amends passed by the TEDP, including  details of the new clause, is shown below.

[**IMAGE: TEDP Benefits**](https://miro.medium.com/max/488/1*NznnbHnr-Fr97zPU0K8x6w.jpeg)

 

**Clause 10: Payment to Block Producer**

The  payment of the Block Producers that, both active and standby, will  continue to be the equivalent of a 6% annual inflation, and will be  disbursed from the Exchange Token Reserve, as long as funds are  available, as a preferred method to creating new tokens.

**Original Clause:**Block  Producer and Standby Block Producers shall be paid each day from a  daily fund consisting of the daily share of 1% annual inflation (the BP  Inflation Rate) of the entire value of the Telos blockchain as  measured in TLOS tokens. Every day, this total amount shall be allocated  such that each Block Producer receives the same pay for the time spent  as a Block Producer as every other Block Producer and each Standby  receives pay that is half of the rate of each Block Producer for its  time spent as a Standby, with the provision that Block Producers and  Standby Block Producers may have their daily pay allotment deducted in  proportion with the percentage of blocks they were expected to produce  in their most recent production period of 180,000 blocks (approximately  24 hours) or fewer, but failed to produce. Loss of pay from failing to  regularly execute the claimrewards action, shall be borne by the Block  Producer or Standby Block Producer, not the network. For blocks  1,000,001 (activation) through block 22,000,000 (approximately 122  days), the BP Inflation Rate shall be equivalent of 4% annually instead  of 1%. For blocks 22,000,001 through block 43,000,000 (approximately 122  days), the BP Inflation Rate shall be equivalent of 3% annually instead  of 1%. For blocks 43,000,001 through block 64,000,000 (approximately  122 days), the BP Inflation Rate shall be equivalent of 2% annually  instead of 1%.

**TEDP Clause 10 Amend: **For  as long as funds exist in the Exchange Token Reserve Fund account named  exrsrv.tf, the aggregate amount of pay for all Block Producers and  Standby Block Producers shall be drawn from that fund preferentially to  creating new TLOS tokens to pay into the Block Producer pay account  named eosio.bpay at a rate equivalent to 6% annual inflation. This  rate may be adjusted by a 2/3+1 vote of the Block Producers provided it  does not exceed the limits set in Clause 49 Telos Economic  Development.

**Clause 23: Requirement to participate as a member**

All  unclaimed EOS Snapshot accounts will be deleted by the BPs and the  tokens that were within those unclaimed accounts will be transferred to  the ETRF instead of being deleted.

**Original Clause:** The  Telos Initial Distribution will include all accounts from the EOS  Snapshot. However, it is unknown which EOS Snapshot account owners may  wish to opt in and become Members of the Telos network. Because all  token holders must agree to become Members by accepting the mutual  representations of this Agreement, accounts that have no transactions  63,000,000 blocks (approximately 365 days) after the activation of the  Telos network are subject to deletion by the Block Producers at that  time or in the future, provided no transactions have yet been made.  Tokens in any deleted accounts will be deleted from the blockchain.

**TEDP Clause 23 Amend:** Tokens  in any deleted or nullified accounts will be removed from those  accounts and deposited in the Exchange Token Reserve Fund account named  exrsrv.tf.

**Clause 24: Worker Proposal Fund**

The  funds allocated to the worker proposal will be obtained from the  Exchange Token Reserve Fund account at a rate not less than 1.5% annual  inflation or above the limit of 1,000,000 TLOS per month, which is  approved and can be modified by BPs. This means that the worker  proposals funds will no longer accrue from inflation.

**Original Clause:** A  value equal to the daily share of 1.5% annual inflation of the entire  value of the Telos blockchain as measured in TLOS tokens shall be  deposited to an account on the Telos 8 Network with the account name of  eosio.savings (the Worker Proposal Fund) each day.

**TEDP Clause 24 Amend:** For  as long as funds exist in the Exchange Token Reserve Fund (exrsrv.tf),  funds for the Worker Proposal Fund shall be drawn from the Exchange  Token Reserve Fund preferentially to creating new TLOS tokens at a rate  of 1,000,000 TLOS per month. This rate may be adjusted by a 2/3+1 vote  of the Block Producers provided it does not exceed the limits set in  Clause 49 Telos Economic Development.

**Clause 44: Exchange of resources**

The  TLOS token holders will now be able to generate new income through the  Telos REX market, which allows investors to obtain up to 30% of ROI in  TLOS through interest granted for lending their resources to the system.  In addition, it gives the investors the option to reinvest their  earnings and keep active those TLOS instead of storing them (compound  reinvesting). This clause can be modified with a majority vote of 2/3 + 1  by the current BPs of the network. The payment to the investors shall  be disbursed from the Resource Exchange account, that isreplenished with  up to 1,000,000 TLOS per monthfrom the ETRF .

**Original Clause:** Upon  a 2/3+1 majority vote by the then current Block Producers to do so,  computer code and/or contracts enabling a Resource Exchange for  staking an accounts system resources to a common exchange which leases  or rents out said resources to others for a fee (even a zero value fee)  and disburses said fees to all resource-staking Members in return for an  equal percentage of network income from RAM transaction fees, name  bidding fees, or any other fee for commonly owned or managed Telos  resources shall be implemented in the Telos Blockchain Network computer  code and/or contracts. The form of this Resource Exchange may be  modified or removed in the future upon a 2/3+1 majority vote by the then  current Block Producers.

**TEDP Clause 44 Amend: **For  as long as funds exist in the Exchange Token Reserve Fund named  exrsrv.tf, funds from that account may be deposited into the Resource  Exchange account named eosio.rex for disbursement at a rate of  1,000,000 TLOS per month. This rate may be adjusted by a 2/3+1 vote of  the Block Producers provided it does not exceed the limits set in Clause  49 Telos Economic Development.

**Clause 49: Telos Economic Development**

The  amend on this clause dictates the use of the ETRF for the purposes of  the TEDP and is the one that establishes the maximum TLOS tokens to be  disbursed and exactly how much of them is directed for WP funding, BP  payment, Telos Foundation, the REX program and the Economic Development  account.

**TEDP Cause 49: **Any  funds in the Exchange Token Reserve Fund account (named exrsrv.tf)  that have not been claimed by exchanges by block 30,000,000 are subject  to use for purposes of the economic development of Telos, at the  discretion of 2/3+1 of the Block Producers, provided that the total  amount of funds disbursed does not exceed 5,260,000 TLOS per month.  While funds are used for such economic development purposes, no new TLOS  tokens will be created as inflation for Block Producer pay or Worker  Proposal Fund savings. Such funds may be distributed as follows: up to  1,000,000 TLOS per month to the Telos Worker Proposal Fund account named  eosio.saving; up to 1,000,000 TLOS per month to the Telos Foundation  account named tf; up to 500,000 TLOS per month to the Economic  Development Fund account named econdevfunds such funds to be disbursed  for the further economic development of Telos as voted by 2/3+1 of the  Block Producers; up to 1,760,000 TLOS per month to the Block Producer  pay fund account named eosio.bpay; and up to 1,000,000 TLOS to the  Resource Exchange fund account named eosio.rex to provide an  additional incentive to Members staking resources to that fund. Such  disbursement of any of these permitted funds may occur directly from the  Exchange Token Reserve Fund or through intermediary accounts expressly  designed for the purpose of programmatically disbursing such funds.  Exchanges which held EOS tokens for their customers as of the EOS  genesis snapshot time may continue to claim tokens from the Exchange  Token Reserve Fund subject to the approval of a 2/3+1 vote of the Block  Producers.

The  passing, and even the development, of the TEDP shows the dedication of  the Telos community towards the blockchain and their conviction on  continuously updating and improving it for the benefit of all the  stakeholders. The financial measures undertaken by the TEDP will ensure  the steady growth of the network and use that as motivation for  developers, BPs, token holders and all of the community to keep working  hard and believing in Telos.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

Real quick, here's my background so you can consider it before weighing in:

\*\*\*THINGS TO CONSIDER\*\*\*

I have no experience in the field whatsoever or in any professional field for that matter. I'm 26 and all my work experience is in the restaurant industry as either a bartender or a server :/ I had a brief stint in real estate for a little over a year but that's it really. On the positive side, I'm finishing up my bachelor's in biomedical engineering. I have a year's worth of expenses saved up and plan on quitting my job to really pursue this and learn full time. But I only have a year!

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I know, I'm not really starting with an advantage here but apparently, I have two options here. Self-teach or enroll in a Bootcamp. Considering the above circumstances, what do you think is the best route to go? 10's of thousands of dollars is A LOT of money.

Is it really possible to self teach your way into a data science job?

Are Bootcamps worth the money?

Can I teach myself and land a job within a year?",7,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm thinking about setting up some kind of prior peer-review mechanism but it would take some time. I enjoyed the ""This Week in Science"" post back then when they were still posted here but I'll stick to monthly ones if you like them. Note that if you're missing important news here the inclusion criteria is being featured in that Wikipedia list.

These threads could be used as some kind of review of the science and technology of the last month.

1)Create a geostationary graphene or carbon fiber tube 60-400 miles long positioned between vacuum of space, low Earth orbit and just below the Ionosphere (low enough to allow CO2 filled baloons \[mildly rocket boosted?\] to reach and attach to an airlock). 

2) CO2 would be pulled through the vacuum and crystallize/freeze as it reaches the edge of the siphon -- pumped with solar powered pump equipment -- wouldn't take much force? Or use mirror array pointed at tube to increase temp pressure gradient of siphon to aid CO2 delivery to the vacuum?

3) space robots collect the crystallized CO2 and then it is rocketed to mars (maybe an ion nuclear ion thruster that gets to Mars atmosphere penetration speed, offloads cargo and then returns to assembly station)?

4) solve the CO2 problem on Earth while simultaneously terraforming the Martian atmosphere sans nuclear bombs?

How feasible is this idea?

We like the things we like and we watch the videos that are interesting to us. 

As Cambridge Analytica demonstrated in a rather uncomfortable way, our data can be interpreted and applied in malicous ways. Yet I believe there is better ways to utilize this data for a more philanthropical purpose. 

If we make an AI rate your behaviour on psychological traits and personality types (as Cambridge Analytica already did), with enough data, one could make the perfect matchmaker.

The reason that this doesn't exist yet, is most likely that it's not a business model, no one would be able to make money of this. If we look at Tinder, a matchmaker that let's you buy a 3 or 12 month plan, depending on how long you think you'll be single, that's just ridiculous.

Also unlike regular matchmakers you do not construct your own image, you don't really get to choose how you portray yourself as it's your behaviour that's measured. Thus the AI would use a more true image of yourself to find a match that is more personalized than any other matchmaker could manage.

His astute analysis of economics suggests that highly-expensive tasks will only be completed if one or both of the following is true:

* Completion of the task is necessary for the survival of a large number of people;
* Completion of the task is expected to result in economic benefits which outweigh costs and render the endeavor profitable.

Colonization of other planets is an immensely costly, dangerous, and time-consuming activity. It is likely to remain so for the conceivable future. Human travel to Mars, for instance, is theoretically possible; the barriers are financial and political, not technical.

This essay proposes that the most compelling reason for planetary colonization is not profit, nor exploration, nor scientific advancement, nor the geopolitical benefits of large-scale cooperation, nor the opportunity to extend ones military might, but rather *the opportunity to allow citizens who are discontent with the status quo on Earth to establish their own civilizations*. Consider two children playing in a small sandbox: the first child (the ruler of the sandbox) has sculpted the entire sandbox into a castle, while the second child (the discontented) is unhappy with this and would rather sculpt a sandbox-spanning platypus. How will this conflict be handled? The children might divide up the sandbox, destroying part of the castle to make room for a small-scale platypus. They might come to blows, with one emerging the victor and the other the loser. Yet neither of these options will leave both children fully satisfied; the more democratic option (sandbox sub-division) will lead to ever-less-satisfied children if more and more join the sandbox, each one with conflicting ideas.

It is exceedingly obvious that many people living in industrial and post-industrial societies are unhappy with the *status quo*. Perhaps they dont like the system of government, or economic order, or laws. Perhaps theyre unhappy with the ethnic or racial makeup of their country. Perhaps they object to the religion or cultural norms that surround them. This essay is not an attempt to articulate and classify every possible complaint about every modern society; nor does it seek to evaluate the reasonableness of specific grievances; nor does it argue about the correctness or incorrectness of any particular government policy, religious belief, cultural practice, or similar.

Rather, the argument is simply this: The easiest thing to change about another person is his distance from you. When a minority group disagrees with the policies of the majority, its often best for *everyone* involved if that minority group leaves in peace and pursues its goals somewhere else.

The United States is an important case. The Homestead Act of 1862 was enacted by Congressmen who subscribed to the safety valve theory. These men believed that discontent over land prices, wages, wealth inequality, immigration, and similar would be best handled if the discontented simply moved to the Frontier, where they could do things their own way. A woman who was upset about her wages as a farmhand could create her *own* farm; a man who quarreled with his landlord could build his *own* house; etc.

The end of the Frontier in the United States has directly resulted in increased strife. Much of the political and social turmoil we face could be averted if, for example, Socialists could go off on their own and build Socialist nations, and Libertarians could go off on their own and build Libertarian nations, and so-on and so-forth. Without space colonization, this isnt possible; theres no substantial amount of unclaimed land for the taking anywhere on Earth, which means that anyone who wants to build a socialist (or libertarian, or communist, or monarchist, or theocratic, etc.) society will inevitably be in conflict with others.

Space offers this opportunity. Space is also a true frontier, whereas the West in the United States was more of a pseudo-frontier: Europeans who moved West may have avoided strife with other Europeans, but their actions caused catastrophic harm to the native inhabitants. Space offers the opportunity for dissidents to establish their own societies fully from scratch, without conflict with the societies from which they originated, and without the need to massacre the locals.

This isnt to argue that we ought to round up misfits and dissidents, strap them to rockets, and forcefully deport them from Earth in order to ensure domestic tranquility. Nor is it an assertion that departing emigrants be allowed to kidnap unwilling citizens for slave labor or somesuch. It is merely an argument that, if we as a society make interplanetary colonization practical and reasonably attractive, then those who disagree with the *status quo* (for the right or wrong reasons) are likely to leave Earth and set up their own colonies with like-minded people. This is often the best solution for all parties: We need not put up with them. They need not put up with us. We need not come to a compromise which will leave both sides dissatisfied. They need not fight bloody wars. We need not endure revolutions.

Theres something to be said for compromise, but theres also something to be said for allowing groups with irreconcilable differences to go their separate ways. This isnt to say that, if we find someone planning to bomb a (church/mosque/synagogue/PETA convention/barbecue), we ought to send him to space; these people need to be sent to prison, not Alpha Centurai. Such people dont pose any serious questions; we know how to deal with them; that's what we have a legal system for. The fact remains, however, that were constantly dealing with low-intensity troublemakers: people whose presence and activity is disruptive to our societies (for better or for worse), but whose conduct falls short of criminality. They dont like us; we dont like them; theyre not happy living surrounded by us; were not happy with their constant rabble-rousing. Wat do?

Sometimes, what you *really* need is a new sandbox.

Good fences make good neighbors, and theres no better fence than the vastness of space. Interplanetary colonization is vital to ensuring societal stability and cultural diversity; we all benefit from this, whether we cross entire star systems or live and die within a days walk from where we were born.

I had a vision about tokenising energy. Starting with so called calories. Imagine an economy, which is based on absolute transparent pricing. Like, the price of a sandwich for example, sums up from calories of ingredients+ calories burnt from farmer (for this unit) + calories burnt from marketing clerk and so on. 

Also the wages will be transparent and fair, as one earns just what he deserves. It is exactly tracked how much energy someone spends and how much energy it generates, also how many people buy the finished product and how much (calories, lets call em zabers after their founder) people pay for it.

Everything is in perfect balance.

What does that mean? Current focus is on the energy paradigm that got us into this mess, though that is the most important we will not get out of this mess by solving that component alone. Any and all solutions need to be explored and implemented with government funding equivalent to world war mobilization efforts. Taxation will have to increase substantially to compensate.

Efforts to focus on

* Water; Many areas need new and more robust flood management systems for wet seasons and water storage for dry seasons. Great projects possible, in great lakes, Mediterranean , and Arabic gulfs.
* Re glacierization; Very important to reduce sea level rise. How can this be done? Solar shades. Develop a standardized design that can easily be mass produced. Roll out to international community. Geo stationary, or stationary at the L1 point, to keep snow from thawing in summer. They will be an ever growing swarm having a growing effect as more are launched. Northern Canada, Greenland, Siberia, and Antarctica all target locations. Also possibility of small glacier growth in mountains using this method, and will restore water supply issues in some regions.
* Energy; Fission large scale, modular fusion, continued battery research. Focus already strongly here.
* Food; Continued condensing required agricultural land. Indoor grow ops with increased food density and genetic/ selective breeding combo to increase yields. Diet change, switch to a more plant protein diet , Indian food is a great alternative. We need to step back our footprint on nature and this is an easy place to start.
* Bio; take some level of control and ownership over the environment. Instead of protecting, which is essentially just leaving areas alone, we should aid nature in finding a new normal. By Allowing invasive species, and aiding indigenous ones through genetic or selective breeding. Fast growing trees should be planted on every unused hectare of land.
* Space; Secondary business models need to be established to truly become space faring. Economic incentive must drive this next step.Moon asteroid impact exploration and surface asteroid mining and cataloging (current value of asteroids extremely high). Secondary moon profits from H3 mining, then tourism. Lagrange point manufacturing point of interest for materials research as the unique gravitational and vacuum properties can allow for predictable, reliable process of crystallization (thinking super strong, super light metals). Inter asteroid belt water mining missions. Primary goal of space is to get all destructive process off plant, the growth of the race can only happen there, Earth must remain stagnant.
* People value; It obvious to everyone by now that automation will strip the majority of jobs away, this is why there isn't a sub section dedicated to that subject. It will happen and people will have to find a new way to have value, let alone make money. Money is easy just give everyone a set amount. But humans are hierarchical animals when left to their own devices inequalities appear from our own constructs. These inequalities can be good or bad, to avoid the possibility of bad ones we can set up a social reward system for contributing to society, science, or industry in a positive way, must be open and transparent. Hybrid system likely a good stepping stone.
* Education; obviously will be controversial but i'd like to see an AI driven classroom where every child will have a personal desktop AI to give them one on one time that can adapt to and focus a child's mind in between teachers lessons. Priming children to leverage the power of AI needs to be the new focus of education of else we will be left behind.
* AI symbiosis; Eventual merge with AI through brain implants, neural lace. This will be a new form of human condition yet to be explored, but a better option than to be at the will of AI.
* Population reduction; During this massive re mobilization of the global economy, developed countries should reject any and all immigration from countries that have a net positive population growth. We must embrace the population downturn, and leverage automation gains to benefit everyone equally. Build up then pop down. Even if we do all that to push climate change back it will still be too little, if so, the last possible resort should be a mass suicide calculate an ideal population number that will buy us enough time to stabilize the environment over the long term.

Warnings;

* Technological Ultra high speed war, driven by very fast missile that can defeat missile shields. With armed drone swarms that can quickly fly, identify, and kill targets with cold efficiency of machine logical. Using personal data to categories people as potential future threats and facial recognition technology to identify those people accurately. This method of warfare would be as effective as nuclear war but with no environmental repercussions, all enemy assets remain.
* With the availability of genetic modification technology and the future trending it to become more available. There is a real risk of engineered super bugs wiping out humanity. Mental health options should be available to everyone.

In 'pre-hybrid' society, humans are expected to abide by social norms to govern day to day life. Would the same apply to robots in a hybridised society?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/csnryo/society_gradually_hybridises_as_more_and_more/,kissasmitta,1566250450,"I recently delved into the fields Socionics and Social Robotics, and was quite intrigued by the notion of a hybridised society in which robots are not mere artefacts, or helpful machines, but practically full-blown members of society. One may argue that smart speakers like Alexa are among the first to undergo this transition, albeit very prudently.   


This gave rise to the question as to how this new society will be governed. Pre-hybridisation, social norms were in place to ensure a swift day-to-day operation. Humans were expected to abide by these norms, and if they wouldn't, sanctioning typically followed one way or another. For example, humans expect from one another to act honestly, and if not, deceptive behaviour may result in time in jail, penalties, break-ups, and so on.   


Now, would you think that smart speakers such as Alexa will also be expected to adhere to such social norms, or that  'rules' like these don't apply to these new artificial members of society? For example, if Alexa acts dishonestly and provides an individual with a recommendation that's more in the advertiser's interest than in yours, would the same expectancy of social norms apply, and would Alexa therefore be sanctioned?

I am writing this article because it might be a crazy idea, even though it might be impossible, somewhere, someone could have something with this information.

The goal is for it to be on the internet, in case someone has the same idea or can find something that is actually usable for them.

It's about ""infinite"" energy. (there are always dependencies, litteral infinite energy is not possible, as the speed of light will not be possible, but we can get as close as we can, or at least try)

Please read the pre-information to kind of follow the hypothesis.

PS: You are allowed to call me ""an idiot"", the goal is for it to be ""on the web"", not to have a working example. It is to explore a possibility and get people to discuss. Anything else it achieves = Ee ;) 

# Pre-information

Just read the following article:

 [https://hackaday.com/2019/08/22/electric-dump-truck-produces-more-energy-than-it-uses/?fbclid=IwAR1rP3sk93dC2jXBx6NImV3YW3dZ80OkJsHeQwcInMDtHPQJwyyir97lCeI](https://hackaday.com/2019/08/22/electric-dump-truck-produces-more-energy-than-it-uses/?fbclid=IwAR1Tjfz9Y8P2fPwvPb1IC8fY_50jTkvAYo3SzbeukrfeRYF0C7Ss2--cmj4)  
 

Summary:

""""""

 This isnt some impossible perpetual motion machine, either. The dump truck drives up a mountain with no load, and carries double the weight back down the mountain after getting loaded up with lime and marl to deliver to a cement plant. Since electric vehicles can recover energy through regenerative braking, rather than wasting that energy as heat in a traditional braking system, the extra weight on the way down actually delivers more energy to the batteries than the truck used on the way up the mountain. 

""""""

# The actual question

Is it possible to get infinite energy?

# The hypothesis

 Location A = Mountain  
Location B = Bottom of mountain  
Route A = A --&gt; B --&gt; It gives so much energy, you can do both Route A, Route B, and has extra energy and you have a lot of mass with you  
Route B = B --&gt; A --&gt; you have no mass with you  


Dependency route A: you have to be in Location A if you want to take this route  
Dependency route B: You have to be in location B if you want to take this route  


Energy needed for Route A : -Ea  
Energy needed for route B: -Eb

Extra energy : Ee

Energy you get from doing route A: Ea + Eb + Ee  


Let's do a calculation if you do the route A , route B and then route A and Route B again  
X = doing route A and route B, twice

(Route A + Route B) + (Route A + Route B) = X  
( ((**Ea** \+ Eb + Ee) -**Ea**) ) + ( (-Eb) + ((**Ea** \+ Eb + Ee) -**Ea**) + (-Eb) )= X  


(**Eb** \+ Ee - **Eb** )+ (**Eb** \+ Ee - **Eb**) = X  
**Ee + Ee** = X  
***2Ee = X***

So for doing the route once --&gt; you get Ee --&gt; Extra energy  


# Condition:

X is off course only possible in case you have enough materials on top of location A, or you will not have enough mass to give you enough energy to complete Ea, Eb.

so as long as you can keep this condition true, you can gain energy from your working activities.

My idea is to use a resource, we can grow ourselves. 

Stones --&gt; finite

Food --&gt; infinite??? --&gt; As long as the ground lets us harvest it

Trees --&gt; I have no clue about trees, so need someone's opinion on this. Can you keep growing trees over and over or is the groud going to fall without nourishment for the tree? Can this option deplete?

Any other resource? Cows, Chickens,...

My idea is to have a resource that is small, with not much mass following Route B, once it is there, grow over time to have more mass. Once fully grown, have it follow route A again. rinse and repeat.

This would add the following thing to the ""formula"":

Route C: When route B is being taken, and the ""source resource (could be seeds)"" is included: Ec  


Route C = -Eb - Ex

Hypothis:  
2Ee + Eb = X (and we have not gone back to take route B, we take route C instead)  
Y = X + Route C  
Y = 2Ee **+Eb** \+ (**-Eb** \-Ex)

Y = 2Ee - Ex

so as long as we keep Ex lower then 2Ee, we will keep having more and more energy.

I might see this too simple, and there will be some huge practical complications (as in growing a tree, you will have to wait several years)

But isn't this ""the formula"" for it? Am I seeing it way to simple?

Do note: I am aware of the huge dependencies. Time is one of the biggest ones. (for growing the mass over time)

The following are some opening thoughts on the issue.

I work to some degree with suicide on a regular basis and from what I can tell, there are three general camps for completions.

1 The enduring grief, predictable, suicide. People saw it coming and had been working to help the person but their drivers were pretty unavoidable. 45 percent.

2 The random, nobody saw it coming including the deceased, blip suicide. 45 percent.

3 The aging illness driven suicide, where death was coming quite soon. And it was more a question of how that person wanted to die. 10 percent.

I'm expecting that all 3 will decline as we get better at resolving medical and trauma issues. But eventually people will decide to slip into a quite different pattern.

That pattern would be more one of ennui driven suicide People that think of themselves as having drunk enough of life and that they would just rather shut themselves down forever. Just nothing feels like it is worth it.

This would partly be driven by lack of purpose, with this being sorted by feeding lives that require much less struggle as we become more rich as a society.

I sometimes wonder if we are seeing edges of this happening currently. I had a friend end her life a few days ago with that fitting the 2 category. And two other friends kill themselves over the decades. 

I'm fine about that friend dying, though grieving some. But she seemed to me to be tending more toward that newer category.

Do you think this is a pattern that will emerge more, the consciously chosen ending? I could imagine a time when it is the most common form of ending.",7,1,False,self,,,,,

When one recognizes that ethics can be thought of as a process of assigning numeric values to choices and then picking the highest value, one can bring a lot more tools of reasoning (mathematics and computer science) to bear on ethical problems.

Okay, but if one claims ethics is merely a decision algorithm, where does ethical value come from? How does one derive ought from is, if it can be so derived?

Ethical value can be derived from the acceptance of simple, self apparent moral axioms (similar to how if one accepts the peano axioms, one then has a method for systematically building a number system).

Moreover, if one takes this view of ethics, it follows that everyone already has a moral algorithm - even making decisions randomly or refusing to make decisions are still decision algorithms after all. So its not a question of whether we should base our ethics on moral assumptions - no, the question is, WHAT are we going to assume in the process of deciding how we make decisions? (Assuming we bother to put thought into it).

Tangentially, this view of morality also implies, due to Einsteins theory of relativity, that even if two people have the exact same non-trivial decision making procedure, there will always be some situations where they come to different conclusions, since information can only travel at the speed of light in the physical universe we inhabit - which sort of gives a whole new meaning to relative morality. 

Back on topic though - is there a set of ethical assumptions that might align with our decision making intuition? After all, the most practical problem in ethics is to justify peoples existing decisions. Can an ethical system be derived from assumptions that succeeds at that criteria? Well, yes, one such system might have the following assumptions (though the author is curious to hear other peoples proposed assumptions (e.g. this paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08347](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08347))): 

1. Assumption of the value of freedom
2. Assumption of the value of narrative coherence
3. Assumption of the value of fairness/justice/balance

This set of assumptions, crucially, can be formalized:

1. Freedom can be formalized by thinking of everything as finite state machines
2. Narrative coherence can be formalized as internal causative density, or causal autonomy
3. Fairness/justice can be formalized as equality of outcome in terms of freedom and narrative coherence for all those affected by a given decision

For point one, some elaboration: if a person starts at state A and has 3 state transitions available to them to states B,C, or D, they are less free than if they had 4 possible transitions. But if choices/transitions that turn into cycles, they provide less freedom than those that do not, additionally we would probably consider longer cycles to be more free than shorter ones, and choices that lead to more choices in the future to be freer as well. 

If we dont between the state transitions of animate and inanimate objects and we base our morality only on freedom, funnily enough, the heat death of the universe becomes the ultimate moral conclusion (since heat death = more and more equal distribution of energy amongst every individual particle which gives every atom/electron more possible states it can be in). So freedom by itself might lead one to conclude that setting oneself on fire is somehow moral (without any additional qualifiers)... In any case on to 2 and 3.

Lets start with 2 since the definition of 3 references points 1 and 2). Imagine a set of gears lying on a table. Why are the gears certain sizes? To emphasize either the speed or the force of whatever is turning them; the teeth lock together so the gears can work together. But sitting on the table they dont actually do those things - sitting on the table their cause is external to them. But if we then put the gears into a bicycle, suddenly the new system has a higher degree of internal causality, since the gears immediate cause is no longer external. If the bicycle was then given to someone to use on their morning commute it would then have even greater internal causality as part of that new human/bicycle system.

Of course, if a morality merely pushed internal causality its logical conclusion would be a universe filled with rube goldberg machines...  Which is why instead internal causal density should be used.

How can this be formalized? Well, it cant necessarily be formalized easily by humans, but there is a causal calculus ([http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/book-toc.html](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/book-toc.html)).

Finally we can say balance or justice has been achieved when a given decisions affords a balance between both freedom and narrative coherence in equal measure to all those participating in/affected by a given decision.

Really though, all this talk of formalizing things, is just another way of saying, we can think of moral decisions in terms of graphs (in the computer science sense, either causal graphs or finite state machine graphs). The only reason we even care is because it  means this morality is computable. That piece of intuition can both help us guess at moral reasoning when we lack sufficient computing power to arrive at a certain conclusion, as well as give us a clear pathway to improving our moral reasoning ability with technological advancements - finding a set of foundational assumptions for a moral formalism is only the beginning.

Another unspoken practical application of ethics is: what do we have to look forward to? What bright new future will our adherence to a creed offer us?

Its not widely understood, but from what could be broadly described as a human point of view, there is a relatively small number of likely/possible medium term futures. If one were simplifying those futures could be broadly reduced to: AI coexists with/ignores us and builds a space civilization while we watch, AI kills itself/disappears (and we continue living on earth more or less as we do until our eventual extinction, maybe in twenty thousand years we might also live on mars... but in the end we would never leave this solar system... and even if we did, as human civilization scales up without a concurrent increase in intelligence it will look more and more like Warhammer 40k due to increased communication overhead and individual human lives will be worth less and less), or AI kills us. Of those futures a formalized philosophical/moral thought really only has a place in the first (if AI kills itself, theres basically no hope for a much more advanced civilization than currently exists, and therefore we should all just chill out and enjoy what weve got in our own primitive way, since were really not capable of very sophisticated moral reasoning in any case (inertia being the universal primary decision making criteria of humans)).

Maybe if we give our AI ethics we can have a better chance at a free, fair, and sensible future. And one that actually has a use for the awesome amounts of computing power that might be available in the future.",8,3,False,self,,,,,

You think the amazon rainforest burning is bad? It is literally just the beginning it is nothing as what is to come.

People seem to believe global warming but think of it as something that does not effect them right now so there is more important things to talk about.

There is nothing more important, we are talking about the extinction of our species and many other.

I just wanted to talk about the extinction event that happened in the past, that was one of the worst and closest to total extinction less then 5% of species survived it.

It is called the Permian extinction also known as the great dying. How it is theorized to have happened is that, before then trees would grow however, there was not bacteria that could digest it, so when a tree died it would not decay, over millions of years it sank underground and the pressure of these billions of trees turned them into coal. During the extinction event, a supervolcano had exploded which caused the coal to burn and release emissions. It took over 10 million years for the planet to recover

Today, many of the early signs of the permian extinction are showing again. As they say if you learn history you can predict the future, except this time we are releasing more emissions from fossil fuels each year then the permian period, and yet people still say it isnt caused by humans?

Our future is very bleak and we need some very radical change, people need to be talking about this because it is the thing that matters the most, we dont have very much longer to make a change, and it will continually get worse.

It seems as though the bystander effect is in play a little. Yeah you want to help global warming but what could you even do about it?

I believe that in order to actually get our governments to take real action, wed need to get more civilians in government, people who will actually feel the impact, people who will actually care enough to create real solutions and not just another tax that changes nothing. A lot of people out there, and in this subreddit care a lot about the environment, and often propose possibly effective solutions to this serious issue, but as it stands, none of our elected career politicians are willing to take any of these proposed measures. If we want to make real change, then we need more average folks with the willingness to do what needs to be done in government. Getting elected will be a challenge for the average person, but weve seen that its definitely possible. 



We want change, but our politicians refuse to deliver. So if we really want the change, then well have to do it ourselves.

We're vaguely aware that relevant work has been done at places like Carnegie Mellon and are hoping to get some guidance.

Our two overarching goals are to discover how models are constructed and to develop a model 'calculus' describing how an agent searches the space of possible hypotheses. We want to examine these questions from a number of different perspectives, studying the means by which both human and artificial agents actually arrive at models that allow them to understand the world, as well as the ways in which they would do so were they performing optimally.

Our motivation is to probe the subtle interchange between inductive and deductive reasoning. When is it that an agent moves from merely noticing patterns in data to reasoning on the basis of an axiomatic, deductive, predictive theory? Does it work differently in different domains? Do these inflection points have common characteristics, and, if so, can we use them to form a general theory of theories?

Does this framing even make any sense?

Along the way we hope to address a number of ancillary questions. Perhaps we can arrive at a formal theory of models, or probe the similarities and differences in how artificial intelligences and humans approach the task of compressing data down into simpler representations. There are obvious connections to Thomas Kuhn, to David Hume's is/ought problem, and to vast swathes of the philosophy of science.

We'd like help locating important books, seminal papers, good overview materials, words or phrases we can Google, theorists that have pushed the field forward, anything like that.

It's amazing that they are finally rolling out some viable options for experiencing VR at long last. Despite the fact that it's currently used mostly for gaming, I think that VR isn't just a future of gaming but Life as We know It. Can you imagine this technology becoming more and more advanced to the point where we have flawless 8K VR headsets that allow us to completely delve into a world and just sit back and experience something completely different. Literally be in one place, and then put on a headset and be in another place completely?


Take fallout for example. Sure, that's a video game. But with the right technology, it can be a life experience. You can put on a headset, sitting in a lawn chair, and watch the world ending before your eyes. Tourism will extend beyond going to other countries and other places, and become heavily rooted in the most beautiful parts of video games. Can you imagine if every single video game had a tourist mode? horizon zero Dawn for example is one of the most gorgeous video games ever. What if you could just control the camera with a controller and explore the world without actually having to play it, kind of like tourism? can you imagine how incredibly powerful that would be? Video games have now become something more than a gaming experience. They've become a real destination to be enjoyed because they are artistic, and meant to be explored and seen.

I read his book Zero to One, listened to him talk on various podcasts, and generally follow what he does.  He's a really interesting guy.  I mean, the dude is a gay billionaire Republican/libertarian from Germany who made his billions in Silicon Valley.  He invented Paypal with Elon Musk and he's a Trump supporter.  Wtf, right?  He's also responsible for shutting down Gawker (Gawker outed him as gay a long time back) by funding Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against them.  There's a lot of weird, interesting, and apparently self-contradicting things about the guy. 

One of the things I've heard him say that's striking is that technological progress has slowed down.  Specifically, he talks about how our ability to create new physical things like flying cars and exotic materials has way declined.  He says that this is a huge problem for us because we need growth in order to survive.  Economic growth requires technological advancement, hence a giant looming problem for our future.

But is that true?  This does seem to be a point of contention for many inventors and entrepreneurs.

Take something like Moore's Law, which refers to the fact that CPUs double in power about every 18 months.  Many people acknowledge that Moore's Law cannot continue indefinitely.  The latest CPUs/SOCs already use a six nanometer manufacturing process.  People like Bill Joy have said that we only have something like 20-25 years left until the laws of physics prevent Moore's Law from continuing (he said this at a conference about 20 years ago).  Physics won't allow us to go much smaller than six nanometers.

The counterargument that Ray Kurzweil has put forward is that, yes, it is true that physics will prevent Moore's Law from continuing, using the current CPU paradigm.  He cites, for instance, the fact that our earliest computers were mechanical--essentially giant abacuses.  Then it was discovered that the job could be better done with vacuum tubes.  Then it was discovered that the job could be better done with solid-state semi-conducting silicon transistors.  Ray suggests the silicon transistor paradigm will be milked for what it's worth until a new paradigm is invented--perhaps some kind of massively parallel DNA-based computer, a new quantum computer model, or using the current design, but stacking CPUs on top of one another in order to keep Moore's Law in action.

I think Ray is right.  We will, somehow or another, find a way to keep Moore's Law true.  As for the lack of technological progress for manufacturing physical things--Peter has a good point.  But I suspect that the lack of progress in creating new materials and physical things is a sort of illusion.

It turns out that everything is an information process.  For this reason, I think that, provided that Moore's Law continues for another 5-10 years, we will eventually have unbelievably powerful computers.  We will, in turn, use those unbelievably powerful computers to create new materials and physical products that will be truly surprising and un-intuitive: materials and products that have unusual optical properties like invisibility; materials that are vastly stronger and more lightweight, such that they float in the air and are yet, much stronger than steel; materials that conduct electricity without loss of energy as heat; batteries with a higher energy density than gasoline. 

The lack of technological progress, I'd argue, is an illusion.  The technologies undergirding our world are making continual incrementing progress.  Every advancement of the underlying technologies goes unnoticed until a critical threshold is met, and then BAM, a giant killer app is invented, changing the world forever, apparently from out of nowhere.

That's what Youtube, iPhones, and Oculus Rifts are.  It's not as if someone suddenly had the idea to provide a streaming video service for free, or to create a tiny, touchscreen tablet with cellular modems, or to create virtual reality headsets.  It's that the underlying tech kept improving until these things became feasible.  People realized that the time was finally right to begin manufacturing these ideas.

What happened with Youtube, iPhones, and Oculus Rifts will eventually happen with all physical products.  As Moore's Law continues and as we develop the ability to very quickly and accurately model physical systems with our computers, impossible, mind-blowing physical products will eventually emerge.  We just need a bit more time, and a few more cycles of Moore's Law.

The nature of reality is that it manifests from the inside out.  There has to first be an information template.  That's what invention and innovation are.  Products begin as simulations in the mind of the inventor.  Human bodies begin in the information content of the zygote.  We use the information processing capabilities of our computers to manufacture and invent new products.  As Moore's Law continues, whether with the current paradigm of semi-conductors, or with a completely different and new paradigm, new impossible, world-changing materials and physical products will eventually emerge, and it will appear as though they came out of nowhere.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

The next level of tech social activism imo will be 'shadow editing'.  The basics of how I see this working:

UserA posts something outside of an accepted activist narrative.  Similar to shadow banning, UserA will see their own 'wrong think' post.  For the sake of argument, we'll use this as an example post:  
""I just don't buy it, climate change is not caused by humans""

UserB, a friend of UserA visits his socials and sees that UserA posted.  UserB is also a climate skeptic, but UserA's post has been shadow edited.  Now UserB sees the following post from UserA:  
""I'm starting to come around to this climate change stuff, I think it may be caused by humans""

UserA is unaware this is what his friend UserB is now viewing.  The system is smart enough to know there is 95-99%% probability UserB will see the post and not interact.  If the system knows UserA and UserB are often in off-line communication, the system will not shadow edit.  Shadow editing only needs to occur a very small percentage to have global ideological influence.  In other words, the low hanging fruit will be what is shadow edited.  This could be especially effective on a platform like Twitter, where the majority simply 'look' at content and scroll through it, the replies are also rarely read by the original poster.  

If for some reason UserB decides to confront UserA over their shadow edited statement, the system will perform a shadow edited conversation until its conclusion, likely steering the discussion into a hole.  UserA and UserB will both be seeing shadow edits as they converse.  In some cases this could go multiple levels deep.  UserA and UserB see one fake conversation among themselves and the users outside of this see even another edited conversation.

Challenges:  The system needs to be fairly unified among big tech companies.  A system would need to be in place which can track the shadow edit through possible multiple platforms.  It may need to keep the edits going across facebook, twitter, chats and even emails.  There will be terms of service changes to ensure when shadow edits are discovered that people accept it as a common good and part of the 'hate speech mechanisms', hate speech of course being whatever the big tech companies disagree with.

If any of the above mentioned aspects and the video you just watched got your attention, you are in for a great treat today. Keep on reading because you will be impressed with what I am going to share.

Email with Digital Utopian Claims

It started with an ordinary outreach email , where the media firm was asking for advertisement of their Program , but when I read through the email and the claims it made I was certain that either its another scam or something really big (i was bit inclined towards the scam thing) , quoting text from email

**We spent more than five years secretly working on its development. At the moment, it is at a beta stage and we are ready to introduce it to the community. With your help, we would like to invite as many beta testers and specialists in this sphere as possible to take part in the testing of our product. You can also help us to inform the community about the launch of our beta testing and to tell people about our unique solution.30MilesNorth PR Firm further outsourced their campaign to another marketing firm while CryptoHill.io didnt even bother to get back to me when I replied to the email. Not a good start.**

**Update:** CryptoHill contacted and outsourced 30MileNorth and not the other way.

Little I knew that my opinions would change when would visit their beta portal and as I started digging , I found the concept intriguing with potential and an actual working beta product for us to take out for a ride.

Utopia  Anti 1984 Ecosystem

**Utopia** is a decentralized peer-to-peer network, With Utopia you can send instant text and voice messages, transfer files, create group chats and channels, send emails and conduct a private discussion. Currently Utopia is an application for Windows, iOS and Linux which offers all the features within one application. Utopia users get on their **Utopia ecosystem** as the application also provides a built-in Idyll browser to view websites within Utopia peer-to-peer network . Utopia comes with a [Cryptocurrency](https://blog.drhack.net/category/cryptocurrency/) which is called **Crypton** and is Proof-of-Stake. uWallet allows you to store,transfer your Crypton(CRP) or even create vouchers and credit cards, Utopia Network includes Utopia Name System (UNS) which is a decentralized registry of names that are impossible to expropriate, freeze or corrupt by 3rd-party as no one has control over the system rather its self-governed by rules set in place which are applicable to everyone. After you join Utopia you may wanna drop by our Hackology channel, which you can search in the Channel Manager

Register yourself as a Beta Tester, Contributor or a Promoter. Each category gets to enjoy the ecosystem while the rewards vary (reward system will be explained shortly).

**Utopia ecosystem is a culmination of multi-year effort by a group of technology enthusiasts dedicated to freedom of self-expression and privacy. We call ourselves a 1984 Group. Among us there are top-notch professionals in almost every IT field, such as cryptographic, software, networking engineers and many more. This has been a long and challenging journey. After all this had never been done before! Finally, we present an ecosystem that will change the way World communicates and handles financial transactions.Utopia brief taken from their official website. Mentioning financial transactions makes one wonder that Bitcoin was also disrupting the conventional financial system**

Lets Explore Utopia and all the features in detail. please note as this is a beta application many of the features might change in future or some even get removed.

Utopia Encryption

Each user participates in transmission of network data but only the recipient can decrypt the data. Advanced encryption ensures interception-proof communication channel to all Utopia users. All communication is secure and protected by **Curve25519 high-speed elliptic curve cryptography**while local storage is encrypted by **256-bit AES**. *Big Brother is no longer watching you!*

Installing Utopia

Once you register on the Beta Portal you have to download Utopia Application. After installing the application you will be given a **Hardware ID** and a **Private Key**, these keys are required to activate your beta license which can be done from the Activation Page. *Please keep in mind that your beta portal website login credentials are not linked with Utopia Application and you can have a different username for the app and the website*. Once you activate the license your utopia account will be tied with your beta portal account. A step by step procedure for easy understanding of the activation procedure:

 Register at Utopia Beta Portal

 Download Utopia software

 Install the program by following simple instructions on installation wizard

 Run Utopia and **Create your account**. You will be provided with Public Key and Hardware ID. Those are needed to activate your Utopia software

 Login to your account

 Click on **JOIN BETA**

 Agree to the Rules and click SUBMIT

 Click on **NEW ACTIVATION** and Enter Public Key and Hardware ID

 Click **ADD**

 Now your Utopia is activated and you are ready to test it

Utopia Dashboard

Utopia is a feature-rich platform that is specifically designed to protect privacy of communication, confidentiality and security of personal data. It was created for privacy-conscious public who believe that privacy is paramount. Utopia is a decentralized network, with no central server involved in data transmission or storage. The network is supported by people who use its many high quality features.

The first glimpse we get of the application is at the Dashboard which has navigational menu for easy access to all of its many features for us to explore, use and report bugs while it is in beta testing phase.

uMail (Utopia Mail)

uMail is a secure alternative to classic e-mail. uMail can be sent to Utopia users that are in your contact list for now. uMail has all functionality of email localized to Utopia ecosystem. No servers are used for mail transmission or storage. uMail account, that is created by default when you join the Utopia network, enables unlimited messaging and attachment storage. Utopia ecosystem encryption guarantees the security of mail transmission and storage. Your uMail, as an internal part of Utopia, cannot be blocked or seized.

All those who value their data privacy would find this useful including activists and journalists knowing that their data is going straight to the designated user and no 3rd party can intercept their data. Currently the limit set for the attachments is 100 MB but as per the team it may be increased in future.

uWallet (Utopia Wallet)

All financial functionality can be found in Utopia built-in uWallet. uWallet allows you to make and accept payments denominated in Utopia cryptocurrency **Crypton**, accept payments at your website, pay by Crypto Cards without revealing your Identity or bill fellow Utopia users for your services. With uWallet you can store value in Cryptons, receive mining rewards, use uVouchers, request payments and accept payments using the built-in API.

All of this while you remain anonymous. All payments are instant and cannot be reversed. Decentralized nature of Utopia ensures that your balance cannot be expropriated.

Utopia Mining  Crypton

Utopia has an inbuilt cryptocurrency called Crypton (CRP), which is proof-of-stake therefore a modest machine can also be used to mine cryptons through the GUI based Utopia application or with terminal based Mining bot which comes with the application.

Utopia rewards users that support the ecosystem through Mining by emission of new Cryptons. When you run your Utopia software or bot you will receive your share of collective reward. Mining does not slow your computer down and is environmentally friendly. You may also run a number of bots at several servers or computers to multiply the Crypton mining speed.

uNS (Utopia Naming System)

Utopia has introduced uNS (Utopia Naming System) which is a unique naming system and independent from the conventional Domain Naming System. DNS is subject to pressure and censorship from less than prefect international laws. Domains can be revoked or suspended due to multiple reasons, such as non-response to WhoIS inquiry or other register policies, non-payment, government actions and so on.

uNS, in contrast, is a truly decentralized non-censored registry hosted by Utopia Network participants with no expiration dates, renewal fees, suspensions and revocations. There is only one rule: **First come, First served.**

uNS registered name should be unique. You may register as many uNS registered names as you want while registration is not free and costs are paid in crypton:

 Single letter uNS costs 1000 CRP

 Two letter uNS costs 500 CRP

 Three letter uNS costs 5 CRP

 Four letter or more costs 0.1 CRP

Miscellaneous Features

Making Groups, Adding users, Chatting and Emailing, Sending Mails and Mining Cryptons might be the highlights but Utopia claims to be an ecosystem therefore they had to incorporate many more features so that users of Utopia ecosystem do not feel the need to go out of the system. List of other useful features within the Utopia Application are listed

 **Packet Forwarding :** uNS Manager lists option of Packet Forwarding which is an internal system allowing any utopian user to host a website which can be accessed by the Idyll browser, the naming system of the website is explained above.

 **File Manager :** All files which are sent or received in Utopia can be accessed from the builtin file manager which also includes an image viewer. As of now the file transfers are limited to 100MB.

 **Voice Notes :** Utopia also supports sending and receiving of Voice messages which you can send to those who are added with you.

 **Dark Theme :** The program comes in standard theme but how can they miss out a Dark Theme for the privacy savvy ? Users can opt for dark theme by going to **Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Interface** and selecting the **Dark Space** theme

 **Utopia API :** Utopia comes with a comprehensive API for users to incorporate in their own projects. For instance, using API you can accept payments denominated in Crypton at your website, automatically manage your channels, send instant messages and much more. To get started once you enable the API you can also access the API documentation.

 **Network Fee Structure :** Utopia provides us with an option to view all the network enforced fee and they are updated live on the network as the fee structure changes, thus one can stay updated with the current fee structure. You can access the Network Fee from **uWallet &gt; Treasury Data &gt; Network Fee**

 **Game :** Utopia also supports in-app games which can be played in multiplayer, as of writing there is a working Chess game.

Utopia Reward System

Utopia is providing a very lucrative [reward system](https://beta.u.is/about-rewards), where Beta Testers, Contributors &amp; Promoters all can join the beta portal and help test and find bugs which in return gets you **pts** where **1 pt equals to 1 USD** which are paid in BTC.

**We truly believe that your participation has to be exciting and mutually beneficial. Utopia Beta Program rewards your enthusiasm, commitment and dedication. No matter what is your skill set you will find an opportunity to contribute to Utopia P2P Project development.**

At the time of writing I have already cashed out $560 and transferred them to my own bitcoin wallet. I can vouch that if you have the eye to spot bugs it is a good place to help them and in return get paid. Uptil now Utopia team has **paid out $3583 to** [**beta testers**](https://beta.u.is/high-score) which is a decent figure keeping in view that they launched 7 days back and still 3 months of beta testing period is left.

If you are not a bug finding sort you can still help and give them suggestions and ideas on how to improve their application or go ahead and share this on social media pages and get paid for being a promoter. Withdrawals are done manually and as per the rule it can take up-to 48 hours, but I have noticed that within an hour or so they release the funds.

Do Earn but **DONT SPAM** they have mentioned categorically that have zero spam tolerance

Who Owns Utopia

Creators of Utopia plan to stay anonymous as they have stated in the help documents

**Utopia has been developed by a group of networking technology enthusiasts over the last 5 years. To eliminate any impact on the project, developers of Utopia will forever remain anonymous. We will not be able to alter the algorithms of the ecosystem once it has been launched.It is currently not known how they will not be able to alter the algorithms once the platform moves out of Beta, that we will know once it is launched**

There is limited we know right now about Utopia team. We know that [**u.is**](http://u.is/) is the domain and they are hosting it on **1984.is**while \*.is is TLD for Iceland. Web hosting company 1984 and Utopia both launched almost together therefore it can be said that the web hosting company was made solely for the purpose of hosting Utopia website project. Some details from Whois of **u.is** domain shows that the domain was registered back in 2010, which might give credibility to their claims of 56 years of development. On the other hand u.is domain was also offering hosting services at one [point](https://web.archive.org/web/20070718165332/http:/u.is/)where one can see mentions of a **Umbra System**. I will leave all this for someone else to do research on as the point is not to find out who wants to stay hidden. **But to point out that for how long one can stay hidden ?**

Domain : u.is ( 190.115.19.82 ) Registrant name 1984 GROUP LP Address 18/2 Royston Mains Street City/Municipality Edinbourg Postal code EH51LB Country GB Registered 28. July 2010 Expires 28. July 2024 Last change 24. June 2019

Whois information of the Webhosting domain 1984.is :

Domain 1984.is Registrant name 1984 ehf. Address P.O. Box 126 City/Municipality Reykjavk Postal code 121 Country IS Phone +354 546 1984 Registered 15. May 2006 Expires 15. May 2022 Last change 5. November 2018

**1984hosting.com** is also a mirror of 1984.is thus is linked with the 1984 Group LP.

No one knows for now who is behind the project Utopia and the intentions to hide the identities might seem like a good idea aswell. It would allow creators to work without any pressure or involvement in their project and they can keep it safe and secure for everyone.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Since i'm a new redditor , i figured out that reddit is a perfect spot for ideas , thoughts and sharing information. This is why i'm posting this idea or more fitting, realization , that has been stuck in my head for a few days maybe weeks. So here it is:  i believe the only limit to the human mind , to the human race, is simply the human body it'self . Think about it. We're probably good for the next 50/100/200 years, but at some point such technological advances will have been made ( especially medical,cybernetics ,Ai) where it won't make sense anymore to be restricted, confined if you will by the human body and its drawbacks. It won't be perfect at first , but once we get going , most illnesses .genetic flaws , and the restrictions of pain , tear and wear, age barrier, e.c.t will be a thing of the past. While speaking of all this may be a bit to far-fetched , i dream of a day when if your hand / leg is damaged beyond repair you could pay a reasonable amount of money (middle class cheap) , and get a brand new bionic limb fully neuroconnected  to the nervous system of the individual. Therefore granting full control , sensory feedback , and no body rejection. After considering these endless possibilities , it almost hurts being alive in a such fragile and on the brink of being damaged flesh -bone system.

I broke my index finger on my right hand a week ago. It was the 3rd time breaking a bone this year.This time i had to undergo surgery and have 2 nails inbedded in there.This is when you realise how many things you cant do, things that when you could you never thought of . I feel so unfortunate yet so fortunate to be able to still do so many things. My goal is to help a timeline when breaking a bone will be the equivalent of getting a scratch , where being amputaded is considered a minor oopsie and is fixed in 2-3 days. I never liked the idea of becoming a doctor or anything like that, but now , now creating a reliable UI between the human body and machine , an OS possibly , where other platforms can be based on .... is my dream.

im 15 , ask me anything.",22,1,False,self,,,,,

What with the debt-laden global financial system and the fear of an [imminent meltdown](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-forecast-51565282205), top investors are already looking for alternatives to secure their wealth. A look into the top 10 billionaires discussing Bitcoin will give us an idea as to what direction the worlds money might be leaning toward in the near future.

Nobody wants to be caught up in the crossfire of [poor economic management](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2019/06/04/the-global-economy-heightened-tensions-subdued-growth) by the government. It is an experience that a lot of people have had before and wont want to have again in the same lifetime.

The emergence of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has generated a lot of interest, and seems to introduce a different method of preserving wealth. For this class of people, things may not be very clear yet, in terms of understanding what the industry has to offer. Nevertheless, the fact that they are showing interest in crypto is enough to make you and I consider the options available within the system.

Among the top 10 billionaires discussing Bitcoin are the following:

10. [**Eric Schmidt**](https://twitter.com/ericschmidt)

Eric Schmidt is the Executive Chairman and former CEO of Google. As at 2019, Schmidts net worth was calculated to be $13.3 billion. By profession, he is a software engineer and a renowned American businessman.

In May 2018, Schmidt described Bitcoin as a remarkable achievement and something that has enormous value. Here is what he said.

*Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement and the ability to create something that is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value*

9.[ **Abigail Johnson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbyjohnson/)

Abigail Johnson is an American businesswoman whose net worth is rated at $15.7 billion. She is the CEO of Fidelity Investments, and the Chairman of Fidelity International. The firm has nearly $2.7 trillion in managed assets, and Johnson owns 24.7% stake there.

Johnson has embraced cryptocurrencies and, in 2018, Fidelity launched a platform that allows institutional investors to trade Bitcoin and Ether.

8. [**Ray Dalio**](https://twitter.com/RayDalio)

Ray Dalio is popularly described as a self-made billionaire. He is currently worth a whopping $19.4 billion. Dalios Bridgewater Associates, which he founded, manages $160 billion in investments, making them the worlds biggest hedge fund firm.

Dalio Bridgewater entered into a partnership in 2018 and gave employees more stake in the firm. This is a move that he carried out in order to plan the life of Bridgewater after his departure.

Dalio is seen as one of the controversial figures when it comes to Bitcoin, however hes still talking about it. He is known for calling Bitcoin a bubble while speaking on CNBC. Heres what he said:

*Its not an effective storehold of wealth because it has volatility to it, unlike gold, Bitcoin is a highly speculative market. Bitcoin is a bubble.*

7. [**Elon Musk**](https://twitter.com/elonmusk)

Elon Musk is the CEO and Chairman of Telsa which is popular for revolutionizing the transportation industry with the introduction of electric cars. Musks revolution in transportation transcends cars and earth. His SpaceX project also focuses on doing something unique in the area of space travels.

On the topic of Bitcoin, Musk calls the pioneer cryptocurrency a brilliant innovation. He made his belief that cryptocurrency is a better alternative to paper currencies public by describing the Bitcoin structure as quite brilliant.

Musk said:

*It (Bitcoin) bypasses currency controls  Paper money is going away. And crypto is a far better way to transfer values than a piece of paper, thats for sure.*

6. [**Michael Dell**](https://twitter.com/MichaelDell)

Michael Dells net worth is $33.2 billion, and he is the Chairman of Dell Technologies. This company was formed in 2016, after a merger between Dell and EMC, a computer storage giant.

Even before the merger, Dell has been a supporter of Bitcoin with his original company, Dell. In July 2014, he tweeted that his \[then\] company started accepting Bitcoin for payments. Nothing more describes a classic adoption of the cryptocurrency. In the tweet he said:

*Dell now accepts Bitcoin. More information about todays announcement*

[*(link:* ](http://t.co/u1t5Snsm8R?amp=1)[*http://www.dell.com/bitcoin*](http://www.dell.com/bitcoin)*)*

5. [**Jack Ma**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-ma-a7689116/)

 Jack Ma is the cofounder and Chairman of Alibaba Group, one of the worlds largest e-commerce businesses. The company raised $25 billion dollars in an IPO in New York back in 2014, setting the record as the worlds biggest public stock offering.

Ma has publicly stated that he is not necessarily a fan of Bitcoin, but is fully interested in the technology that powers it. Here are his words:

*When it comes to Bitcoin, Im not so interested in it myself. What I want to know is, what can Bitcoin bring to society? After some thought, I myself think that the technology behind Bitcoin is tremendous, so at Alibaba and Alipay we are using it to help build our roadmap to a truly cashless society.*

4. **Mark Zuckerberg**

Mark Zuckerberg has gone beyond just discussing, but even creating a whole cryptocurrency on its own, which has become a huge subject of controversy lately.

Zuckerbergs net worth is estimated at $72 billion which is linked to his primary company, Facebook and every other subsidiaries that are attached to it.

Facebook was taken public in 2012, however, Zuckerberg still owns 15% stake in the company. Zuckerberg has never hidden his affection for cryptocurrency. However, the proposed launch of Libra coin is the loudest statement anyone can ever make on the subject matter.

3.[ **Larry Ellison**](https://twitter.com/larryellison)

Here is the cofounder of renowned global database management company, Oracle. Ellisons net worth is estimated at $68.2 billion. Today at Oracle he serves as the Chairman of the board and the companys Chief Technology Officer.

Ellison is optimistic about Bitcoin and the technology behind it. His only concerns were about blockchain being used only in the context of Bitcoin and digital currencies. However, he is optimistic that companies outside of finance will implement the technology on a wider scale.

2. [**Warren Buffett**](https://twitter.com/WarrenBuffett)

When it comes to investments, the name Warren Buffett is one of the loudest across the globe. He is a serial investor whose present net worth is estimated at $81.2 billion. Buffett, who is nicknamed the Oracle of Omaha runs Berkshire Hathaway, which owns more than 60 companies, including insurer Geico, battery maker Duracell and restaurant chain Dairy Queen.

Buffett is not one of those who are optimistic about Bitcoin. In the past, he even described the cryptocurrency as rat poison squared. However, the technology upon which Bitcoin is built is something that he is excited about. Buffett believes that blockchain holds some promise. Well have to wait and see if he may change his mind following his infamous lunch with TRON CEO Justin Sun, and other crypto heavyweights.

1. [**Bill Gates**](https://twitter.com/BillGates)

Bill Gates has a net worth of $103.9 billion. He is the co-founder of Microsoft and till date owns a little over 1% of the companys stake. Bill and his wife Melinda chair the worlds largest charitable foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.

Gates is another critic of Bitcoin who does not expect the pioneer cryptocurrency to succeed. Here is what he had to say when asked of his opinion in 2018:

*As an asset class, youre not producing anything and so you shouldnt expect it to go up. Its kind of a pure greater fool theory type of investment.*

**Conclusion**

One way or the other, the top names in business and investments have had a look at the emerging technology of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Whether in support or against, the fact that there is a show of concern is a matter of interest.

Many people across the globe today are exploring liquidity providing platforms like [Vertex.Market](https://vertex.market/) to gather hands-on information about the industry. Besides, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on their own, are constantly breaking new grounds and proving naysayers wrong in several ways.

Therefore, it is only ideal that even as we consider such information like top 10 billionaires discussing Bitcoin, we take our time and engage in hands-on processes. This is the only way not to be left behind after the train has left the station in this era of emerging technologies.

Then the traditional ISPs could switch to honeypot mode, and contain / analyze the attack while it is happening. They would get compensation from the federal government to do this service, but while it's underway the federal government has jurisdiction once it's put in honeypot mode. You could handle this by sending a key to a one time use for this purpose address, which would then forward it along customer computers until it reaches the Feds themselves.

Made this summary of arguably the most important science of last month. I hope it gives a good overview and brief explanations. Selection of items is via [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\_in\_science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_in_science).

If you like these summaries I could post them every first Saturday of the month. This one is late due to various delays.

I hope these summaries are somewhat unique (currently at least!) as they aren't meant to be headlines but explanations (but short ones) that summarize the finding and why it matters and because these are using Wikipedia. The latter also means that the process is partially open. If these are successful I hope later some kind of peer-review and the like could get established for these. I'm pretty sure there are no errors in this month's summary though.

**These threads could be used as some kind of review of the science and technology of the last month. Here we could discuss the future prospects/relevance and implications of these scientific findings.**

It didn't happen for automobiles, for television, for cellphones, for air travel, for personal computers, or for the internet. And what's more, the tech for gene-modding is rapidly decreasing in price and increasing in accuracy. In fact, genetic modification being spread amongst the poor could be used for *great* social control.

We already know that the best way to achieve social control is to craft a narrative of ""us vs. them"". *We're already seeing this narrative right now with gene-modding*. GMOs are unnatural, they'll foster plagues, they'll spread cancer, they want to make a new species of human from designer babies. Clickbait asks if gene-modded people will leave all of humanity infertile or if GMOs in general will lead to another kind of apocalypse.

Now fast-forward about 30 to 40 years. Now middle class people can get genetic modifications easily, giving us Genetically Modified Persons (GMPs). It's just another reality of modern medicine. Except there are plenty of people who *deeply* fear genetic modification in general. Some will argue from it on a moral basis, that it's utterly unnatural to mess with human genes. Others will say that GMPs shouldn't be allowed to breed because otherwise they could royally screw up the gene pool and possibly introduce wicked diseases into the human population a fear that isn't at all unfounded because you genuinely will be leaving new genes to be passed onto new generations, and adding or subtracting genes could indeed lead to a population that has a greater chance to catch a certain disease or has reduced capacity to fight off another one. But it likely won't lead to the wholesale extinction of humanity. It'll be seen as a selfish move if you don't do it right and an immoral move even if you do.

This despite plenty of people *needing* gene-modding as a cure for diseases. And if it's cheap enough, designer babies become an inevitability even if it's dangerous.

What about the wealthy? I can see then escaping *some* of this by creating this sense that *their* therapies are high quality and free from mistakes, but humans are much too irrational. Rather, wealthy figures who are known or suspected to be GMPs will become favorite targets for conspiracy theories and political demonization ""I'm part of X group, while Y group is funded by literal Aryan reptilians."" In fact, this all seems to be set up to eventually lead to pogroms against GMPs in underdeveloped countries. And I say ""against GMPs"" but I really mean ""anyone *accused* of being a GMP"". It would be a good way to reintroduce widespread anti-semitism ""Jews have all genetically modified themselves, and if they keep breeding, they'll ruin the human gene pool and cripple us forever! We've *got* to run them through now before it's too late!""


And in a reversal of contemporary future predictions, there will also be theories that the wealthy are only pushing gene-modding to the poor as a means of creating multiple divergent species that will never learn to work with each other since they actually *will* be different from one another, while they get to be the bermenschen. I don't see how the rise of AI &amp; automation makes such a thing practical, but again, humans are irrational.



And I'm not coming at this out of nowhere. I'm just reacting to actual responses [to the two *real life* designer babies that already exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designer_baby#Lulu_and_Nana_controversy). Everyone was freaking out over the possibility of the wealthy using this technology to separate themselves from the rest of us, and here I am looking at an absolutely unsettling number of comments saying ""**We must kill these babies before they infect the rest of the human population**."" Just *where could that go if that sentiment were weaponized?* 

And yet *no* one is talking about that possibility. With gene-modding, it's either genetic dystopia between Aryan wealthy and the rest of us or a genetic ...quasi-topia where we all have access to gene-modding and terrorists engineer deadly viruses to wipe out certain people. Both are widely discussed for good reason, don't get me wrong, but the most sobering and realistic possibility is the one we seem to ignore.",12,26,False,self,,,,,

It's no secret that TPTB want the masses to be as helpless and weak-minded as they can possibly be, lacking peace of mind and critical thinking skills so that it will be easier to control their sheep. So what if you found out that meditation could open your mind to peace and awareness you never before fathomed possible?

The first link posted has some basic benefits of getting into meditation.  The following link is a few free pages about how to do the merkaba meditation (recreating your human lightbody):

I highly suggest giving this meditation a try. Here is a guided audio link on YT of the merkaba meditation:

https://youtu.be/81Kf3UBQ1g8

Its from the book ""the ancient secrets of the flower of life part 2"".  The book also teaches spiritual anatomy of your 13 chakras,  healing, psychic powers, how to cast out entities/demons from your energy field, how to reconnect to mother earth,  the cosmos and your higher self,  and talks about a few intergalactic conspiracies and the current great awakening!

Here is another very useful meditation called the unity breath. It goes hand in hand with merkaba meditation. It will allow you to tap into a stream of infinite healing love energy:
