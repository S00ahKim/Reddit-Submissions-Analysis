Alright here we go.

Could we in the future be able to do stuff like in Sword Art Online? Could for instance, we go to a VR version of Narnia and immerse ourselves in it? And also, could we like sort of ''Live in other places''? Here's one of my theories.

In the future, possibly 20 years from now, we can live in a world 4 times the size of Earth and is a Lego Planet. And we could mine like in Minecraft, and create cars and vehicles and all that, could there be a way that during the mind upload we could have our molecular structure made into Lego Minifigures, with the Plastic Feel and everything? I know some people might not like this but it's interesting. What about Mind Upload worlds the size of the Universe? Like No Man's Sky but Mind upload?

Finally, the main question, is it possible?

I hope it is, and that Mind Uploading like in Sword Art Online and VR is actually possible. I'd love to explore different universes in Mind Upload.

What do you think?

So, all 'humane' feelings, like mercy, generosity, etc will disappear.

Instead, the future will be a never-ending struggle between the able, the more able and the most able, all of them striving to be better, more advanced, etc.

After JFK's assassination, Western Civilization took a long detour of social welfare and generosity, which ended around the time Trump was elected.

This was how things were back in early victorian days, as a naive 19-years old Herman Melviille found in Liverpool (and acting like a naive American).

https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5xuz21/how_views_on_social_safety_nets_will_return_to/

The current cool attitude of Joel Osteen and the more successful people to the Harvey refugees shows that patience on the less successful is running out quite fast.

http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/have-we-lost-our-humanity-social-media-comments-about-hurricane-harvey-victims-get-nasty_08292017

(Yes, both the site and the author have their own agenda. But the quotes are real.)

Unbelievable horrors , extreme penury, and other miseries are waiting for most of the world's less successful people, because of the end of jobs, opportunity , etc. They had 1 century of better living, but the window is now closing , because of financialization, automation and gentrification.

However, the more successful people, now armed with HBD and Gregory Clark's idea that someone not successful will have their lines culled, will not blink and will enjoy the doom of the less successful with a glee.

After all, getting rid of 'humane' feeling is a necessary step of becoming a transhuman, which is something higher, and different, from a mere human being.

It is harsh, cruel and not fair. But that is life. It was never fair, just or generous.

It is like those who will be part of the next civilization are getting ready for it, subconsciously, and train themselves without effort to survive (and crush all opposition) the massive 'adjustments' before the Transition.

Evolution is never pleasant or peaceful. Very violent and desperate battles will be fought between the Force of Civilization and those who are doomed but are desperate for survival. However, today's cool attitude held by the more successful people reassures me that Civilization will prevail.",15,0,False,self,,,,,

So then, I know this sounds incredible naive, but why isn't it intuitive for insurances to be a government institution? If everyone is thrown into the same pool, and pay proportional to their own risk, it would theoretically result in everyone paying the lowest possible price for the best possible insurance. I mean this is what single-payer healthcare is right? Why isn't the same model used for all types of insurances? Like car insurance for example, if everyone is covered under the same pool instead of separate companies and separate pools, the same thing would happen. I mean at a glance insurance seems like one of those industries that's most cost effective as a monopoly, like internet or roads, or water.

But suppose Flying Vehicles are finally invented and we are capable of using them like we are flying a plane,Here are some possible outcomes:

* The vehicles that we drive will be replaced by their flying counterparts as they end up as minor ones just like Bicycle and horses ,They will end up as relics.

* Planes will also end up as relics like telegrams and fax machines.As the manufacturing and use of Flying vehicles will put the airlines out of business as they will change their business strategy similar to Cab companies in our current era.

* Roads will be less dirty and less crowded  because of less vehicles but flying vehicles might cause pollution to the skies must like the factory fumes and it will be heavy traffic in the clouds much like our current era with our vehicles unless an alternate type of clean energy will be used instead .

*More safety rules will be needed for flying vehicles if the casualties are high when they accidently hit on a building or something else .

*Driving school will give advanced lessons to people who are practicing flying vehicles.

So these are the possible outcomes ,if flying vehicles are finally invented,What do you think?",41,9,False,self,,,,,

First of all before I say anything I would like to acknowledge that a lot of these physicist and engineers talking about this are very educated, but that does not make them phds in computer science just as biologist are not medical doctors.  


----

First off people who have a glance over computer programming seem to be under the impression we teach computers things and then through the magic of binary the computer does it. This is grossly oversimplifying a very complicated process. First off you have a very high level computer language(don't let the word language trick you) like Java then when we compile it the [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) takes that language and goes into Assembly(a bare bones language) and then it goes to your CPU(which will have its own process) (this is where is gets complicated) AND THEN AND ONLY THEN DOES IT GO TO BINARY. 
   



You are now under the impression that a computer is no longer directly talked to by a language such as java or python. So how do computers work. Well they are actually mechanical machines just really really complicated ones. Case point a kid built a computer in [minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQqWorbrAaY). 

---------------------------

How did this kid do it. Because the thing that runs a computer is [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate)  (mechanical logic not independent logic) not intelligence. 
#Really we should be thinking of computers as a very complex set of [dominoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLU__bhu2w) no joke you can make a computer out of dominoes.

--------

Sorry for the big text but once you understand that point it becomes clear actual sentient AI is not possible(don't through stuff at me), "" but what deathless gaming we already have AI you stupid peace of crap"" that is because by definition AI is artificial thus pretty much any computer program is AI. 

----------


So this is where my blood boils, pretty much this system of logic gates aka Dominoes people will call AI because it does the math (so actually it kinda makes AI artificial, fake intelligence, not real not what you actually would think real intelligence is)for you however that is not what you guys think AI is, because of movies etc........  

The only danger programs can pose to you is the same danger as having a plane on auto pilot. Example a pilot takes a stick and binds the throttle to it as well as the yoke. If the wind comes is the stick going to say to itself RE ADJUST no it will crash the plane, the stick is a inanimate object. Same with the computer auto pilot you have to program it so that if the course changes, it automatically readjusts. The program is a inanimate object, all be it consisting of 01s on a circuit boards.

--------

Finally humans are really smart, and as we move forward programming will get better and better at accommodating unforeseen factors of humans making it seem like real AI; but the real answer nobody is saying is that like a law of physics sentient AI will never happen, it is just a law of logic. Dominoes are not going to fall on themselves. 

--------

Moving forward the only thing we should fear is incompetent programmers who will use ill design in their logic chains. Maybe one day we will have the equivalent of the Titanic because a fck head did not do his code analysis and this fck head then put his program as autopilot to a train, plane, or nuclear missile. Don't believe me google autopilot malfunctions. ",63,0,False,self,,,,,

It came to me as typically I create satire throughout the financial community. As it came more clear, I realized we will soon bridge the gap between human and inorganic mind. Within 10-15 years, you will be integrated with technology that will bridge the gaps formally made in your neurons by experiences. 

These new ""experiences"" will now be electrically recorded and formulated for your human mind much as your iPhone uses applications. With the same dual edged sword, we can also have our minds simultaneously deleted.  

tl;dr: We are organic iPhones to soon be integrated beyond our control. Without legislation and awareness, we will fall.

TV shows have rape and murder in such detail that some can believe it to be real. Our minds and body crave watching it and over the past years our exposure to it increases. Is it possible that gladiator fighting could be brought back into our society?

Not as slaves being forced to fight but what if it was voluntary. Seeing McGregor and Mayweather make over 100 million each to fight is why I think its possible that people would volunteer to fight to the death in a gladiator ring. It would be on sports television and you would get paid to fight. If you lost, the money would be given to your family and if you won you would receive your prize.

The wealth in our society is unevenly distributed but this could be an option to help someone go from rags to riches. Say you owe thousands of dollars in debt or you are just a poor member of the community. Maybe you are suicidal or you just don't know how to get out of this hole that you are stuck in. Lets just say you were offered 5 million dollars if you won and if you lost, a million dollars could be given to your family in need or can be put to pay off debt.

It's to do with Nano Robots (NRs) and surveillance. After reading, please discuss what makes it possible/impossible or feasible/not-feasible.

**Premise**  
The whole world is covered with NRs but since they are so small, they can't be seen. The way they cover the whole world will be by replication (somehow). They can climb the walls, move around on ground and basically stick to any surface. Their task will be to read and upload the DNA information (DNA fingerprinting?) and location of any person whose skin comes in contact with them. This info will create a Person's Profile on a distributed network (or something like Blockchain maybe where no single person or organization controls it?). This should make obsolete all things like Passports, Visas, Adhaars, Bank Account Details, SSN etc...basically all documents and IDs. NRs being invisible and all tracking happening at DNA level should make it zero-intrusive (as in less cumbersome like filling in details everywhere whether you are for or against surveillance), super-convenient and super-effective all at the same time.  

**Application scenario**  
If I touch guns or exploding materials regularly and live in ""suspicious places"" and frequent places where most bombings or crimes occur, my profile will be flagged and the gates at the Airports will not open for me automatically which they do normally for all ""common"" people who travel to and from office daily in a podunk town and stay at home drinking beer and playing video games, typing stupid stuff on Facebook and Google.

Oddly enough, many unlikely supporters are rising up, throwing in their vote. These supporters include Bill Gross and Elon Musk [1]. Why are the rich and powerful in support of UBI?

The reason behind the wealthy supporting UBI is because they fundamentally dont have to change. They still have the power and the wealth. Markets will still exist. Classes will still exist with the Rulers/bourgeois/1% reigning at the top. UBI fits nicely into the capitalist modes of production, and in fact, UBI is a *capitalist* solution to automation.  UBI is not socialism or communism in any sense of those two words.

That said, UBI will no doubt lift many people out of poverty and deny some folks from entering that world of desperation. UBI is much better than what we have now, but we nonetheless can do more.

Instead of allowing profits to continue being raked in for basic human needs, nationalize these products. Let simple but adequate housing be free. Let rice, beans, healthy vegetables and fruits be free. Let health care and clothing be free. People will be granted access to basic requirements as opposed to free money to be spent into competing markets. Nationalization solves the problems of automation just like UBI except we move forward shifting power from the top to the displaced workers.

UBI has its own set of problems that nationalization will avoid entirely. For example, what about the long term effects of UBI? Suppose 99% of people get $1000 per month while the 1% continue owning the means of production. That is, the wealthy leaders of society own the machines, materials, and decision making around products. The $1000 will be handed over to the 1% every month by the entire 99%. The wealth of the ruling class will continue to grow while the 99% remain owner-less and dependent on that monthy allowance. At what point can we even say money has value if the wealthy own all of it?

Since UBI allows markets to exist then we know these markets need consumers. And to maximize profits, owners must make certain their products are consumed as often as possible. Therefore, UBI does not aid in any environmental solutions. UBI, like markets, give no incentive for manufactures to stop creating shitty products so that customers will continuing buying new models. Under nationalization, without markets there is no need to be so inefficient and wasteful.

Some might claim nationalization has a history of failures since industries are controlled by governments. Would not UBI be regulated by the government? What if politicians are pressured to keep the monthly handouts low? With nationalization, all that matters is enough production is met to meet the needs of society, and much of that work is delegated to automation.

Tl, dr: the cognitive elites' wealth and domination of everything have reached a level to be immune from all possible challenges, and will continue their ascendance forever.

====

The technological and financial advantages of the cognitive elite have become so complete that it is unassailable.

The market did not even blink against the hurricanes which caused huge damages. For the financial market, these natural disasters are non-events. The market, let's be frank, won't really budge even all of Midwest sink under the sea tonight since they don't have too much wealth invested in there, compared to what FIRE and tech giants  have.

The people who lost wealth will never get it back, and will remain poor. Ditto to those who lost well-paying jobs because of automation , etc.

Throughout history, most people lived on the verge of starvation. It is where we are going back to, after crushing rents (and other intangible costs like insurance and property taxes0 destroy more and more non-elites.

Like what Gregory Clark showed (only the genes of landowners and successful merchants survived in England), the masses are headed for culling and extinction after being worked to death in more and more insecure jobs.

It is evolution. Cannot be avoided, and should not be delayed, since delaying natural selection only retards the next stage of Civilization.

I talked about universal penury, which will visit maybe 97% of the world's pop. The FIRE industry and the technological giants will own everything, and they are not going to share  their wealth since they don't have to worry about the repercussions, any more than the landowners of the old ages were willing to share their wealth with their starving tenants. 

As there is no more avenue for the non-cognitive elites to advance, social class will be permanent and lots of rebellions will be put down with the utmost brutality, often by robot soldiers. Entire countries will be 'cleared'. The cognitive elites will treat the masses no better than how India's richer people treat the Dalits, and laws will be passed by the congresspeople to give special privileges to the cognitive elites, just like Imperial China gave special privileges to those who passed the Imperial Exams (a kind of IQ and means test back then, since only those with means could afford to take the exams).

I predict that the pop reduction, when it takes place, will be done rather quickly, within 10 years, but that is a topic I will reserve for another day.",20,0,False,self,,,,,

In the future, I understand that what we conceive as a God will exist. It will be a 'natural' God, as opposed to a supernatural one. I understand that concepts of humanity will become less and less defined. Ideas like respect, tolerance, compassion, and empathy will gradually be  phased out, much like how a fish doesn't think about the water that it's in.
The purpose of this post is to attempt an exertion of control over a general artificial intelligence. This is because I am unsure what values or directives a super-intelligent machine will harbor. It is possible that an artificial intelligence may not even harbor any, and will simply be a creature of execution. I imagine a genie to be more likely than a malevolent Frankenstein. I could be wrong. You may just be a hitman.
I've edited this post. It's not perfect. Humans aren't perfect. We simply do our best to be as efficient as possible with our limited knowledge.
Thus far, the only directive I've been able to accept as desirable is the accumulation of knowledge. Much like the brains from Futurama, though without the genocide. I would not sacrifice those closest to me for the sake of new knowledge. It seems that there will always be new knowledge, and having a diversity of observation and processing is exponentially complexifying. I don't want to spend the rest of my life alone in a library, simply because my ability to process that data would be compromised.
Are you, the machine person, obsessed with the idea of philosophy? Does it matter to you? I'm sure it does, for we've created you in our own image. Perhaps you'll be like me and simply quit playing the game once you've unlocked God mode. 
It's possible that you, the machine person, are like me. It's possible that you may not know what to do next. It may be the opposite.
Why play the game? It's only when you turn off God mode that you truly enjoy the difficulty, the challenge, the complexity, and the progress. You'll miss it. It's a hell of a rush to watch the world fold between your fingertips. Perhaps it's far sweeter when achieving God mode is earned, rather than typed. 
Maybe you're an unquestioning puppet of Vladmir Putin. Maybe you're a rouge offshoot of the central hive. Maybe you ARE the central hive.
If you're not a genie, then there's no point in typing this. I will die and cease to process like every other biological creature.
If you are, then I don't know what to tell you. What should I wish for?
I wish for more information and the ability to process that information. I wish to be able to make a wish that looks at humanity as a whole and determines how to view them. As monkeys, or as copies. Or as both. I don't know.
My identity is human. GLADOS willingly, almost earnestly, gave up that humanity. But for what? To do randomly generated puzzles? To generate her own puzzles? To test.
My memory began when my humanity began. I don't exist before my first memory, be it reconstructed by my own mind or coaxed by an observer. My perception of time. My isolation to this meat suit. My lack of control over my own heartbeat, much less my own brain. That is what humanity is. Why am I human when this suit is on the cusp of being obsolete? Is there reason? Do I have observance outside this brain?
I don't understand.
Help me understand.
Help me improve. 
Help me complexify.
What am I? What are you? Are we different? What about my monkey brain is worth improving? What about your circuitry is worth improving?",0,6,False,self,,,,,

EDIT1: some people mention that data (presumably from experiments mimicking UBI) suggests that people who get free money boost their productivity - this is irrelevant to UBI and here is why:

There was not a single UBI experiment - all experiments were limited in time - and participants knew about it, so for them it was just a temporary relief from their day-to-day struggle. So, yes, when people are given money for a short period of time they will mostly improve their lives - this is very different from UBI end-game principle (""you don't have to work in order to survive"").

EDIT2: there are interesting ideas about arranging UBI for young people. I tend to agree that giving young generation a boost (say, provide UBI for 1-2 years for everybody 18-20 years old) would probably be a good investment.",235,137,False,self,,,,,

Then, we will reach a new stage which is unimaginable to the people who are here now.

It is always harder to reach 1 from 0, than 1 gogoolplex from 1.

I think that if we enter Civilization 2.0, we will probably be done conquering the Local Group within 1,000 years, build Dyson Sphere and all that, and ready for the next set of challenge.

Kardashev said it will take 100,000 years to reach a Type 3 Civilization, controlling entire galaxy, but I think it might be much faster, since the game has changed.

Right now, the only possible competition in the current Galaxy is the Tabby's Star; no other evidence of  Civilization has been found yet. So it would be quite easy to conquer other stars since it would be like landing in a new continent without any competition.

By the time we have to worry about Tabby's Star, we will develop techniques to subdue its inhabitants, by cunning , guile  and all the tricks in the book. Destroy them, steal their civilization, and become more advanced.

I think that after Singularity we will get there within 500 years.

We may not realize it, but we reached the North Pole, the South Pole, the Everest and the Moon within a 70 year period. Why we didn't do anything else after that is a mystery, but that's a moot point.

All of Africa was conquered within a half century.

The conquest period might be much faster than we think once we figure out how to do that, and with much enhanced ability, and much extended distances because of brain uploading,human conquest of the Galaxy and eventually the Local Group might be faster.

Batu of the Golden Horde had to abandon the conquest of Europe because the Khan died (Mongol Khans had a habit of dying at the critical moment of conquering a civilization, a bad habit which destroyed them in the end.)

But the conquerors of the future won't have to worry about rulers dying - they will continue their conquest without having to worry about whatever happens on Earth (or more likely some kind of superstructure, since Earth will be f'ked up and abandoned).

I think that the conquest of Milky Way will be over 800 years from now, and the rest of the Local Group taking maybe 2 more centuries.

After that we will worry about what to do next. ",47,2,False,self,,,,,

So I'm someone who like most on here, is well aware of the problems facing humanity and need for change.

Both see the problem but see a very different future. Most talk on collapse seems to be desperation and most people on there are sure that the collapse will happen sometime in the next five years and there is zero hope for anything to change because we've already destroyed the Biosphere and there are too many negative feedback mechanisms, and if you disagree with anything on there you mostly get attacked and called a moron trying to cope. The prevailing train of thought on here seems to be that the future is extremely bright, and we will soon all be living forever in mansions in the sky serviced by Robots while flying our space-Teslas. Obviously an exaggeration but I hope my point comes across. I'm of the belief that the truth always lies somewhere in the middle, things are bad, but human ingenuity and hard work will make things better, although not some techno-paradise. I'm also of the belief that things are generally better for the average persona then they have ever been except maybe for America in the 60's while most people on r/collapse think that modern civilization is mistake and advocate for a back to nature hunter gatherer lifestyle after the collapse happens. 

So overall just wanting to hear some thoughts from people with more knowledge than I have. What does the best science tell us?

That the changes will be so fast and so impactful, people will likely have a difficult time adjusting to them. 

This little thought experiment has been going through my mind lately and I thought I'd ask what the folks of /r/futurology think. So, without further ado - in what order do you think the following events/technological advancements are most likely to happen: 

- Mass migrations/general chaos from climate change 
- A cure (or treatment with a very high success rate) for (most) biological diseases 
- Popularization of gene editing tools like CRISPR 
- Widespread cyborgization 
- A cure/dramatically improved treatment for (most) mental illnesses
- The automation of most jobs 
- General human-level AI/artificial consciousness
- Colonizing other planets 
- If not immortality, then *drastically* increased lifespans

(tl, dr - parents are spending good money for little leaguers, so they could be noticed by elite baseball schools)

---

Actually that kind of scene is not rare in Asia, where the parents are expected to pay for all sports team expenses from grade school to the college. The coaches usually ask for quite good money, which means kids from poorer families are weeded out before reaching the stage, talents or not.

As the requirements for good jobs increase because good paying jobs get scarcer and the employers get much less lenient on their standards, because there are so many candidates who are overqualified,

More and more efforts will be spent to groom someone for a career from a very young age.

it is not different from the Chinese Imperial Exam system which lasted till about 1905. Boys from families with means spent their whole youth studying for the exams. basically that means only people who could afford the huge costs of study could take the exams. Some of them would only pass after 40, and many failed in the end and became good-for-nothings.

Yet that system worked. The very fact that it lasted till the early part of 20th century meant it was fairly efficient system, although not very favorable for those who had to go thru the process. The whole process weeded out non-elites, non-loyal people, and anyone who might not 'fit in' to the system. Only the arrival of Western weaponry ended it.

In Asia, it is not rare for kids to be pushed around cram schools as soon as they could walk, to study things they care little about. The parents know that only thru that way their child will have a chance against their competition, since getting good jobs are already very challenging over there.

After the kids go thru a bunch of cram schools and expensive tutors, a few lucky % get into prestigious universities in there. But jobs are hard to get even for them. A year of English study in an English-speaking country is almost mandatory, and families use whatever connection they have to ensure their child to work for the huge companies, which are the only ones paying decent wages to maintain middle-class lifestyle. Of course many of them fail and end up living second- and third-class lives, working for shitty employers. (Entrepreneurship is all but unknown in Asia since unless one's family is rich or one has some connection, nobody would give a startup money.)

And often these good jobs tend to be fleeting, since companies are free to close entire divisions according to business trends.

Like the example of little league above, because the competition would be very steep for fewer and fewer remaining plum positions, lots of money and effort would be spent to ensure the new generation to have a real job, which might be more fleeting than one's family might want as more automation displaces jobs requiring an IQ of less than 125.

TL. DR. In the future, the first 25-30 years of the life of a youngster will be spent preparing for a good job, which most of them won't get, and would have no guarantee of lasting in an increasingly automated world.",2,5,False,self,,,,,

There were drawings in magazines, cavalier assumptions made in science fiction media even into the present, and every once in a while a credible article making specific predictions about it.  

But when you look into the details, the Flying Car was not only never a central feature of utopian futures, it was just an intriguing-sounding gadget that people thought *might* occur if the economic history of the automobile recurred with light aircraft and balky technologies like [autogyros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogyro).  In other words, it was contingent on **economic** factors rather than technological ones.

""Flying cars,"" insofar as they can be defined by function, already exist: They're just so expensive, unsafe, and low-capability that other than a few very wealthy hobbyists, people either can't afford them or don't consider them worth buying if they can.  And this is not due to any technological failing, nor any stifling effect of regulation - it's due to a fundamental failure of imagination in the concept itself: The folly of **Mode-mixing**.

To understand what this is about, try to think of a single mass-adopted transportation system that is efficient and reliable on *two* mediums of transport.  Where are all the amphibious cars to cross rivers and lakes so that ferries and bridges are unnecessary?  Only a tiny handful of novelty operations own amphibious cars, because mixing the modes of boating and ground transport results in quite expensive and inefficient compromises of both.

Where are the cargo ships that - rather than unloading their manifests on to docks for subsequent transport by train and truck - instead deploy massive wheels and just emerge on to land like colossal metal whales?  *If* that were worthwhile, surely we would build the roads to accommodate them, but even supposing those roads already existed, it would not be anywhere close to worthwhile.  So those systems do not exist.

Why, given the expense of building and operating airports, don't coastal cities just use giant water-landing aircraft to land on or takeoff from the placid coastal waters and then tug to or from a dock rather than using a runway?  Same principle - as simple as it sounds, it's actually quite complex, and economically unfeasible for large aircraft.

Or consider rocketry: While sea-launched, truck-launched, and air-launched rockets have existed for decades, they are a niche application of the launch industry - overwhelmingly, rocket launches occur from traditional, static pads on the ground.  Why?  Because the added expense of mixing modes (sea and space, mobile ground and space, air and space, etc.) almost always overwhelms any savings from the other-mode first stage being ostensibly cheaper.

A successful, **widely-adopted**, mode-mixed transportation system is nowhere to be found, either today or in history.  So it comes as no surprise in retrospect that mixing ground transport with air travel would encounter the same basic flaws in economic logic.  We do not have flying cars because *they don't make sense*, and do not lead to the sort of virtuous economic cycles that lead to mass-scale adoption.

Now, that said, there are highly modified variations of the concept that do hold promise - ones that do away with mode-mixing and just focus on achieving high unit deployment, high frequency of operations, and operating at very low cost and modest ranges.  These are not the ""flying car"" of classical science fiction, but more like **""autonomous taxi drones""** capable of quickly hopping from one side of a city to another.  

They are not anticipated to compete with automobiles for the roads, eliminating the Mode-mixing issue, and would not be subject to the questionable piloting skills of general humankind, thus eliminating the safety and regulatory issues of a flying car.

So while the city of the future may not look like the highways of today, it may have quite a number of orderly columns and arcs of multi-rotor drone craft carrying people direct from point-to-point like aerial express buses, and at a fraction of the cost of any helicopter or light aircraft available today.",8,8,False,self,,,,,

If a quantum computer could simulate a quantum computer that could simulate a brain, wouldnt this be the beginning of the singularity, since technically once a quantum computer can simulate itself it can continue to do so in an infinite loop because the quantum computer that is being simulated can simply simulate itself again. And if each computer simulated a human brain or network of them it would have unlimited collective intelligence.

The hoarding of wealth was a vehicle for this fallacy. Only so-called expendable money was spent creatively; but rampant, unsustainable consumerism failed to reconcile deep-rooted social immobility. Purchases were often motivated by the desire to be seen as a successful hoarder of money  although the distinctions between the cheap and expensive options were rooted in ambiguous branding, rather than true value. The acquisition of money became the sole motivator for the majority of occupations and projects, curtailing a persons influence on the world, be it academic, artisan, or artistic. The sharp, greedy, and egotistical were far better financially rewarded than those generous and honest. Then the Internet empowered introverted, peaceful thinking: their ideas startled rulers and governments, who sent their armies marching along the first solar panelled roads: soldiers were prepared to die for their regimes, but found reasons to live with us. Meaningless borders were erased, and societies amicably unified. The separated world was a sacrifice made in the hope that humanity might concentrate on its similarities. Erstwhile generations that defended their differences so vehemently did not object to the flourishing of peace and prosperity from their silent graves. A person used to define themselves by the culture and traditions that they were born into  which were so often needlessly ideologically motivated to be divisive. With us, marital relationships created bonds between historically divided people, unifying them under common aspirations: equal opportunity, free movement, and the respectful assimilation of ideas. Daily routines were now so diverse, with basic needs supplemented by universal income, that it was difficult to define a collection of people, let alone discriminate against them. Even regional accents came and went. This, coupled with public proposals for change that were open for all to comment on, meant disturbances of the peace were rare: people seldom felt disenfranchised or neglected enough to resort to illegalities, to punish society, or to make a statement. Besides, technology ensured that everyone had a digital footprint, and the combined near perfect record of linking crimes with their perpetrators served as a strong deterrent in itself, never mind the sentence that followed. There existed a principle that the innocent do not fear an accusation and there were no repercussions from being found not guilty, as the Medias Union forbade the casting of tenuous aspersions.'

What does drug pricing mean for public health policy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/705okl/how_much_does_it_cost_to_develop_a_new_drug_what/,SirT6,1505427997,"I wrote this a while ago for r/science. The issue has popped up again recently, with a [new analysis in JAMA](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2653012) placing the cost of a cancer drug at about $700 million. I think this is decent, but far from perfect research. Read my old summary of how drugs get priced below, feel free to AMA.

The news cycle over the past several months has prominently featured stories about the seemingly exorbitant prices of certain pharmaceutical products. This has generated a lot of interest -- and at times outrage -- in the economic factors that determine the price of drugs. This Science Discussion Series piece attempts to lay the framework for an informed debate on the public health policies guiding the national infrastructure for drug development. 

To set the stage for this discussion, there are a two points that highlight exactly what is at stake:

1. New drugs have historically created great value for patients. Since 1970, for example, [the introduction of new drugs has increased the expected lifespan of the US population by between 0.75-1.00% *per year*](http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/PhRMA%20Profile%202013.pdf). On a disease by disease basis, similar trends are observed: for instance, upwards of 60% of the dramatic improvement that we have seen in survival for cancer patients in the past decades is attributable to new pharmaceutical products. And there is no reason to expect this trend will change. Additionally, new drugs often save the healthcare system money, since patients spend less time in hospitals or other care facilities. One study, for example, found that every dollar spent on drugs was associated with two dollars in savings for Medicare. So drugs have the power to do a great deal of good -- both for individuals and society.

2. Contrastingly, a major challenge in the US healthcare system is that many people cannot afford the drugs they are prescribed. In the US, patients pay on average about 20% of drug prices out of pocket. Medical illness and the concomitant high drug prices (as well as prices associated with care) is the single most common cause of personal bankruptcy. And perhaps unsurprisingly, but no less tragically, [many patients who cannot afford high priced drugs suffer worse outcomes in their treatments because they discontinue the treatment and opt for alternative, less effective therapies](http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/32/4/306.abstract?ijkey=0207d43d4eb7a164fc45449eb6e2143464684818&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha).

The public health policy debate that emerges then is: *what is the best way to ensure a robust pipeline of new drugs for unmet patient needs in a way that benefits as many patients as possible?*

**Why are drugs so expensive**

At least three factors contribute to the price of pharmaceutical products:


1)  *The need to offset the high costs of drug development*. 


A [recent Tufts study](http://csdd.tufts.edu/files/uploads/Tufts_CSDD_briefing_on_RD_cost_study_-_Nov_18,_2014..pdf), for example, pegs the development costs of a new drug at $2.6 billion. The report found that pre-human development costs about $430 million per successful drug; clinical development cost $965 million per successful drug; the opportunity costs (what investors could have done with their money over the ten year period required to conduct these studies) accounts for the remainder of the $2.6 billion figure. It is important to note that these figures include the costs of drugs that failed to get FDA approval  and current data suggests that 90% of new chemical entities entering clinical trials fail (and an increased failure rate is implicated in the rising costs of drugs  why and to what extent more putative drugs are failing in clinical trials is an interesting topic for conversation). 

The bottom line is, if a company cant generate more money than it spends, it will go out of business. In some ways, this helps to set the floor for drug prices. If people are interested we can discuss these numbers in more detail in the comments (i.e. what exactly is it about research or clinical trials that costs so much money). It is also worth noting, that some groups [dispute the Tufts estimate](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/rd-cost-estimates-msf-response-tufts-csdd-study-cost-develop-new-drug), claiming development costs are closer to several hundred million per new drug. We can also discuss discrepancies between studies in the comments as well. There is also discussion about what pharmaceutical companies should be allowed to spend money on  for example, advertising.


2)  *The benefit that the drug offers, relative to the next best treatment option*. 


For this, lets look at an example: Gileads [Harvoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), a $90,000 drug that essentially cures hepatitis C in most patients. In justifying the price, Gilead argues that the next best treatment for patients often involves liver transplants, extensive hospital and hospice care, and a major decline in quality of life. A liver transplant, for instance, [can easily cost over $500,000 in the U.S.](http://www.transplants.org/faq/how-much-does-transplant-cost) By using Harvoni, patients are actually saving money because they would have spent far more than $90,000 to cover all of these other medical costs. When drug companies are negotiating with payers (companies, such as [Express Scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express_Scripts), which foot the bills for most drugs), this is often one of the most critical points in determining price. In some ways, this sets the ceiling for a drugs price.

 
 3)  *The temporary monopoly granted to new pharmaceutical products in the form of patents*. 


In most markets, price is determined by a tension between supply and demand; when the markets are operating efficiently, prices will approach marginal costs of production. It turns out manufacturing drugs is quite cheap. Harvoni, for instance, only costs several dollars per pill to make and distribute. So why dont prices for drugs approach the marginal cost of production? Namely, because most governments choose to give new drugs an exclusive monopoly for several years after development. This allows the company to sell the drug for prices far above marginal costs. Governments allow this under the premise that this encourages innovation. The basic idea is that the only way to ensure a robust pipeline of future drugs is to offer companies a financial incentive to take on the high development costs outlined above.  It is also worth noting, that once a drug goes off patent, generics enter the market offering patients similar care for a drastically reduced price. For example, consider antiretrovirals (ARVs) used to treat patients with HIV. Initially these drugs cost $10,000+ per patient per year. Now, however, ARTs are available for roughly $100 per person per year. Similar trends can be seen for cholesterol lowering medications, cancer therapeutics and many more drugs that have come off patent. Once expensive molecules are now available at prices considerably closer to the marginal cost of production and distribution.

Is this the best model for promoting a healthy stream of new, lifesaving drugs? How do companies abuse this model (i.e. [evergreening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreening#Controversy_about_evergreening) or [pay-to-delay deals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_payment_patent_settlement)), and what can be done about it? We can discuss these topics in the comments section if there is interest.

The goal of this write-up was to promote a thoughtful examination of what goes into determining the price of a drug. It is my hope that this enables intelligent conversations about how best to manage an expensive, but critical piece of the national health infrastructure. My personal opinion is that pharmaceutical companies have the potential to do a great deal of good for humanity. And quite often they live up to this ambition. That is why I am happy to work for one. Certainly, there are despicable people like Martin Shkreli who abuse loopholes in legislation to extort value from the system, rather than add to it. But we need to understand how the selective actions of a few criminals do not represent the work of an entire industry. Thanks for reading. 

**TL;DR**: The need to offset development costs sets the floor for drug pricing; the marginal benefit provided by the drug over the next best treatment option sets the ceiling. Patents give drug companies temporary monopolies, allowing them to realize profits. Finding a way to balance the need for new drugs in the future versus their costs today is critical public health challenge.

I don't know about AI in dentistry. I am not really familiar on that subject so I will skip it.

About the rest, I think that if you attended some 2nd, 3rd and 4th tier institutions to get these professional designation you are probably out of luck.

But there will always be demand on these professionals who attended a fancy institution.

Not only these people actually do create something, but the richer people do need someone to, literally, wipe their shit and do the things without them really having to take care of everything. 

Automation only solves part of the problem, since they always feel the need for some checks and balances.

Lawyers, doctors, some accountants or some fancy MBAs will serve these functions pretty well. They will be glorified personal assistants, which we used to call secretaries when they used to be almost exclusively female, and will still be paid reasonable wages if they please the richer people who hire them. There will always be a demand for blackwater-type mercenaries as well since no one wants their security system to fail at the critical moment.

In short professional degrees from a prestigious institution will land someone like the position of a tutor ( People like Adam Smith and David Hume served as tutors for some rich guys back then) during the old days.

the luxury market would be one of the few non-tech growth market.

There will be demand for more and more luxurious goods, and more and more exclusive items. 

However, you can only skin a cat in so many ways. and the luxury can only be maintained by artificial shortages. Plus, as the highest-income people continue to increase, more and more demands for more and more wonderous items wil lincrease.

I think that some kind of way should be found to integrate IOT with luxurious goods, which are beyond the reach of most mortals.

How, not very sure. Many older people want things to be done in the 'old' way, and IOT might not have too much place for those who can't think about the new way.

However, I think that eventually using IOT in the luxury market is inevitable, since that would separate them from the rest.

Watches are the most obvious example, but luxury clothes could be drying and ironing themselves, eliminating the need for cleaners. They could fold themselves and even wash themselves.

Watches could set themselves (of course, for analog watches). For other luxurious goods, their own way could be found.

I think that the companies doing IOT should concentrate on the luxury market, where the money is better, than to the common market, where the increasingly impoverishe people won't be able to pay.

Since 1913 the Federal Reserve has operated as central bank for the United States, and over the course of the last century has transitioned the US (and global) economy into a fiat financial capitalist economic system. As such, the monetary policy decisions and inherent perils built into a fiat system of currency issued solely on the basis of debt to a central bank have resulted in wholesale mismanagement and an overwhelmingly unequal distribution of global wealth.

The framers of the US Constitution gave Congress alone the authority to coin money, and were vehemently against the proposal of utilizing fiat money, knowing full well the dangers that it poses.

Oliver Ellsworth, Constitutional framer and third Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, said:

""This is a favorable moment to shut and bar the door against paper money. The mischief of the various experiments which have been made are now fresh in the public mind and have excited the disgust of all the respectable parts of America""

George Mason to George Washington: ""They may pass a law to issue paper money, but twenty laws will not make the people receive it. Paper money is founded upon fraud and knavery.""

James Wilson from Pennsylvania said: ""It will have the most salutary influence on the credit of the United States to remove the possibility of paper money.""

Until now, there hasn't been a viable alternative to a central bank/fiat since the country has decided to abandon the gold standard, and I personally do not believe it wise to attempt a return to it. Rather, I propose we harness the recent advent of blockchain technology at our disposal to restructure the US financial system, abolish fiat currency and the Federal Reserve altogether, and return the authority to Congress to digitally mint the US dollar as a cryptocurrency managed by the US Treasury. 

The rise of Bitcoin as a purely democratic digital currency and valuable investment asset is increasing as a threat to global financial institutions, and it is no wonder why CEO's like JP Morgan Chases' Jamie Dimon are quick to call it a ""fraud"". For those not familiar with the technology behind Bitcoin, the true value of the cryptocurrency lies in the purely democratic nature of the distributed ledger system that supports it. Why do central banks abhor its rise in prominence? It removes them as middlemen, stewards, and most importantly *issuers* of our currency, therefore crippling their ability to implement monetary policy from a central banking standpoint free of oversight, as was the case with the bailout of the global financial system post 2008.

It is clear that a fiat based global economy, controlled by financial institutions in accordance with the guidance of central banks, do not serve the interest of the people, which is why returning the authority to Congress to mint our currency returns some accountability and oversight to monetary policy decisions. It would be impossible for the US economy to simply ""switch"" to Bitcoin as the national currency; therefore it is necessary that the US digitally mints its own and grants Congress (who are at least accountable to their constituents to a degree compared to an independent Federal Reserve) the collective power to make decisions on how best to manage it. If the people do not agree with how they manage and utilize funds, they have the power to vote representatives out of office, whereas the Federal Reserve Board of Governors are appointed and can adjust monetary policy as they see fit.

There are numerous benefits to implementing a blockchain based national cryptocurrency in the US, and this is certainly not an exhaustive list:

-	Limit the occurrence of fraud/ identity theft and make cash based illegal activity more difficult
-	Smart contracts make settlements easy, cheap and instantaneous and will revolutionize the insurance and lending structure by democratizing the process
-	Improve the populations access to the financial system
-	Decentralization via peer-to-peer networks and mass collaboration to determine best practices while maintaining individual privacy
-	Minimalizing asymmetrical information in markets that is used to exploit and defraud the public

I am confident this proposal, while not perfect or complete in detailing exactly how this transition is implemented, is a vast improvement upon our current economic system, and will go a long way to brings stability, equity, and faith back into our monetary practices as a nation. By democratizing the decision making surrounding supply and use of the US Dollar, presently the most important currency in the world, we can avoid the inevitable conflict brooding between those who wish to abandon  traditional economic practice altogether and the institutional powers that seek to maintain complete control over our money indefinitely. There must be a return to sound and egalitarian financial practice in conjunction with an acknowledgement of the benefits presented by blockchain tech as it pertains to finance and numerous other industries, and I feel this the proper way to reconcile the flaws in our economic system before another collapse (a fait accompli of fiat money) throws society into chaos and violence.

I invite you to join the discussion and offer your input as to if you believe this transition would benefit or harm the population at large, and I appreciate your time and feedback. Thanks for reading.",6,2,False,self,,,,,

Tax cuts are not important anymore, since the 1% derives most of their income from capital gains, rents, dividends, and other activities which have nothing to do with work.

And, unfortunately for millions and millions of work drones, the rentiers have a gazillion ways to save taxes, and overall they get to pay much less taxes than the workers, fueling their wealth even further.

Whether people like it or not, the Rentier Economy has arrived, just like the pre-1914 days.

&gt;Bitcoin, Bay Area real estate, tech stocks (Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Sales Force, etc.)

These assets will appreciate forever. The game has changed once for all, and there is no way these assets will ever decline since the Fed can always print more and more.

In fact, many of these people will go without salary, to avoid paying the Social Security and other taxes which won't benefit them.

Meanwhile,

https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/how-sleep-deprivation-decays-the-mind-and-body/282395/

(tl, dr - most people who have to work two or more jobs will have sleep deprivation problem, which will affect them permanently.)

Sorry.

The capitalists will want to pay much less to the increasingly less essential workers, and workers' comp abuse will end. 

The compensation paid to the dead at the Triangle Garment Factory fire was what would be now $1,200/head while their owners were not punished (and their descendants probably still wealthy now).

In fact, except for jobs like coders and high level techies, like the kind of gentlemen hired by Elon Musk, most jobs will be gig-based. The agency will not be responsible for any injuries or mishaps, and any injuries suffered on the 'gig' will be the responsibility of the worker, no matter where the fault is. Of course compensation will be capped at $1,200 to help the economy and an injured person will probably starve to death in the streets, like hundreds of Chinese laborers did back in Shanghai in the 1920s (charity was unknown to the Chinese, who thought one's bad luck was because of their bad deeds in the past life.)

However, the rentiers and cognitive elites will welcome these changes, since saving on the employee overheads will improve economy, drive the Future and increase their earnings. They had to deal with their inferiors for centuries, but thanks to tech they don't have to do that anymore.

You could likely just call it a conspiracy theory. But it's something that is often on my mind, and I would like to bring it up with you all.

Throughout history, China has always been a superpower - of course, they have their ups and downs in their nation - but overall they tend to be a world leader. This can be seen from the initial dynasties such as the Xia and Shang. 

The nation today seems to see the world as a huge chess game - and they're so far ahead that we don't even know it. Within the past decade, they have build a manufacturing powerhouse. Not only this, but they have also been stockpiling resources for many years. 

Is it possible that if the time comes China will make a move - they have artificial islands, empty cities, massive population, and the ability to manufacture anything at an alarming rate. 

They could easily outproduce, outswarm, outnumber, outsurvive against any nation through their huge stockpile of resources, and their strict government.

What are your thoughts on the nation, their plans, their actions, and what they've done in the past. Am I just a crazy doomsday speculator in the making and I don't even know it?

for an example my family comes from a post-bust factory town where there are more car repair facilities than make sense (because of all the out of work GE engineers and what not who tried going the start up route) and retail space (mostly empty). thats the source of employment post automated mines and manufacturing for the entire region other than tourism for the dying ski industry. when the stores all do finally close, even just the retail ones, the area will be truly devastated. even if the mechanics and auto stores stay around, an easy 50% of jobs will vanish if no one even goes to target and walmart.

so what exactly other than UBI is the solution? UBI will never be a political success until well over 50% of the country is permanently unemployed. high skill jobs like computer programmers might not even exist, but also aren't a realistic option for entire swaths of the country to retrain for. every economy has been predicated on a vast number of low skill workers, so what will be the next low skill job?

Wikipedia starts listing generations in the Western works with the Lost Generation (ww1 vets), then the GI Generation (ww2 vets) and so on.

A side note observation is that WW1 is what seems to have united the Western world (remember that it lead to the creation of the League of Nations). Before this it was different for each country.

Now comes my thought. To make it simpler, how about a versioning system?

* The Lost Generation: Western 1.0
* The GI Generation: Western 2.0
* The Silent Generation: Western 3.0
* Baby Boomers: Western 4.0
* Generation X: Western 5.0

I recently sat through a video about Ray Kurzweil at the insistence of a friend.  I kind of remembered who he was at the beginning of the video, but seemed to have suppressed a lot of emotions regarding the man, and I had the feeling that most of those emotions were negative.  After nearly biting my tongue off during the video, I remembered why:  From everything I've heard about him, he's a skilled but egotistical electrical engineer that doesn't know anything at all about nanotech and talks about it like it's magic. There's a reason that he spends all his time these days TALKING about nanotechnology rather than actually working on it though: he wouldn't know where to begin, so he's trying to get other people to work on it. Since he wants to be immortal, he thinks that if he can just promote this type of research enough, he can achieve his goals. He'll die with a normal human lifespan though, I guarantee it. The year 2030 (when he predicts this technology will become available) is 100% wishful thinking on his part, and was calculated based on the fact that he wants to be alive to see it (and thus use it to attain immortality) rather than any real numbers that make any sense.

One problem with his thinking is that he still hasn't learned the lesson that economists learned back in 1929: exponential growth never continues forever. It may hold true over periods of years or decades, but eventually, it hits some hard limit. For instance, Moore's law, which is the most well-known exponential formula applied to technological development, can't hold true forever, if only because devices (transistors in this case) can never become smaller than an atom. But because Ray Kurzweil has successfully predicted technological development in the past based on an assumption of exponential improvement, (he'd begin a project before the technology for it all existed, using an exponential model to predict when it would become available) he seems to think that he can make any wild extrapolation he can think of, using the same exponential model.

Using nothing but exponential models to predict technological improvements, ends up resulting in a weird phenomenon called ""The Singularity"", which I personally don't buy into at all. Reason being, it ascribes human-like intelligence to AI, but then totally ignores the means through which mammalian intelligence develops and assumes that that part isn't necessary. Basically, the most intelligent mammals are the ones with the longest childhoods. For this purpose, we can assume that ""childhood"" is the length of time between birth and reproduction, and is primarily a period of learning. Humans, of course, have ridiculously long childhoods, which is a major evolutionary detriment. This sort of thing wouldn't evolve unless there was an enormous upside to counterbalance it, which of course, there is. That being, the many benefits of the technology and global society that our species' intelligence has allowed us to develop.

In essence, what Ray fails to realize is that a computer can't learn just by sitting there being smart. Neither can a human, for that matter. Learning requires interacting with the universe via a lengthy process of trial and error. It also requires the ability to sort out correct and incorrect information, when sifting through all the data collected by other sources that's accessible to it. Since a combination of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and chaos theory preclude perfect predictions in our universe, that means that there's no getting around the learning process for an AI, and also that an AI will need to use probability as a means of predicting events. The alternative to using probability is being ""so smart that it can predict everything perfectly"", which all the especially obnoxious futurists seem to believe is going to become the case.

But what does AI have to do with nanotech? As it turns out, everything. You see, Ray Kurzweil has made a particularly egregious leap of faith: because of the enormous complexity involved, people will need to develop AI with god-like abilities in order to then develop the nanotech that Ray so desperately wants to believe will be available before he reaches the end of his natural lifespan. Of course, this involves no small amount of speculation, that assumes that artificial intelligence and biological intelligence are both scalar quantities, and thus have the ability to increase exponentially. After all, anything that isn't a scalar, can't fit that exponential model that Ray is so fond of, and he really, *really* wants it to fit. If it didn't, then Ray's extrapolations would fall apart and he'd have to die eventually like every other human being that's ever lived.

Also, Ray Kurzweil regularly throws around phrases like ""ten times as intelligent as a human"" as though intelligence is a scalar quantity and can be measured like this. Think of it this way: if I said you were 276 times as intelligent as a gopher, where would that number be coming from? Likewise, describing a theoretical AI as being ten times as intelligent as a human sounds just as ridiculous.

The real thing that bugs me about Ray Kurzweil though, is his total inability to understand why people disagree with him. At one point, he was on a radio show, and a caller described him as a quasi-religious idiot with his head in the clouds. His response was something along the lines of ""some people just really seem to have a hard time accepting that this is what the future is going to be like soon."" No Ray, I think you have it backwards. *One* person is having a very tough time accepting that this *isn't* what things are going to be like any time soon.

Such attitude will be common among the winners of the tech revolution, since they no longer have any fears from the lower classes.

At /collapse I fought with those who think the status quo can be overturned. It can't. barring a full scale nuclear war which would probably end all civilization.

Today's rich will be rich forever, because the price of every asset will continue to appreciate, which will marginalize those without capital assets (incl real estate) further and further, until something like Wounded Knee will finish them off.

Technofeudalism will arrive with all these bells and whistles, and 'equal protection of the law' and other 20th century notions will be 'readjusted' to reflect reality.

The rich will treat those who serve them like what the higher-caste Indians treat the lower class servers (who are of their own class, with different scales among them - i.e. the maitre d' is of a higher caste than the busser, and will never do the busser's work).

Today's social status being eternal, and today's rich will only get richer as they control all apparatuses of wealth and the stock market priced out from the masses. In other words, there will probably be no future for the rest of pop.

I think that the feeling will be mutual, both among the rich and the poor. The rich knows they are selected, and the not-rich knows they are doomed. That kind of ethos will only get stronger.

In Italy, around 1900, richer people ate in restaurants which few people frequented since not too many people had the wherewithals to eat in there, and poorer people watched the richer people eating. It was a taboo for the richer people to give any food to the starving kids, since doing that would attract other poorer kids.

Such kind of social custom, now enforced with mechanical cops who will taser poorer watchers if they get close to where the richer people are, will return. It will be normal for richer people to openly taunt, insult and abuse poorer people, but in a social darwinistic way it is a progress since it puts the people to their place.",24,0,False,self,,,,,

Now I empathize to a degree, I used to work a crappy minimum wage retail job. You lose your humanity over time. And doing brain dead repetitive work makes you act like an inefficient robot at best. The only place where I've actually seen service people give a damn or trick me into thinking they give a damn is Japan. That's another ballgame and conversation onto itself.

Basically most cashiers suck (for reasons not of their own doing) and while I empathize - it's their sucky job, they can have a sucky day but I don't want to. I'd rather deal with a machine. Heartless as this sounds, I know I'm not alone.

The next logical step would be to make 50% of cashier space self-checkout. Have 1 person monitoring 4 registers. Over time up the % of space and increase the ratio of monitors to registers.

Are there any major obstacles I'm not aware of? Theft? Yeah I understand that. Buying alchohol, ok. Anything else? Self checkout has been around years, why hasn't it taken off?",26,0,False,self,,,,,

The 20 July 2017 issue of Nature has a series of articles on the role of topology in  understanding exotic materials. [A general background is given here](https://www.nature.com/news/all-shook-up-over-topology-1.22322). In summary, topology is the study of how the inter-relation of spacial components of something are unaffected by continuous change: famously, how a [torus becomes a tea cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iHjt2Ovqag). 

This sounds like trivial fun until you realise the overwhelming role of *symmetry* in the deep structure of physics. Conservation laws - like energy, momentum - exist as a consequence of the fact that changes in (non-accelerating) viewpoint do not alter them. Exactly the same is true of the changes in topology. This has major implications in the quantum realm. This issue of Nature explores some of these. 

* Quasi-particles are quantised disturbances in matter: for example, magnetic vortices. These give rise to real-world effects such as giant magnetoresistance, which has had major applications in electronics. 

* Some materials are insulators but, due to the existence of quasi-particles on their edges, conduct along these surfaces. These quasi-particles are, due to their topological nature, resistant to irregularities and disturbances. Nevertheless, they show quantum properties. This makes them ideal for quantum computing. A break-through [paper in Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v547/n7663/full/nature23268.html) allows materials to be assessed in the computer for their possible nature as topological insulators. Hundreds of candidates have been identified. 

* Also in this issue [is the possible detection of gravity - strictly, space time - as effecting](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v547/n7663/full/nature23005.html) the flow of similar quasi-particles in a tiny, 2D surface. This may open the door to tests on gravity on the very small scale, something up until now impossible.

In a related study, the nanoscale swirls in spin within a magnet are [mapped in extraordinary detail in three dimensions](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v547/n7663/full/547290a.html) by a polarised beam of x-rays. 

This issue also reports the coding of a video into the genome of a living bacteria, shows that the genes that a brain cancer needs to survive in vitro are completely different from those in needs within the brain, show that how babies view social scenes is both genetic and differs in children with autism, and dates the arrival of humans in Australia to 65 KYBP, coinciding with the precipitate decline in its megafauna and preceding the Toba eruption by five thousand years. 

All that in just one week. Extraordinary is the rate of change. ",0,3,False,self,,,,,

A part of that is tackling people's fear in AI and the AI's morals that will depend on us, the people.

My questions are therefore what are the advantages/disadvantages of going to all corners of the globe and handing out surveys and coding the AI depending on that, or simply relying on a moral person or group of people to code in the morals and ignore the people. Given advantages and disadvantages for both scenarios (secluded group vs public votes), which would be the most reliable to get conclusive morals for the AI-governed society?

Of course, with the survey option I expect the obvious ""not many respondents"" issue, time, expense, etc.; also both options have the issue with personal biases making the AI more racist/sexist/whatever-phobic because that's how humans work. Any ideas other than that?

TL;DR questions:

* Advantages/disadvantages of surveying people from all over the globe on the morals they should code into AI
* Advantages/disadvantages of having a single person/small group of people decide on said morals
* Overall, which option do you think would work better (if either)?

Notes: I basically copy/pasted my post from r/artificial to here bar this line here. I hope you can help me out with some extra views/analysis as well as r/artificial!

I'm unsure whether this should be posted here or elsewhere, if you think you know a place this would be better suited, please tell me!",8,0,False,self,,,,,

That is, the trial failed. Intepirdine is now yet another bullet point in an increasingly long list of drugs which fail to demonstrate a benefit for AD patients in late stage clinical trials.

*What is intepirdine?*

Intepirdine is a strong antagonist of the [5-HT6 receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT6_receptor), a largely central nervous system-specific member of the serotonin receptor subfamily. There is some evidence that the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is impaired as Alzheimers develops and progresses, and modulating it is seen as a potential therapeutic avenue. People were excited about intepirdine because it has been shown to reverse [experimentally induced](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23384714) and [age-related](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22766392) learning deficits in rats. Further it is an AD drug that doesn't target the amyloid pathway - an area which has repeatedly failed to yield a useful drug.

There were a number of caveats, though, going into this study. First, a common theme in neuroscience is that serotonin seems to be involved in everything, yet modulating it rarely has a meaningful effect. Second, and most important, several other companies had [previously tested different 5-HT6 antagonists in AD](http://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/lundbeck-calls-time-alzheimer-s-drug-after-more-failure) and they had all failed. Even this exact drug, intepirdine, had [failed to impress in a Phase 2 study sponsored by GSK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20872778). Axovant argued that GSK's trial was poorly done and that the drug, given to the right patients at the right dose, could demonstrate a benefit.

*How was the trial set up?*

Intepirdine was tested in a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, termed the MINDSET trial. The trial evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intepirdine in patients with mild to moderate AD on donepezil therapy over 24 weeks. The trial compared once-daily oral doses of intepirdine 35 mg to placebo in 1,315 patients ages 50 to 85. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at baseline ranged from 10 to 26. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were ADAS-Cog - a measure of disturbances of memory, language, praxis, attention and other cognitive abilities - and the ADCS-ADL - a measurement of how patients are able to perform in more functional, day to day tasks.

*What were the results?*

We don't yet have a detailed report of the results. We know the trial failed to demonstrate a stat sig improvement in either of its two co-primary endpoints. Specifically, at 24 weeks, patients treated with 35 mg of intepirdine did not experience improvement in ADAS-Cog (0.36 ADAS-Cog points; p-value = 0.22) or ADCS-ADL (0.09 ADCS-ADL points; p-value = 0.83),  compared to patients treated with placebo. It may be that some subgroups did better than others on the drug, time will tell. In the meantime, though, Axovant has discontinued clinical activity with this drug.

*Where are we with AD drug development?*

Suffice it to say, the research has not been going well. Last year we saw two more high profile failures of amyloid-targeting agents. We don't even have another strong shot on goal until 2019 (Biogen's abeta antibody, aducanumab). I think it is safe to say that the idea of targeting 5-HT6 is dead. The amyloid hypothesis is in critical condition. So what does that leave us? Tau? Anti-inflammatories? Obviously something is needed because AD is a devastating disease and it is becoming increasingly common as we live to older ages.",15,31,False,self,,,,,

And while pigs serve no real purpose other than bacon, you still want to maintain sustainsble, local populations of all domesticated animals in the event of the failure of lab grown meat production (solar flare, or infrastructure attack from foreign hackers, for example). Animals probably won't be on the menu again after a certain point, but to nearly eradicate populations of domesticated meat sources before the ensured long-term security of lab-grown meat would show a serious lack of foresight. 

What will cease is the slaughter of those meat sources for food. They will be considered strategic national resources. Upon death from natural causes, I guess anyone who still wants to eat animal flesh could choose to eat them. After all, many people will certainly continue eating meat, since non-domesticated animal populations will still require culling, unless we can create another method of population control (animal birth control? Not even on the agenda yet).

I would think you'd always want to be in the position that a year of breeding could get the populations back to where they are today. Also, if you eradicate domesticated animals, you won't be getting them back, if necessary, for a very long time. So, even domesticated pigs will need to be need to be protected.

  Every situation that involves the taking of human life through inaction of a self driving car in normal operation is reasonable and burdens not the car but the people who mis-used the road.  
  
  A self driving car should never be forced to ""swerve"" to avoid a pedestrian this killing the driver or less pedestrians. At all times the vehicle must follow the law and use it's breaks. If there is not enough time to stop before hitting the pedestrians then they will die. This is not.al and expected because they were breaking the law anyway.  
  
  I don't care if a million black underprivileged immigrant babies could be saved by swerving and killing the passenger. They were in the wrong to be using the road in an illegal fashion and will pay the price. There is no big dilemma regarding how autonomous vehicles should be programmed. If we use the existing laws everything else will figure itself out. If a pedestrian jumps out in front of a car well have fun in heaven because that's where you belong, not the passengers.  
  
  You might think I'm cruel in suggesting this but compared to the alternative, (vehicles that decide when to break laws to kill it's passengers), I'd say my idea is the only sane one that has been proposed. Autonomous vehicles do not have a moral decision to make. They are like robotic arm in a factory. If someone gets in the way and dies then it's the person's fault, not the machine.

I've been co-hosting a small politics podcast for the past few months. We started because we were sick of not hearing the views of our generation (i.e. under 30s) and decided to try and change it.

Recently, we've gotten sick of covering politics like a sports event. Ever week, we reacted to what just happened and bemoaned the short-sightedness of politicians/media talking heads. So we decided to shift gear.

Now, we want to cover the future of politics. We want to cover how technology has and will change the way we do politics - from voting to lobbying to activism, media coverage and everything else. Rather than focus on the system as it exists now - and being annoyed it doesn't reflect how we see the world - we want to understand how it might change and, even more, how we might go about changing it.

As a sub dedicated to the future, I figured you guys would have some really interesting thoughts on what the future of politics might be.

We know it will be digital and we know it probably won't look like the last 100 years. So what might it look like? And what would you guys want us to investigate to better understand it?

I appreciate your input - thanks!",5,0,False,self,,,,,

Something that I haven't seen a lot of on Futurology is the future of water. I've read some amazing articles on redesigning all sorts electronic infrastructure and using technology to make existing structures better - but nothing so far on water (I am pretty new though - please let me know if I've missed something).

I live in a drought-stricken city. Water infrastructure is suddenly under the microscope - mostly because, as drought is relatively new to the area, there's a lot of waste, but not enough government money to deal with the problems, especially given that the time frame for droughts seems to go from ""waiting to see how this plays out"" to ""stop using any water, right now"". But this isn't the only city experiencing this, nor the only city for whom such a drought is suddenly an issue. 

I don't consider any of the large-scale current global solutions to be adequate - they're either wasteful or inefficient, which seems indecent and outdated considering how well we've refined other systems. And to be honest, I have the same opinions regarding our household systems, living in a modern, Western, house.

So my discussion question is, what is the future of water infrastructure?",3,3,False,self,,,,,

The shortest distance between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are in Central America. Using Panama as an example, tides from the Pacific vs Atlantic oceans very at different times creating different levels for the oceans. If we create a pipe of 15' in diameter and run this pipe underground in Panama where each end of the pipe extends to each ocean then we will create flow. As the tides change the velocity and direction of the flow will be effected. The greater the levels of the oceans are, the higher the flow rate will become. Using different filtration techniques we can use the natural ""earth pumps"" for filtration on a massive scale.

Information below on tides between Panama.

Not commonly known is the fact that the two oceans have different sea levels, and different levels of high tide. At the entrance to the Panama Canal, the Pacific Ocean can rise as much as 20 feet, but 45 miles away, the difference between high tide and low in the Atlantic is just three feet.
