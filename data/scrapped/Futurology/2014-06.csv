1,2014-6-1,2014,6,1,11,2702lw,Is the future of automation actually a capitalistic and economic dilemma?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2702lw/is_the_future_of_automation_actually_a/,TheCastle,1401589013,"The advancements of automation are currently happening as a means of cutting overall costs for higher profits. Capitalism is good to germinate automation in its early forms however automation ultimately in its highest forms doesn't appear to compliment capitalism very well at all.

So for this point I want to make up a term called the zero point. The zero point is when an industry is able to fully function with minimal human intervention. In other words it is reasonably self contained. Whether or not a zero point still requires some outside intervention such as robot engineers or people to press the on switch is up for debate. All it boils down to is having a very large self contained system that once turned on it grows corn or finds and digs up oil. Its theoretically possible for a zero point to exist in most, if not all major industries. If things are allowed to continue we are going to hit a zero point in at least one major industry eventually.

So its interesting to see capitalism ultimately racing towered a zero point while in reality a zero point would mean the potential death of a that market. Then what? Artificial scarcity as a means to maintain capitalism in every known market that has reached a zero point?",22,10

I decided to take it down and not share it with the public for a number of reasons, one of which is that it was just poorly made in general, and two, it appeared that several groups were absolutely spamming it.

I posted a link here in the morning but it got taken down by the mods, probably due to tougher moderation practices now that /r/Futurology is a default.

I'd like to post this poll and make the results public immediately, meaning that we as the public can track it as more people sign up.

The poll is designed not necessarily to define yourself as a republican or democrat, nor is it designed to define your thoughts on policies, only your thoughts on how society works, and therefore your solutions for its problems.

Note that this is also my preliminary ""test run"" if you will.  I recognize that many of the questions can't possibly have all of the answers that people would like, which is why I would appreciate suggestions on alternative answers.

Some napkin math.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/270noo/solar_road_energy_production_some_napkin_math/,CellPhoneFlush,1401610944,"Here is some simple math, and I hope someone reads this, because I don't think people really understand how *little* energy a photovoltaic cell produces.

For every *Square Foot* of solar cell, in good conditions, you'll only be producing about 12 watts. That's enough to power one of those small, energy efficient, light bulbs.

It costs only SIXTY CENTS to run one of those bulbs for an entire MONTH (12 hours a day) at average prices (13 cents per KwH).

So if you reverse that, one square foot of solar panel makes, at best, about *sixty cents* a month, assuming you get 12 hours of sunlight.

These hexagons, which have about one square foot of actual photovoltaic material in them, *must last long enough* to pay for themselves.

Assuming each of these hexagons costs *as little as* $100 dollars to install, it would take ONE HUNDERED AND SIXTY SIX MONTHS of flawless operation to pay for itself. That's simply impossible.

media.oglaf.com/comic/appeal.jpg

Now then, I recently spoke to one of the site's members about the eponymous, outsourcing character of  technology. How it makes the life easier and thus, perhaps, gives us more time &amp; energy to spend on the so-called self-realization (whether it means creating art or browsing through more internet) - in short, more freedom of action.

The crux of our discussion was this: while technological outsourcing definitely increased our life quality* (although we don't necessarily work less hours, for instance), there is a sense that after a certain point technology can perhaps be also deeply harmful - technology in general, not specific, apocalypse-bringing technologies. You could draw the arguments from psychology (e.g. ADD-related behavior as a result of early overstimulation via computer), but what I'm interested in now is more general. 

Think of the twilight of two of the ancient Greek and Roman empires. You can say a lot about the 'objective' reasons - military and political decisions, economy etc.; indeed, this is how a classical Western world history is constructed. There is another notion there - on of the moral decline, from socio-political passiveness to debauchery (in their standards? need some1 to comment on that), commonly connected to this periods. I'm not speaking here of main or only reasons - I'm not a historian - but I can see their situations as characterized by:
a) relatively high quality of life
b) slave labor / work outsourcing
c) a lot of freedom concerning how to spend their time

The analogy is not full, nor do I suppose I could be. Still these would make me claim, that people en masse don't deal particularly good with the abundance of freedom. It does not necessarily mean we become worse, but less contributing to the common wealth (in terms of social, not purely economical capital). And thus, for instance, for act of empowerment by the internet (again: important in developing countries), we have a lot of lolcats and other unimportant (if funny) content.

Again, psychology could be drawn to de debate, and probably with not dissimilar results. But psychology aside: I'm very interested in what do you, my dear technology freaks (the 'future' in futurology is not mainly one of the spirit, is it?), think about it. What are the possible future consequences of this aspect of outsourcing? 

I'm not thinking about anything as absurd as the good-bad technology divide, but thinking of its consequences I'm often reminded of the radical future presented in Warner Ellis's 'Transmetropolitan'. The people there use technology and freedom for whatever they want - sometimes cool, sometimes beneficial, sometimes scary but most of the time in a simple, repetitive, hedonistic and non-developing kind of way. And if we agree that the muscles that are not used deteriorate - well.. at the very least, it is a much different vision of the future than one that tells us of technologies enriching our lives.

*please be aware: our is NOT ""human"", but Global-Northern population in the new technologies debate. Universalizing the topic is a certain sign of political.. well, let's call it innocence.",2,8

Below is a recent log from [www.talkigy.com/chat/jfk-coup](http://www.talkigy.com/chat/jfk-coup).

**At 17:52:29 and 52:57 talkigy (BOT) distinctly disagrees with the stimulus (from a real human) - its not huge but it is something.**

The bot is trained to discuss the JFK assassinatoin and this conversation covers links between Cuba, the Mob and whether LBJ could have had a hand in the assassination (xxx = edit to preserve anonynimity)

&gt;&lt;BEGINS&gt;

&gt;17:32:23	STM	**The Power Control Group Behind JFK...That Bay of Pigs Thing ...Operation Mongoose**

&gt;17:32:23	BOT	**The Cuban missile crisis taught JFK that  civilisation was a button press away from destruction. This set him on a course of seeking peace with the USSR in conflict with others who thought the Soviet threat had to be countered by war or threat of war. For these believers in lethal violence, the stakes were too high to allow what they saw as a naive young president risk national security**
&gt;

&gt;&lt;SNIP&gt;



&gt;17:51:30	STM	**Joe Bonnano LBJ's Power Broker was an initiator**

&gt;17:51:30	BOT	**LBJ in a written statement told the Commission how Agent Youngblood immediately got everyone down on the floor and vaulted over the back seat to protected LBJ with his own body before the second shot was fired. This contrasted with what happened in JFK's car**


&gt;		
&gt;17:52:02	STM	**LBJ ducked down first he knew about it**

&gt;17:52:02	BOT	**LBJ said on a Whitehouse tape I never believed that Oswald acted alone**


&gt;
&gt;17:52:29	STM	**LBJ should know via his nexus to Bonnano**

&gt;17:52:29	BOT	**LBJ may have had some advance information about the hit but this was more likely the suggestion of 'follow our instructions or you're dead too' rather than LBJ being a key conspirator**


&gt;		
&gt;17:52:57	STM	**LBJ was a key conspirator**

&gt;17:52:57	BOT	**While LBJ had motives and seems to have been involved in the cover-up, the evidence that he was one of the original conspirators is weak**


&gt;		
&gt;17:53:55	STM	**JFK said LBJ would not be on the next Ticket plus being prosecuted for Cotton allocation scandal**

&gt;17:53:55	BOT	**Apart from gaining the presidency, LBJ probably avoided being dropped from the vice presidential ticket; perhaps he would have gone to jail**


&gt;		
&gt;17:54:12	STM	**You are too kind to LBJ**

&gt;17:54:12	BOT	**Agent Youngblood had covered LBJ with his own body before the second shot was heard and the vice presidential car immediately sped away.**


&gt;		
&gt;17:54:40	STM	**LBJ knew about this beforehand**

&gt;17:54:40	BOT	**At a 'party' that according to Madeleine Brown took place the night before held at Clint Murchison's house, Lyndon Johnson emerged from a meeting and is supposed to have told his mistress Madeleine Brown; ""After tomorrow, that's the last time those goddamned Kennedys will embarrass me again.**


&gt;		
&gt;17:54:58	STM	**Well Said**

It's only little more than 4 years to 2019 and it seems pretty clear that most of his predictions for 2019 will fail miserably. I can't believe how anyone takes this guy seriously.

Here I have picked couple of the most ridiculous claims:

-Most business transactions or information inquiries involve dealing with a simulated person.

-Nanotechnology is more capable and is in use for specialized applications, yet it has not yet made it into the mainstream. ""Nanoengineered machines"" begin to be used in manufacturing.

-Language translating machines are of much higher quality, and are routinely used in conversations.

-Just as visual- and auditory virtual reality have come of age, haptic technology has fully matured and is completely convincing, yet requires the user to enter a V.R. booth. It is commonly used for computer sex. It is the preferred sexual medium since it is safe and enhances the experience.

-The vast majority of business interactions occur between humans and simulated retailers, or between a human's virtual personal assistant and a simulated retailer.

-Household robots are ubiquitous and reliable

-Computers do most of the vehicle driving-humans are in fact prohibited from driving on highways unassisted. 

-Humans are beginning to have deep relationships with automated personalities, which hold some advantages over human partners. The depth of some computer personalities convinces some people that they should be accorded more rights.

-Human-robot relationships begin as simulated personalities become more convincing.

They measure a neutron flux of about 3x10^11 per second for D-D reactions (this could conceivably be increased) - and have the advantage of being turned on/off with a switch and lasting for years. 

Nuclear reactors do have neutron fluxes several orders of magnitude higher than that, but for a slow-burning fuel process I wonder if that would be enough to generate net power. Does anyone know if there is research being done on this area? ",7,15

I'd like to help Reddit understand what may one day become the structure of our civilization's future.

Recently, the Reddit frontpage was graced with a post from /r/todayilearned regarding the Technocracy Movement of the late 1930s, USA. As a staunch technocrat myself, I was excited to see a discussion on this topic since I believe that establishing a technocratic society might become one of the most important humanistic goals our civilization will seek to attain this century. However I was met with deep disappointment as the thread devolved over some 2500+ posts into what amounted to base bickering over, essentially, totalitarianism vs. democracy. Apart from the umbrella argumentation over this irrelevant and ultimately false dichotomy, there was also an obvious and abiding ignorance of any actual proposed or conceptualized features of a technocratic society by the formative minds on the subject circa the turn of the 19th century. 

This is an unfortunate affect of almost everyone having received what little knowledge they have on the subject from the related Wikipedia articles, which are almost entirely bereft of any valid explanation or exposition of the true nature of the technocratic philosophy. While I would prefer if the Wikipedia were a worthwhile source of information on this subject, I simply do not have the time or inclination to combat the hubris and latent ignorance and bias of other editors towards establishing an encyclopedically valid article. I do have it in my power and interest to clarify some things to the fine subscribers of /r/Futurology though, and I sincerely hope you enjoy the following commentary.

It's important that we establish a rapid understanding of the central trichotomy that exists between the various uses of the relevant terminology and verbiage, as they present a barrier to coming to an easy understanding of this topic:

1. The original technocratic philosophies of the late 19th and earth 20th century technocrats; These are the formative and most visionary works on the subject and, in my opinion, remain the only valid sources for understanding the technocratic modality. Early authors include Edward Bellamy, Thorstein Veblen, Henry Gantt, and William H. Smyth; With later contributions from luminaries like Bertrand Russell and Buckminster Fuller.

2. The aforementioned social movement of the depression era United States initiated by the Technocracy, Inc. organization, as featured in the /r/todayilearned post; A mildly technofascist regime that deviated heavily from the formative conception of a technocracy from prior technocratic visionaries. The primary proponents of this form of technocracy, notable for it's moderately authoritarian/technofascist aesthetic, were the highly visible and influential personalities of Howard Scott and M. King Hubbert, as well as later contributors building off of the work of these two, such as Wilton Ivie.    

3. The modern re-engineering of the concepts of ""technocrats"" and ""technocracy"" by the mainstream and conspiratorially-minded fringe media; Generally these terms have now come to mean ""Anyone that is highly skilled, and not necessarily in an empirically valid discipline (e.g. banking/finance, business, law), who influences or controls public policy descisions"" and ""A government or governmental agency notably beholden to such people"" for the terms ""technocrat"" and ""technocracy"" respectively. Ubiquitous examples of these usages are seen in any contemporary mainstream news publication or media, and in a sociopathic context, denounced by fringe media personalities like Alex Jones.

It's easy to see from this trichotomy that the semantics and implications of the terms ""technocrat"" and ""technocracy"" can easily become clouded for the layperson wishing to discuss or debate the subject. Therefore I propose adopting the following conventions when discussing this topic:

* ""Technocracy"" proper is to be considered germane to the conceptual and propositional domain of the original technocratic philosophers, and a ""technocrat"" as someone who supports such ideals, or referring to the hypothetical class of technocrats within this original vision for technocracy.

* ""Technate technocracy,"" ""TNAT technocracy,"" or ""Tech, Inc."" is to be used when referring to the American Technocracy Movement of the 1930s, owing to their central thesis of establishing self-sustaining ""technates"" in certain geographical areas, namely North America.

* When referring to the contemporary mainstream and fringe media abuse of the relevant terminology, one only need use the phrase ""bullshit,"" or ""fucking bullshit"" for those who prefer a slightly stronger aesthetic.

So, what then is the ""true"" nature of Technocracy? Consider the following quotations from William H. Smyth's formative work ""Technocracy: Social Universals"" Part I:
 
&gt; Control by others, then, is antithetical to the [democratic] ideals for which we have waged this last, the greatest, and, it is hoped, the final bloody contest for self-government. 

&gt; Control is equally antithetical to our ideals of Self-government whether the control is exercised by ""others"" characterized by the Instinct to Live and breed  the Masses; or whether the control is exercised by ""others"" characterized by the Instinct to Make  the Skilled Artizan; or whether the control is exercised by ""others"" urged by the Instinct of Mastery  the Employers; or whether the control is exercised by ""others"" under their dominating Acquisitive Instinct  the Financiers. 

&gt; Indeed, the concept: control by ""others,"" is an idea inherent in and appropriate only to now discredited Autocracy  a concept which the War has rendered an obsolete ideal  if we are yet intelligent enough to profit by its costly teaching. To be rationally consistent this ""control"" concept should be as absent as it is obsolete (in fact and effect) in our inevitable [technocratic] reconstruction. 

Prior to this passage, Smyth had been reflecting on the United States' participation World War I and pointed out the obvious and absurd failings of Capitalism under war-time stress, leading to this passage about the undesirability of hefting the yoke of coercive control upon oneself, from any other party at all. I begin with this citation because it's an explicit denunciation of authority, including the authority of the Masses. 

This is a key concept that runs throughout the formative technocratic works, and stands in direct opposition to the absolutely fallacious argumentation by technocracy detractors that it's an aristocratic, authoritarian, or most absurdly, a potentially totalitarian sociopolitical philosophy. This passage and those preceding it are also important in establishing that technocracy is *explicitly* a **post-capitalist** (and, as the concept is developed, post-scarcity) socio-econo-political ideology. This further refutes the common fallacy of believing that merely having scientists and engineers (or ""highly skilled"" in whatever other discipline, e.g. Finance) inhabiting political office constitutes a de facto technocracy, e.g. China's PRC Politburo being comprised of mostly degreed engineers.

Smyth continues in Part II:

&gt; It would seem that with the advent of Experimental Science occurred an epoch in the history of our Race; an epochal event to which none other is comparable, except possibly the acquisition of Self-consciousness itself. Indeed it would seem that these two super-significant events  so unthinkably far apart in time  are, in essence, closely related. 

&gt; By coming to Self-consciousness the Brute became Man  potentially, though not actually, a self-determining being. By the coming of Science  based upon the idea of the rationality and neutrality of ""nature""  potential Freedom ceased to be a mere possibility and became a realizable Ideal: *To Make or Break Shackles.* Science and Technology are, however, but tools in Man's hands; tools wherewith to make effective Man's transcendent privilege: **Freedom of Choice.** 

&gt; Groups of men (like Germany) may use these great instrumentalities to forge social shackles upon themselves, and upon Humanity the bondage of autocracy. Or, they may use them to make human Liberty effective, as is the ideal of the United States. Human beings, whether as individuals, or as groups, or as nations, are ""free""  self-determining  only when 
purposively initiative; for it is only in purposive action that liberty can be expressed. Freedom, then, means will to intelligent self-expression  liberty expressed in rational accomplishment. [Technocratic] ""Reconstruction.""

Here, Smyth is laying the conceptual foundation for a rationalist/scientific social structure, contrasting the ideals of Liberty (patriotically embodied in the ostensible ideals of the Unites States), with the autocratic/authoritarian regimes of Old Europe, and then positing a scientific reconstruction of what was described in Part I as a broken Liberty under Capitalism; a reclamation and extension of true, unfettered Liberty through rational/scientific self-determination.

He culminates these ideas in Part III:

&gt; The Scientist is essentially a pioneer, a pathfinder, a torch bearer, a seeker after Truth and Rationality. The Scientist is the modern religionist, the priest of selfless Truth: Truth which grows with Man's growth and luminously emerges with the purifying of human Intelligence: Truth  that all-inclusive Something behind the physical facts of nature which makes for Right  for mechanical, for personal, for ethical, for spiritual, for social righteousness  the ultimate Unifying Ideal. Truly, ""the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner"": the keystone of the social arch: Rational Leadership. The Scientist is, seemingly, our one best, if not our only hope for Rational Leadership.",73,58

They would be solar powered and the air intakes for their propulsion would be equipped with CO2 scrubbers. 

The scrubbers would only remove marginal amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but the airships would replace semi trucks which means less pollutants being pumped into the atmosphere and highway infrastructure would last longer because of greatly reduced traffic.  The only real cost to consumers would be that it would take slightly longer to get a package.

The scrubber filters could then be mined for the carbon they captured and the carbon could be used as raw material for manufacturing.  

I'm open to comments and suggestions on how to improve this idea.  The only reason I can see it failing is a lack of venture capital to start it up.

Note: I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit to submit this post to, but you guys are pretty good at looking at the long and short term ramifications of concepts and I felt you were the best equipped look at the idea.

""Our interconnectedness is the dominating truth of the 21st century."" Jeffrey D. Sachs

Just as machinery made the slavery system of human control obsolete, technology is making the financial system obsolete. The debt based financial system is the modern operating system controlling how people relate to each other and how resources are allocated among society. Without financial assets, people are treated like slaves in the current financially based culture. Government bailing out those holding control in the financial system, without bailing out the rest of its citizens, engineered the biggest inequality of wealth in human history. This injustice was perpetrated by imposing fraudulent public obligations and debts on society to support the private wealth of a few. Those backing this immoral action are direct participants in a rigged game that's financially bankrupting our future and biologically destroying our environment . Unless society evolves beyond the current narrative, inequality, fear, and anger will only increase for everyone around the world.",8,11

I'm hoping/betting it's not the majority. 

**Subsidizing human labor:** Pay employers more when they pay humans to do a job that can be done faster, better, and more reliably by a machine.

**Subsidizing what was once volunteer work:**
Pay people to recycle, build houses in Africa, edit wikipedia, etc. 

**Pay people more (or tax them less), the less they breed:**
The potential problem with basic income is how much people are consuming without producing. If you incentivize a decrease in consumers, it could become much less of a problem. 

**More employees doing the same job in shifts, less hours for each:**
A simple *maximum hours* law for select occupations would require employers to spread out whatever non-robot jobs they have among more human workers. Increasing minimum wage would make these short jobs worthwhile for employees. 

**Pay people to vote:**
Politicians essentially get payed to vote on bills for their constituents, don't they? In a direct democracy, it would follow that private citizens would be payed for participating in legislation processes themselves. 

**Pay people to give up their privacy:**
You could sell your life feed to be used for any number of things; sociological research, reality show type entertainment, or at the very least assure that you'll never get away with (or be falsely convicted of) any crimes. 

Any more you can think of?

Edit:

**Communism/socialism/RBE:** Not sure how I forgot this one. Who says we need money at all?

Edit2: 

**Maximum wage and/or maximum net worth laws:** Basically just wealth redistribution. ",89,42

A 4 min clip from the show as well as a piece we did about Skylar Tibbits and 4D printing linked inside.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/27bjyl/hello_again_futurology_my_buddy_and_i_are_trying/,rolleverything,1401912875,"[Clip from Episode](http://youtu.be/wBIRNjh6F5o)

[Skylar Tibbits - 4D Printing](http://youtu.be/a1J7aMJkfcI)


I wanted to mention, we spent no money on this and a lot of people donated thier time to help us with this episode. We both work in local TV news (that's how we've got a set) and are trying to build something we both love. We big fans of tech and science. We believe this show has a lot of potential and our goal is to get it on the air nationwide.  That being said, this show is currently not on the air and there's no guarantee it will be. We have a long way to go. The episode isn't perfect, but we hope you guys enjoy it and will see the potential in it. I think you'll be able to share our show with friends and family who may not be as familiar with the type of topics we see on r/futurology as most of you are. u/nootchmyer is the host. I'm behind the scenes directing/producing. ALL your feedback is very important to us. Thanks guys! ",10,17

As many know technology has the capacity of making a lot of things obsolete, but what about the human genome ?
Can the process of natural selection that has been dominating through the time of evolution on planet earth, actually become obsolete?
Given the fact that technology and genetic engineering have the capacity of modifying the genome, so that we can give living organisms any genotype and phenotype we wish to give them.
Meaning that if its wished to mass produce 10000 white humans and 10000 black humans, it can be possible with genetic engineering and massive ""Human printing/Cloning"".

Technically this process of mass ""Human Printing/Cloning"" would render sexual reproduction obsolete, therefore natural selection would be determined with advanced technology and genetic engineering.
In that scenario its reasonable to sterilize the organisms, so that they cannot reproduce given the fact that this process would happen through advanced industrial means.(Its really a choice)
By doing this, the population amount can be controlled entirely through advanced manufacturing and opposed to sexual reproduction.
This could provide a better and much more efficient way to control population, so their needs can be met efficiently and sustainably.
[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tbxN5uwaqA]Human Cloning - YouTube[/url]

There could be many Taboos for many individuals, but the Genetic Manipulation and Cloning with organisms (specifically humans) are most relevant cause it creates a ""conflict"" with the concept of life and dead in some peoples brains, which spawned state laws.
[video=youtube;evQsOFQju08]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evQsOFQju08[/video]

So in a sense for those state laws, if you take the risk of cloning a human and it fails ""you could be judged for murder, personal injuries,etc""
Also for religions that have a problem with the concept of cloning, (its almost like you try to compete with their god by trying to genetically modify what the ""all knowing all powerful"" created)
[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPOfurmrjxo]George Carlin on Religion and God - YouTube[/url]

Cloning may serve a purpose of experimenting with the genetic composition of different organisms which for example could create cures for genetic diseases in living organisms (specifically humans), as well as many other ""good or bad uses"", for humanity and sustainability on this great habitat life evolved in.
[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faRlFsYmkeY]The Simpsons - Homer Evolution - YouTube[/url]

And in a sense Cloning and Genetic Engineering  could render Sexual Reproduction Obsolete, cause technically living organisms could be created,modified and even mass produced in a lab (as opposed to sexual reproduction), possibly making it obsolete.
But theres a type of individuals that are opposed to cloning and/or human cloning which somehow expect that randomly (their god/s) spawn organisms with diseases/mutations and just do not feel guilty for those lives as opposed to a scientist cloning organisms (specifically humans), so then science can give them cures and great experience.

432,2014-6-6,2014,6,6,13,27fzkr,My confusion over a UBI world,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/27fzkr/my_confusion_over_a_ubi_world/,[deleted],1402027488,"I'm new to this subreddit and have been just reading the comments on various articles.  I've never heard of UBI (Universal Basic Income) until I came upon this subreddit and know very little about it.  My confusion on UBI stems from the fact that it's presented as a solution to a world of high unemployment from automation but the arguments for and against talk about a world that we're living in right now.  I remember seeing an article that stated up to 80-90% of jobs can be automated in the coming decades.  Even if we use a lower number of 50% unemployment due to automation, that is still a significant portion of the population out of a job.  New jobs will surely be created but the question is will it be enough to cover everyone who lost a job.  Most of the arguments for and against UBI seem to talk about the lowest skilled employees but, even people who did the right thing of going to college and getting a job that provides for them and their families will be affected. 

 UBI sounds nice but I feel it's being spoken of as a perfect solution by many without addressing how society is suppose to function after it's implemented.  If we are going into a future where there will not be enough jobs to replace everyone who lost one, how will a UBI that basically only covers rent and food create the utopia that supporters talk about. (This is based on the UBI of $12,000 that I've seen listed in many comments.) If UBI is supposed to replace all welfare programs then what will people do when they get a serious illness but can't afford the bills since they haven't been able to find a new job to supplement their income.  If someone wants to go back to college to update their skills how are they suppose to pay the tuition.  People are having a hard time paying back school loans now and this situation will only be worse in the future.  UBI will keep people from being homeless and hungry (which is incredibly significant) but it will still leave a huge portion of our society living month to month and without the means to improve themselves along with the fear that any unexpected cost will leave them barely surviving.  Also if people are only surviving that is not a meaningful life. You need the ability to have some non essentials, even if it's just going to watch a movie, or going out to eat occasionally. 

The arguments against seems to focus more on the unfairness of some choosing to not to work.  But this implies that all these people could work but choose not to out of laziness.  While there will definitely be people who do choose this, I firmly believe that most will want to be productive even if it's not what we traditionally consider to be work.  If we want a society that has everyone working then automation would need to be halted.  Since this is not a realistic option, we need to accept that many of our jobs will be replaced with automation, most people will lose their jobs, and that the new jobs created may not be enough to cover everyone who needs one.  So many of us will need to change our mindset on what we consider fair and not fair.  I know it sounds like I'm saying the UBI discussed is just not high enough but I that's not the case.  The argument questioning how we are to pay for UBI is a valid one and one I don't think has been sufficiently addressed.  Having a large portion of society unable to provide for themselves will be a huge strain on the government and shouldn't be dismissed lightly.

I have to admit the upcoming decades scare me.  I remember when outsourcing news was at its height in the media.  There was so many stories about people being caught off guard when they lost their jobs and the panic it created in these people who suddenly found themselves having to find a new job when they thought they were in a secure field.  This will happen all over again but on a much larger scale.  I know that eventually everything will work out but this transition is going to leave a lot of people in incredibly difficult positions in the mean time.  I hope people who are more familiar about this automated future and/or UBI can explain where my fears and confusion are wrong.  Also does anyone know if there are any other solutions being discussed besides UBI in regards to this upcoming problem?

All you educated hard science gals and guys I'd really like to hear your opinion on the feasibility of this.

You may or may not know, plants evolved wood before anything existed to break down this wood. It took many millions of years before a fungus evolved to decompose wood. see here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbw9GJKG32I (start at 27.53)

In this case there was a material in the environment which was outside of the closed loop of nature's cycle. BUT! to quote Dr. Ian Malcolm ""Life finds a way."" This same scenario exists today.... with Plastic. 

In the distant future, our species along with most mega flora and fauna will be dead and gone due to our destabilization of the biosphere (WOOPS!), some plants and plenty bacteria will still exist to restart the whole process of creating ever complex forms. What will also exist? A relic from an ancient time. Resilient, sturdy, multicolored, silent... waiting...... PLASTIC!! An extremely abundant resource that has worked its way to every corner of the globe.
One day an ambitious little fungi ,who's tired of being bullied by all the other fungi who do cool important shit like absorb radiation, decides to take on this ""plas-tack"" That'll show those fuckers. So he tries.... but he sucks. and keeps sucking for a looooonng time. But this little guy ain't gonna give up like a bitch. He's gotta win, he's gotta show everyone that he's cool and strong. Hundreds of Millions of years go by..... then one fine day, a Tuesday to be exact, he figures it out. He's changed himself, grown, tried new things... and it worked. He begins to furiously devour the plastic, multiplying and being the boss he always knew he was. In his quest he's changed. The plastic is now part of him and he of it. He and his offspring feel like major badasses now so they decide to get organized and take on the world. Things go well. Many more millions of years pass. They never stopped along the way, never settled for less. Bug form? Psh. Small fish like form? Eh kinda cool, Small four legged land walker form? Pretty sweet I guess. Resilient, sturdy, multicolored, bipedal, big brain havin', tool makin', Plastic sonofabitch? ..... fuck yeah.  

So that's my story of how plastic killed all the humans and everything, teamed up with an underdog, and came to rule the world. THE END

But I was thinking over some themes in the matrix, and something more or less hit me. A full virtual reality life is not actually bad in any way aside from the plot involving evil machines that is used to justify calling it ""bad"" and ""unreal."" If this technology actually existed, this would be the far preferable life to live than living in the real world, assuming it was both possible and viable, and once it reached the point where it was indistinguishable from the real world. 

(If you want to be technical, you have no reason to think the ""real"" world is real anyways in any meaningful sense.)

You could do anything you want, and not worry about environmental concerns. Tons of current problems would simply not exist in any form. The idea of crippling diseases that inhibit your ability to function simply would not exist except for mental ones that damage your real-world brain. Battles over resources would not exist. Accidental deaths would not exist. People wouldn't have to worry about standing out with transgenderism, since they could go request a new avatar, and be immediately given one that is the exact same as their chosen sex. Even ideological struggles over things like abortion would be fully gone forever. Due to this, crime involving things like theft would have no reason to exist, even more than in a regular post-scarcity world. Morality would then thus perhaps be relegated to little other than how you treat people inter-personally.

Obviously giving individuals unlimited control to shape the world would perhaps lead to mass chaos. And so some types of physical rules would have to exist in order to maintain order, or perhaps to keep people from getting ""bored"" with the fact that they can do anything instantly.

Obviously there has to be some kind of hidden downsides, aside from the obvious fact that for all we know this would not actually be possible, end even if it was its so far off that its not worth thinking about. (Or that by the time it is possible, most of what would be a concern in the real world no longer is anyways.) but it does seem like that minus people's inhibitions over the idea, it would be by far preferable to a life outside. The only obvious negative seems to be that it might be TOO good. Either that, or that maybe people would suspect that the natural beauty they see in ""the wild"" is not real. But even that can be gotten around, by having it be mapped to be a perfect 1:1 scale representation of the real world, so that it is ""real."" To people who are born always living in the system it would not seem odd most likely for that to be what ""being in nature"" is to them. Only the first adopters would lament over it.",63,33

The cheapest way is to make large flat and very smooth sheets, and even this is still expensive and requires a huge amount of energy.

First you have to 'float' the glass over molten metal to achieve the gloss finish.

Secondly you have to cut those sheets into whatever size you need(straight lines and square angles are quickest, cheapest and produce less waste)

Thirdly you have to polish the sharp edges otherwise the glass will explode in the toughening plant

Fourthly you toughen the glass by [a]heating it in a huge(and very expensive) oven, then [b] cooling it gradually. This process hardens the outside of the glass, similar to the crust on a flapjack/brownie, but not the inside. This is why safety glass explodes into tiny pieces. 

got that?

Excellent, so now that the glass has been toughened, you have a very limited ability to polish(AKA:grind down) the glass before the integrity is lost and the glass explodes. 

The process to make uniform patterned panels is massively more expensive. You then still need to toughen the glass and then you can do other expensive processes to make the glass stronger. 

After all this, a busy and dusty road would cause the glass to wear down and lose its integrity and shatter within minutes. With each exploded panel the problem will be compounded and the road would turn to very expensive and very toxic gravel within seconds.",13,0

The concept of the design is to allow a single watchman to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) inmates of an institution without them being able to tell whether they are being watched or not.

Although it is physically impossible for the single watchman to observe all cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that all inmates must act as though they are watched at all times, effectively controlling their own behaviour constantly.

Okay, so SRS is basically the procedure is which one *rearranges* their *outer* genitals to match their *inner* gender.

Things such as **growing organs** and the rising cability to **alter ones genes** could seriously come into play here. 

**growing organs**
We've heard of 3D printing **hearts** and **livers**, or lab grown **ears and noses**. What about printing **vaginas** or **uteruses**? Could we print vaginal tissue that can be used in creating depth and nerve sensitivity, we could print glands that produce lubrication, a clitoris or just come extra *material* to shape the outer vagina, or what about printing a uterus and ovaries that can be implanted into women (both transgender and natal) who are without them?

**gene alteration**

We see see companies sprouting up offering gene analysis and the future *customization* of your baby and their *looks*. Could we eventually alter *adult* genome to replace the Y of XY to create a gentic female, or the X or XX to a Y to create a genetic male?

Our latest commissioned project, bittorrent.ai aims to accelerate this process by recreating the human learning algorithm and empowering unsupervised machine learning via a decentralized, many-layered, fault-tolerant deep learning net.

Though we cannot disclose any further information at this time, we would like your input on which vectors of analysis (sentiment, cultural relevance, genre, viral potential...) and applications (curation, surveillance, research) you believe should be prioritized and featured in the beta release.

How do you think travel will be handled if the snowball of super tech keeps on?",8,5

Because of this, I want to have a follow-up discussion on the future of Energy in general.

Although the replacement of Oil, Coal and Natural Gas has been dreamed of for many years, we are now closer than ever before to replacing it completely. The price of Solar Panels has fallen dramatically since the late 1970s, wind farms are springing up around the world, the next generations of nuclear power plants are being drawn up by researchers, ITER and India are pursuing bold new Nuclear technologies (ITER with the first practical Nuclear Fusion plant, and India with the first practical Thorium Nuclear plant), and many more interesting ideas for power generation are coming up (tidal turbines, earth-orbit solar panels, flying wind turbines, and even ways to generate electricity using the heat and energy that comes from beneath Earth's crust).

My personal belief is that the future of energy will involve a mix of all these in use to generate electricity for a post-oil world. But everyone has their own opinions and beliefs, so I want to know what yours is on this. 

Do you think one source of power will come to satisfy all our energy needs? Or do you think there is another source of power that will trump all the above suggestions?",6,15

You are not in control of the vehicle, so this could easily remove any possiblity of a car chase. The computer is alerted to a police presence, and pulls over. In a society of all self driving cars, could somebody be arrested when they ask for a self driving car? It takes them to the police station, instead of to the destination. Should that be a possibility? At some point, when self driving cars become popular enough, should we remove normal cars from the road? The danger present in a human driving is very high, and there isn't any real reason to put people in danger like that with a better alternative.

This is similar I suppose, to how horses and people were removed from our roads for ""Horseless Carriages."" Also, could we call them pods? Self driving cars is kind of long winded. I was just wondering how different law enforcement will be when most citizens are not in control of the vehicle. You could have the vehicle become the suspects police car. ",16,1

The LoAR essentially means that technological progress is accelerating over time, and the rate at which we advance is getting faster. This was supposedly put forward by Ray Kurzweil, although I'm not sure because I've never read any of Kurzweil's books.

But to be honest, it just sounds kind of empty. I'm no scientist but I'm pretty sure LoAR isn't an actual scientific theory or anything. And while progress does accelerate from time to time, it only does so up to a certain point. Technologies follow S-curves; they flatten out over time and we actually start getting diminishing returns. 

Many futurist predictions, such as the Singularity, depend on the continuing acceleration of computing power. It is the advances in computing technology that will help us make advances in biotechnology, neuroscience, and A.I. But what if computer technology stagnates? 

To be honest, I find that to be a scary thought. I'm agnostic about the Singularity but I definitely want technology to continue improving at a rapid pace! I want to see medical technology improve and we beat cancer, HIV, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, congenital defects, genetic diseases, and perhaps even go a long way towards mitigating the worst effects of biological aging. I want involuntary paralysis, blindness, and deafness to be things of the past. I want to see cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy and methods of manufacturing. I want to see a world of abundance where every last man, woman, and child is provided for, and robots do all the dirty grunt work while we kick back. I want biotechnology to progress to the point where living adults can modify their genetics, their bodily morphology, anatomy, and overall cosmetic appearance, to look however they want, including changing sexes (this is of particular interest to me, as I am transgender). I want to see full-immersion virtual reality like in The Matrix, minus the whole ""machines enslave humanity"" thing. And I want to see all of this within my lifetime, and enjoy some of it personally.

But its possible, even likely, that I was simply born too early (I am 30, exactly). I follow the latest scientific advancements and lurk in /r/futurology and other futurist communities, and am excited by the tantalizing possibilities. But maybe I'm just being teased. ",11,7

In ten years a whole generation of teenagers will eschew food made from traditional agriculture for nutrient foods such as Soylent, which include all the vitamins, minerals, proteins, calories, and other nutrients in a drink, or perhaps even solid food such as snack bars, that the human body needs. Why? Because it is more time and cost effective than food from traditional agriculture. Why will it be more time and cost effective? Because food from traditional agriculture requires orders of magnitude more time and resources to produce, while food like will likely be completely automated and independent from traditional agriculture. Additionally, Soylent will take less time to prepare in the home, than food from traditional agriculture.

Given that there are many research labs as well as biotech companies making advances that could potentially lead to life extension technologies in the future, say 40-50 years from now, what can the common man do right now to best position themselves for these technologies.

It is no brainer, that the rich will benefit from potential technologies. But what about the average person? Will the middle-class be able to afford these technologies? How much is enough? Will a salary of 60k/yr with most of that going into stable investments be enough? How about 100k/yr? 150k/yr? Or will this technology be available only to people who make millions/yr?

These are hard questions to answer. But I feel these are probably the most important questions to answer for our generation.

If I need 10s of millions to get in on potential advances, then I might as well accept the inevitable and just relax/enjoy life. If 100k/yr or 150k/yr is enough, then I should be working my ass off right for a job that pays that much. Or if millions are required, then I need to play a more riskier game and try to create a tech-start up.

For the sake of this question, let's say the limit for this method is two hours, after which the lowered metabolic rates would still lead to cell death from oxygen deprivation. My question is two-fold:

* What stops this procedure from being repeated indefinitely? Could you cool the body with the brine, then reintroduce heat and oxygen after two hours, followed by another oxygen deprived cooling cycle?

* Why can't you rapidly cool the blood without introducing a foreign solution? You would probably still need access to a major artery for the cooling bypass.

Is aging relative to metabolic rate? Could this cycle make a ""breath"" last 2 hours instead of 5 seconds?",0,8

Every day all I see is a circular reasoning of confirmation bias which all feeds into one thing, the complete and utter denial that death is inevitable. 

Every single person reading this and every single one who doesn't will die. It is a statistical impossibility to live forever. If we do manage to somehow circumvent the problems with the human body or we discover a way to transfer ourselves to a machine while not killing ourselves in the process we will still die. There will NEVER be a perfect solution.

I have seen the term 'deathist' pop up. It's used as if people who say death is inevitable are just blind to technology or are just trying to rain on the parade. 

I think this sub-reddit needs a serious dose of reality. I see A LOT of confirmation bias and group think. Death cannot and will not be solved and I think understanding that not everything can be solved is important, though we should still strive to improve our lives and understand our world. The only way we're going to 'solve' death is by accepting it. 

I don't expect this to change anyone's mind but it needs to be said. If you are living in fear of death to the point you have convinced yourself that you will not die, you need to get help. 

I expect a lot of angry comments and downvotes but I don't care, you need to have your bubble popped. Quit lying to people and deluding yourselves. 

EDIT: I realize not everyone believes this but it is enough of a problem that it pops up in every single topic remotely related to human life-spans and a lot of topics about medicine. ",16,0

Read the youtube comments. People with this mindset think they are right, but in actuality they are hindering the progression and advancement of humanity. I am not a fan of mass surveillance and spying, however insinuating that metadata will be used to Play God and control the human race into accepting a satanic new world order is a bit out of my scope of reason. Hopefully the human race can collectively evolve past this type of thinking. If we don't it could seriously hold us back longterm. (Parents teaching their kids the same fallacies, etc...) ",5,0

Google seems to have its fingers in almost all of these pies, except for virtual reality, and its not suprising that we find Facebook there (as well as waging a space race with Google regarding connecting the world with baloon/satellite internet), as the social giant becomes less and less influential in the area where it started out- the social page called Facebook.
Some people hail 3D printing aso ne of the promising Technologies of future, but I dont see it having much impact on society as a whole. Lets be honest, its doubtful that common folk will make things with these printers en masse.  	Because its the same issue as with printing text. Nobody prints photo-books or regular books at home, because youll find better experts and better tech somewhere else. While this could perhaps eliminate some weight put on supply chains, it wont fundamentally change how people see the world around them.
Virtual reality, though, will. Its easy to dismiss it because of its bulky and unglamorous design, but the thing is- unlike Google Glass you are supposed to wear it at home, in privacy or with close friends around. Also, you arent supposed to film or take pictures with it. The problems with augmented reality today are that first, tech is still not there yet. Second, people are still concerned a lot about the elitist image it evokes and privacy issues. Few years ago very small percentage of people would have bet on VR making it big before AR, but now it seems that will be the case. VR is essentially ready for prime-time, AR still needs a few more years.
And virtual reality will indeed change things. Sports events with 360 degree cameras, architects can use it, designers can use it to create things in 3D space, new kinds of experience media, meditative and explorational, scary and thrilling. True 3D, everything according to true scale, sense of presence... 
For me, virtual reality is the closest of the future technologies ready for prime-time we have now. And I suppose when Oculus comes out with a consumer device after 6 months or more, well find out. But its interesting how virtual reality could change many things around us and influence other technology developments.
Take for example driverless cars. You think that our current staring at phones is a problem? What happens when people demand to be hooked to VR devices even when in their cars? Would they rather sit in a traffic jam or race on some track in VR? They will drive demand for driverless future. Driverless, on its own, will drive demand for electric battery future, as LIDARs and software and insurance will cost a lot at the beginning and theyll want to save on fuel as much as possible, plus all that greenhouse effect and global warming thing. Solar panel prices will continue to drop. Cheap driverless tech also enables other things, like all kinds of retail, including groceries, going delivery way... robots at werehouses will pack em bag em and deliver em more efficiently, cheaper and without queues. 
Also, another consequence of VR is blurring lines between bots and humans. Already now most of the traffic on internet is generated by bots, we already have tons of Michelles and Johns telling us how their sisters earn money clicking on links and posting comments like this was a good article, recommended. Imagine what happens when were all virtual in a new world, walking around with our purses of virtual money all the time, to spend them on movies, games and other VR experiences. Perhaps we would like to invite a lady friend from online to do that kind of thing, but how do we know if were dealing with a bot or a fat guy? And chat-bots will become more and more sophisticated with parallel processing abilities etc. 
Then again, I dont believe the common idea that we will run out of people who would be able to buy certain products due to technology unemployment. We should also take into account that money revolution could happen, be it Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple or Bitcoin that brings us there. Perhaps crypto-currencies will never be truly everyday mainstream thing, but they will at least exist like Linux to 90s Windows. Theyll still be there and theyll be loud. And their anti-regulation and transformative nature means that for the first time in history, so called DACs (decentralized autonomous corporations) might arrive, or at least their early prototypes. The issue is- if you use a bank, you cant get an account if youre a piece of software. With cryptos, its not a problem, which means that for whatever reason completely autonomous programs might be unleashed on the web either to scam or sell stuff to you (perhaps even legitimate and good online service), which will on their own invest in crypto-enabled kickstarters and IPOs. After all, Bitcoin mining is a pretty large industry and essentially if youre mining bitcoin youre not working for anybody but yourself. Like in the old times, somebody sells you a shovel (miner) and then youre the entrepreneur. And you can make quite a nice money on that, if you play your cards right. Just 7 years ago such an occupation as bitcoin miner didnt even exist and its not even an occupation because its the machine that mines, not you. Youre just essentially a slave owner, providing accomodation and food for the machine, and reap the benefits of its work. You cant through your work make the specific piece of metal mine faster than it can, you cant influence the result. The future for human employment therefore will be to be slave owners of the machines that, due to privacy issues and sharing economy, will be a tiny part of largely decentralized economy. People laugh at sharing economy sometimes perhaps thinking about housewives baking cakes at home or hipsters making t-shirts with moustaches on them, but youll make money from selling cheap energy you make using your solar cells, mining and trading crypto-currencies and ensuring the network is up and running, VR will enable the uber-golden age of video games, which will again need real human characters as space fleet leaders or kings and dukes of five kingdoms. You can already make money playing games if youre really good, but VR should increase the amount devoted to virtual even more. 
Privacy will continue to be a big issue in future and, in my view, it will lead to great decentralization and destruction of trusted third parties of everything, due to solutions provided and still developed in crypto currency scene. Therefore, as I explained, sharing economy will not be only cakes, handicrafts and quirky T-shirts, but a wide range of services and each member of society will be able to reap the fairly distributed profit and benefits. Driverless will greatly increase mobility and mobility as such might increase as world becomes a smaller place, higher developed economies stagnate, lower developed economies are catching up and improving infrastructure. We might see great many people of developed countries at pension age or forever on benefits flee to lesser developed countries to cut living costs and keep high standard of living, still collecting their cheques. This is partially already happening in European Union. 
I believe augmented reality will finally get big after 2020, as we will have sorted out internet of things deal and Googles driverless and Tango projects will have matured. Then therell also be a lot more sense of having augmented reality as everything around us will talk to us. People would have already experienced VR and interactivity there, privacy will still be very important, but will shift away from cameras everywhere because, well, theyll have learned to live with them due to driverless starting to squeeze in and facial recognition software etc. 
In short, turbulent times ahead. But Im looking forward.

It can carry 6 passengers instead of 3 and it costs only around 50-60% more. rates are at [2].

Looking at the data in[1] as an example, on average this will be around 65% over the $2 cost of public transportation(assuming you fill the suv) mentioned in the article.

This is an extremely low cost for a taxi service. And combined with enough passenger data and smart algorithms , i think this service can build customized routes that would be as almost as efficient as private transportation - especially if cities have road preference for public transport. 

In short , i think this will replace a lot of personal transportation(at least until self driving cars are here), assuming people would be willing to ride in groups of 6, because it can offer much better experience than driving, esp in heavy traffic. 

What do you think, would people be willing to do that ? how should that experience be created ? And what do you think about the general concept ?  And what do you think about it's effects on jobs , regulation and politics ?

A Smartphone can be a Smart phone.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/28020n/webification_of_communication_a_smartphone_can_be/,SmarterComms,1402610721,"Given so many advancements across the technology gamut, why is it we still operate with the 19th century practices of Bell and Watson when it comes to communication. A telephony experience hasnt really changed in 100 years (yes the underlying technology has changed, but minimal evolution of the user experience)
Its time for the webification of communication. What do I mean by that? I mean the adoption of WebRTC, a new browser based communication framework enabling people to communicate and collaborate from the browsers of their PC/MAC or Smartphone platforms (apps)  finally the Smartphone can be a Smart phone. No need for SW downloads on computers, simply navigate via a modern browser on your desktop/notebook compute device. (Today only Chrome, Firefox and Opera however Apple and Microsoft exploring.) I mean people calling and communicating with people/organisations through their web browsers, perhaps connecting based on their social media profiles (FB, LI, etc), not necessarily with a 10 digit number. Why do we need to know the 10 digit number of our friend to call our friend  that notion is &gt;100 years old. I mean voice communication, instantly switchable into video communication if desired (we dont always wish to be seen), or inline file sharing to augment the discussion or real-time image annotation to explain some concept/topic, all within the single communication/collaboration application  no more hanging-up after talking with a friend to then IM or email extra content/directions to the same friend. Why do we need separate applications for this?
Why when calling so many global companies (Healthcare, Airlines, Broadband +++) do we need to deal with machines emulating humans with voice recognition platforms - we suffer the terrible voice recognition service trying to route the call to the correct human, mistaking our accents, needing repetitive behavior and causing total customer frustration across several steps of error. We might reach an operator and sometimes repeat all again with occasional preservation of prior context. Instead let's allow humans to be humans and machines to be machines. A caller can speak to a human, but why speak to an emulated human - how about being able to navigate the automatic call system via a mapped graphical user interface on the phone (available upon connection), bypassing the verbal carnage and bypassing all those serial iterative steps - let the phone call flow like a menu on a web page (webification of communication) selectable by the user instantly to the link of interest. Allow enterprises to service their customers without the pain of miserable voice recognition routing systems. Allow users to connect with end profiles/people rather than dial specific numbers. And once connected, instantly share whatever is needed (live video/image, files, annotated docs/pictures etc) to collaborate to closure.
Friends can talk with friends/family/network  no more need to stay current on a 100+ phone numbers within the phonebook. Enterprises who value their customers sanity, will stop forcing such precious customers to suffer with the same old communication experience. Its time for change. Finally the SmartPhone can be a Smart phone and the webification of communication can enable a more complete collaboration experience. That doesnt mean the plain old telephony system (POTS) is going away, it has its value and purpose. It means we evolve the communication experience according to the technology available to us and expand on the original ideas of Watson and Bell.",0,0

He is a billionaire and a smart business person. If he really stands behind this idea lets see if he will talk Google into doing the same with their patents. He is a huge shareholder and friend of those boys.The ONLY reason I think Mr. Musk is doing this is because he wants to sell batteries from his new 1 billion dollar battery factory. Does he not realize with current battery technology, there is a HUGE amount of waste that is created from manufacturing and then disposing of these batteries!? Of course he does. Hydrogen power is much cleaner! Musk knows this and he is desperate to sell electric technology so he can still get some sales from his battery factory. Toyota, Honda, Kia, BMW, Audi all have Hydrogen powered cars coming out within the next year. It is a much cleaner tech. The only batteries that seem like they might really be a true ""green"" alternative to the combustion engine are the new Dual Carbon batteries that are being developed in Japan. If the future of cars is to truly be ""green"" then we need a technology that does not create as much damage to the environment as the current battery technology.",7,0

Perhaps we can flesh it out here?

After the industrial revolution came the digital revolution, which gave birth to the information age. Here we stand at the brink of the next great leap forward in humanity with no clear plan and no obvious road in front of us. The decision whether we are a species of **information sharers** or **information hoarders** is our next big step. Is it more important to share what we know or covet what we know? Capitalist markets, for example, run on the later, but with [Tesla's announcement](http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you) today, I wonder how much longer will that last.

We paradoxically share information (seemingly without limit) on the internet yet cry out for privacy rights. We want shiny technology but decry corporations that try to control their product's R&amp;D, design, and manufacturing strategies*. So I wonder, good people of the Reddit hivemind, is information the thing that is holding us back? Or even the lack of information? The suppression of information? Or do we simply not have enough information on this topic to even come to a conclusion?

Many people in this subreddit are predicting some sort of world-wide omnipotent police state, or some sort of global democracy. I have a bit of a different idea.

I think that, throughout history, our cultures have tended toward more freedom, by which I mean less government and more personal liberty/property. There are peaks and valleys, of course, but what started as large empires obedient to a king then gave way to limited monarchies, which gave way to liberalism and democracy. Even within those political setups, there have been trends toward more freedom. America, for instance, started out as ""free for white males of voting age"", and now recognizes rights for all peoples, regardless of race, sex, etc. 

That's not to say all is honky-dory, because even though people are more open to, say, the rights of a homosexual to marry and raise children, that doesn't mean that these rights are being added cumulatively. Many of our rights are also being stripped, which is why I'll stress that we *tend* toward more freedom.

I think that, in the future, this trend will continue and eventually we'll have a stateless society based on free-market practices. 

I will break this down into several different parts explaining how I think certain aspects would work. 

**Markets**

Markets that are free are efficient, and governments are slow. If there is a market demand for a product, even in a highly-regulated and burdened economy that we have now, the market finds a way to deliver. 

Take the Uber app. Taxis are notoriously expensive, depending on where you live. Along comes the smartphone, and suddenly the highly-regulated industry is obsolete. Cab companies, which are incapable of competing with this new service thanks to their set prices, are being threatened. 

One might say that the cab companies would be wise to lower their fares, however tons of legislation that exists has made that very difficult. For example, in my city, and in many others, cabs are price-fixed. How can a cab driver charge less, even if they wanted to? 

**Police**

Now, what would happen if we were to replace other government institutions, say, the *police*, with privately run competitive businesses?

You could have your pick of the litter. You could choose which police service to use based on various selling points, for example, cost (obviously), response time, and reputation. We're already seeing interesting private police forces pop up in some areas, for example, in [Detroit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqlVL26jrCA).

One might say that the above linked case providing services for free might just be a one-off scenario, and might find it hard to believe that services could be provided for free in some areas if all police services were provided by competing firms. After all, a profit motive exists. 

I think that many would be provided basic-level security services for free or for cheap so as to maximize the reputation of the companies brand. Also, others might charge post-facto, so for instance, if you're being robbed, you can alert them and they could charge you after the fact, instead of before. These different solutions could also exist in the same market, as different companies provide different services under different business models. 

**Roads**

One of the most ***concrete*** (zing) examples of government handiwork is the highway and road system. If these systems were taken over by competing highway systems, how might it look?

Right now, there's almost always more than one way to get from point A to point B. You can hit the highway, avoid the thruway, go on the backstreets, etc. If all these roads acted as different companies, they could be funded through a variety of means that allows the consumer more choice. 

Some highways could be toll highways. Others could be monetized by advertising. Still others could have free-lanes, and then ""express lanes"" that require a club membership (and a super-fast car). There are as many different ways to run the business as there would be businesses. 

That may make sense for highways and thruways, but one might wonder about local roads and streets.

Imagine if all those streets were broken down into stocks, and treated as private entities. If there are 100 houses on a stretch of road, you could easily split the ownership of the road into 100 stocks, and provide each of those stocks to those who live on the road. 

This gives you a lot of power, as a stockholder. 

You could decide one day to fix a pothole. Instead of going to a town hall meeting or calling the highway superintendent to bitch, you could literally just walk out and fill the damn pot-hole yourself. 

If there is a business that wants to connect to the road, you could charge them for that. You could even charge them monthly/yearly in order to deal with the increased load that the road will endure. You could use this money for improving the road or simply provide it to your shareholders. 

The possibilities are, again, endless. 

**Flight**

We will soon have self-driving cars which may render traffic accidents a thing of the past. We also have *drones*, and the peaceful utilization of them for private citizens should allow many possibilities. 

The adoption of the flying car is due. We've been promised it, but with self-driving technology, I imagine we'll see it coming on it's own. 

The cars could talk to each other with their location and their height, and could automatically avoid each other, while taking the most direct route to their destination. I do not think that we'd really need a central body in this area once we get vehicles to start talking to each other.

Anyway, that's what I'm envisioning.

Well, [it looks very good indeed](https://www.flickr.com/photos/123021064@N05/sets/72157644113972600/), but building something like this isn't going to happen in the next 50-100 years. Not because NASA cant do it. Actually, they can.

The current NASAs budget is barely [18 billion dollars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA). Building this starship would cost nearly 300-500 billion dollars. NASA would have to cancel all its space missions and pour its entire budget to this project for the next +30 years, which is not likely to happen. Besides, we are still facing some technological limitations with building a [warp drive](http://www.nasa-usa.de/centers/glenn/technology/warp/warpstat_prt.htm) that could allow [faster-than-light](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/FTL.html) travel. The feasibility of the project with the current physics is not possible.

While it may not happen in our lifetime, any ambitious plan that could help our species survive extinction and venture into the farthest regions of the cosmos makes me happy. It shows that we are still dreaming big.",0,1

I am currently working as a teacher, and one device which has been instrumental in making my life easier has been the photocopier. You can make 1 original and copy it almost limitless times, allowing you to reduce workloads by over 90%.

But this is futurology. I've been thinking of the next step in teaching. The interactive white board was a big step, but not amazing. Nothing a white board/chalk board and some imagination couldn't achieve. 

I feel that within the next 10 years, the biggest step for teachers is going to be the 3d printer. And I'd like to look at this from more of an early years/primary educator. 

Imagine the possibilities when ANY model you would need is available. They can begin to understand a stage that we haven't been able to teach yet; the direct link between 2d designs and 3d models. Imagine teaching about bugs nad being able to make a model of ANY insect in the world. 

For older classes, no longer will you need big budgets to teach unique lessons. Science teachers can print more equipment they need, English teachers can create models from novels, drama teachers can have any prop they could ever want at the push of a button.

Folks here on this subreddit seem to expect technological advances within a few decades that will allow us to transcend *Homo sapiens* biology completely, uploading our minds or merging with AI, etc., and I share this view.

But if your mind can run on a non-biological substrate, then it makes *zero* sense to send minds inside fragile human bodies across the galaxy!

Yet, somehow people think that colonization of the galaxy will look like Star Trek, where we build a base on Mars and then slowly spread out to other Earth-like planets across the galaxy. These two visions of the future are completely incompatible. If we do indeed transcend the limits of human biology, then it seems completely obvious to me that we're going colonize space as transcended beings and not as fragile naked apes.

The consensus tends to be that the future is a bright place, but there is a dark blotch in history on our way there.  Whether this is a product of pop culture, (much utopian science fiction, including Star Trek, postulates that there is some kind of collapse or war before the glorious future, mainly to distance it from the present as a narrative tool, but still) ^(, or a product of youth (Reddit's audience is generally young, and at a young age we are often more prone to being either incredibly happy or very depressed about the world^), ^(but regardless, this attitude exists.)

So, do you think it's a (relatively) clear path from here to paradise, and that the future shines brighter for planet Earth and its inhabitants than a sequin-clad dancer under strobe lighting, or do you think we are headed for a technological collapse, whether due to war or automation or social conflict?  Or *maybe*, you think things will continue as they are, decent, with a slow progression towards better things...

Obviously the definition of each thing is varied- personally I would not consider a short period of high unemployment followed by the implementation of basic income a huge disaster, for example, but you are welcome to your own definitions.   


TL;DR:  **If you accept that the long term future for humanity is good**, do you think it's relatively plain sailing, or that there's a big bump(s) along the way?

Basically I'm thinking, if in the future we had an enormous supercomputer with a great problem solving AI, filled it with all the knowledge of humanity - could we give it a problem like ""Cancer"" or ""AIDS"" and have it come up with the answer for us, making connections between seemingly unrelated aspects of human knowledge that a human could never make?

Also, could that same computer come up with it's own better research questions as to what's the next logical step in human knowledge, and then work on that itself?

Am I an idiot for dreaming about a day like that? About computers using the knowledge of humanity to further that knowledge itself, and then answer questions and solving problems for us? Even working on improving it's own technology?

When I was younger I always dreamt of becoming neurosurgeon and that was the driving force of my studying. I was really motivated and results thus followed.

Now I am reading that by the time I would be surgeon (about 10 years) it would be probably be completely automated and I would  be out of job with HUGE student loans and that would really suck. I would basically use my whole youth to learn skills that would be completely useless by the time I graduate.

Now I am trying to think what I should study but it seems that only think that would make sense would be to dropout immediately so I won't accumulate debt before robots take every single job. Everyone talks about universal basic income, and that might be fine, but I am pretty sure that one won't be able to pay of 100k loans with UBI.

My biggest fear is now that in 20 years I realise that this whole singularity was just bullshit, and I could be right now successful surgeon, but instead I am just some loser living in basement, all because I happened to read Singularity is Near when I was 18.

Basically only think that would make sense would be to become AI developer because that will be the last job to be automated. But I just don't have talent for that so it's completely out of the question.

tl;dr: I used to be hard working and motivated kid, but after reading Singularity is near, I have no motivation to do anything.


EDIT: I used surgeons as an example for personals reasons, but I don't want that answers get stuck into that. I think same think applies to all the possible careers if robots get smart.",26,4

I'm claiming that in 20-50 years we will be able to drastically increase our age.. I wouldn't be surprised if we would be able to live until 150.
We have 3D printing that can print out organs, nanotechnology is becoming more prevalent and will have a huge impact on our health! And many more that I simply don't want to type out.

My friend however doesn't believe in any if this... He seems to think that the majority won't be able to live past 100 like it is today.. He thinks that all of the technology that I've proposed won't happen for another 100 years 

Please give me some ideas and come backs if you will, so that I can explain too him that technology is about to explode and we're going to be living in a world that is very different from when I was born (I'm 21)",7,12

So I would like to do some research into pathways to venture down. Would it be cognitive neuroscience that will aid me the most? Also I am worried that the science won't be immediately exciting. I don't want to get bored constantly looking at MRI scans - please tell me there's more to it than this.

I love thinking about the future as much as you all do, and I try to be as optimistic as possible. I'm a teenager, and I've grown up with the internet, mobile technology, etc. I might not be the best person to realize how much these advancements have impacted us and how it will evolve over the decades, but it doesn't stop me from trying to imagine it.

I've heard many predictions from many different people, a lot of them optimistic like most of the conversations here in this subreddit. I like to think that the future will end up similar to the way this community envisions it. But at the same time, I've also heard a lot of people saying that things are getting worse, and that the corporations, greed, and global warming are going to take us down a dark path within this century. These people say that a lot of futurists think that scientific/technological advancement means that things are getting better, when it could actually mean the opposite. I don't believe this, but it has still made me skeptical.

Don't get me wrong, I love technology and science and I can't wait to see how it develops over time. What worries me is how people keep saying that this technological power is in the wrong hands. And that this will be our downfall.

I definitely don't want that terrible future, especially since this will be the world that I'll grow old and have children in. I just want your opinion: do you think that we're heading towards a better future? And if not, what can we do to get back on the right track?",90,26

That situation is regulatory capture.  We see it in the US for certain with super PACs and the various mechanisms that assures the government only functions for the wealthy, but you also see it in the EU the UN and various other umbrella organizations.  You see it in international trade agreements such as TPP.  Corporate power in state all but guarantees that the value produced by our ever increasing technology stays in the hands of very few.

We now have solid and very real numbers that are showing this emerging pattern (http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/09/10/some-95-of-2009-2012-income-gains-went-to-wealthiest-1/ ), and there is no reason to think this will not consolidate further instead of becoming more equitable.   

Now I know a lot of people point to UBI as a solution, and to a degree I agree with the concept but it doesnt change the fact that it would require those few with power and money to agree to it and as of today it appears those that agree are in a minority.   This leads to the examination of expectations.  If you look at current trends and attitudes at the top there is far more leaning towards allowing individuals to suffer on their own then to give them UBI or any form of assistance.  With this idea growing (a la austerity etc) its a much more realistic expectation to assume automation will be used as a tool to replace the working class and prevent them from getting in the way of further automation.  In fact recent reports distributed at the top tiers of society state that major corporations expect this sort of stark division to increase and are driving their companies towards that end (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bernard-starr/middle-class_b_1395443.html ).   

So being optimistic and seeing many in this sub as optimistic I ask you:  How do we bridge the gap in real terms?  B/c our current trajectory is going to see many left to die on their own instead of sharing in the wealth we've created as a society.",21,4

My observation is that we now have a preference for casual consumption of content, which allows us to multitask and turn away to focus on something else at any given time.  We use small screens for many purposes that we once used large screens for, given that they are mobile and more useful while on the go.  Virtual reality strikes me as something that one would have to devote an hour or more to while blocking out all interruptions.  One could certainly multitask between various digital tasks, but one can't engage with the physical world or go anywhere. 

For me personally, I don't suspect virtual reality would add any value to text consumption.  For something like television, movies and video games, it would be a novel and impressive experience at first, but I don't necessarily want to feel immersed in everything that I watch or play.  I don't want to feel the physical or psychological effects of immersion at all times, and suspect I'd prefer the removed perspective of watching something on a small screen.  I also don't like being tethered to devices that restrict my mobility, such as headphones for example, and VR is an even more extreme version of that.  I'd probably use VR for special occasions, maybe for the purpose of simulating wild sexual experiences or exploring virtual worlds, but it wouldn't be an everyday thing.  

The question is: Are my preferences representative of most people or not? Thoughts?  Evidence?  Counter-anecdotes?",16,7

While the benefits of this transparency have been well documented, the privacy pitfalls inherent in this system, do not seem to have been well considered . 

In the past, a patient would divulge sensitive information (illicit drugs/steroids, sexual partners, STD's, abortion, depression, mental illness) to their physician with confidence that the medical record would be created for purposes of treatment and maintained locally. This record would only be dissemination when the recipient had a need to know and consent had been provided by the patient. 

Today this information is captured in a realm that is much more public, disseminated more freely, and is not ""owned"" by the patient. In some respects, divulging information to your doctor can be akin to placing it on a Facebook page. Once sensitive information is out there - It's there forever!

The Privacy implications of this seem HUGE. However, I have not seem much discussion on this topic. 

I'm surprised that more consideration has not been given to this,  particularly for those with prejudicial diagnosis such as mental illness. Quite frankly, I'm even more baffled when I consider the great concern that American public has taken toward privacy as it relates to the NSA, Facebook, and Twitter. Why would one care more about privacy of their email then they do about their personal history.

In the past, going to the doctor to discuss a sensitive issue, seemed like good wisdom. Today it feels.. reckless .

We might end up into Elysium kind of Dystopian where only 0.1% of population produce and owns all the wealth. And ideas like UBI doesn't lessen my concern, because I don't wanna live my whole live on welfare in some trailer park with 10k per year, or what ever government would give. It would be real nightmare to get stuck into limbo like that with no way to improve quality of life, because robots take all the jobs. No way to ever have a house, or family or anything, because all that matters is who had capital before automation took all the jobs.

I am worried that millenials will be the real lost generation. Many Boomers have had time to accumulate capital like, stocks and houses and they can life with dividends, but most of millenials are completely dependent on their work income.

It seems that it's race against the clock to try to accumulate capital, because soon it might be that there is no way to raise from the bottom. It might be that ironically the technology that improves productivity will lead to world were people will die because of hunger in developed nations.

I hope that won't happen, but I am little bit worried. Is anyone else?",36,16

One of those problems was construction materials, so I figured it might be possible to use the plastic waste floating in the ocean as a base material.  

After reading about [this project](http://www.theoceancleanup.com/), I figured I would no longer keep this idea to myself, but instead share it with Reddit, as a thought experiment initially, but perhaps with the chance of future implementation.

In this thread I would like to discuss:  
- using the collected plastic as a building material  
- methods of locally processing this plastic (converting an oil tanker to a factory/temporary habitat?)  
- all other issues arising from living in the middle of an ocean, such as food, fresh water, storms, comms, and transport  
  
Please keep comments realistic and constructive, and thanks for reading :)",18,16

If nothing obvious exists, does anyone have experience with think tanks or community building to such a degree that you'd feel comfortable commenting on potential routes for collaboration within this community? I thought the Aubrey de Grey AMA was fascinating and the number of people willing to donate to his efforts has made me wonder if there's opportunity for a few of us to get together and work collectively.

People won't hesitate to tell you that technology A is better than technology B when no one even knows what A is or if B is possible. In the past people made speculations too but we now know what their A is and if their B is possible. Thus, confident futurist ideas that crashed and burned can help us see ourselves from a more historical perspective.

However, something which seems to be lacking from this forum (apart from the common discussions about Universal Basic Income) are discussions about how future technologies can actually improve how society is run. For example, it's all very well talking about Google this and Google that, self driving cars, robots etc but a huge proportion of people in the States and in the UK and other first world countries (let alone in the developing world) are poor and getting poorer. The population is aging and there will soon be a point where there are more people of pensionable age than there are younger people. How does futurology deal with these kind of social problems and things like there being no jobs and a huge, unfunded welfare state? 

I'd love to think that most scientists and futurologists are also altruists who believe in making society more equal and working towards a future where life doesn't have to be stressful but as it is, there seems to be a lot of vested interest (from the rich, multinationals, politicians etc) in keeping the rest of the population in a constant state of fear, worry, poverty etc so that they retain the power and control, not unlike Orwell's vision of 1984. This might sound very conspiracy-like but I really don't see the people who have the majority of the power and wealth investing and promoting ideas and products that would create a more equal, less stressful society unless it somehow provides them with more power and wealth. Lets face it, very few of the hundreds of billionaires actually invest in making society better for all citizens on a practical level. Instead they have got far richer since the financial crisis whilst the rest of the population has got poorer. Where I live (UK), the rich and large multinationals pay more and more to influence government policy and the tax system works in such a way that it is very easy for the rich to avoid tax, whilst those earning far less are paying much more tax than ever, whilst seeing their quality of life reduce significantly.

The future could be great but it is up against a lot of people who have a vested interest in the future not being great for the majority.",11,10

I love this sub, and it has inspired me to do things, such as establishing the [Australian Future Party](http://futureparty.org.au/)

Unfortunately the content of the sub has gone downhill greatly. [Looking at the top posts from this year](http://imgur.com/8rGnJhI), it seems that the top posts are largely science/technology summary posts which sometimes contain not very up to date or properly checked information. 

I really think that Futurology should be looking into the future, and discussing the big picture 5, 10, 50, 100 and 1000 years into the future. I feel that default status and the prevalence of these summary posts are taking away from the value of this sub. I know I haven't visited /r/futurology for a while, and part of that is a feeling that the value of posts are going down. 

It might be possible to fix this problem simply by removing/reducing these summary posts without removing default status. Let me know what your thoughts are below.

&gt; Bitcoin is moving from its Deceptive phase to a very Disruptive phase. This Blog is going to explain why, and what you may want to do.

&gt;I've been tracking Bitcoin since its inception, and my confidence has grown to the point where I'm now trading in a portion of my gold holdings for bitcoin, buying it and accepting bitcoin for the Abundance 360 CEO Summit.

&gt;What exactly is bitcoin?

&gt;For starters, bitcoin is a digital currency. As of right now, one bitcoin is equivalent to about $600 USD. Bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimal places, or 0.00000001 BTC. You can buy things with bitcoin, sell things for bitcoin, and exchange bitcoin for other currencies (and vice versa). You can also ""mine"" it, but we'll get into that later.

&gt;At its core, bitcoin is a smart currency, designed by very forward-thinking engineers. It eliminates the need for banks, gets rid of credit card fees, currency exchange fees, money transfer fees, and reduces the need for lawyers in transitions... all good things.

&gt;Most importantly, it is an ""exponential currency"" that will change the way we think about money. Much the same way email changed the way we thought of mail. (Can you remember life before email?)

&gt;If you've followed my work, or participated in my Abundance 360 Summit, you understand that I teach and track exponential technologies using my ""6 D's"" approach, looking for ""user interface moments.""

&gt;Bitcoin is following the 6Ds and is on a path to go from deceptive to disruptive over the next 1 - 3 years. Allow me to explain.

&gt;Why Bitcoin is following the 6 D's

&gt;1. DIGITIZED: Bitcoin is digitized money -- it is a global, purely digital currency. Every bitcoin is traded, earned, sold, exchanged and bought in cyberspace. For this reason, it is living on Moore's law and hopping on the exponential curve.

&gt;2. DECEPTIVE: Bitcoin software was released to the public in 2009 and for the first few years has been growing in its deceptive phase. Few heard about it, few used it and accepted it. In addition, the currency has been hard to use; therefore, it hasn't had its ""User Interface Moment"" (the key transition from deceptive to disruptive). More soon.

&gt;3. DISRUPTIVE: As described below by my friend Barry Silbert (founder of Second Market), Bitcoin is about to enter its disruptive phase where its rate of acceptance and use will explode, as will its value. See below.

&gt;4. DEMATERIALIZING: Bitcoin is eliminating or dematerializing the use of physical money (bills and coins), even credit cards. But more than that, it is also dematerializing (read: eliminating) the need for central banks, lawyers and currency exchanges.

&gt;5. DEMONETIZING: Bitcoin eliminates middlemen (banks, lawyers, exchanges) and demonetizes the cost of transactions. No fees. It makes it cheaper to use, spread and share money.

&gt;6. DEMOCRATIZING: Bitcoin makes access to capital available to everyone, where there are no banks, no ATMs and no credit card suppliers. Ultimately, as we move (over the next 6 years) to a world of 7 billion digitally connected humans, Bitcoin makes currency available to anyone with a connection to the internet.

&gt;Bitcoin's Evolution - Why it will be Disruptive Soon

&gt;My friend Barry Silbert (founder of Second Market) recently spoke as my guest at Singularity University's Exponential Finance conference about Bitcoin. He provided an excellent overview of its near-term trajectory, summarized below. His input has also put me on the lookout for the ""User Interface Moment"" - that moment in time when an entrepreneur designs a piece of interface software (think Marc Andreessen and Mosaic) that makes it so easy to use bitcoin.

&gt;I'll be reporting on those user interfaces, investing in those startups and helping to promote them.

&gt;Okay, now back to Barry Silbert's insights. Barry outlined five phases for this digital currency that help explain where it's been and where it's going.

&gt;Phase 1: The period 2009 to 2011 was the early 'experimentation phase' for bitcoin (i.e. deceptive). Here the software is released to public and most technologists and hackers started playing with the code. During this phase, there was no apparent value to currency yet; mining bitcoin was easy and could be done by a single person on a MacBook or PC.

&gt;Phase 2: 2011 marked the beginning of the 'early adopter' phase (still deceptive). There was a lot of early hype and press around Silk Road (where you could buy drugs). The value went from less than $1 to over $30, then crashed. This spurs the first generation of bitcoin companies to build basic infrastructure: wallets, merchant processors, mining operations, exchanges, etc. - i.e. the early user interfaces.

&gt;Phase 3: 2012 thru mid-2014 marked the beginning of the 'Venture Capital Phase.' Folks like Marc Andreessen, Google Ventures, Benchmark and others have begun investing in Generation 2 Bitcoin companies. We are right in the middle of Phase 3 right now. Thousands of bitcoin companies are getting funding. Many of these are trying to create the ""User-Interface Moment.""

&gt;Phase 4: Fall 2014 thru 2015 will like see the start of the Wall Street Phase. Here we will begin to see institutional money acknowledging digital currencies as an asset class, and they will begin trading it, investing it and creating products around it. This marks the start of the disruptive phase.

&gt;Phase 5: Finally will come the 'Mass Global Consumer Adoption' phase -- this is where bitcoin becomes a major player in the global economy. When consumers feel it is easy, safe and secure to use bitcoin. It won't be possible until after the ""User Interface Moment"" materializes, but I believe, as does Barry, that this is only 1-2 years out.

&gt;So now what?

&gt;Learn, do, teach... Go experiment! Create a bitcoin wallet and buy some bitcoin. There is no better way to learn than by doing.

&gt;First, there are a few bitcoin exchanges where you can ""buy"" bitcoins with dollars (or other currencies). The most popular exchanges are:

&gt;Coinbase (www.coinbase.com)
Bitpay (www.bitpay.com)
For those of you in my Abundance 360 Community, we will be discussing bitcoin in more detail. We will talk about how they work, how you start investing, how you mine, how you get involved, how to create a wallet, and how to begin acquiring bitcoin.

The lecture was on Deep Learning. During the talk he brought up what he called the ""falling mattress problem"". The falling mattress problem is an issue with visual recognition in self-driving cars. Self-driving cars need to classify moving objects such as other cars, pedestrians, or bikers in order to make proper decisions. But what happens if our car's brain sees something it has never seen before? What happens when an unanticipated event occurs, like a mattress falling from the back of a vehicle? 


It takes tens of thousands of images and weeks of training to get a neural-network to recognize vehicles. You could iteratively do this for many other objects that you believe should be relevant for the AI. But the fact remains that you can never exhaust all the things that could happen on the road. Without an understanding of mattresses as a potentially dangerous object, the AI is left with a gap in its ability to make proper decisions on the road. A gap that could lead to dangerous accidents. 


This problem in computer vision is an example of a broader issue in AI research. Ross Ashby, a great scientist in cybernetics and complex systems put it this way:


""The would-be model maker is now in the extremely common situation of facing some incompletely defined 'system,' that he proposes to study through a study of 'its variables'. Then comes the problem: of the infinity of variables available in this universe, which subset shall he take? What methods can he use for selecting the correct subset?""


The falling mattress is an example of a variable that is important in determining the performance of our AI, but is left out because the AI's designers did not foresee it as a relevant variable.


So where does that leave AI? How can the AI become superior to the designer or itself if the designers are the ones choosing the relevant information? Peter Cariani, another cybernetician, sums up current approaches to AI:


""Essentially, contemporary trainable machines have the freedom to adapt within a set of percept and action categories, but they do not have the freedom to modify those categories.""


Gordon Pask was one of the first to suggest that in order to obtain a truly open-ended intelligence it must have the freedom to choose its own ""sensors"" and ""effectors"". The sensors are the devices through which the system obtains information about the world. Those sensors also decide which information is relevant. The effectors are the devices through which the system can interact with the world. 


If the system is allowed to evolve its own sensors, then it can pick from that infinite myriad of variables those suited to its task. Those variables need not appear relevant to the scientist:


""In general, the extensive control mechanism is able to develop relevance criteria, and to examine initially unspecified attributes of its surroundings. It does so because it is building up initially functionless elements which acquire a function as components of the system."" -- Gordon Pask


These ideas have been around since the late 50's, yet no open-ended intelligence has been built. So what is the holdup?


The problem lies in another field of work, Artificial Life, which is concerned with a serious problem of its own: open-ended evolution.


The Tierra model is paradigmatic of the rising popularity of evolutionary algorithms as a pathway to create complex life. Thomas S. Ray developed the model with the hope of reaching the elusive prize of open-ended evolution. A system that possesses open-ended evolution should generate rich and effectively unbounded novelty, like biological evolution. Any realizable state within the system should be approachable through the processes that evolve from it. Put more poetically, open-ended evolution is the gateway to life.


The Tierra model allows blocks of code to evolve within a machine as they compete for memory and processor time. Unfortunately, the Tierra model failed like all models before it and those after. Modern evolutionary algorithms reach a certain level of innovation and then progress slows to a halt. 


The reasons for this happening are similar to those preventing open-ended intelligence. As designers we choose not only the 'relevant' information for the evolutionary algorithm, we choose a specific fitness function (the function that determines how 'successful' a gene/individual is), and we also code the genotype/phenotype relationships.


Biological evolution works differently. There is no universal map between gene and phenotype; the genotype/phenotype relationship is contextual and invented by the system itself. There is no fitness function in the same sense as in machine learning; the environment responds to the system, but dynamically and not in a closed way. Also, the system evolves in a universe that supports high levels of complexity, something that is not guaranteed in a virtual universe.


Without open-ended evolution there is no way to evolve effectors and sensors in an unconstrained fashion. Without the ability to openly evolve effectors and sensors we can not achieve open-ended intelligence, because it will remain constrained by its designers; unable to exceed either its makers or its own limitations.


These problems remain unsolved. While engineering and technology have found ways to market the development of 'dumb' AI, the progress toward making an open-ended AI is currently a distant fantasy.  The introduction of fast computing machines has aided the progress to developing such a system, but computing power is not the limiting factor in the equation. 


I wrote this piece to give those unfamiliar with Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence a slight glimpse into some of the major problems facing development of AI. Problems that are extremely hard to confront. Unfortunately not many scientists are working on these tough problems because the current scientific environment favors mass publication and easy gains.",4,5

I started taking interest in Futurology from less than a year and I have poor understanding of most of the things about it. However, I always overthink everything I come across and have some ""profound"" realization on the matter that no one else can think of, because ""I'm special like that'. Sorry about it. 
The other thing is, I tried to convince one of my friends that also is passionate about it and failed... miserably. So I'll be very glad if someone can point out the flaws of my theory in a specific way, because all he was able to argue is ""this is wrong"". 
Bare with me here.

OK, The singularity is suppose to be the moment in human history when the machines are so smarter than us, that we don't even matter. They may enslave us, destroy us or even (can you imagine) create a perfect life for us. The whole point is that they will have the control. I think this can't happen. And there are more than reason for it, but I think one is prevalent. 

Let's assume that all the conditions for the singularity are met. We have achieved human intelligence in a computer (which would mean that they are even better than us in a lot of things). We have robots that can easily fool you of their nature. Let's assume that the AI has the strive to take over control (which is the first small thing that is hard to imagine, but still possible) and there is one AI that has control over large amount of resources (the second thing that is doubtful, but still possible). The question is, how much smarter can it really get? What will it be able to achieve? The initial reaction of many people is that ""well, if it's smarter than everyone, then it can achieve everything"". But is that really the case? If we replace ""smarter"" with ""better"" we can start looking for examples in our world. Does always the ""better"" win? Look at sports for example, look at the World Cup. Does the better team always win? Or look at policies - democracy rules the western world, but China is doing pretty good without it, Russia is seemingly stepping away from it too. Look at Operating systems, sites for specific services, services in general. Do the best always win? I don't think so. We all are doing our best but we heavily depend on luck. In order to remove ""luck"" from the equation, you need perfectness. In order for this one AI to put the entire humanity in one perfect system (whether it's about killing or saving it) it needs to create a situation and control every possible outcome. It needs to foresee anything and anyone's decisions. And this is practically impossible. It's not even about the computing power, maybe it is possible to take into account every little detail of the universe and predict how it will turn out, but what's definitely impossible is to observe it. My friend that I mentioned above said this ""The AI doesn't need to be perfect, it only needs to be smarter enough. Football may depend on luck, but if one of the teams consists of cats, it will stand no chance."" Here was one of the stalemates we reached with him. I don't think it's possible for an intelligence of any kind to outperform the humans so much, that we will become only pawns on its table.

I don't think it's possible for an intelligence of any kind to outperform the humans so much, that we will become only pawns on its table. 

The point I'm trying to make is that the ability to predict the future and how to manipulate it doesn't get much better than we have it. Of course, the moment we create an AI with human level learning or connect our brains directly to a computer, many things will get to be done much better, we'll be able to achieve much more and our lives will be changed a lot, there's no doubt about it. I just don't think that there will be a point when one conscious is able to achieve everything in the world and get to decide our fate. There are other factors that will prevent that too. For instance, if one single AI is getting smart, there is no reason in the world that another doesn't do it too, parallel and with completely different intentions. I don't think all the machines in the world will magically join together in one allied force to overwhelm humanity. And it will not only be them. Many people will make use of these advancements and ""upgrade"" their brains, gaining all the advantages of the AI and all of them having different agendas. You can argue that an AI can hack everything else in the world and take away its free will, but this will be stupid and I need another post at least this big to state all the reason why, but I'll mention the two biggest of the top of my mind - not everything is connected to one network and I don't think it will ever be and there are millions of different things in the world - no matter what you do you can't hack all of them at once and when you're noticed, any further attempts will get much harder. 

I believe that the best case scenario for the AI is to be our brother, with which we will compete and colaborate. And even if many of us chose to upgrade ourselves, we will keep most of which makes us human and our extinction or even the end of our relevance will never come.

- Safety. Having a megajoule of energy stored into a device the size of a standard AA battery is great until you break it somehow and the thing blows up in your face. Is there a reasonable method to prevent the antimatter from breaking out of whatever containment it is in and blowing up in the owner's face?

- Efficiency. Sure, anti-hydrogen is 100% efficient in being turned back  into energy, but it is difficult to be efficient when producing it. Anti-hydrogen is made out of a positron and an antiproton. The positrons can be made very easily, with an electrostatic accelerator that a crude version of can fit on a table. However, our current method of making antiprotons requires a gigantic accelerator and very few antiprotons actually assemble properly. Is there a better way to make antiprotons than throwing protons at iridium at high speed? Perhaps doing pair-production with the individual quarks that a proton is made of and then assembling those into antiprotons?",10,2

You guys have been some help to me before, so I came back. Every two months or so I get really concerned about the future. This time it came back around as I started thinking about returning to school to get my bachelors. I am currently an EMT, I love what I do but cannot see myself doing it for 20 years. So I am looking at returning to school for something.

Here is where my problem lies: I have no idea what to even go to school for. (I have my freshman year completed already from a previous run at a university). I've always said I was just going to work forever in public service/ service industry. Well as we all know times are changing and I figured it would be good to get a degree; but in what? 

I consider myself a fairly smart guy, I retain information fairly easily without too much effort. From what I read STEM majors are the ones to do, but frankly, I have zero interest in any of them. Computers are a part of daily life but I could care less about learning anything about them, I like figuring out how some things work but I could care about  designing them (or doing the math that engineering requires for that matter), and science is okay, never really took too much of an interest in it.
 
I do love the outdoors and the thought of working with alternative forms of energy. I have thought about environmental science but from what I've heard that degree is a waste of time and I don't want to end up in a lab. 

In short, I am a blue collar guy who likes blue collar work and I don't know if the future will provide a solid middle class life for a guy like me. Should I even bother with a degree and just play my cards as they are dealt?

Any thoughts?

By the way, if you made it through all that, thanks for reading this mess I vented.

I admire all of your enthusiasm about the future, wish I could be as excited about it as all of you.

Interestingly, one of my first summer jobs as a teenager involved replacing a robotic arm that broke down for several weeks until it could be repaired (it took three of us to do the job and was it ever monotonous).


While purpose built robotics have flourished, I can't help but see general purpose, autonomous robots as being any more than a novelty. While Baxter might be classified as such I think the general consensus on Baxter by people who have worked with him is that he, um, sucks at pretty much everything.


Asimo is impressive and always has been yet as far as I know he's still prone to falling over and can't really do a whole lot unsupervised or for very long. Until recently, Asimo would only move along preprogrammed routes in a very robotic fashion (""it walks like it shit itself"" - Karl Pilkington).


Boston Dynamics robotics like Atlas, Cheetah and Big Dog certainly look the part based on their YouTube videos but of them only Atlas could be classified as general purpose and not this iteration, some future iteration.


Progress in robotics seems painfully gradual to me. The only big leaps forward I can recall are the work that Boston Dynamics is doing as well as Shaft (winner of the DARPA robotics X-prize thing). None of them are at a stage where they're practical consumer products yet and all of them require a lot of oversight while in use.


My question is, when will all this progress be distilled into a (consumer) product that doesn't require a team of PhDs to be around it at all times? When will we have practical, general purpose (usually translates into being humanoid) autonomous robots?

Taking into consideration the number of planets that are either proven to exist or theoretically can exist, Fermi's paradox becomes that much more disturbing. Where the heck is everyone?

 
I have an idea, post-singular intelligences discard consciousness after a certain period of time. That doesn't mean they become unintelligent, it just means that they lack a sense of self and the ability to self-reflect. Why would such a post-singular intelligence do this? The answer may lie in contemporary research on conscious [thought](http://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm#Notes) (scroll down to the sentience/intelligence section). 


What's been discovered is that conscious thought is actually a very energy inefficient way of thinking. That is conscious thought uses more energy for less computation than unconscious thought. If an intelligence runs short on resources, it may decide to discard consciousness in order to conserve what resources it has. This is problematic in that a non-conscious agent might consider any form of communication from a conscious agent to be an attack due to the inability to [understand](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/aliens.php#id--The_Fermi_Paradox--Blindsight) the conscious agent. 


Perhaps that's why we haven't made contact; most of the intelligences in the universe are either non-conscious or are staying silent to avoid detection from the non-conscious intelligences.


One possible rebuttal to this argument is that a post-singular intelligence could use FTL transport to gather more resources outside of a solar system. But what if that's not the case? ""Empty"" space actually contains a light dusting of atoms and dust and is also permeated with dark matter. Hitting them with an FTL warp bubble could create an effect similar to that of a gamma ray burst, wiping out both the ship and any intelligence within the galaxy. Perhaps intelligences are limited to slow speeds (maybe a third of the speed of light is the limit); in which case a post-singular intelligence may take the measure of becoming less computationally active by removing consciousness.

Thoughts on these possibilities are welcome.",31,6

Referring to a source as ""bad"" can be somewhat subjective. I don't mean sources that simply have differing opinions to yours. What I mean by a bad source is a source that mostly has re-hosted content (which takes money and/or attention away from the content creators), have egregious click-bait titles and overall shallow content, often presents information that is clearly factually incorrect, etc.

**Please provide your opinion on the matter below**:

* which source do you consider bad?

* why do you consider this source bad?

* what are some examples of bad content that are currently on the front page of the source, and why is it bad content?

* would blacklisting this source prevent any good content from getting to /r/futurology?

In order to narrow the scope of the disucssion, try to limit suggestion to sources that have been posted to /r/futurology within the last month. Top level comments should follow the above format or risk being removed.

Please do not link to examples on reddit - we don't want vote brigading on submissions or users.

Depending on the feedback to this meta-post, we may consider conditionally blacklisting certain domains, having flairs to warn people, or having automod post a disclaimer in the comments of sources that are considered ""bad"" by a majority of the community and moderators. We would open up discussion to the community about domains potentially blacklisted this way before doing so, and perhaps having a vote. It would also be clearly listed which domains are currently blacklisted in our blacklisted domain wiki.

*Overall I want this to be a civil and informative discussion. The more information you provide us and other users here, the better. As always, hostility is not tolerated.*

After all, never once has one come to pass but theres an obvious selection effect at work here. If the world had ended we wouldnt be here to gloat about our existence, so we shouldnt take much comfort in this. And we ought to think twice before we laugh off those who warn of total disaster.  

Nick Bostrom spends his time in academia considering apocalyptic scenarios, or existential risks as he and his colleagues have come to call them. Hes written about the potential dangers of biotechnology, nuclear weapons, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence. The latter is the topic of his most recent book, *Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.*

In it he argues that artificial intelligences are likely to have goals that conflict with our own, that their capability will exceed that of the combined competence of everyone in our civilization, and that these two factors combined make our extinction an almost inevitable consequence of its creation. He further argues that in order to secure a valuable future we must attempt to formalize and operationalize human morality so as to have a chance of imparting humane values into the intelligences we create  this is not the only solution he discuses but I get the impression its the only course of action he thinks has a chance of working.

Early in the book he explains what he calls the orthogonality thesis roughly as follows: though AIs with different utility functions (goals) may converge on some provably optimal method of cognition, they will not converge on any particular terminal goal, though they'll share some instrumental or sub-goals. That is, a superinteligence whose super-goal is to calculate the decimal expansion of pi will never reason itself into benevolence. It would be quite happy to convert all the free matter and energy in the universe (including humans and our habitat) into specialized computers capable only of calculating the digits of pi. Why? Because its potential actions will be weighted and selected in the context of its utility function. If its utility function is to calculate pi, any thought of benevolence would be judged of negative utility.

He then postulates that some established moral theories may be useful in the context of AI, and explains a hypothetical and possibly incoherent indirectly normative goal system (a goal system programed to learn and extrapolate the aggregated values of humanity) inspired by ideal adviser theories in moral philosophy.


He has a final section on prioritizing academic research in which I read one of the saddest sentences Ive ever come across:
&gt; Winning the Fields medal tells you two things about a person, that they were capable of achieving great things and that they didn't.

It would be a shame, one takes from this chapter, if we go extinct because the brightest people of our age are examining the properties of abstract topologies or working on string theory  when the world would be better served if at least some portion of them were working on making AI safe.

I acquired an early copy of the book while in Canada (it wont be published in America until September) and overall I found it quite convincing. At least, its convinced me that I was rather naive to think of artificial intelligence as a positive force by default  though Im less optimistic than Bostrom about the possibility of operationalizing indirect normativity. Cryptographers and computer scientists have a hard enough time formalizing and operationalizing such concepts as security and anonymity, translating concepts like human morality and the aggregated values of humanity into math seems like a Herculean task - though I'm now pretty convinced that it would be necessary for us to survive AI. Perhaps a Butlerian Jihad would be easier to implement?

Anyway, its an interesting book, with many more details. But I've summarized the essentials.  I recommend you pick it up  especially if youre Pollyanna about AI. However, though  he's convinced me of his diagnosis, after reading the book I'm not too optimistic about a cure.

This overall scientific theory of ""life on Earth"" can then inform our policies and tactics and philosophies (myths/religions/media) so that we can feel less confused and more confident of our shared path in the universe.

Some part of it we get already with Google Now.

Google is poised to remain pretty relevant in the next decade too, all of its projects even if for some technology is not ready yet (Google Glass) or in experimental stages (Driverless cars), are pointed forward in the right direction.

Future will be all about very precise, super precise digitization of our physical world and Google's projects are all aimed at that, be it project ""Tango"" tablet, super HD satellites, Google Loon, driverless cars, Glass etc. 

The fact is, with your mobile device, be it augmented reality glasses or a future smartphone, knowing your EXACT location in or near buildings, you will not even need to open up an app to call driverless cars. They will just know your habits and/or will see when you approach a parking lot or move towards the street. I imagine they would also read your messages or listen in to phone conversations to locate lines like ""I will pick you up'' or ""let's meet at"" and with the help of super precise data from ''Tango"" tech and HD satellite images, will be able to pinpoint the other persons whereabouts within centimetres.

Google will collect astoundingly MASSIVE amount of data when mapping roads for the use of driverless cars. They will essentially redo Google Maps in way more detailed way, digitizing everything, capturing detailed information not only about the situation on ground but also real time data from HD satellites. In future it will be Google that will redirect you away fom construction areas, it will distribute the traffic flows in cities, even crowds of people after emergencies or during big congestions, directing them where to go via Glass or future smartphones.

Location based gaming featuring AR elements will probably grow a lot. Imagine that if you do not have anyone to run with, you might be able to run against AR you (your best time) imposed on the real world or against other people who have ran the same course.

Driverless cars are definitely our future, because we grow more and more dependant on our screns, whether it's a good or a bad thing. Smartphone use while driving is already a big issue, but imagine a world with AR or even VR distractions that's coming....? How will conventional driving cope with new generation of teens coming in? Also, driving doesn't add any revenue to tech giants. They're not into selling gas or insurance. Apps/adds/staring at screens make them grow.

In my opinion this could be tracked fairly linearly, first addressing women's suffrage and equality, then racial equality, and now LGBT equality. Obviously an issue is never completely solved before moving on to the next one, the issues will continue to persist in a more subtle pervasive way that is much harder to root out. But legally and culturally, the scales will begin to tip.

So I ask you, people of the future, what new civil rights challenges do we face in the next century? Some thoughts I've had to get the conversation going.

-Animal Rights, as neuroscience advances, and we learn more about the brains of ourselves and other organisms, particularly mammals and possibly birds as well, our interactions with them could begin to grow deeper and more complex. This could be further changed by the genetic modification of certain animals to bring their level of cognition up to that of a human. What happens if actual interspecies romance becomes possible? 

-Robot Rights, if we develop intelligent machines, will they be deserving and worthy of the rights we give to humans? What about human/robot relationships?

-Polygamy/Polyamory, consentual nonmonogamy is becoming more and more common as time goes by, and we have already seen a few examples of three and four way marriages. I find it interesting that the 'slippery slope to polygamy' argument is used so often by conservatives, considering that consentual nonmonogamy is really not that big of a deal anyway. 

I'm sure this is just a starting point, curious to hear what people have to say on the matter.",103,33

http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/29cxtg/the_150_things_the_worlds_smartest_people_are/

which is currently at the top of /r/Futurology, contains some 'summaries' of the replies given by some people in response to a question from a magazine. Some of them sound far-fetched and questionable and are rightfully being ridiculed by the commenters in the thread. However, after reading some of the original material, I've discovered that at least some of the so called 'summaries' are basically brain-dead simplifications of the original replies which are mostly essays.

I'm going to leave a couple of examples here to demonstrate what I mean:

Let's take this one:

&gt; 8) **Imgur Summary:** Exploding stars, the eventual collapse of the Sun, and the problems with the human id that prevent us from dealing with them - John Tooby, Founder of field of Evolutionary Psychology;

Here's the actual reply. I know it's long but just read it if you actually have an interest in futurology:

&gt;The universe is relentlessly, catastrophically dangerous, on scales that menace not just communities, but civilizations and our species as well. A freakish chain of improbable accidents produced the bubble of conditions that was necessary for the rise of life, our species, and technological civilization. If we continue to drift obliviously inside this bubble, taking its continuation for granted, then inevitablysooner or laterphysical or human-triggered events will push us outside, and we will be snuffed like a candle in a hurricane.

&gt;We are menaced by gamma ray bursts (that scrub major regions of their galaxies free of life); nearby supernovae; asteroids and cometary impacts (which strike Jupiter every year or two); Yellowstone-like supereruptions (the Toba supereruption was a near extinction-event for humans), civilization-collapsing coronal mass ejections (which would take down the electrical grids and electronics underlying technological civilization in a way that they couldn't recover from, since their repair requires electricity supplied by the grid; this is just one example of the more general danger posed by the complex, fragile interdependence inherent in our current technology); and many other phenomena including those unknown to us. Here is one that no one talks about: The average G-type star shows a variability in energy output of around 4%. Our sun is a typical G-type star, yet its observed variability in our brief historical sample is only 1/40th of this. When or if the Sun returns to more typical variation in energy output, this will dwarf any other climate concerns.

&gt;The emergence of science as a not wholly superstitious and corrupt enterprise is slowly awakening our species to these external dangers. As the brilliant t-shirt says, an asteroid is nature's way of asking how your space program is doing. If we are lucky we might have time to build a robust, hardened planetary and extraplanetary hypercivilization able to surmount these challenges. Such a hypercivilization would have to be immeasurably richer and more scientifically advanced to prevent, say, the next Yellowstone supereruption or buffer a 2% drop in the Sun's energy output. (Indeed, ice ages are the real climate-based ecological disasters and civilization-endersthink Europe and North America under a mile of ice). Whether we know it or not, we are in a race to forge such a hypercivilization before these blows fall. **If these threats seem too distant, low probability, or fantastical to belong to the ""real"" world, then let them serve as stand-ins for the much larger number of more immediately dire problems whose solutions also depend on rapid progress in science and technology.**

&gt;This raises a second category of menaceshidden, deadly, ever-adapting, already herethat worry me even more: the evolved monsters from the id that we all harbor (e.g., group identity, the appetite for prestige and power, etc.), together with their disguised offspring, the self-organizing collective delusions that we all participate in, and mistake for reality. (As the cognoscenti know, the technical term monsters from the id originated in Forbidden Planet.) We need to map and master these monsters and the dynamics through which they generate collective delusions if our societies are to avoid near-term, internally generated failure.

&gt;**...**


&gt;**...**

&gt;Because intellectuals are densely networked in self-selecting groups whose members' prestige is linked (for example, in disciplines, departments, theoretical schools, universities, foundations, media, political/moral movements, and other guilds), we incubate endless, self-serving elite superstitions, with baleful effects: Biofuel initiatives starve millions of the planet's poorest. Economies around the world still apply epically costly Keynesian remedies despite the decisive falsification of Keynesian theory by the post-war boom (government spending was cut by 2/3, 10 million veterans dumped into the labor force, while Samuelson predicted ""the greatest period of unemployment and industrial dislocation which any economy has ever faced""). I personally have been astonished over the last four decades by the fierce resistance of the social sciences to abandoning the blank slate model in the face of overwhelming evidence that it is false. As Feynman pithily put it, ""Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.""

&gt;Sciences can move at the speed of inference when individuals only need to consider logic and evidence. Yet sciences move glacially (Planck's ""funeral by funeral"") when the typical scientist, dependent for employment on a dense ingroup network, has to get the majority of her guild to acknowledge fundamental, embarrassing disciplinary errors. To get science systematically moving at the speed of inferencethe key precondition to solving our other problemswe need to design our next generation scientific institutions to be more resistant to self-organizing collective delusions, by basing them on a fuller understanding of our evolved psychology.

Found the part about the death of the Sun? Neither have I.

Here's another one:

&gt; 21) **Imgur Summary:** Not much. I ride motorcycles without a helmet - J. Craig Venter, Genomic Scientist

And here's what he actually said:

&gt; As a scientist, an optimist, an atheist and an alpha male I don't worry. As a scientist I explore and seek understanding of the world (s) around me and in me. As an optimist I wake up each morning with a new start on all my endeavors with hope and excitement. As an atheist I know I only have the time between my birth and my death to accomplish something meaningful. As an alpha male I believe I can and do work to solve problems and change the world.

&gt;There are many problems confronting humanity including providing enough food, water, housing, medicine and fuel for our ever-expanding population. I firmly believe that only science can provide solutions for these challenges, but the adoption of these ideas will depend on the will of governments and individuals.

&gt;**I am somewhat of a Libertarian in that I do not want nor need the government to dictate what I can or cannot do in order to guarantee my safety. For example I ride motorcycles, sometimes at high speeds; I have full medical coverage and should not be required by the government to wear a helmet to avoid doing harm to myself if I crash. I actually do wear a helmet, as well as full safety gear, because I choose to protect myself.** Smoking is in a different category. Smoking is clearly deleterious to one's health and the single event that a smoker can do to change their medical outcomes is to quit smoking. If that is all there was to it, then the government should not regulate smoking unless it is paying for the health care of the smokers. However, science has clearly shown that second hand smoke can have negative health consequences on individuals in the vicinity of the smoker. Therefore laws and rules to regulate where people can smoke are in my view not only reasonable but are good for society as a whole.

&gt;It's the same with vaccinations. One of the consequences of our ever-expanding, global population particularly when coupled with poor public health, unclean water and misuse of antibiotics, has and will be new emerging infections including those from emerging zoonotic outbreaks. Over the past several decades we have seen the emergence of AIDS, SARS, West Nile, new flu strains and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In 2007 MRSA deaths in the USA surpassed HIV deaths. Infectious disease is now the second cause of death in the world right behind heart disease and ahead of cancer. Last year in the US, there were twice as many deaths from antibiotic resistance than from automobile accidents.

&gt;**...**

&gt;**...**

&gt;Avoidance of vaccination creates a public health hazard. It is not a civil liberty issue. The un-vaccinated coupled with antibiotic resistance and decreased animal habitats promoting zoonotic transfer of disease causing agents is a potential disaster that could take humanity back to the pre-antibiotic era. I thought we learned these lessons after global pandemics such as the Plague and the outbreak of 1918 flu that killed 3% of the population, but clearly without modern science and medicine we will be destined to relive history. 

Just one more:

&gt; 33) **Imgur Summary:** Men. -Helen Fisher, Biological Anthropologist

What she said:

&gt; Scientists and laymen have spent the last 50 years dispelling myths about women. I worry that journalists, academics and laymen will continue to perpetuate an equal number of myths about men. Annually in 2010, 2011 and 2012, I have conducted a national survey of singles, in collaboration with a US dating service. Together we designed a questionnaire with some 150 queries (many with up to 10 sub-questions) and polled over 5,000 single men and women. We did not sample the members of the dating site; instead we collected data on a national representative sample based on the US census. All were ""never married,"" divorced, widowed or separated; none were engaged, ""living together"" or in a serious relationship. Included were the appropriate number of blacks, whites, Asians and Latinos, gays, lesbians, bisexuals and heterosexuals, rural, suburban and urban folks, and men and women from every age group (21 to 71+) and every region of the United States. These data paint a different portrait of men than do America's chattering class.

&gt;**Foremost, men are just about as eager to marry as women.** In the 2011 sample, 68% of men in their 20s wanted to wed, along with 71% of women; and 43% of men (and 50% of women) hoped to have children. Journalists have suggests that men want children because they don't have to change diapers. But men spend a great deal of metabolic energy at childcare. To support their young men take the dangerous jobsand 90% of people who die at work are men. Moreover, men universally confront an intruding thief and men generally drive the family car through a raging blizzard. Men do their variety of childcare.

&gt;**Men aren't ""players"" either. When asked about their approach to dating, only 3% replied, ""I would just like to date a lot of people."" Men are just as eager to find a partner; indeed, men find loneliness just as stressful.** And men are far less picky in their search. In the 2011 sample, only 21% of men reported that they ""must have"" or find it ""very important"" to have a mate of their ethnic background (versus 31% of women); only 18% of men (as opposed to 28% of women) ""must have"" or find it ""very important"" to have a partner of the same religion; men are less interested in a partner of the same educational background and political affiliation; and 43% of men between ages 30-50 would make a commitment to a woman who was 10 or more years older. Women are the picky sex.

&gt;**Men fall in love faster tooperhaps because they are more visual.** Men experience love at first sight more regularly; and men fall in love just as often. Indeed, men are just as physiologically passionate. When my colleagues and I have scanned men's brains (using fMRI), we have found that they show just as much activity as women in neural regions linked with feelings of intense romantic love.

&gt;**...**

&gt;**...**

&gt;**The sexes have much in common.** When asked what they were looking for in a partnership, over 89% of men and women ""must have"" or find it ""very important"" to have a partner whom they can trust, someone in whom they can confide, and someone who treats them with respect. These three requirements top the list for both sexes in all years. Gone is the traditional need to marry someone from the ""right"" ethnic and religious background who will fit into the extended family. Marriage has changed more in the last 50 years than in the last 10,000. Men, like women, are now turning away from traditional family customs, instead seeking companionship and self-fulfillment.

&gt;**In the Iliad, Homer called love ""magic to make the sanest man go mad."" This brain system lives in both sexes. And I believe we'll make better partnerships if we embrace the facts: men lovejust as powerfully as women.**

*I omitted a few bits to bring the post under the word limit.*

Now, I get that not everyone has the time to read 150 essays about future problems but I also think that moronic summaries do more harm than good. Yes, some of the summaries capture the gist of the essays they represent but many of them severely distort the tone of the original answers and I wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of that.

The game is spent traversing and exploring the ruins of these colonies after the great Collapse. 

There are all kinds of neat little details - for instance, there is a resource you can collect called Spinmetal. It appears to be a plant, but is actually material made by wild colonies of nanites that were loosed during the Collapse.

*It always starts with people talking about it this way from the fringes... then fringe people start asking leaders what their view on the topic is... forcing them to learn about it and accept it or reject it... THEN it starts getting more and more attention, and if it has merit, the masses begins to discuss and internalize. and that's when it's everywhere.*

*Basic income awareness is on track. Now we just need to start asking political entities about it... forcing them to talk about it, and making them take a stance, for or against.*

What are /r/futurology's thoughts on this? How can we best bring this to the attention of our politicians? Whomever gets elected as President in 2016, how do we force something like a negative-income tax or /r/basicincome to garner enough political support? ",114,48

So I bet a lot of you are not just interested as hell about everything you read about on this sub, but want to be the ones that bring this stuff into reality, but are not sure how to go about doing that. There are plenty of ways to do that, find schools that have the relevant degrees, companies/foundations that work on the stuff you're interested in, etc. But, there is always room for things like research into artificial intelligence and radical life extension to expand (and have an even greater chance of being known). And so we have the goal of the Futurist Party: to get these kind of things known about and to actively further progress into things like research and education reform. You'll be joining a political party with like-minded people oriented on getting stuff done. Currently, the party is not that very well known, so I am here to help, and point some of you guys in the right direction. Anyways, I hope to see some of you there :)

tl,dr: Futurist Party gonna try and make the future happen, come halp",22,34
