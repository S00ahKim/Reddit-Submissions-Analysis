I posted my notes and observations here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlProblem/comments/4qndcn/notes_on_the_safety_in_artificial_intelligence/ If you are interested in long term AI safety or are interested in topics like superintelligence then you might like to see some of the technical and policy information which I gathered. 

There was much less discussion about long term AI unemployment - the other White House conferences on AI would have been better for that. However, I did hear a high ranking person from the White House say that he doesn't believe permanent mass unemployment is likely, because AIs will create new job sectors. They did however say that there would be significant structural unemployment from industry sectors being displaced and that we would have to find ways to deal with it.

Happy to answer any other questions you may have about the material and opinions presented at the conference.",27,15

Unlike restrictive subs like /r/philosophy or /r/askphilosophy, we will be liberal with allowing open-ended discussions and links.

It grows like icicles upon protein sticks, so people could grow it in their own homes if they wanted, making it affordable even to the developing world. It has all the proteins, all the nutrients, all the taste of butchered meat. It's a 100% substitute that even Ted Nugent could get behind. It will revolutionize agriculture as we know it, making meat production greatly less energy intensive and vastly reduce carbon and methane emissions.  It can't fail. You'll be rich. You've be famous. You'll have it all.


And then you call it 'Testcicles.' 

20 years later, when your broke-ass laments how it all went wrong, it should be a shame that your children have to tell you ""*That was an awful name.*""

That's an extreme example, but this is what I'm trying to get across ***no one*** is going to eat something called ""lab-grown meat"" or ""in vitro meat"" or ""synthetic meat"". It carries with it a stigma that it's sterile, cold, tasteless, and outright unnatural. It sounds like you put in some grey paste into a petri dish and after the bacteria got done eating it, they shat out this ungodly material that scientists then decide to sell for your consumption.

It's *not* going to work with that kind of name.

The shame is that it doesn't have to fail. It's not like this meat *isn't* meat. It's not like those veggie burgers or the pastes McDonalds uses in their McNuggets that are made out of god knows what that have to actively *try* to taste like meat. It ***is*** meat. It's grown from meat cells; it has meat proteins; it is meat. It's just meat that didn't have to die first. That's the only difference.

Yet you would never get that out of names like 'lab grown meat' and 'synthetic meat'. Some socially inept people will still try to claim that we should go with the name for so-and-so reason. I.e., it's our moral duty to eat lab grown meat, or we should actively dismantle the negative connotations, or whatever.

The real world doesn't work that way. Some products that we treasure so dearly today would've crashed and burned decades or centuries ago had it not been for proper marketing. So go ahead flip that coin.

So all I'm asking is to get the people behind lab-grown meat to market it better, lest they so love the bitter taste of poverty.

I get the reasoning that ""it's still a new technology, so they haven't had the time to market it properly"", and that is indeed true. However, we're now beginning to make it for consumption, and have put some people through taste tests. I think that's as good as any moment to start thinking about how to market it.",41,21

It is likely to be quiet and stable, as long as those who run things do not get people too uppity.

To protect civilization and prevent any kind of uprisings which might upset the apple cart, it might be necessary to prepare humanity, or at least the portion which will be relevant, to a more stable condition.

We were so close on 1913; but the Great War dragged for 4 years, thanks to some 'heroes' whose actions only benefited the commies and the third world in the end.

In any case, to facilitate the arrival of the new civ some adjustments might have to be made to today's world;

*anti-egalitarianism
*acknowledgement of human biological differences
*anti-democracy
*pro-civilization
*traditionalism
*classical aesthetic, but some are futurists
*support of social hierarchy, patriarchy, and order
*absolute monarchy, autocracy, or theocratic government, although some suggest an algorithmic government or a corporatocracy

Sorry, there will be many losers from this, but there is simply no way, and probably no need, to save them.

We can control artificial limbs with just our brains now instead of the muscles around the amputation, we even have artificial skins that can sense touch, such as textures and temperature, and it won't be long until artifical limbs are better than our native ones.

So, would you be willing to surgically remove your limbs to replace them with superior artifical ones? To have faster, stronger legs that never get tired? Hands and fingers more dexterous and stronger than what we have now? Augmented eyes that can see vast distances with useful heads up information?

Or would you never remove a healthy limb or body part no matter how good an artificial part is?

Are you not wanting to commit to a full amputation and instead would prefer to augment the current body part or limb?

I'm legitimately interested in this question, as I really do see the near future of the human race as augmented humans/cyborgs, just like in popular science fiction such as the latest Deus Ex video games, where most of the technology on display seems very achievable by the games plot date of 2027.

Tesla autopilot has driven 130M miles which resulted in 1 fatality, whereas the American average is one fatality every 90M miles, while the world average is a staggering one fatality every 40M miles. 

But, i am not sure these figures are completely honest:

Out of those 130M miles, how many miles were driven by people completely removing their attention from the Road/System? 

If we take a rough estimate that right now, only around 25% of drivers trust the system enough to completely give it full unsupervised control for the entire drive (And this is an extremely beneficial estimate for self driving cars. the actual rate could be less than 5%), then we have a fatal accident as soon as ~32M miles per complete autonomous driving. if it's a more realistic 10%, we got a fatal accident as soon as 13M. again, remember the proposition - Tesla wants us to think 130M miles were driven completely inattentive. this is a ridiculous notion. if those rare trusting people let their system completely take over only in highways (Since the Tesla autodrive can't handle urban settings), that alone reduce the miles actually driven inattentive to less than 65M miles.

How many near fatal accidents were prevented at the last second because of human intervention? it takes only 1 one such instance to have the 1 every 130M miles becoming 1 every 65M miles, worse than the american rate. it takes only 2 such instances to extend the rate to 1 every 41 miles, coming close to the world terrible average. we have seen enough videos on Youtube to conclude the numbers are higher to the point where it could very well been hundreds of such instances.

how many Tesla cars where involved in fatal accidents where the driver took control at the last instant, thus disabling the autonomous driving element just too late to save their lives, but just in time to make the accident inspections conclude that the driver controlled his car at the instant of the accident? Remember, here, again, it takes only one instance to reduce the rate to below american average, and two instances to reduce it to a terrible world's average.

If you combine all these factors, the data right now might hint that the only reason Autonomous driving is supposedly safer, is because humans supervise it and prevent it from killing more. that the only reason Autonomous driving is supposedly safer, is because Tesla skewed with the numbers to show that it is.

Yes, Tesla autodriving system can, even now, prevent accidents from happening, the problem is that it can also cause accident that wouldn't have happened otherwise and if people were more trusting in the system, we would have seen far higher fatality rates.

So, what do you think, is my opinion correct in assuming that the Tesla's general figures that takes into account complete miles driven while the Autopilot was activated are irrelevant since the figures we need is the the actual Miles driven by the Autopilot inattentive? ",50,10

It's written by one of the authors of [The Futurist](http://futurist.typepad.com/) blog, which used to be quite active between about 2005-12 but hasn't been updated much in the past few years.

As I read it, the author's main point is that accelerating technological change is the driving force behind an entirely new type of deflation, and that central banks  need to start printing trillions of dollars now (and steadily increase the amount year by year) in order to keep the inflation rate at a healthy level and avert an economic depression.  He suggests that this printed money should  fund a stipend for everyone (in other words, a basic income) of $5,000 a year, and increasing thereafter as technology progresses.

Personally if this is correct, I think this could be a selling point for a basic income.  The main objection to UBI is the high taxes it would require, but if it's sourced through printed money instead (and if, as the author asserts, this printed money would not result in high inflation as was formerly the case) then the general public and policymakers might not be so averse to the idea of a UBI.",12,11

https://voxday.blogspot.com/2016/06/the-decline-of-entrepreneurship-in.html

The days of setting your own shop is now over.

What is happening is that the bigger companies get virtually zero percent interest rate, while smaller companies pay way higher rates. 

Plus, funding has gotten very stingy, while banks will shower money to proven giants who will pick up the failed startups , or even a bit successful ones, with virtually no cost.

Everything is now being concentrated into a few huge companies and the rest will fight for ever-dwindling scraps. Promising companies will be picked up for less than a billion, like Demis Hassabis' Deepmind which was sold to Google for $500 mil, which is not bad but still short of becoming a world figure status.

In fact that has changed the focus of new startups; their objectives now are not becoming the next Sergei Brin, but making a company which could be bought out by the likes of Sergei Brin as high as possible.

The cost of insurance, advertising, and various regulations have risen to prohibitive levels as well. Big companies can negotiate their deals and cut these costs as well.

In short, the whole situation is like Rockefeller getting a rebate for the shipping of other oil companies' stuff.  By 1910 the entire supply of oil around the world was controlled by three families; the Rockefellers, the Nobel family (the two older brothers of the Nobel Prize founder) who controlled the Baku oil fields in the Caspian Sea, and Calouste Gulbenkian, who controlled all of the oil in the middle east. (This arrangement ended because the Russian Revolution kicked out the Nobels from Baku, and the fall of the Ottomans robbed Gulbekian his power (he spent the rest of his life collecting art). As a result we only talk about Nobel when Nobel Prizes are awarded and we don't really talk about Gulbenkian much. It was a black swan event which is unlikely to be repeated in today's world.)


Entrepreneurship dies, and all the innovations will be directed by the giants according to how they see it fit.",76,49

If we look back than we will see that the change happened in fields where the technology was ready for practical application.
I tried to think about it in terms of everyday problems that we are ready to solve.

**Here is my list**:

* Human Resource management revolution
&gt;	Blockchain technology could make possible ""honest recommendations"".
&gt;	Imagine if you could find people based on recommendations (started from high school and common around the world) from other people and all of theme are stored in immutable database.
&gt;	It will remove HR specialists, you just need to look for who recommended your employee, and what is the ""status""  of recommender.

* Remote meetings
&gt;	Now we already can work out of the office. 
&gt;	But face to face comunication is still the most effective way of communication.
&gt;	Virtual reality will make remote meeting more effective and realistic.

* Everyday routines automatization
&gt;	Internet of things are already in our lives, and there are already critical mass of apps exist.
&gt;	I think it will boost in next 2 years on how we manage all around us: cars, appliances, gadgets...

* Delivery services
&gt;	Drones are already tested by amazon.
&gt;	We just need delivery services start using them.	

* Self driving cars
&gt;	Tesla and google cars.
&gt;	It's just a matter of time when it will become popular.

And what is your list? 
It's also interesting to see a list where the ""next big thing"" already happened for the last 2 years.",13,7

I just wonder - if we are so much into space travel, why would a human not travel to the moon first before Mars mission ? 

I Mean - we have no real evidence that Human was actually on the Moon. I wonder why nobody even talks about moon missions ? Shouldn't we first colonize Moon to explore space further? Shouldn't we do it 'again' just to prove even if it was hollywood mystification 50 years ago we are now able to do so without bigger effort ? 

We are all so excited about Mars manned missions, but for now it seems just to be a fairy tale... 

It's hard to believe there will bee manned mission to the mars if nobody has visited moon during my lifetime.. 

What do you guys think ? Is it only about money or there's a deeper reason why nobody plans manned Moon mission. 

From wikipedia I can see there are actually some plans about it - but nothing confirmed and why would space agencies plan first to enter orbit rather than land? If humanity would do that 50 years ago - why is this so difficult with current technology?  I am almost sure humanity has never left earth's orbit (SO ISS is our greater achievement), What do you think?

Just a food for thought. Its one area that won't ever be in concept ""automated"" by robots. Even if it doesn't come through as a field, it will be my hobby once Im unemployed thanks to my robot overlords. ",14,16

428,2016-7-6,2016,7,6,16,4rhf1t,A wager about the potential of artificial intelligence in our lifetime,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4rhf1t/a_wager_about_the_potential_of_artificial/,jasonrohrer,1467791340,"On the evening of July 14, 2015, on the sidewalk of G St. in Davis, California, /u/Preece and I were debating our expectations for the future of artificial intelligence.

He believes that real AI will come easily within our lifetimes, and I do not believe it will come (possibly never, and definitely not in our lifetimes).

In trying to nail down what ""real AI"" means, and how we'd actually measure it, and to get beyond ""I'd know it when I saw it,"" and to be sure that we're not already there already (AlphaGo?), we proposed the following 20-year wager.

By **July 12, 2035**, will the following have occurred?

**A machine will learn to master a non-trivial task, that it was not designed to perform, at or exceeding the best available human capability at that same task.**

**""Non-trivial"" is defined as a task that would take an average, adult human novice more than one year to master, where such a human master could consistently outperform an average human who had spent only half a year learning to perform the same task.**

If this statement is true by the above deadline, I will pay /u/Preece five ounces of 99.9% pure gold, and if it is not true by the deadline, /u/Preece will pay me five ounces of pure gold instead.

This wager is meant to capture a certain type of adaptability and generality that humans have, and that AI systems so far do not seem to have.  AI systems outperform human capabilities in many domains, but only where domain-specific systems have been designed by hand.

The tasks that humans were ""designed"" to perform, like tracking moving objects visually, are not even generally counted as intelligence, but merely reflex.

Thus the phrase **that it was not designed to perform** is the crux of this wager.",21,3

I'm really interested in both people's thoughts on the need for this kind of tech, and hopefully insight into what's currently holding us back from achieving it. To be clearer, I'm thinking about laparoscopic style medical tools that could be shrunk down to a MUCH smaller size. I've seen a couple of 'needlescopic' tools which are great too, but can we really still not go smaller? With 3D printing, can we not easily get down to a scale to deal with the smallest joints in the body yet? Why not? Do 3D printers simply not have that scale of resolution yet? There are so many potential surgeries that could be done so easily if we just had small enough tools. I'm not talking about nanotech here, just highly miniaturised somewhat dextrous tools.",0,5

In reaction to the events of June 30, 2016, I had a lot of thoughts about the future of autonomous vehicles. (It's also interesting because I talk about what the link on the front page talks about) I really wanted to have a large discussion and share my own thoughts as well as hear other people's. I did make a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/SAQpb_7EI18) talking about all of that, but this seriously isn't a self-promotion post as I'll be posting the script I was going off of down below. I really want to hear other people's opinions and I'd love for some comments on mine.


Hi my name is Dylan Hong and lets talk about autonomous vehicles. For those of you who dont know, on June 30th, Tesla released a statement on their blog titled A Tragic Loss. This statement covered information pertaining to a death that occurred while a Tesla owner was using autopilot to drive the vehicle.


According to Tesla, this was the first known fatality in just over 130 million miles where Autopilot was activated. Among all vehicles in the US, there is a fatality every 94 million miles. Worldwide, there is a fatality approximately every 60 million miles. While this shows that current autonomous driving technology is clearly able to reduce errors, this amount is not yet enough. On average, the the public will trust autonomy once the rate of error is about one tenth the rate of that of a person. This roughly means that society will fully trust autonomous vehicles once out of every billion miles driven there are one or fewer fatal accidents.


Looking at the computer program, you might think, how did autopilot drive perfectly well for over 100 miles then somehow eventually slip up? In the case of this accident, the variables lined up to make it a perfectly imperfect situation where autopilot could not detect the trailer that the car eventually crashed into. In this statement from Tesla we read, What we know is that the vehicle was on a divided highway with Autopilot engaged when a tractor trailer drove across the highway perpendicular to the Model S. Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied. The high ride height of the trailer combined with its positioning across the road and the extremely rare circumstances of the impact caused the Model S to pass under the trailer, with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S.


If you look at all of the variables that resulted in the crash, you begin to realize that everything really did have to line up for this accident to become non-preventable. This model of analyzing error is called the swiss cheese model Imagine all of those variables as slices of swiss cheese. The holes in each slice are the small but important values those variables could hold to cause an error. When you stack all of these slices on top of each other, the holes start getting covered up because where there is a hole in one slice, the next slice will cover it up. But somewhere, as small as it may be, there a place on the stack of cheese where you can see completely through it, a place where all the holes line up. And unfortunately, this fatal crash was that little open spot. Had the tractor been brown, if it was a cloudy day, if the trailer was slightly lower the ground, or if any of the countless of other variables been slightly altered, the outcome might not have been the same.


There has been a lot of discussion about who deserves the blame for the crash. Some are saying that its Teslas fault because they released software that is not prepared to handle all situations, but is good enough to give users false confidence. Others are saying that its the fault of the driver for not listening to the multiple warnings prompted by auto-pilot saying that the user must still pay attention to his or her surroundings and that the user is responsible for the vehicle even when autopilot is engaged. There are also messages that tell the user to be ready to take over at any time.


When errors like this one occur, were able to actually see where things go wrong so future development can account for things like the placement of sensors, the field of view, the amount of contrast in colors that will register with the camera as an object. While its extremely unfortunate that a death occurred we will learn from it and future users of the technology will be safer because of it. While I feel nothing but empathy and remorse for those personally affected by the loss, this terrible accident may spark the development of additional features that end up saving countless lives in the future.


Self driving cars are going to become the standard. Theyll also eventually have error rates of less than 1 death per billion miles driven. But as with every drastic leap in transportation technology we will be made aware of errors through failures that could result in the loss of life.


Autonomous vehicles will be here, but their road to mass adoption will not be easy. Aside from figuring out technical errors, we need to figure out moral issues as well. When a self driving car is put in a situation where there is no outcome where everybody lives what should it do? If it does one action it could save the driver, but end up killing 5 people. If it saves the people it could end up killing the owner of vehicle. Whos life is more valuable? If you think about it, these self driving vehicles that ultimately make road travel much safer, must also be designed to kill.
My point in saying this is that, as many lives as fully autonomous cars will save, the legislative process will take longer than it will for the technology to be ready. And we cant let unfortunate but inevitable errors slow down the process even longer. If we do, we will not be pointlessly losing lives because of innovative technology, but we will be unnecessarily losing lives because our society was not ready to embrace this technology.


But this has all been my opinion. Id really love to know all of your thoughts, if theyre the same, different, or variations of mine. Comment down below to keep the discussion going, and Ill try to communicate back to as many people as I can. This has been a different style video, but I hope you enjoyed the discussion. Im Dylan Hong of Dylan Hong Tech.

TL;DR Self driving cars will be here and we can't let tragic errors slow us down",3,5

1. A problem arises that many people struggle with.
2. Those people band together and establish systems and communities to support each other. 
3. Those communities grow over time and develop various traditions or practices, languages, habits, etc. 
4. A cure arises for the problem, and people reject it for fear of ruining their culture that originally served to help them and their struggle. 

For example: [The backlash against Cochlear Implants as something that ruins the deaf community](http://www.deafau.org.au/info/policy_cochlear.php). 

In other words, we have long talked on this subreddit and others about the amazing technological advances we are seeing in medicine and physiological research. With these advances, will we see more opposition from those who have developed communities? If we could instantly cure addictive behaviour, would groups and agencies fight against it to preserve their purpose? If we cure paralysis or supplement it with spinal taps and robotics, will [people and agencies](http://www.wheelchairsportsfederation.org/) object to the sudden end to wheelchair use?

I have come to find that communities raised in support for people who need it are fearful of become unneeded, and will advocate for reasons to still exist or stigmatize those who accept treatment. Will society be the thing that stands in the way of progress, or will people be so awed by science and medicine that they change their opinions? ",48,21

I've seen a lot around the difficult issues around self-driving cars and inevitable crashes with humans and animals etc., most of which seem to have been written by speculators who have, in an attempt to simplify the discussion have over simplified and made it more complicated. For example suggesting that there is going to be a [line of people jump out and cover all bits of road before a car can react](http://hothardware.com/ContentImages/NewsItem/37826/content/moral_machine.jpg) and brake is somewhat unrealistic when traveling according to the laws of the road. As a software developer I've been thinking about this issue a lot and have come up with what I think is a **simple and easily to interpret set of priorities for a driver-less car when entering an ""inevitable collision"" situation** which provide a solid base with which to start (i.e. the car is going to hit something, it is just *what* it is going to hit that is in question). These could then be broken down further if necessary. Here is my 5 stage ""life preservation law"" which I will then break down and explain further in a minute:

**Life Preservation Priority 1: The Passengers**

**Life Preservation Priority 2: Human Bystanders**

**Life Preservation Priority 3: Causal Humans**

**Life Preservation Priority 4: Emotionally Attached Animals**

**Life Preservation Priority 5: Other animals**

Now, i must add **6 assumptions and rules** to how this must be implemented... 

Firstly, **driver-less cars don't make mistakes**. And by that i mean that if you had a load of enclosed roads with no humans/animals and only driver-less cars there would be no crashes (or at least only a negligible amount due to poor maintenance of physical parts etc.). Obviously I am not saying we are in this situation yet, but Im thinking about 50 years (maybe not even that long) into the future when the technology and processing power will be fairly standard.

Secondly, **driver-less cars have the ability to ""see"" 10 seconds worth of road ahead (considerably further than it would need to break to a stop)**

Thirdly, **the people/person (including objects containing humans e.g. driven cars) you are going to hit if the car was to continue normally, are defined as the ""causal humans""**

Fourthly, **People who would otherwise not be hit by the car if it continued on its path are defined as the ""Human Bystanders""**

Fifthly **the ""Passengers"" become the ""Causal Humans"" in the event that a car malfunctions due to a physical defect which causes the AI driver to lose control. For example, a poorly maintained tyre wears through and ruptures doing 80mph along a motorway, the passengers would then become the causal humans and cede top priority to human bystanders**

Finally and probably most importantly, **the life preservation priorities must be assigned at the time the car decides evasive action due to a change in surroundings may be necessary, and those assigned priorities may not change until the evasive manoeuver is completed.**

So now for the reasoning...

The Passengers: The passengers above all else must have top life priority in the eyes of the car when the accident is not their fault (See assumption and rule 4 for times when it is). Now I know there are studies which state that most people would accept a ""greater good"" approach, however I think this would change greatly once driver-less cars become more accessible... If you bought a car and signed a Ts&amp;Cs agreement which said: ""in the event of an inevitable collision you agree to allow the car to prioritise the lives of those outside the car if it deems it to be in the greater good, because lawsuits"" would you sign that? I certainly wouldn't. You buy cars with high safety ratings with the expectation that if the worst happens you and your family will have the best chance of survival. People just won't buy cars that prioritise someone else's life over theirs. We are survivalist creatures after all.

Human Bystanders: These get the second life priority because they have essentially got nothing to do with the situation. They are not the direct cause of the inevitable collision and they are conforming to all road laws or standard conventions (i.e. pavements are for people, roads are for cars). They are not at fault and therefore deserve to have life preserved. The likelihood of death for people assigned this priority would, in most cases, be less than that of passengers as they are the highest prioritised external party.

Causal Humans: These people have the lowest human priority. They are essentially the thing that caused the car to make an exception to its normal driving process and, if a human must be killed (i.e. all other options for no human deaths are exhausted) the ones at fault unfortunately should take the punishment if there is no other alternative option with a lower life preservation level.

Emotionally attached animals: Obviously require a higher priority than livestock for example as it has the ability to affect humans, but not as important as other human life

Other Animals: wild animals, unfortunately are not as important in as all the above... and livestock can be insured so there would be minimal financial losses.

**I have yet to think of a situation where in a somewhat realistic event this wouldnt pick the most appropriate outcome in the majority of cases. However I would like to see what people here think of this and if you can think of situations where this would not be fair if applied. Please also suggest any potential amendments you think may be suitable and state a reason.**

[In-depth],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4rpzn6/sexbots_and_usage_to_teach_disabled_adults_about/,SubaruToyotaFan1986,1467914704,"I was reading [this discussion on sexbots](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3vldir/sexbot_timeline_predictions/) and [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/39nygo/realdoll_invests_in_ai_for_future_sexbots_that/) and it made me think of one other use for them - aside from sex?

Could a sexbot [as much as this term sounds inappropriate in this context - but it's the term people are using] be useful for teaching disabled adults [mostly adults with autism spectrum disorder/Asperger's Syndrome] about sex and relationships?

It would not be as a replacement for them having a relationship with a real live human being but as a safe way without the risks of harm, violence etc. [especially for those who are more severe on the autism spectrum].

The pros and cons of it:

For

- Safe way for adults to learn about how to go on an actual date with someone without physical harm or risk [similar to how we train pilots in flight simulation before they take to the real airspace]

- Could be used to teach adults about social skills etc.

- Technology is a common interest amongst individuals with ASD [Patricia Howlin 2004] so this may appeal to them.

- Good publicity for the robot manufacturer, on a PR level.

- Robots could be made in different specifications/looks - Caucasian, Asian, African etc. [racial skintones/colours] etc. based on designs of individuals etc.

Against:

- The hypothetical service user could become addicted to the technology [but this is also true of non-autism spectrum individuals, however due to technology being a common interest amongst people with ASD [Howlin 2004] this is an issue] and not want an actual relationship with a person.

- Some may not want a relationship with a human and prefer the robot [there was an article in The Mirror today about sexbots, but in the context of a survey, not disability].

- Service user may become obsessed with sexbot [some adults with ASD may become obsessed with particular person. Source: Patricia Howlin, 2004]

- It may take a long time to program the robot to the needs of the charity / organization etc.

- How to prevent the robot[s] from damage [service user anger/aggression etc.]?

- Controversial as an idea already.

I know there is a precedent - the film Lars and the Real Girl involves a plastic doll rather than a sexbot.

Obviously this will not be useful for all levels of individual on the ASD spectrum but it could be useful in some ways.

What are your thoughts on this?

This is when what you already know is capable of meaning something entirely different than you suspect - the pieces are all in place for a drastic technological revolution, but it simply never occurred to anyone to put them together in that pattern.

All inventors to some extent operate in this domain: After all, Thomas Edison did not invent the screwdrivers and metal wires used in his shops, nor did Henry Ford invent the automobile.  Rather, they saw a present set of technologies and considered the potential implications - what could be done with it that would have broad societal impact?

There is no inherent reason why electricity *had* to become a part of everyone's daily life, lighting their homes and towns, powering their climate control systems and appliances, etc.  It could have remained a way to power big factories, and the smaller applications might simply have been ignored.  But because someone noticed the possibility and pursued it, civilization was considerably altered as a whole due to a seemingly frivolous effect involving magnets.

The same could be said of Henry Ford - he was not the creator of the automobile, just one of its more prolific enthusiasts and tinkerers.  But rather than obsessing on perfecting each and every component and flourish of his product, as his competitors did, which kept cars as baroque luxury items, he looked to the outside context: The machine that makes the machine.  It was all in plain sight, but yet nobody saw it - the worlds of improvement that could be had by changing the production *process* even if all else remained the same.

That insight produced generations of continuous expansion and improvement, and are the reason why ""motorcars"" are the default form of transport in the United States rather than remaining a symbol of affluence.  Ford's inspiration altered the design, development pattern, and economics of the entire United States, simply by expanding the scope of his engineer's eye from the product itself to the process of making it.

The most profound, most ancient example we could give is Imhotep of Old Kingdom Egypt - he who directly preceded, if not *caused*, the age of the great pyramid-building in Eypt.  He was a polymath, as such people tend to be, with many subjects of interest, but at some point it interested him to apply his math skills to the design of grand structures for the King, Djoser.

Before this time,  Egyptian ""cities"" were little more than huddles of mud huts by the river with some better-looking stuff on top of slightly higher ground.  All of it was low to the ground, and while it may have had some figures painted or carved, they would have been much simpler than we recognize from later works.  

Rather than attempting to build a single gargantuan wall that would likely collapse under its own weight, Imhotep got the idea of using the roof one building as the foundation of another, smaller one.  When that seemed to work, he went for yet a third top of the second building, and had apparently discovered that things could be built like this.  

Compared to later projects, the result [the Step Pyramid of Djoser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser) is not exactly breath-taking, despite still being impressive.  But it proved to Imhotep and, more importantly, the Kingdom that he had discovered new possibilities to glorify their king and please the gods.  These methods could be pursued over time and honed to unforeseen degrees of precession, leading ultimately to the Great Pyramids of Giza and all the other forms of architecture that have proceeded from architectural revolution he sparked.

It's important to state that Egypt before Imhotep was not particularly advanced even by its own standards - a river kingdom with some mudhuts and some stone buildings, beautiful but not extensive.  Djoser together with Imhotep began the tradition of massive public mobilization toward a central architectural goal, analogous to the Manhattan Project, which proceeded well after their deaths and achieved results that would have had them in awe could they have seen them.

Egyptian civilization was changed for *thousands* of years because of Imhotep's experiments with sticking rooms on top of each other, eventually putting it so far high above all other societies on Earth at the time that had it no real competitor until finally overthrown by Alexander *thousands of years* later.  Imhoteps insights redefined not just Egyt, but the world; and not just the world of his own present, but the world cascading across thousands of years.

Stepping beyond the immediate possibilities for Tesla: Autonomous, affordable electric cars; and that for SpaceX; affordable, safe, regular human spaceflight to Mars and other accessible world; which analogy seems most appropriate?  Musk is indeed just tweaking things that already exist -his companies are most definitely not making any fundamental technological discoveries.  He, like Ford, is indeed increasingly focused on revolutionizing the machine that makes the machine, and will change a quite a lot in the process - but far can he go, and how far will he go?

When, as he has discussed, he had made car production so massive in size, so internally efficient, and colossal compared to any other factories in history, that they appear to human observers like ""alien juggernauts""; when the outpout of these systems is occurring at such speeds that they arrive with the shockwave of a tsunami on the market.  How far will he go then?

Will he begin further climbing his own supply chain, perhaps buying raw materials mining companies like Alcoa to have control over the raw feedstocks that go into the machines?  Buy the companies that transport the material to the factories?  Buy the companies that make the trucks, or start building their own industrial trucks for their mining and transport operations?  Etc. etc.

If the businesses themselves can keep going, there are no limits to their scope or scale, because Elon Musk is not a fan of conservative business strategies: For him, the purpose is the accomplishment, and money is merely the means.  So again, *how far can he go*?

If the world is blessed with another 50 years of this guy in adition, with this or greater levels of money at his disposal, what does that world become?

When I imagine it, as skeptically as possible, I nonethelss have a picture quite dizzyingly exotic.  Earth 2100, transformed by Elon Musk and all his technological and business progeny, is as beyond today as a few mud huts ona  river in Imhotep's childhood were compared to the Gteat Pyramids of Giza standing above the Empire of the Gods that his grand-children might have known.  

It's staggering.  When you chase one implication, you find ten more.  So I think comparin Musk to Henry Ford and Steve Jobs is valid, I think it misses the point: His significance is not limited to a current trend, or even to a current industry - the way he is doing things has the potential to transformation the structure of civilization; not just where it physically exists (i.e., with space travel), and how it moves (i.e., self-driving E.V.s), how it powers itself (solar panels), but all the ways that every other aspect of civilization rearranges itself to work with these changes.

Imagining a ""Great Pyramid"" time period a couple of centuries from now when all of this has universally adopted and all its deep possibilities explored for incremental improvements - a time when the technology is mature - who knows the set of possibilities will be then?

You never know what you'll see from a mountain top.  All you know is that's amazing, and worth the climb.  ",23,109

In short, it was a cost cutting measure that theoretically allowed for democracy to be made cheaper.

However, representative democracy has its flaws. The loss in granularity caused by the reduction of sample size means smaller groups tend to be underrepresented in decisions. Representatives able to afford more advertising stifle opponents unable to do the same, limiting the pool of possible representatives to well-off people. Personal interests of representatives can differ from those who elected them, and the difficulty of overthrowing a representative reduces the barrier for corruption and the repercussions of lying in order to get elected. In addition, more recently wealth concentration has allowed groups to influence these representatives to promote their own interests through ~~bribing~~ lobbying as well as campaign financing, to a point where representatives no longer represent their voters. Citizens have mostly stopped paying attention to politics as they boil down their decisions on issues to be called by the politicians they choose instead of the other way around or realize they don't have any viable representative choices matching their interests.

Faster and cheaper communications have removed the need of representatives and thus the reason for a representative democracy, meaning we can transition to a better form of government (whose form or implementation is outside of this discussion's scope). However, This form of government has been too deeply ingrained to allow an easy transition away from it, especially as this would remove power from actors currently holding it, making not allowing this to occur in their best interest.

Historically, government changes have been made through conflict, either through military takeover or through revolution.  The former tends to lead to either a dictatorship(in case of a coup) or to colonialism or alternatively the same form of government previously held by the winning faction in case of a war. The latter has the shortfall of attempting to prioritize solving whatever caused a revolution to happen in the first place, without focusing on what happens long-term, usually causing that government's downfall some time later. In addition, the potential for a revolution has been stopped by the effectiveness of tools the insurgents have no or limited access to - the human advantage revolutionaries have just doesn't cut it when the faction in power has technologies enabling them to defeat a revolution despite not having a manpower advantage. We're currently having such a tipping point with the introduction of robotized forces and information warfare. A machine gun or tank doesn't make distinctions on who is using it, but drones can be made to self-destruct in case of capture denying the opponents tools they could use to further their cause. In addition, advanced individual tracking enables governments to stop revolutions before they even start by silencing dissidents before they reach critical mass.",14,15

Many times in our history the reigning scientific truth has been cast into doubt or at least minimized due to the introduction of new, often more generalized theories. These theories brought us from old notions of the 'universe' as a 2D land mass to the newest theories involving the concept of a multiverse. In 1900 Lord Kelvin said ""There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.""(http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Kelvin.html). He might have been wrong in 1900 but his two sentences map out my question well. Do you guys think we, or any species for that matter, could reach such a point where no new discoveries are ever to be made?

There was an interesting article in US News a while back about the PBS/BBC program ""The 1900 House"". 

It compared the labor saving and entertainment gadgets in the 1900 house with those found in an ""Ozzie and Harriet"" house in 1950, and with a modern 2000 house. Interestingly, while the 1950 house would come as a major surprise to the Victorians of 50 years earlier, there is very little aside from a PC that Ozzie and Harriet wouldn't recognize in a 2000 house. The conclusion, all the really big innovations in consumer goods, entertainment and productivity occurred in the first half of the 20th century. The second half saw little more than incremental improvements - e.g. compare the *invention* of the TV with the *improvements* of color TV or Cable. The Victorians would not know what a TV is, but Ozzie and Harriet would recognize even a modern TV as a better version of their own TV. 

Moral of the story: true innovations - new things - may be running out of steam, leaving us with only improvements of existing devices.

Basically, it seems much easier to simulate something than it is to actually create it, so why not just do that? I think that given the current rate of technological advancement, we should have access to the technology capable of doing this fairly soon. Also, since once a species has decided to just ""hook"" themselves up to a simulation, they would essentially be dead to everyone else, this could also be used to explain the Fermi Paradox (although the fact that I have never heard of this theory in relation to extraterrestrial life suggests that there is an apparent flaw in it, since I'm assuming I'm not the first person to have considered this).

I've recently thought a bit about how this could be implemented, and realised that there might be a problem. Basically, I don't imagine the majority of people are going to willingly give up their ""real"" life to live in a simulation. On the other hand, if we actually develop the capacity to do this, it's pretty much going to be a solution to all of our problems: no more overpopulation, limited resources, etc. so it seems like there would be a lot of incentive to get it going. 

So anyway, what are your thoughts on this?


**TL;DR: Simulating a perfect world seems much easier than creating one, and theoretically could be done. If a species decides to fully implement it, they would essentially appear dead to everyone else, providing a *possible* solution to the Fermi Paradox. On the other hand, it doesn't really seem like something people would be willing to accept.**",18,2

The thing about this is that protests don't bring back the dead. Even in the rare circumstance that a cop is punished, it still does not bring back the dead.

All this can be avoided with the invention of a modern non-lethal weapon that has the advantages of a gun. So instead of demonizing and politicizing, let's discuss this like real inventors and engineers. (IF you can't handle the discussion without politicizing it, please do not participate.)

What are the advantages of a gun, from the cop's point of view?
1 It instantly incapacitates the target so they cannot return fire.
2 It is accurate from a distance.
3 It is easy to use.
4 It is inexpensive enough for all police departments.
5 (edit) It needs to have multiple shots, like a gun instead of just one shot.

In order for our new technology to be accepted by police, it needs to have the same advantages. What possible technologies could meet these needs? Here are some suggestions:

1 paintball-like weapon, but with fast-acting paralytic chemical. The chemical would need to evaporate quickly or it would be a risk to responders. Also if it is too effective then the target would die from heart-lung paralysis. This needs to be fine-tuned.

2 Wireless taser-like weapon. The projectile contains a capacitor and 2 barbed prongs that short out as it enters the target's skin. This could be increased from normal taser levels of electrocution to ensure complete incapacitation. It could also be programmed to zap, pause, zap, pause, zap, pause to ensure continued incapacitation rather than brief incapacitation followed by immediate recovery.

Ok those are my ideas. What other ideas can you come up with?

Like a lot of you, I found the concept of accelerating returns perfectly logical and through various YouTube videos and blog posts I found my way here. Voila. *Perspective changed, man.*

Drug habits aside, it is a surprisingly pressing thought. And as I look at the downhill slope of 2016, I'm left wondering where we are on the longer timeline. It hasn't surprised me that 2016 has been so crazy. The logical process towards achieving constant progress is constantly accelerating progress. And that means more and more events. I wake up every day and roll over to see 10 or 15 notifications on my phone about all the batshit crazy things that happened overnight. It's weird. There's just something new every day. I expect days to be abnormal.

I'll stop droning on. What do you think? Is 2016 an outlier or just the first beast of its kind? What elements of this year are the most repeatable? How ""new"" do you think humanity's behavior has been this year?

The world wasted too much resources and too many capable people during the Great War, and somewhat more during World War 2. And after that, the cold war and the resulting attempts to win Third World to their side wasted additional resources.

We are only now advancing toward the next level of civilization. And the resources (rare earths, rare metals) are being wasted to make cheap phones for the Third World, for example.

All these talks of abundance are impractical (more on that later). Raw materials are the ultimate limiter, and there are only so much rare materials to go.

Plus the politics of devolution does not help, such as Brexit or the various exit movements now.

Even if we pool all of the earth's resources to reach the next level of civ, we may or may not make it. If the world does not unite there is no hope of reaching the next level of civ in my opinion.

This may be off topic, but UBI is a common subject here, so I thought this might fit.

Long ago, you worked 16+ hours a day just to feed yourself.  You would even have 10 kids just to work as farm hands because it was the only way to stay afloat.

Since then, we advanced our farming practices and we've evolved to the point where 1 farmer can feed hundreds of people.

We've filled our days with various new industries, but that river has begun to slow.

Now we have reached a turning point where we do not have 40 hours of productive work for every person to actually do.

So half of us work, half of use dont, income is divided.  The notion of those who work subsidizing those that dont seems like a reward for the lazy, and thus it is met with opposition.

So, why not reduce the work week to 20 hours before overtime kicks in, our income is halved, but instead of half of us working full time and getting half taxed for UBI, we all work half time.  It would be an adjustment for those that now earn less, but atleast you have more free time to wash the bitter pill down with.",25,1

Background - in the 1970s and 80s, many Japanese farmers had one or a few injection molding machines in a shed at the back of their farms, making 'extra' money - soon they were making more from those than the farm.

So, rather than Universal Basic Income, develop a program where every worker can acquire a robot that takes their job, and receive income from the use of the robot.  The first one would be 'free', paid for by government or corporate loans that are also tied to the robot.  They could have the option to buy more as time goes on.  This could work much like a home loan, since the robots might well have very long lifetimes and maintenance would be the responsibility of the company using it.

There is also a potential similarity to the way that railroad cars work in the US.  Many railroad freight car are owned by investors.  Railroad companies are required to pay rent on the car for the entire time it is on their track, whether they use it or not.

There are many ways to work this idea, suggestions encouraged.  This has the advantage of turning people into investors instead of just receiving a dole from the government, and could act instead of a 'payroll' tax on robots.  It would also reduce the capital requirements for companies to move to robotics, since these robots would be on some form of rental or pay as you go program.  I expect that consortia would be created to manage both the ownership end and the rental end of the system.",29,3

&amp;nbsp;

Nano-robots that travels to the past, copies every humans full life's memory from birth till death and DNA samples, sends information to the future, keep the mind in a virtual world or print a new body with all the memories and personality indistinguishable to the body that died as a perfect continuation. 

&amp;nbsp;

With this, you can collect the minds and information, being able to create 3D model of the earth where you can see what happened in any given moment in time in human history with 100% accuracy and resurrect not only every human who ever lived, but possibly even any animal and thinking creature in history that ever died which someone would wish to bring back and even everyone who is yet to be born.

&amp;nbsp;

If this turns out to be real, it means we will end up creating life after death, every single religion in the world is right and wrong at the same time and that you should not be afraid of death but still enjoy life and try to be good, as in the future you'll possibly be resurrected but they will probably watch your whole life as a movie to see if you are worthy of being resurrected.

&amp;nbsp;

Following both the logic of the ""Simulated Reality"" and the ""Infinite Multiverse"", and a simple example, it becomes easy to prove that everything virtual is still real even if everything physical turns out to be virtual.

&amp;nbsp;

Remember that your mind itself is virtual, so even if you fear that the ""revived you"" and the ""dead you"" are 2 different ""you's"", they are not, as you are not your body but an information construct called ""a mind"", so you are exactly the memories and personality being taken to the future, that is your ""real body"", your actual existence.

&amp;nbsp;

Imagine it like this: 


If you were inside a technology like the ""NerveGear"" presented in the ""SwordArt Online"" anime, where all your senses are sent inside the virtual realm with access to even pain, if someone were to be raped inside such a device, would it be a real rape or ""only a virtual one""?

&amp;nbsp;

Not enough? Okay, okay... one more example, in reverse this time. Virtual to Real

&amp;nbsp;

Imagine an artificial intelligence so advanced no one would notice it wasn't a human speaking at a microphone if talking to it. This A.I. then prints a 3D human body with a unique DNA created by itself but with an ""0 KM brain"" and than it makes an upload to this bodies brain... It feels, it loves, it hurts, it can die... can you seriously say that is not human? 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, the same but in the simulated reality would mean that at any moment, anyone of the race living in the ""above dimension"" could print us body of their same constitution and upload our minds to it, which would make us ""physical"" but not any more or less ""real"".

&amp;nbsp;

This raises a huge array of subjects that needs to be discussed for something like that to be ethical, as you would need to decide who is worthy of being ""resurrected"" to this world and who should stay in a ""virtual afterlife"" without knowing it.


The ""multiverse"" is but every single possible combination of information that could create a ""dimension"", be it a physical, imaginary or virtual one, even one that makes no sense at all, so everything you ever imagined, read or watched on TV was a separate dimension you just might be able to visit one day, when we can send our minds inside the virtual and travel the multiverse freely from inside a super-computer in this ""physical dimension"" we have lived in until now... 

&amp;nbsp;

What are your thoughts on it or what do you believe is important and should be considered towards this? 


What other subjects this affects, like philosophy or ethics? 


What do you believe is important to be said on this matter?",14,0

The Enclosure during the 17th century was a movement where large landowners kicked out tenant farmers, who either froze to death or became city laborers (and Gregory Clark has proven that their lines have died out), because raising sheep was more profitable.

The world is now being divided into two parts, the ones capable of following and profiting from all these changes happening around the world and those who can't and won't.

The major centers of civilization, Manhattan, the Bay Area, Orange County, Washington DC Area, areas around the HQs of Microsoft and other tech giants, Toronto, Vancouver and London and their surrounding areas are experiencing a superexplosion of real estate prices, forcing these cities to gentrify quickly and drive out anyone making less.

Trillions of dollars were released around the world and they were mostly claimed by the top 1%, and all these money have to go somewhere so they all go to inflate these important cities' prices beyond the reach of ordinary mortals.

Sorry, all these money has to go somewhere, and they will drive out the 99% farther and farther from the centers of civilization which will be the only places with 'decent' jobs are.

As lands with favorable views, enough water and less crowds get scarcer, and pollution and environment degradation reduce 'livable' areas, all the people with money will buy out the remaining desirable areas sooner or later if not already done so, and at the appointed time will drive out all the renters to the wilderness since doing so will be more profitable.

Expect the law and LEO to be silent on the eviction process. They will be kept a place as long as they are needed.

I expect to see all the civilized zones now owned by the cognitive elite and the richer class, with billions of people driven to barren and polluted land.

Doing so will increase the economic value of the gentrified zones, human costs not a consideration by those who handle money.

The masses sitting on the next targets of gentrification are no fools, and they are now fighting back. But how long, I don't know. Throughout history, landowners always won in the end.

Such gentrification will make neighborhoods safe and eliminate the risk of violence in the areas which do matter ; the ones driving civilization to the next stage can just watch the show, filmed by drones, in the 'taped-off' zones where 7 billion + of humanity have been driven off.

Some people might think it belongs to darkfuturology, but it is a great improvement over the present situation when the worthy people have to go thru lots of security to do anything, so it belongs here.",9,4

I've read a lot about the singularity, and most articles use Moore's law or some equivalent to extrapolate into the future.

However, why do we assume that this exponential growth does not have a ceiling? Microprocessors have already run into some quite problematic physical issues blocking their progression into getting even smaller or faster (like electrons quantum tunneling through isolating barriers).

As a different example, I've read articles extrapolating from the growth of harddisks and making predictions about storage capacities in 2025 and beyond. But even today we see the limits of platter speed and data density increasingly limiting this growth. Not to mention the fact that personal data doesn't grow nearly as fast as our capacity to store it.

Yes, new developments might take their place - optical or quantum computers, storage based on non-magnetic media (like SSD), etc. But even those will have pysical limits. There's a limited amount of data that can be stored per cubic nanometer; there's a light speed which will always limit our communication speed (although maybe not data rate), no matter if our speed approaching this limit is exponential.

That's not even taking into account the (hard to predict) effect on human society, when our ability to manipulate data and the real world outgrows our ability to use it in a meaningful or constuctive way (paraphrased more rudely: give a chimp a better hammer and he'll be even better at destroying things).

Also, I'm always reminded of the boundless optimism in the 80s about the development of AI, with many people predicting that we'd have an artificial consciousness before the year 2000. Of course we ran into obstacles and limits which we've only started to overcome a several decades later (like data availability and mining, fast global networks, realtime image recognition and processing, etc.). Or language translation, which still isn't very good (and there are [good reasons for that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAgp7nXdkLU)), and it won't be for quite some time, half a century after it was announced to be the best thing since sliced bread.

So why are people (even people who know what they're talking about) still so optimistic about achieving a singularity? In just a few decades?",18,0

I've google'd this and couldn't find anything about my concerns. So, I figured I would ask some Futurists. 


1. Do you think self-driving cars will be *enforced* any time within the next 50 years? 


2. Do you think older cars can/will be easily/afford-ably equipped with self-driving technology? 

Also, if you can inform me of any other concerns that I have not thought of, that would be great.


Thank you for your time.",21,8

About Local Roots Farms:

Local Roots designs, builds, and operates vertical modular farms in Los Angeles, CA.  We started almost 3 years ago, experimenting with hydroponic growing in our garage.  (No, not that kind of hydroponics!)   After many hours and failed experiments, we discovered that existing technology didn't give us the control we needed to grow plants with efficiency or consistency.  So we engineered our shipping container farming systems from the ground up to create a system that allows us to grow 365 days a year with 97% less water.  To date we have been focused on operating as a produce company, selling leafy greens to local fast casual chains.  However, we are about to launch public sales of our farming systems.  ",57,80

He wrote something on why he is quitting his twitter account, and said this:

&gt;I was once at a futurist debate where one of the speakers was ranting some technoutopian nonsense about how high-bandwidth brain to brain communication systems would revolutionize science and allow much faster progress. I remarked, not at all facetiously, that we already have such a system: Its called Twitter.

&gt;After all, its not the bandwidth or the ease of communications thats bottlenecking anything; 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;its a plain lack of the sort of very high-level intelligence that we increasingly need as the Flynn Effect grinds to a halt and we slam against the technological frontier.

&gt;Social media do almost nothing to extend it. Bandwidth is already superfluous, more than our Dunbar Number brain can handle anyway, and is swamped by a low signal-to-noise ratio besides. Admittedly, social media does probably make information marginally easier to find, but I would argue that Alexandra Elbakyans humble academic paper sharing/piracy project Sci-Hub by itself has already achieved at least as much for global intellectual progress as Facebook and Twitter combined.

&gt;Finally, by rewiring so many first class brains from deep analytical mode to dopamine-seeking wisecrack mode  Charles Murray and even (ironically) N. N. Taleb himself might be in the early stages of that  social media might have ultimately retarded progress. This is not to even mention the considerable cognitive effort that has been expended directly to develop and maintain Facebook and its various clones and applications like Farmville, Mafia Wars, etc. as well as Twitter, Instagram, etc. 

&gt;It certainly pales besides the epochal misallocation of cognitive resources that is the modern financial sector, but it is probably quite considerable nonetheless.

It is true that the greatest minds of today are going into the finances where they design even more elaborate schemes to make money, while the tech things are left from folks who had crossed the pacific (or, increasingly less, the atlantic).

A commenter replied this:

&gt;Things have changed since that time. Nowadays German
universities are unable to attract enough students interested
in majoring in physics or computer science  a worldwide
phenomenon in the industrialized countries. 

&gt;Even Caltech has problems. 

&gt;Back in the 60s in California the student activists
started referring to scientists as whores servicing the military-
industrial complex, and this appellation has stuck, helped
by the environmental movement (e.g., the famous line Plastics
in the 1967 movie The Graduate. Better Living Through Chemistry
- my foot!). 

&gt;Today many (non-Asian) students are repelled by
science for moral reasons, and even the Silicon Valley is acquiring
a penumbra of evil

Unfortunately, Asians of all flavors tend to do well in set-piece situations but are not well known for their creativity. They improve an existing thing well but do not really make new theories, new gadgets, etc. 

Which makes me very concerned about completing the last leg of the journey to Civ 2.0. People like Kurzweil, Diamandis or Musk are showmen; they don't really make anything themselves. They instruct others to make the stuff they imagine and ... it might be possible that whatever the end result might fall short of the Promised Land.",17,0

I think this weakens the US and is a losing strategy (or no strategy at all).

I got to thinking. What if we were given the chance to directly choose, in broad terms, what our tax dollars were spent on instead of leaving that to a congress that cant seem to agree on anything? Take individual senator/representatives ideologies out of the picture. Elected officials still generate policy and allocate funds for their areas of responsibility, but we choose where the money goes. If an elected official can make a strong enough case to convince voters that their department needs and deserves the funds, they get the monies. Maybe it divided up by the current cabinet departments or something. Each citizen would fill out a form each year when submitting tax documents what his/her choices would be for the coming fiscal year.

My first thought is that the entrenched moneyed powers that be that reap huge benefits from our tax dollars with questionable benefit to the US citizen would object strongly. 

My second thought is that most of the electorate doesnt know or care enough to do research on their own to make an informed decision, but a feller can dream, cant he?

Do you think that each department would get about the same or some very different amount of cash?

For example, Anthem by Ayn Rand. It's a communist dystopian future, but eventually one guy breaks out and makes a new colony with a woman to start a freer society. As another example, Soylent Green just has me thinking, ""Yes, if the human race reaches carrying capacity, then people have to die/be cannibalized"". 


Basically, anything short of the earth itself being swallowed by the sun doesn't really have me worried. But that's just because my mind thinks in terms of ""will humanity stay like this forever?"" Brave New World? Nope. Total extinction? Yeah that one's permanent. 


But I think others don't share my logic. I feel like other people worry more about the fact that people will die in the process or that entire generations will live in misery, whereas I don't care as long as humanity has a shred of hope to survive. I don't believe that we're constantly working towards a utopia where everyone lives forever and is happy, so to me it's all a matter of who gets the pain and for how long, not a 0-sum game. 




tldr: My argument in a little treatise is basically ""well humanity will definitely survive X so no need to worry about X being the apocalypse"". This is in a particular case where X would easily be resolved within a generation, but may cause some chaos in the meantime. But will that argument actually hold up against others?",3,2

However, some people are saying that the end of cheap oil and the abundance of plenty but expensive and hard-to process fossil fuels would hurt civilization.

In another subreddit I talked about triage and increasing control to 'hold the fort'.

Until now, the emphasis was 'more' for 'everyone'. 

As I have written before, the necessity to conscript colonials during the Great War was the beginning of the end of Western Prosperity, and although the trend is finally reversing, it might be too little, too late.

I think it is time to reduce social services, aid to the third world, migrations, etc and concentrate all the available resources to advance tech, in other words take a pro-civilization policy to reach the goal of Transcendence (i.e. singularity, Civilization 2.0, etc).

It is probably necessary to convince the world that there are no more 'free lunch', and no more aspiring for 'western middle-class life'. The people who are stuck in miserable existences have to be convinced to accept their lot that the 'good jobs' will never come back and a lot of the stuff will be automated.

Basic Income , etc are just bribes to keep people from rebelling. I think the general public will be militarily insignificant and there will be no need to do BI, although people like Chris Langan (pre-discovery) could be identified and given help.

Nothing can escape the low EROI (Energy return on investment, i.e. putting 1 unit of energy to get 10 units of that has an EROI of 10:1). Modern civilization exploded when we had an EROI of 50:1 or even 100:1, and it is slowing down when our EROI is now down to about 15:1.

What use is regenerating even an anatomically perfect limb if we can't do this? If the nerves aren't properly connected, all those perfect new muscles will just suffer permanent neurogenic atrophy.  I know people look at plugging directly into the motor cortex, and yes, this will yield some sort of control, but I don't think it could ever be comparable to the way our limbs are naturally connected and the level of coordination/dexterity they offer. What do you think of the problems an adult would face with this vs a child? Could we find a way to tap into existing motor coordination patterns in the brain, or is there no way of avoiding the person having to completely relearn new coordination for their replacement arm?

I'm not talking about prosthetic limbs here (though techniques used in one may very well apply to the other).

The future looks bright, except when it doesnt. Here are 10 exceptionally regrettable developments we can expect in the coming decades.



Listed in no particular order.

1. Virtually anyone will be able to create their own pandemic

Earlier this year, Oxfords Global Priorities Project compiled a list of catastrophes that could kill off 10 per cent or more of the human population. High on the list was a deliberately engineered pandemic, and the authors warned that it could happen in as few as five years.



Illustrated version of Steven Kings The Stand (Image: Marvel Comics)

Many of the technologies for this prospect are starting to appear, including the CRISPR/cas9 gene-editing system and 3D-bioprinters. Whats more, the blueprints for this kind of destruction are being made available. A decade ago, futurist Ray Kurzweil and technologist Bill Joy scolded the US Department of Health for publishing the full genome of the 1918 influenza virus, calling it extremely foolish. More recently, a number of scientists spoke out when Nature decided to publish a so-called gain of function study explaining how the bird flu could be mutated into something even deadlier.

The fear is that a rogue state, terrorist group, or a malign individual might create their own virus and unleash it. Natural selection is good at creating nasty and highly prolific viruses, but imagine what intentional design could concoct.

2. People who transfer their minds to computers are actually killing themselves

One of the more radical visions of the future is a world in which biological humans have traded-in their corporeal bodies in favour of a purely digital existence. This would require a person to literally upload their mind to a supercomputer, but this hypothetical process might actually result in the permanent destruction of the original person. It would be a form of unintentional suicide.



Ben Kingsley having his mind transfered in Selfless.

This is whats known as the continuity of consciousness problem. Sure, we may eventually be able to cut, copy, and paste the essence of a persons personality and memories to a digital substrate, but transferring the seat of consciousness itself may be an untenable proposition. Neuroscientists know that memories are parked in the brain as physical constructs; theres something physically there to copy. But consciousness still eludes our understanding, and were not certain how it arises in the brain, let alone how we can transfer it from point A to point B. Its also quite possible that subjective awareness cannot be replicated in the digital realm, and that its dependent on the presence and orientation of specific physical structures.

Mind uploading will likely require destructive atomic-scale scanning of the brain. It would be similar to the way teleportation is done in Star Trek. Indeed, one of the dirty little secrets of this sci-fi show is that the person being teleported is actually killed each time it happens, replaced by an exact duplicate whos none the wiser. Mind transfers could be similar, where the original brain is destroyed, replaced by a digital being whos convinced theyre still the original  but it would be a delusion.

3. Authoritarianism will make a comeback

As threats to national security increase, and as these threats expand in severity, governments will find it necessary to enact draconian measures. Over time, many of the freedoms and civil liberties we currently take for granted, such as the freedom of assembly, the right to privacy (more on this next  its worse than you think), or the right to travel both within and beyond the borders of our home country, could be drastically diminished.



Hitler certainly knew how to capitalise on fear.

At the same time, a fearful population will be more tempted and willing to elect a hardline government that promises to throw the hammer down on perceived threats  even overtly undemocratic regimes.

The threats to national security will have to be severe to instigate these changes, but history has precedents. Following the September 11 attacks and the subsequent mailings of anthrax spores, the US government enacted the Homeland Security Act. This legislation was criticised for being too severe and reactionary, but its a perfect example of what happens when a nation feels under threat. Now imagine what would happen if another 9/11-type event happened, but one involving hundreds of thousands of deaths, or even millions.

Such an act of terrorism could be unleashed through miniaturized nuclear weapons, or the deliberate release of bioweapons. And the fact that small groups, and even single individuals, will have the power to attain and use these weapons will only make governments and citizens more willing to accept the loss of freedoms.

4. Privacy will become a thing of the past

We are rapidly approaching the era of ubiquitous surveillance, a time when virtually every aspect of our lives will be monitored. Privacy as we know it will cease to exist, supplanted by Big Brothers eyes and ears.



Big Brother watches William Hurt in 1984.

Governments, ever fearful of internal and external threats, will increasingly turn to low-cost, high-tech surveillance technologies. Corporations, eager to track the tendencies and behaviours of its users, will find it impossible to resist. Citizens of the surveillance society will have no choice but to accept that every last detail of their lives will be recorded.

Already today, surveillance cameras litter our environment, while our computers, smartphones, and tablet devices follow our daily affairs, whether it be our purchasing proclivities or the types of porn we watch.

Looking ahead, government agencies and police could deploy more sophisticated tracking devices, including the much-anticipated smart dust  tiny sensors that would monitor practically anything, from light and temperature to chemicals and vibrations. These particles could be sprinkled around Earth, functioning as the eyes and ears of the planet. In conjunction with powerful data mining algorithms, virtually everything we do would be monitored. To ensure accountability, we could watch the watchers  but will they allow it?

5. Robots will find it easy to manipulate us

Long before artificial intelligences become truly conscious or self-aware, they will be programmed by humans and corporations to seem that way. Well be tricked into thinking they have minds of their own, leaving us vulnerable to all manner of manipulation and persuasion. Such is the near future envisaged by futurist and sci-fi novelist David Brin. He refers to these insidious machine minds as HIERS, or Human-Interaction Empathetic Robots.



Ex Machina.

Human empathy is both one of our paramount gifts and among our biggest weaknesses, Brin told Gizmodo. For at least a million years, weve developed skills at lie-detection[but] no liars ever had the training that these new HIERS will get, learning via feedback from hundreds, then thousands, then millions of human exchanges around the world, adjusting their simulated voices and facial expressions and specific wordings, till the only folks able to resist will be sociopaths  and they have plenty of chinks in their armour, as well.

Brin figures that some experts will be able to tell when theyre being manipulated by one of these bots, but that will matter about as much as it does today, as millions of voters cast their ballots based on emotional cues, defying their own clear self-interest or reason. Eventually, robots may guide and protect their gullible human partners, advising them when to ignore the guilt-tripping scowl, the pitiable smile, the endearingly winsome gaze, the sob story or eager sales pitch  and, inevitably, the claims of sapient pain at being persecuted or oppressed for being a robot.

6. The effects of climate change will be irreversible

Late last year, world leaders forged an agreement to limit human-caused global warming to two degrees Celsius. Its a laudable goal, but we may have already passed a critical tipping point. The effects of climate change are going to be felt for hundreds, and possibly thousands, of years to come. And as we enter into the planets Sixth Mass Extinction, we run the risk of damaging critical ecosystems and radically diminishing the diversity of life on Earth.



Image: Mad Max Fury Road

Climate models show that even if carbon dioxide levels came to a sudden halt, the levels of this greenhouse gas in Earths atmosphere will continue to warm our planet for hundreds of years. Our oceans will slowly release the CO2 it has been steadily absorbing, and our atmosphere may not return to pre-industrial levels for many centuries. As a recent assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated, A large fraction of climate change is largely irreversible on human time scales.

In The Bulletin, science writer Dawn Stover lists the ramifications:


The melting of snow and ice will expose darker patches of water and land that absorb more of the suns radiation, accelerating global warming and the retreat of ice sheets and glaciers. Scientists agree that the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet has already gone into an unstoppable decline. Currents that transport heat within the oceans will be disrupted. Ocean acidification will continue to rise, with unknown effects on marine life. Thawing permafrost and sea beds will release methane, a greenhouse gas. Droughts predicted to be the worst in 1,000 years will trigger vegetation changes and wildfires, releasing carbon. Species unable to adapt quickly to a changing climate will go extinct. Coastal communities will be submerged, creating a humanitarian crisis. 

Our only recourse, it would seem, is to start geoengineering the planet, but that will also introduce complications.

7. The antibiotic era will end

An increasing number of diseases are becoming resistant to antibiotics. Eventually, we could make the unhappy transition to a post-antibiotic era, a time when even the most routine infections could threaten our lives.



Image: Pixabay

The era of antimicrobial resistant bacteria will change medicine as we know it. Transplant surgery will become difficult, if not impossible. Simple operations, such as a burst appendix, will be perilous once again. Pneumonia would ravage the elderly, as would many other diseases of old age, including cancer.

How bad could it get? A recent report by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in Britain predicted that the new era of antimicrobial resistance will kill upwards of 10 million people each year by 2050. No wonder theyre calling it the antibiotic apocalypse.

Thankfully, were not completely out of options. Scientists are currently on the hunt for undiscovered antibacterial compounds. Theyre also working to develop bacteria-fighting viruses and vaccines. Failing that, we could alway design artificial microorganisms that can hunt down and destroy problematic bacteria.

8. Getting robots to kill humans will be disturbingly routine  and dangerous

Its The Terminator scenario come to life  the unleashing of fully automated weapons systems that dispassionately hunt down and kill human combatants.



Image: Terminator Salvation.

These systems, known as LAWS (Lethal Autonomous Weapons), are under development, and it will only be a matter of time before theyre tacked onto pre-existing weapons, including powerful munitions and nuclear warheads. These robotic weapons are supposed to reduce human casualties and make war more humane, but experts fear these futuristic killing machines could be prone to accidents and even escape human control.

LAWS will be imbued with safety mechanisms and moral programming, but as Wendell Wallach from Yale Universitys Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics told to Gizmodo, they will be difficult to test, will still have software bugs, and will act unpredictably at times, even displaying unanticipated behaviour.

The speed-up of warfare and cost factors will make LAWS essential for advanced nations and attractive to non-state actors, Wallach said. While countries like the US promise that there will be meaningful human control and strong communication links to LAWS, they are particularly interested in LAWS for undersea weapons because they are difficult to communicate with. As an example, Wallach worries about an unmanned submarine that mistakenly launches powerful munitions or even a nuclear warhead.

We could have a nuclear conflagration before anyone even recognised what happened, he said. This is only one of hundreds of scenarios where semi-intelligent weaponry poses existential risks for humanity, long before the better recognised superintelligence might ever be realised. The long-term consequences of failing to ban LAWS far-outweigh any short-term benefits.

9. Well lose all the satellites

Few people today are aware of the risks posed by the partial or total loss of our satellite fleet, a catastrophe that could be instigated by a Kessler Syndrome (as portrayed in the film Gravity), a massive geomagnetic solar storm, or through a space war.



Image: Gravity.

Without satellites, our ability to communicate would diminish dramatically. GPS would be completely wiped out, along with those systems dependent upon it. Space-based synchronisation would grind to a halt, affecting everything from the financial sector to the electrical grid.

We need to take this risk more seriously and act accordingly. For starters, we should improve the robustness and resilience of our infrastructure; our dependence on satellites has put us in a precarious position. We also need to develop an appreciation of the orbital ecology. As time passes, both Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO) are getting increasingly cluttered with satellites and space junk. Unless we start to clean it up, we could lose these precious areas of space for decades, if not longer.

10. Well never make contact with aliens

We take it for granted that eventually  whether it be next week or sometime during the next millennia  well make contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence. Trouble is, it will likely never happen. Thats because theres no one out there transmitting signals for us to intercept, and no ones travelling between stars in search of new places to conquer.



Not bloody likely. (Image: Star Trek: First Contact)

The ongoing Great Silence isnt just a trivial observation. Our galaxy is ancient, so we should have made contact with aliens by now. Signs of ET, from radio signal leakage through to megascale engineering projects, should be virtually everywhere. Yet we see nothing.

The fact that we havent had an alien meet-and-greet could be read as a dire warning for our future. Perhaps theres a technological barrier that cant be surmounted, such as artificial superintelligence or weaponised nanotechnology. Alternately, aliens might be paranoid and xenophobic, playing it safe in case the neighbours are hostile. Alternately, intelligent life may choose to explore the infinite realms of cyberspace instead of the cold, dead cosmos. Either way, zipping around the galaxy in spaceships doesnt appear to be an option.

1480,2016-7-19,2016,7,19,8,4thxxo,Is the total population of scientists and engineers higher now than it was before in the USA?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4thxxo/is_the_total_population_of_scientists_and/,svbarnard,1468883153,"So are there more scientists and engineers than there were in 1950? How about 1980? Has the trend always been going up. What I am trying to ask is, is the number of scientists and engineers that we have now in America the most we've ever had in this nation? Science isn't dying out right but growing and growing?

In this article http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2015/nsf15328/ it says ""From 2003 to 2013, the number of scientists and engineers residing in the United States grew from 21.6 million to 29.0 million "" But in this article http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2012/scientists-engineers.aspx it says ""PRB's analysis of data from the American Community Survey shows that the size of the U.S. science and engineering (S&amp;E) labor force has declined from its peak at the turn of the 21st century."" And this article https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43061.pdf says ""The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that the number of S&amp;E jobs will grow by 953,200 between 2012 and 2022, a growth rate (1.3% CAGR). In addition, BLS projects that 1.3 million scientists and engineers will be needed to replace those projected to exit S&amp;E occupations. The number of scientists and engineers needed to meet growth and net replacement needs between 2012 and 2022 is 2.3 million,"" So they contradict each other, it seems you will get one answer from one person and a different one from another.

Another thing to take into account is that the total U.S. population in 1950 was 151 million and by 2010 was 308 million. So just by judging by that i would definitely say there are more S&amp;E now than at any point in America's history. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_the_United_States#Historical_population

Why do I wonder about this? Well I have read The Singularity Is Near and I dont know if it will happen by 2045 but I really want it to so badly! And if we really are going to be colonizing Mars and curing cancer and have self aware AI all by the year 2045 then we we need as many S&amp;E as we can possibly get.

And lastly are there more S&amp;E in the world now than before? The world population went from 2 billion in 1927 to 7 billion in 2012!!! So just by judging by that I would say for certain that there has never more S&amp;E than now! So I'd say the number of S&amp;E we have now compared to how many there were in 1927 is many orders higher, probably dwarfs it. Am I right? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population#Milestones_by_the_billions

So I hope we have more S&amp;E than ever before here in the USA and in the entire world for that matter. Cause its the only way the singularity will occur in our lifetime, if the singularity doesn't occur before I die than there goes my chance at immortality. And it isn't just immortality that I'd love to witness but Mars colonization and androids and nanobots and hey a cure for cancer, thats why innovation is so important and why I have been wondering about this lately.

&amp;nbsp;

Transhumanism is a hot zone for debate when it comes to ethics, possibly more so than the debate on AI. While on a surface level, it may appear that there are only benefits to be derived from augmenting human beings, there are actually a number of moral and ethical issues that can arise from their implementation. Some of these issues I'll introduce below, and if anyone can think of any others, please feel free to add them in and I'll adjust my list as I see more.

&amp;nbsp;

1. *Who gets to edit their genes?*: When new technology becomes available, it will almost always be more readily available to the wealthy than it will be to others. 

* With the ability to edit genes and create humans with viral immunities, or superior ""stat rolls"" coming into life, does this create a further divide or unfair balance of power for the wealthy? * Could this result in a genetically superior species arising from the upper class? 
* What is the role of the unenhanced in this world? 
* Does this create a social climate where ""undesirables"" could be easily purged with a virus or disease to curb population growth?

2. *Population control in a world without ageing*: In a world without ageing, we are assuming that barring grievous injury or disease, that nobody dies.

* How do we manage population growth? Limited resources are manageable now, but indefinite extension of lifespan would necessitate some form of population control.
* In a world with genetic enhancement, are the unenhanced given extended lives, or would this be seen a as a misuse of the population cap?
* Do human beings give birth anymore, or is it more ethical to simply create new humans from scratch genetics to avoid controversy? If you think that human beings should still give birth, how are the parents selected when room in the population is open?
* How do the definition and effects of life imprisonment change? How does society view life imprisonment? Does capital punishment, which is currently a morally bankrupt act, see a turn of favor in this society? 
* What is the capacity of the human mind to endure immortality? Does euthanasia become socially accepted for those who feel they have lived too long?

3. *Advances in medicine*: In Cowboy Bebop, Faye Valentine is a character whom is brought back to life 50 years after she has been cryogenically frozen. In her origin story, it is revealed that she begins her new life in the future with a massive hospital debt to repay for her cryogenic storage and resurrection.

* Is it ethical to assign debt to someone whom is resurrected through cryogenics? Is there a benefit to future society in resurrecting someone from the past without some form of repayment?

EDIT: If someone can help me figure out why my numbers come up as 1., 1., 1. instead of 1., 2., 3., that would be great. D:",1,2

Even if a successful drug has been developed, I think our conscious will die first as neurons die each day and they gets worn out eventually before the 120 years limit.

Instead of being a ""do this, do that"" machine, people have changed them to make them look, act, and feel like human beings. Of course, it's merely to make them act like they feel like us.

But with technology today, it only becomes more common, and soon enough, we could have characters in games that we could converse with and do whatever we wish.

Will something like this happen in our life-time, if at all?

I would suppose sometime in the near future we'll have something - for lack of a better term- called ""Google Earth Live"" - in which you can look at Google Earth and essentially see live things going on (up to a reasonable magnification, of course) including your own surroundings.

I would suppose something like this would be a privately owned sattelite perhaps owned by Google themselves and - who knows - launched in a joint venture with SpaceX.  I would guess that it might rollout slowly via one urban area at a time, perhaps first in tech-savvy cities like SF or Seattle. It would probably never be allowed in Washington DC for security reasons.

Possibly through gene editing or reactivating certain genes.

To help clarify what I mean, it would mean that in a brain injury scenario, neurons in the brain would regrow based on that person's genetics, ligaments and muscles could be prompted to regrow, and nerve connections to them. I guess it would include limb regeneration too. The reason I would like this sort of approach is that it would restore people closer to being ""them"", rather than restoring generic ligaments and neurons to people which seem pretty arbitrary in where you would stop. I know this would never restore the memories and such that a brain injury might have destroyed, but it could return someone to their full biological potential to build new memories.

So what if in the future, lets say u are in LA could put on some VR goggles like the occulus and control a robot in your empty parents house in Massachusetts. So the robot can do tasks like chores and things. But CGI is getting so realistic it is indiscernible from reality. So someone could like hack ur video feed and replace it with a videogame... and u think u are controlling the robot in real life, but in reality u are inside the simulation and u cant tell the difference because the videogame is 100% the same graphics and physics as reality. Surely in the future this will be a real possibility... And could be used in worse ways, like tricking a prisoner to think they are somewhere they are not during an interrogation, etc. kind of like the movie inception. I have not read ender's game, but this may also be along the lines of the plot to that book, let me know if it shares similarities.

I am Calum Chace; I write books about the impact of artificial intelligence.  I will be here from 1pm EST/10am PST/6pm BST 26th July to discuss the issues raised by my latest book, ""The Economic Singularity"".

The book argues that within a few decades, most humans will be rendered unemployable by intelligent machines.  I think this can turn out to be a very good thing - but only if we solve some very significant challenges which we haven't begun to plan for yet.  

I argue that we will need Universal Basic Income, but not yet, and introducing it may not be straightforward.  I also think that we may need to adopt a completely new economic system.  I spent 30 years in business before becoming a full-time writer, and I believe that the mixed economy (capitalism with regulations and a welfare safety net) has made today the best time ever to be alive in the developed world.  But an economy where a few people own the AI, and therefore pretty much everything else as well, while the rest of us live on static if comfortable basic incomes could easily degenerate into a dystopia: the gods and the useless.

I believe we can navigate succesfully through these perils to a world of radical abundance, but it will require a lot of discussion, monitoring, and scenario planning.",217,252

Four reports from experts describe how cities, storage and transport form fundamental mainstays to drive innovation and sustainable growth, according to a Cleantech market research firm Navigant Research.  The reports show large growth in four key areas of the low-carbon movement: smart city development; energy storage deployment; the rollout of fuel-cell cars and buses; and sales of alternative powertrains for heavy-duty vehicles. 

One of the reports mentions global smart city revenue growth increase from $36.8bn in 2016 to $88.7bn by 2025.  Another report claims that energy storage deployment in major world markets could reach 62GW over the next decade.

The third report approximates that global sales of fuel cell cars and buses will be more than 580,000 between now and 2024.  The final report concludes that alternative powertrain sales for medium and heavy duty vehicles will pass the 800,000 figure by 2026.

Today, city leaders and suppliers are recognising that there needs to be a more clear and timely route to the broader deployment of proven technologies and solutions, Navigants research director Eric Woods said. The question is how to establish the right business models and deployment strategies to enable this expansion.

In regards to smart cities, Navigant clarifies the increased usage of the Internet of Things will mobilise large-scale projects across energy, water, mobility, buildings and government. The report highlights data-driven policy-making will encourage smart investment, thereby increasing revenue to these cities.

Navigant predicts an increase in the energy storage markets of North America and Asia Pacific which will be aided by the rapidly declining costs of storage deployment. The report points out that after an emerging stage, these markets will develop into world leaders. Asia Pacifics five major markets are expected to deploy 199.5 MW of distributed storage capacity in 2015, rising to 9.4GW by 2025.

Vehicle advancement

Navigant is expecting businesses to lead the way as the transport sector stops or lessens its fossil fuel addiction. A report states that current fuel cell ranges of 300 miles will be increased over time, resulting in a greater portion of low-carbon vehicles on our roads by 2024.

Manufacturers are pursuing fuel cells to meet the needs of larger, longer-range vehicles, Navigants research analyst Lisa Jerram said. Overall, the driver for fuel cell vehicles activity continues to be the sentiment that a diverse drivetrain mix will be needed if the transportation sector is to shift away from petroleum dependence.    

Researchers are estimating global sales of fuel cell cars and buses will reach 580,000 in the next 10 years. If we are to successfully move away from fuel cell vehicles, then more is required to support the correct infrastructure and policies, with more charging stations needed over a larger geographic area. Currently, the UK has just two hydrogen-fuel cell models available.

While passenger vehicles are already undergoing a transition, there is a danger that heavy duty vehicles are getting left behind. The final Navigant report notes that, in order to keep up with the low-carbon transition, heavy duty fleet operators may turn to a variety of powertrain and design specifications to improve fuel efficiency.

Alternate powertrain types, such as plug-in hybrid, battery electric, hydrogen and natural gas will all become worthwhile options as economies grow and truck fleets increase. Navigant is expecting sales of alternate-powertrain, heavy-duty vehicles to reach 820,000 in 2026. In a bid to improve efficiency further, the report claims that aerodynamic aids, low rolling resistance tires, and vehicle light-weighting will be investigated.

This is akin to the US government allowing Standard Oil or other international conglomerates to develop Nuclear weapons for profit in the early 20th century. AI has the potential to be more disruptive than Nuclear technology.  It could make or break a nation. The first country to have superhuman AI capabilities would essentially have the powers of Gods. This tech will give less powerful state actors the power to have dominion over other far stronger nations. I find it strange that governments around the world arent trying to take the lead in AI research, and many are allowing corporations with their own self interest to poach the top AI and Machine learning talent from their own country.

Neutral networks are now creating unique imagery, music, and photorealistic sketches. It stands to reason that video creation will be the next art form that neutral networks are pointed at.

* World population is higher (7 billion brains instead of 3 billion)
* More nations are industrialized, which means more investment in R&amp;D. More R&amp;D comes from China, South Korea, Brazil, India, etc. than it did in 1956.
* The Flynn effect means IQs are about 20 points higher than 60 years ago
* Computers and the internet augment intelligence by allowing the wisdom of crowds and outsourcing of calculations
* Better scientific tools make it easier to see patterns and examine data

etc. We are now learning about the genetics of intelligence and may soon start selecting embryos that have a higher IQ. This could result in an IQ boost as small as 10 points per generation, but if more advanced techniques are used boosts of 100 points could be possible. Some people like Stephen Hsu claim if all genetics associated with IQ were selected for, an IQ of 1,000 could be possible (Nick Bostrom said the ceiling is probably closer to 300-400, possibly lower, if you selected all genes for intelligence though). Also there is the machine intelligence revolution where machines become better at more and more forms of narrow AI, and will eventually reach general AI, which will then reach superintelligent general AI. 

Does anyone think this all follows a fairly reliable trendline, like the graphs Kurzweil would use in his book the singularity is near? I guess there is no known metric to even calculate the intelligence of the human civilization, so that is a bummer. But it seems like multiple factors all come together to increase the collective intelligence of the human species. The Flynn effect, higher world population, industrialization of the third world leading to them investing more in R&amp;D, machine intelligence advances, biotechnology advances, advances in communications, advances in scientific tools, etc. 

I know some people are predicting superintelligent general AI around mid-century, but will that just be another dot on the graph of the increasing intelligence of the human race that probably goes back to the 19th century? 

Rather than say the intelligence amplification revolution is sometime a few decades from now, it is more of a smooth trendline and we are in the lower/middle of it and have been for decades? ",1,2

I love looking into the future and seeing the amazing possibilities! I often come here to lift my spirits, and to speculate about the future! 

but recently, I've expanded my interests a small amount. you see I want to live for a long time, so I thought it would be prudent to look into the current situation of my country (The USA) to make a double check of sorts...I wanted to see if the US would be stable for the next 10 to 20 years. as you might assume from the title, it was not as positive as I once thought it to be. I know its a bit confusing and i'm no expert, but this is what I have so far:

* The USA's current debt in total right now is about 66 trillion dollars total. (source: http://www.usdebtclock.org/# ) and the current GDP of the us is about 18 trillion dollars. 
* interest rates are at 0% atm and our growth has basically halted. and the housing market is at an all time low as well. 
* our presidential choices are between an inexperienced lunatic, who has no idea how to run a county, and a bold faced lair who is backed by the very people who are the causes of our debt.
* The issues from the 2008 crash have not been solved, in fact they've been made worse. so much so that if it crashed now, the whole world economy would crash.
* The US federal reserve is a huge printing press for money, and we have basically been pumping in more and more money just to keep its proverbial head above the water.
* many economists who rang the alarm bells in 2007, are ringing them again. but the media has covered none of it.

It is very hard of me to look at all this and say the future will be fine...I keep hearing about UBI, as much as it would be a good idea, it wouldn't work in this situation. we simply cannot stop our runaway debt. we are now like a shark. in that if we stop producing debt, we die.

our only hope is technology, or AI to supplement or replace our current systems. but it might already be too late for it to take any effect at this point. I am really trying hard not to let this effect me...but its becoming an increasingly heavy burden on my mind.

what are we to do? what are your thoughts? am I completely wrong about this? I hope so.

Edit: thank you so much for the replies! I really appreciate all the clarification. I still have my worries, and I will stock up on canned food and water just in case ;) but hopefully things go well!",24,7
