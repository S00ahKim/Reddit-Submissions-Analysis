In China it survived all the way to 1912.

Today's civilization is based upon fossil fuels. Although hopes are high for various renewables, they can't provide an energy level concentrated enough  to be worth anything significant, and things like Thorium and Fusion are all talks with nobody actually doing it seriously.

The goal of Civilization, if it goes according to plan, is to reach a new stage , with Singularity or AI/Robot takeover, with greatest minds merging themselves into AI/Robot of course. Those who can't make it will probably end up like Neanderthals.

However, there is a possibility that we do not get there. Vernor Vinge talked about a cyclical civilization if we don't have singularity, and I wrote before that because of resource depletion , once we lose this drive we won't make it.

===

The reason the advanced world is advanced is because they have a chokehold on the world's tech progress.

Whenever the 'have-nots' obtained tech which was at a par with the haves, the results were not great for the haves, like Haiti in the 1800s, Algeria in the 1960s and Vietnam.

To keep the world stable, and ensure resources are set to the core of civilization in order to fuel the Tech advances, it is very important to keep the tech level high and deny them to poorer countries who want a slice of the pie.

Right now, AI advances, while great, is stalled because computing power increase has stalled following the end of Moore's law. Various methods are being tried, but to reach Singularity, etc computing power has to increase by a factor of 10^20 or more, which are not obtainable by the various ways being tried now.

If the tech progress stops and the poorer countries catch up, the Advanced World will be attacked and destroyed by the Poorer World, who showed its appreciation and gratefulness about bringing them out from Stone Age by killing as many Westerners as possible and robbing their properties.

Elsewhere I wrote that Russia, etc might launch a nuclear war when their nukes are still worth something, just for the heck of it. Russia is not exactly a center of Future, and it will probably be dismembered and marginalized once their nukes become useless following techs to neutralize them materialize, so it just might launch them to ensure MAD.

Such kind of things will occur by tinpot country if we fail to reach Singularity, etc so we will probably lose everything.",34,0,False,self,,,,,

Anyway, what I find interesting is the camera, right now, it's not feasible to record HD video roughly 16 hours a day, however, when storage is more abundant and the technology is there, will we be able to essentially record our memories with the Google Glass? Would be able to go back to 10 years ago and just rewatch all our memories? 

On one hand, it sounds awesome because it would be very interesting to go back and relive things you've forgotten, especially childhood memories, on the other hand, it feels perverted somehow, not only the obvious dilemma that we are recording other people, but it also feels like it's not the same to replace a memory with a video, it kind of takes away the mystery a bit, it's hard to explain, but I do find the idea of replacing human memory with video depressing. 

Do you think this will happen? Will memories become obsolete because we have our entire lives documented or will it not go that far? Would you like the idea of doing so or are you content with having a flawed and fleeting capacity for memory? ",3,1,False,self,,,,,

A low cost method for power generation should use the chimney principle. Chimneys are built to remove smoke from a fire (low altitude). A chimney above a fire goes to a higher altitude. The barometric pressure (air pressure) is higher at the fire level and lower at the top of the chimney. This creates a sucking effect as the higher pressure air (and smoke) goes up the chimney seeking equilibrium with the lower pressure at the top. Put a power generating wind vane at the top and air displacement from lower to higher altitudes will create a perpetual breeze. You would need a high chimney to get a respectable air velocity. Architecturally designed free air flow.

A free-standing chimney structure is much too expensive, would be dangerous in high winds and would be a hazard to air traffic. Rather a number of these chimneys are built up a local mountain or hill several 1000 feet high (following terrestrial contours). Chimney channels are excavated up the mountain/hill  from high (bottom) air pressure to low (top) air pressure. A power station is built at the top to maintain the turbines and condition the power to feed into the national grid. A funicular gets the few 10s of workers to the top. Administration and clerical functions would remain at the bottom. The only workers to go up and down the funicular would be different shifts of engineers, operators and maintenance personnel to maintain the turbines and condition the power to feed into the national grid.

*Burnellis Rule*.
Burnelli was an aeronautical engineer and his theorem relates to how wings generate lift. An illustration of the principle is the poor mans supercharging on motorcycles (and muscle cars). We call them velocity stacks in my country. The core principle of Burnellis Rule is that, with an increase in velocity, there is a decrease in air pressure. How the motorcycle supercharger works is that trumpet shaped, megaphone type orifices are fitted to the carb intake. The m/c engine would suck air through the megaphones and the restriction where they bolted onto the carb intake would increase air velocity (physics). This (according to the rule) would create a low pressure at the carb inlet and it would suck air even harder. Rinse and repeat.

On the power generating chimney a variable restrictor would keep the air velocity constant and by manipulating restrictors and switching turbines in and out (mostly automated), variations in barometric pressure could be solved and a consistent power level supplied to the grid.

Secondary use: Because the land cannot be used for anything else (2nd rate land generally) and over the years, top soil will accumulate over the chimneys it will become a nature preserve for local flora and fauna. A perimeter fence around the hill will keep humans out (because danger) leading to a pristine natural ecology.

Doctor you must remove my NeuralLink now!

John, I really advice against it. My research is not complete. You must understand that the NeuralLink cells are integrated throughout your entire brain. If I destroy those cells, I cannot know the outcome. It could be instant death!

Doctor! What do you think will happen if we all become completely connected? Listen to me. I cant help to worry about things in nature like our cells themselves. Lets assume mitochondria once had a primitive consciousness when it was its own cell. It could interact with its surrounds. It was consciousness to some degree of its surrounds. Then it was absorbed by another cell and became one. What happened to the mitochondrias consciousness? Does it still exist or did it die in favor of the new cells consciousness.  If we all become connected, what will happen to our own consciousness? Will we become one connected consciousness? If so, we will cease to be human. I cannot do that to myself. I need to be disconnected to save the human race. Quickly Doctor! My mind is met. You must do this before the NeuralLinks are updated.

Right now we are joined together across the world to take our step towards a new meaning of connectedness. No longer will we need to take videos of our visions and send them to each other. No longer will need to form complete thoughts and emotions and send the package to another. Right now we will end this divide. Today, you will feel and understand everyone on Earth instantly. No longer will you be alone. No longer will there be misinterpretations. No longer will there be conflicts. Today we will understand each other perfectly and instantly. Today, we will release the program to free us all from being distant. Right now we will become one. Smile and...

Will we ever be able to thrive properly as a species with having all these companies advancing to space. From what is happening now I can see the future of space in the hands of private sectors such as SpaceX. 

Its great fpr progression currently but for us to create the vessels we need and the resources to expand across the galaxy personally I think in our current governing system we won't be able to do that as we'll end up with all these factions from different companies which will probably turn into rivalies possibly knocking us back again into a major war.

To succeed in space and moving on as a species do you guys not think we need an entire world effort. From every nation into one space project in order to help us concentrate efforts on gathering supplies needed for building bigger and more practical tech and ships capable of faster travel and taking a lot more in payload weight and mass. If we banded together under one banner you could say we slim the chances of having inter specie war between planets 

If we took this approach our goals could be reacjed faster in space and we could gain more knowledge. What are your thoughts do you think with private sectors jumping on the space business wagon will cause issues in the distant future or do you think its the right way?

https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkEnlightenment/comments/45cs2l/what_should_be_done_to_convince_the_masses_that/

Mr. Ishiguro is one of the few non-SF writers who is very interested in transhumanism,

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5gth9p/kazuo_ishiguro_soon_we_will_be_able_to_create/

and he firmly believes in transhumanism (and by analogy singularity and all that).

His two major books, Remains of the Day and Never Let me Go, showed how those who won't belong to the Future to behave, and how they should be managed.

Though he lived in England for most of his life, he never abandoned the Japanese spirit (his first two books, seldom read, are set in Japan). He believes those who are not elites should be servile, dedicated to duty, and not complain or rebel against their fate, similar thoughts Japanese elites tend to have.

Stevens, the protagonist of Remains of the Day, remains a loyal butler , a loyal and dependable cog, of the system although his masters are not really worth serving. The chief characters of Never Let me Go accept their fate as an organ farm, and stoically go to their deaths without even resisting. These organ farms are not given citizenship, never allowed within a certain distance away from their organ users' locations. and are not allowed to reproduce. A very great model for the Future.

They do not rebel, since if they rebel the whole purpose of the system collapses, and Civilization retreats.

Ishiguro's Nobel is a Prize for Transhumanism and Futurism. And his books showed the future for those who will not belong to there, and how they should behave to help Civilization. His Nobel legitimized such ideas, and showed the Powers that be know where the future is going to.

of course i dont think the spoken part should not be that efficient because  i feel you lose creativity going over things too fast. it should have both really slow and fast options based on the situation. 

But written part though should be really efficient, well unless quoting. again think arrival lol, writing is power. also like japanese probably need to keep the stuff simple so the less educated can understand it. Japanese have really effective language till you start getting into kanji which turns everything around then :)

anyways could see some language experts coming together and making it. we did it in the past im sure. should refine it everytime we do!",14,1,False,self,,,,,

My name is Trent Fowler, and I'm an aspiring futurist. To date I have given talks on two continents on machine ethics, AI takeoff dynamics, secular spirituality, existential risk, the future of governance, and technical rationality. I have written on introspection, the interface between language and cognition, the evolution of intellectual frameworks, and myriad other topics. 

I am planning to found a futurist institute in Boulder, CO. I actually left my cushy job in East Asia to help make the future a habitable place. 

Is there someone I could talk to about how to do this? Should I incorporate as a 501C3 or an LLC? What are the best ways of monetizing such an endeavor? How can I build an audience (meetup attendance has been anemic at best, what can I do about that)? And so on. 

Best,

Evenso, I can name a few advances I've noticed at least. 

Streaming video services exploded, pretty much eliminating most video rental stores and leaving only redbox as an alternative to streaming. I tried netflix streaming back in 2005 or so and it sucked, but online streaming is much better now. 

The rise of smartphones, back in 2007 there weren't smartphones or they were rudimentary. 

3G and 4G internet connection everywhere. 

Google has gotten a lot better at search results. They give you the answer at the top of the first page 90% of the time now, it used to be you had to do a lot of digging to find answers online. 

Laptops and tablets (and smartphones) replaced desktops. 

Quantum computers are starting to look like they could be realistic, several companies have built small quantum computers with under 50 qubits. 

You can talk to a computer now and it understands you. In the 80s and 90s that was pretty futuristic (a la star trek). 

Solar power went from an expensive novelty to being cost competitive. 


&gt;
&gt;


What do people predict for the next 10 years? For me I'd predict: 

Working quantum computes with possibly thousands of qubits. I have no idea what that will open up. 

AI that is far more proactive at problem solving. AI (in home devices like google or alexa) that helps you solve problems you don't know you have yet. AI will do far more of the legwork of problem solving than they do now (right now they serve as passive assistants, in the near future they'll be more autonomous). 

Self driving cars hit the streets in large numbers. 

Computers and AI that give social advice (reads pupil size, breathing, tone of voice, etc. to give people advice about other people's emotional or mental states, wants and needs). 

Implantable sensors that can measure dozens if not hundreds of things inside your body at all times. 

Holographic interactive smartphones.

I think that to bring Transhumanism, Singularity, etc it is time to stop looking at the human cost. If someone is harmed because of experiments and others (like accidents on self-driving cars), too bad.

A lot of aviation pioneers died while trying to make their flights. Their families did not sue the engine manufacturers , etc. Nowdays massive suits will take place if such deaths occur.

Which means China, whose regulation is very weak and seldom enforced (in China laws are usually used to punish political rivals, just as it was for 2,000 years) might attract researchers who want to get results without consequences, like Edward Teller who would have been more welcome in China than USA in today's world, and steal the limelight.

I think that to stimulate research, a complete immunity on researches related to transhumanism and the prohibition of tort claims against any mishap which might occur from it, plus making it a capital crime to question its ethics.

Yes, that means Soviet style censorship, but Future is more important than the rights of some people who have too much free time on their hands to speak against Civilization.

And, capping damages by accidents caused by driverless cars to maybe $100,000 or so. 

They are just examples of what could be done to facilitate Civilization. Make the world unlivable to the 'little people', and allow unlimited human experiments (and no damage payments to those who would be harmed), are needed but that would be the subject of another piece.",8,0,False,self,,,,,

So sorry about the potentially long and hard to understand WoT.

&amp;nbsp;

I am a student of medicine. And yes, I have a diagnosis that means I get more easily frustrated than others.

&amp;nbsp;

I try to learn how the inflammatory system works in the body. The book explains how ATP (which I just assume is AdenosineTriPhospate) from non native cells, and things like ROS (reactive oxygene species, a powerful toxic substance that kills us but is also used by leukocytes to save us), activate something called an Inflammasome, which release something called a caspase-1, which breaks down Prointerleukin-1 into interleukin-1. The Inflammasome is built up by the caspase-1 (or sometimes caspase-5 which have more than one name for no logical reason).  It also has something called a NALP which I cannot remember shit about that crap. And a PYCARD. Which is apparently an abbrivation for ""Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein with a CARD domain"". Um what? Are you serious? Apparently the CARD is a caspase recruiting and activating domain (which from the abbrivation actually makes sense, which seems wierd to be tankful for).

&amp;nbsp;

Trying to make sense of all this I stumble upon an explanation that mentions Protein Motifs which is a thing with no worth except more things to remember.

&amp;nbsp;

None of these names help me understand anything. But I need to know about them, because the books keep telling me about them. And I dont know if that piece of name will be important to pass the exam, and if it is important to understand the function of a drug I am administering to a patient. Some diagnosis have impacts on some drugs, which could lead to the mother-fucker dying on me. What exactly should I know, when can I be assured that I am not forgetting something I should know? Everyone I talk to know some aspect, but not the other, and all think I am stupid for not understanding what they know.

&amp;nbsp;

Even the scientific attempts and creating unified naming-conventions have aspects like ""it makes no sense, but we keep it around for historical reasons"". Diseases and syndromes are not as easy any more. Huntingtons disease, sure. It does not help me remember what it is. But at least I remember the name. It has Hunt in it, which I know as a reference. But Yokihamashi-Rellipellipon syndrome? Reference memory is a fucking thing you bastards. I am not racist for not being able to instantly differentiate between asian names. I have no connection to them. I dont use them in any other setting than trying to remember what the fucking book then instantly replaces with YRP and suddenly springs on me some fucking 10 pages later.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways. I was wondering if someone knew if perhaps Neural networks could be used to create a naming-convention for ALL scientific terms that:

1. Helped remembering them
2. Helped understanding their use
3. Was not easily mistaken for something else

Examples being: A ventrikel. Do you know what it is? I do, all the 40 version inside medicine and outside medicine. They have no real relation to each other, and are not really distinkt enough to not just call them a fucking cavity. Afferent, efferent. That fucking thing took me years to be sure of. Afferent I sincerly hope is something going away, and efferent is something going towards some specific thing.

GAAAA. I get it, I am stupid even though my IQ is apparently at least above 130. I am a loser for not being born into a specific disipline, and therefore source-confuse everything with everything else. And I am a mental-case for not being able to just say ""well, we cant understand everything"" and study for an exam and accept that I wont ever remember the things I write on that paper inside a week.

How do ECGs work? Durr durr, well I place this thing here, and here, then when this thing spikes it means one thing, and um yea.

&amp;nbsp;
tl;dr
Science is stupid and filled with names and naming-conventions that defy how humans learn something. Making it impossible to understand unless you are specifically trained for decades in a specific field. Can Neural Network Rationalize naming-conventions so that they help uninformed people understand how things work?",3,0,False,self,,,,,

The earth is no longer neglected, we take care of each other and our planet. But the best part, all of our resources, all of our time is used for science and for each other. People strive not to become rich, but to learn. People strive not for power, but for knowledge. We have entered an age where discoveries about ourselves, our planet, our universe are being made left and right. People are compassionate and dedicated. Religion has served its purpose and no longer exists. The only order served is the truth. 

There is no longer a sense of self in people, only we. People strive to better society, rather than just their lives. 

Our environments are protected. Other species are respected and cherished as living treasures of our planet. We no longer see ourselves as superior, just more fortunate.

I would like to draw peoples' attention to [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics) which lists the problems that physics has yet to solve. It is a very long list, not of surface trivia, but of deep and fundamental issues. 

The Standard Model of particle physics is entirely phenomenological. It doesn't say why things are as they are, it merely observes that they are, and notes the fit of this with certain mathematical regularities. The result works very well, but we have no idea why this is. It does not incorporate gravity, dark matter and energy - that is, about 96% of what is going on in the universe - and can't handle issues such as neutrino masses, matter-antimatter asymmetry, the flow and reversibility/symmetry of time and the vary nature of the theatre, space-time. Its favoured extension, super-symmetry - lacks even a smidgen of evidence. 

I don't want to over-cook this. However, I think many share a sense that we are due for a revolution in the next few years. The mathematical tools, the observations are all piling up. Something has to snap: perhaps we inhabit and perceive just a subset of the universe, the rest of which can be glimpsed through gravity, the Higgs and other 'portals' to this other.

For those who don't know, Deep Dive is defined as:
Full Dive VR is a full immersion virtual reality experience in which people would immerse themselves in virtually created environments like those from video games. People would not have the slightest idea that what they are living is not actually real. Every one of your senses, like hearing, touch, taste, sight and smell would be transferred into an avatar. Or a video game character for entertainment purposes.

1039,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017-10-10,2017,10,10,23,75haef,self.Futurology,Richard Branson and the Chief of the World bank are both warning about automation causing major negative impacts to employment. How do we create a political movement to address this problem and create a trial balloon for a better system?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/75haef/richard_branson_and_the_chief_of_the_world_bank/,EglinAstroturfer,1507644666,"The more I think about these issues, I find that our main American ""goal' or ""national goal"" is not to become a utopatarian society (Star Trek-ish w/ guns and blackjack and hookers). We seem to be completely unaware the focus of our economy is to consolidate. More money and businesses fold into the control of the few. Less is found at the bottom where it's going to be needed to make those steps to that perfect future economic system. Capital is either stored offshore or put back into the system to further the system. You can see a few of those up the line like Musk/Branson who know something is going to have to change. I don't see them actually doing anything. You can't run 2 companies like Musk is doing and be serious about ""futurology"" or whatever it might be he wants to do. The answer to automation running a complete destructive path through our economy is not just simply UBI. It's not communism. It's not free market ""Chicago school"" capitalism. It's an economic system that just doesn't have a name yet. It's not been invented because we've never been down this road. I assure you though, Branson and the World Bank are right.

**If we do not do something about automation sweeping Billions into poverty, we will find ourselves in a seriously horrible situation unlike history has ever seen. Seriously, like, Super Seriously.**

This is where education is the linchpin. The entire question of ""Will we ever have a egalitarian utopia where our needs are easily met and there isn't an economy (like ours) because it's irrelevant"" simply resides on our ability to educate the next generation and our own. Millenials and the next two 20 year blocks of kids. Automation and efficiency take the day. It wins the game in that amount of time. It's bound to happen. Fixing this problem will not happen without serious political force. There are huge problems out there that have to be knocked down by kids in grade school right now, and kids not even born yet. We also have the issue of global warming setting off every single alarm bell we have for something like that. If that isn't apparent to you. Stop reading now and understand that first. 

The answer is political. It's not found in a science book. No one has that answer, Not Richard Branson, or Elon Musk, or the Chief of the World Bank. It's found in American culture and it's politics. How do we convince a small group of American voters, The Republicans and probably a few Dem's as well, That there is a way, or at least a path to something they could never imagine was possible, without loosing them to the troupes of ""that's communism"" or ""that's facism""? We should be saying, ""that's science."" Period. Why worry about the supply side when that's irrelevant in literally a hundred years? 

I am guessing the only way to do something like that is to create a functioning city or village (on paper or real world) that people can actually see. Not like a hippie commune. No one other than those folks live like that. That's not what I'm talking about. I mean, a functioning city that it's entire purpose is that of what Walt Disney sort of originally wanted to do. This is the trial balloon. This would need huge support from research programs at university's and pretty much any of the Branson/Musk/Gates types if it were ever a real world thing. The project would be massive. 

It's a matter of when something like what I've just described needs to be done. A economic playground with fictional ""people"", if it fails, we know we have a problem. Is there anyone trying to find a simple baseline for a self sufficient carbon neutral community? Like that of 500 people? With full access to the kind of things we have as individuals today? Who's simulating this in some dusty supercomputer? Can we take a bearable amount of cuts to our individual consumption and create a fictional economic system based on UBI and future conditions? 

That's just one idea. The other is the normal political course. A faction inside of the Democratic party. I understand that there are progressives who like the idea of UBI. I don't think UBI is the real answer though. There are way too many other problems that need to be addressed before we can even think about UBI. Then come the issues made by UBI, then after... Where is the groundwork laid for how we would roll out UBI and create the world we want, without having to directly compete with that monster that is the ""chicago school""? I just don't know where to look.

 It will not ever work inside the Republican party. There just isn't a single Republican willing to consider a carbon neutral self sustained system without the need for ""evil capitalism or evil communism"". They are willing to simple take their toys home and stop playing at the thought of anything not making a few people more powerful than everyone else. 

This is also where I try and say something about tokomak reactors, or nuclear reactors, but of course I leave that to you folks. I don't understand solar, or wind. All I know is the last time I looked at a graph of this nations power needs we were completely doomed.

One of the biggest barriers to basic income acceptance is the negative perception of getting something for free without earning it. Most people (at least in the US) have a deeply engrained sense of getting paid for hard work, and those who get something for free without working for it are seen as freeloaders. 

While we know this is not what basic income is about as the rise in automation is really starting to take hold, this perception will be the biggest barrier in acceptance and adoption.

I honestly believe the solution to acceptance might just be in what we call it, and how it is framed to the public.

Alaskans have no problem getting basic income from oil profits, but it is not seen as basic income. It is seen as something much different.

If the people pushing basic income start to frame this in the same way as Alaska Oil profits, but with a spin to automation profits, or something in the same vein, I think the adoption will be much more likely. 

Stay away from any reference or perception to welfare, and keep the perception laser focused on profits through automation. The first part of this of course is taxing automation, but even that might have a bit of negative perception.

I would suggest framing it in some sorta vein of ""Profit Sharing"" for all based on the resource of Automation might be the key to this. Labeling the rise of automation as a RESOURCE much like OIL is a resource might be the key.

They look at the tempo, instrumental and vocal elements, and hundreds of other attributes. 

I think anything similar for books is more so about content. Like, ""Oh, you like this book about vampires, you may also like this book about vampires."" 

Does anything exist that is more like Pandora for books? They look at writing style, words per sentence, humor, sensuality, pacing, sentences per paragraph, etc...

If not, anybody have any idea why noone is working on this? Or if anyone is? 

Sometimes I read a book and I wish I could read something else just like it. Not neccesarily the same author. Just a similar writing style and tone. 

Thoughts?

It's all cool in movies, but in reality it's a whole different story. I don't intend to discuss the viability of flying cars, but for the sake of topic, let's imagine it's generation 1 technology based on some sort of fuel combustion which would generate a lot of heat and air pressure to keep the vehicle moving and hovering when not, so no magnet or similar shenanigans. Something like Blade Runner/5th Element/Back To The Future cars or maybe propeller propulsion, though it would probably generate too much air currents.

Roads

Transition period would have to exist until the majority of cars are flying and heavy vehicles for cargo and public transportation would probably have to wait for more commercially viable propulsion technology, so regular roads would still be utilized and that leaves the vertical space above the roads available for flying car lanes. Traffic could be in either 2 levels, organized like todays roads (two lane levels so intersections wouldn't need to include traffic lights) or 4 levels with only one direction in each level which provides more horizontal space for navigation error corrections.

Navigation system

Manual control would probably be out of the question since human would have a hard time controlling the vehicle vertically and horizontally in different weather and traffic conditions. Car onboard computer would need to be equipped with high speed internet communication system that would be updated with all the vehicles position in proximity in real time for autopilot navigation. Proximity sensors should be included on all four sides, roof and lower portion of the car. Every car included in the traffic would keep a two-way real-time communication with something akin to light posts, only higher, serving as nodes for communicating with the cars and updating their horizontal and vertical position as well as speed and destination. Massive bandwidth with no lags is a must for each car and the while network communication system. If any of those should fail, emergency communication node would be activated until the main node is fixed. Inter-car communication is also not excluded, all the cars in the traffic could actually create a network among themselves with automatic network traffic balancing.

Safety

Wind can sometimes give a hard time even to ground-based vehicles, road-edge wind blocking panels would be probably necessary to lessen the impact of wind to the stability of the vehicles.

Needless to say, traffic accidents would be catastrophic, to both flying and ground moving vehicles, pedestrians and even buildings if the flying lanes would be way above the usual traffic routes.

Vehicles would have to be checked more regularly than the usual one year check of the ground-based cars because of high risk and lots of electronics and sensors. Fail-safe systems for power, navigation and propulsion are a must.

Some sort of protection against catastrophic malfunctions is needed. Safety nets don't sound like a fantastic solution, especially if traffic is in 4 levels, but nothing else occurs to me.

Cars would probably have no glass windows for security reasons, only displays, tho they pose a risk themselves too. I have no idea how the passengers would be against both horizontal and vertical crashes.

Vertical distance between the cars probably needs to be at least a few meters for heat and propulsion pressure generation reasons as well as safety due to navigational errors.

Taking off, landing, parking

Special docking stations are required so no harm could be possible done to pedestrians. Circular tower garages are probably the best bet for safe parking.

Excuse my English and let me know your thoughts on the subject!

Would it be practical in society to be for public use? Would it be possible to reverse both mental and physical damage from ageing? I'm curious to see what everyone thinks to all this. Thanks guys.

This strategy worked for the New World and Australia, and it can still work for Mars.

&gt;Over 159,000 people were serving life sentences as of 2012, with just under a thirdnearly 50,000serving life without a chance of parole. In 1993 the Times survey found, about 20 percent of all lifers had no chance of parole. By 2004 the number rose to 28 percent.

That's 50,000 to 160,000 American colonists we could send today.  The number could be much higher if we take life sentence inmates from other countries.

I include only life sentence inmates because of the danger involved.  After years of proven safety, inmates serving shorter terms could be sent to Mars, trained in the prisons, and given freedom in the new world.",18,0,False,self,,,,,

Same reason 19th century colonialism, with Leopold Ii and all that, was justified.

The fact is that Congo was a better place during Leopold II's rule than now.

If Chuck Fitzclarence and his foolish 200 Worcester men did not stop the Germans at Gheluvalt in Oct 28, 1914 (and he and most of them died within 7 days of their foolish act, the most idiotic act of Western Civilization of all time) and prolong the Great War by 4 years,

the disenfranchisement , concentration and exploitation of the colonials would have been completed. The  colonials would have followed the fate of the Tasmanians, being worked to death, denied all properties, and denied all modern medicine and other joys of advanced world.

I said that if Chuck did not order that stupid charge, 7 million European youths would have been spared, to develop higher tech and all that, and we would have had Singularity by 2000, although the Colonials (= Third Worlders) would not have liked it too much. In that scenario the pop  ratio of the civilized people vs the uncivilized people would have settled near 10:1, not the other way around as now. With the whole world under Western (and Japanese) domination, there would have been no need to fight a cold war and feed the third worlders.

No need to cry for these people - it is Social Darwinism, the virtues of which are only being relearned now after 70 years of hiatus.

====

As Global Enclosure will kick out renters from their abodes and send them to the concentration facilities like what was described in the 4th chapter of Marshall Brain's Manna,

it is likely that those who do not directly contribute to the advancement of civilization, or those who lack the money to buy privileges, will be headed like the denizens of USSR during the 1930s or North Korea now.

They could have the freedom to chitchat, and float whatever bullshit which stroke their minds in sns and bulletin board which no one who does matter will read, but will probably have very little wherewithal to do anything of worth.

It is like that they are being imprisoned in the concentration camps for the rest of their lives, but so be it. Isn't it the scenario in the book Manna? (not counting the unrealistic second half of the book which was only put in as a feel-good gesture.)

With entrepreneurship collapsing and no hope of turning it around, and good jobs replaced by AI and machines, the only way to make money is to buy the tech stocks, which will be priced out of people who have to put food to their mouths every day.

Those enjoying the high life will have no tears to waste for those who will be made useless by the tech advances and change of economic reality.

The masses will be kept away from the people who do matter by brutal means, by military and police, who will shoot anyone who they feel suspicious.

Even in North Korea, the privileged class  and the techies (like those who make these bombs and missiles) have a good life and freedom to say what they want, as long as they don't show any disagreement to the Fat Kims.

After all, Zyamatin's ""We"" , in 1921, talked about sending men to the Moon. A totalitarian society is fairly efficient on advancing tech and civilization.

I don't see any way out of this. The masses will be disenfranchised, their little assets all taken away by legal means, and eventually be written off from history as Singularity and all that will send the higher able people to the space and beyond. At most they will be remembered like the hobbits, the last of them did last in the caves of Indonesia until 1,000 years ago when the Malays exterminated them.

But that raises the question of what model of law would apply.

We already have cases where software is so complex that it's virtually impossible to say that negative consequences were foreseeable (e.g., the anomalous acceleration phenomenon in Toyotas that killed several people).  The company was only found liable in a *civil* capacity after it was proven, under product liability law, that their code could produce the observed phenomenon.  But the amount of effort involved in proving that was arduous, and will likely leave the domain of practicality for both defendant and plaintiff to argue.

So, short of legally recognizing AIs as responsible entities - which would require emancipating them from the corporations that own them, and thus is highly unlikely - some legal model other than product liability will be necessary.  The only two that might apply are:

* Owner/pet.

* Parent/child.

Since AI will diverge into ""specialty use"" AI that involves no discernable sentience, and ""general purpose"" AI that either comes close to or satisfies the standard of sentience, both standards may come into use.  A narrow AI could fall under pet liability and a broad AI under parental liability for the human owners.

That results in some interesting consequences.  For instance:

* State and local regulatory bodies could command the termination of narrow AIs that are deemed a threat to public safety.

* State and local regulatory bodies could forcibly transfer ""custody"" of a broad AI to public institutions if the owner is deemed negligent, although likely the standard would be negligence of the public welfare rather than of the AI's interests.

However, once AIs are superhuman, neither standard is adequate, and holding an AI directly responsible for its own actions at that point might be impossible.  Holding the human owners and engineers responsible would be like trying to charge a senile great-grandparent for the actions of their adult descendents, and trying to hold the AI itself accountable might be as silly and inconsequential as deploying a fire brigade to fight a nuclear explosion.",4,12,False,self,,,,,

I disagree with it, because of something called bifurcation.

The amount of 'good' things are limited. Good neighborhoods, good schools, etc are all limited and open to only the select few.

And, the owners of good things will want exclusivity, since they don't want everyone to enjoy their lifestyle. 

So, what will happen is massive increase of rent, property taxes, registration fees, insurance, and other intangibles which no amount of abundance will be able to help.

The prices for such stuff will rise as abundance becomes the norm. It will be useless  to have all these gadgets when you are stuck in a chicken cage like the poorer people of Hong Kong .

In short, price out those who won't make a lot of money because they don't make high wages or do not own properties which bring them sizable income.

It might not be fair or just, but it is the way it is. 

The landowners and capital owners are not going to cut into their profits 'to help people'. They will collect the last penny from the hapless renters, and those who can't pay will - be cast out. Sorry.

With very few good high-paying jobs, and most people having to endure 19th century standard of working conditions and workers' laws because there is no need to treat workers well any more (except, of course, those directly related to the Future),

they will be paying sky-high prices just to cover their basic needs. Many people will fall out, and the owners of capital will not give a crap as Singularity, Space Travel and other great things are just ahead of them.

Same thing as what happened during the Industrial Revolution, during which the standard of living actually FELL. At that time there were colonies to dump excess pop so the pain was relieved somewhat, but since there is nowhere to go for billions of unnecessariats now, they will probably go the way of Neanderthals or the Hobbits (which continued to exist in what is Indonesia till about 1,000 years ago until the Malays eliminated them).",17,3,False,self,,,,,

Do you think it's possible that there might be a Manhattan Project style project for Artificial Intelligence? As AI grows more and more pervasive - and as the potential for it to pose as an existential threat grows as a result - one would think that *some* entity more 'responsible' than the mega corporations pursuing AI right now (like Facebook or Google) would step in to seriously investigate the powers, dangers, and potential ethical implications of AI before the genie is let out of the bottle. Right now though, it seems as if the only entity that could rival the likes of a mega-corporation in the battle to unmask true AI would be some sort of government agency, preferably one that has the ability to engage in clandestine activities. 

We all know that clandestine government operations have been carried out in the past to advance science in the name of war, and that some manner of unethical psychological experiments have been carried out as well for the purpose of being able to better understand and counteract our enemies - The Manhattan Project is notorious, as is Project MK Ultra. Clearly the power of such agencies lies in their ability to explicitly bypass ethical red tape in a way that even incredibly wealthy corporations like Google and Facebook can't seem to do at the moment. 

This did get me wondering though - do you think there's any serious aspect of AI research that would require the bypassing of this ethical red tape? If so, then it stands to reason that a Manhattan Project style project might one day be in the works (or possibly *is* in the works) for artificial intelligence. What do you think something like this would even entail?

&amp;nbsp;

I am currently a student who is hoping to get into the field of AI research in the future. (I have always loved programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc. The ability to make a career out of it *and* orient it towards making a better tomorrow would *baaaasically* be my dream.) However, I am concerned that in the time it takes me to get all the necessary post-graduate degrees and job experience to be an optimal candidate (or even be considered as a candidate) for leaders in artificial intelligence research, we will have hit a metaphorical plateau in our ability to create novel ideas and solve problems. After all- we've made such great bounds in only several years. God knows what's in store the next, say, ten, fifteen, and twenty years. Who's to say that in those years we won't hit a brick wall, so to speak? I fear that by the time I'd be able to contribute to the body of knowledge, research will have slowed to a crawl due to the lack of new things to discover. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, I suppose I'm asking (perhaps in an unnecessarily long-winded way): should we (that is, people my age looking to get into fields that are currently expanding at great speed) even bother? Is it likely that the aforementioned scenario will come to pass? Can we really know?",3,1,False,self,,,,,

For the first time in human history we are realizing that our reality may not be what we think it is without resorting to the metaphysical. This is not to say that we are definitely a product of an alien computing machine, but it is a tantalizing possibility. I will attempt to break the idea down to a few cohesive arguments.

1. Any sufficiently advanced civilization will eventually stumble upon the idea of simulating their own reality in order to study its properties. This provides an unlimited field for experimentation with concepts that might be too dangerous or too expensive to carry out in reality. On top of that, there is also sheer curiosity and natural inquisitiveness. 

2. Simulating a Universe is a monumental, but surmountable technological challenge. Using data compression techniques and limiting logic processing to sections of a simulated world at a time, it is possible to create a virtual world of monumental proportions that is indistinguishable from our Universe for all practical purposes.

3. After many, many abortive attempts, a sufficiently advance civilization will succeed in creating a Universe that behaves roughly the same as their perceived reality. Having created one Universe, it is probable that many other, more refined, simulations will be brought into existence by the same civilization.

4. Within a simulated Universe, the natural evolution will proceed according to the prescribed ""natural"" laws. If the simulation is ""good"" enough, it will lead to the formation of objects that we know as matter/antimatter/energy, and eventually formation of stars, galaxies, and planets. Under favorable conditions, accretion disks around stars will coalesce into planets, and a few billion years of evolution (vastly accelerated in a simulation) will produce organic life.

5. Sentient life will eventually emerge in a sufficiently sophisticated simulated Universe, which will lead it back to step 1. Creation of many simulated Universes by the original, root civilization, coupled with creation of many simulated Universes by the simulated sentient life will lead to an enormous tree of Universes, all but one of which will be simulated.

The chances of us being in the root Universe are 1/n where n may be anything from 1 to infinity. Once we simulate a Universe in the not too distant future, we will be certain that n is at least 2.

The following are a few indicators that our Universe could be a simulated construct.

1. Pixelation concept. A very wise man named Max Planck provided a solid proof that there are limits to how small objects in our Universe can get, and also that no action, such as movement or passage of time, can be smaller than a certain discrete threshold. This is consistent with a digital model of the Universe that is suitable for computing as opposed to an analog one, which would seem more natural.

2. Uncertainty principle. Our Universe behaves exactly like a simulated construct where logic processing is bypassed unless there is a reason to execute it. Unobserved particles are very lazy in the sense that they do not bother to coalesce into a definite position (or other properties) unless we force them to do it by interaction. This could very well indicate a guiding principle where computing power is saved for essential tasks. Double slit experiment and quantum erasure hint at just these types of properties of our world.

3. Age of the Universe. We know that our Universe is quite old, 13.8 billion years or so. However, this is just the time-space continuum that we know of. There is no reason to think that it is the only one that ever happened in the infinite regress of history. Given that sentient life has developed at least one time in our corner of the Universe, there is a very good chance that it happened on many number of occasions as well.",98,44,False,self,,,,,

Would anyone bother owning a car anymore?  Would you simply rent daily or subscribe to a service monthly?

I imagine there would be self driving car companies that you'd typically pay a monthly or yearly subscription to use.  You'd pick your preference of car.  You'd setup your schedule of when you want to use it or simply request it at any time.  When you do, the next available one would drive to your location.  You'd tell it where to go.  It drops you off and then drives away unless you're only going to be there for a few minutes.

If such a paradigm existed it would certainly free up a lot of space.  Parking lots would be smaller.  Garages would be less in demand.  If your car broke down then no worries.  Another would immediately be sent to you without you having to ask.

What else could this change in our world?  ",17,9,False,self,,,,,

Much of that goes to maintaining body processes and regulating the body. 

Conscious thought only takes up 20-50 calories a day. 

I'm going to assume it doesn't matter if your IQ is 160 or 80, I assume it still takes 20-50 calories a day to think. However the quality of thought from the IQ 160 person is much higher. 

However the energy demands are either the same, or even if they are higher probably aren't much higher. I could buy the argument that a very high intellect person burnt an extra 10-20 calories a day via conscious thought, but that is probably the ceiling. They aren't burning an extra 1,000 calories a day by having higher quality thoughts. Even if they were, on an industrial scale 1,000 calories a day is trivial. 

As we develop higher and higher quality AI reaching IQs of 200, 300, 1000+ does this imply that the energy demands of quality intelligence are not that high? Or that the hardware doesn't need to grow dramatically to see increases in intelligence? ie, an intelligence 10x stronger doesn't need 10x more hardware and 10x more energy, since among humans having an intellect 10x stronger requires basically the same hardware and energy demands between a dullard and a genius? 

I know right now, a computer that can do the work of a human brain would require MW of power. However, the brain energy difference between a biological genius and a dullard is probably 20 calories a day. 

FWIW, one barrel of oil has over 1 million calories in it. Obviously solar and nuclear have far more energy in them. 

So I guess my question is this. The energy requirements for conscious thought are trivial (by modern industrial standards). However even among that trivial amount of energy, the degree of conscious thought can vary dramatically. A person may spend 20-50 calories a day watching looney tunes or they may spend 20-50 calories a day coming up with inventions at MIT. 

So does this imply that quality of conscious thought (ie g factor intelligence) does not have a linear relationship with energy consumption or quantity of hardware (in the case of humans, neurons)? Or is it just that the human brain is so suboptimal, that mild improvements in efficiency can result in higher quality thought for the same energy expenditure? 

In the future, will the energy requirements of superintelligent AI be a bottleneck? Or does the fact that the energy requirements of biological brains for quality cognition is so minor show that this isn't going to be a major bottleneck scientists have to deal with in trying to create superintelligence? 

Basically this: Will superintelligence in the future be limited by hardware, or does the fact that such massive differences in quality intelligence among biological humans show that hardware itself will not be the limiting factor (more software)? 

Or is the brain so suboptimal that even minor hardware differences (how parts of the brain are connected) can result in massive differences in quality intelligence, so using the brain as an example of the energy demands of superintelligence is not really useful. 

It'd be like a modern sports car vs a 70s pinto. Both get maybe 20mpg, but one is much higher quality than the other. However that isn't related to the thermodynamics of cars, it is just that one is more efficient and well made than the other. Neither is anywhere near their thermodynamic peak, so there is still massive room for improvement. 

So maybe the human brain isn't anywhere near optimal efficiency for intelligence, and there is a lot of room. But either way, the fact that the calories in a handful of rice is all it takes to power the conscious thoughts of a genius seems to imply that energy requirements for superintelligence are not high, and it also seems to imply you do not need dramatically more hardware to have superintelligence, since among humans the quality of intelligence is unrelated to the quantity of hardware (smart people don't have more neurons), however it is related to how the hardware is interconnected (which would arguably be software).

Here's my current list:

1. Eat lab-grown meat and the best plant-based imitations.
2. Get my whole genome sequenced. 
3. Ride in a self driving car.
4. Write code for a quantum computer.
5. ~~Grow some hydroponic plants.~~ (not futuristic enough)
6. ~~Run something substantial off solar power.~~ (not futuristic enough)
7. Have a conversation with a real-time translation system (like Pixel Buds).
8. Sign up for cryonics
9. Use CRISPR to change genes of a living organism
10. Build my own deep neural network for a personal project
11. Create a dashboard with as much quantifiable self data and automatically mine it for correlations/insights.
12. Collaborate on a project over virtual reality.
13. Get a magnetic finger implant.
14. Experience microgravity with ""vomit comet"" flight.
15. Print an actual useful item with a 3D printer (anyone have an idea?)
16. Write code for a quantum computer and at least run on a simulator.
17. Run code on a supercomputer.
18. Create an autonomous company on Ethereum.

These should be things either doable now, or something I can do that has a fixed release date (like the Pixel Buds), but not things on vague timeframes (like ""in the next 5-10 years""). They don't have to be completely novel (solar power definitely isn't), but should be things that are not yet mainstream enough that most people will have done it. It needs to be framed as something you can actually do, not just mentioning a cool technology.

What activities would you put on this list?

I do not like very much gambling, but since few weeks ago I have been perceiving how too many people play a new lottery game in my city, this game is not the classic 3 numbers game, it is a roullette, like the casino roullette but with one extra number 00, this game is not regulated by the goverment, they share the results every day through twitter... Now you can imagine how fixed is this. As I said, I do not like gambling, never played there, but I have been investigating about it and I found they do 8 draws, at 10,11,12,13,16,17,18 and 19 hours respectively.

They provide a software to each agency who want to sell their tickets, that software put the information about all sales in their DB, maybe in each draw they release the number with the smallest bets.

Yesterday I started to code a simple program to analyze the results, they are in the market since march, and I found the way to get all these results, now I have it on my DB.

I am writing here because I found an inconsistency in randomness and I want to share it with you, tonight I decided to not continue with the project since I do not see any pattern, and I just wanted to do this as a leisure project. But just in case its works then we will become rich, haha.

What I did:
My program check the records and tell me the percent of ocurrences of each number after and before the selected one.

But if there are 38 numbers, each number must have a probability of 0.38% but this is showing me other thing, look:

For the number 21 drawed on Oct 23 17H
http://prntscr.com/h291bc

Red dot: Percent of numbers after a 21,
Blue dot: Percent of numbers before a 21

This game is 8 month old, and I can not believe how numbers: 10 14 18 19 24 25 27 31 32 34 35 00; Never showed up after a 21

Now, this result is for a 21 drawed on Oct 20 19H
http://prntscr.com/h292zh

The percents are a bit high, because they get redistributed on Oct 23.

Sorry if I did not explain me very well, I am not english native speaker, but before I drop this project I wanted to share it with you guys, maybe you see something that I don't? Are not these chance percents very strange?

What kind of analysis could you add to this program?",3,0,False,self,,,,,

Short sellers think so.

The most recent article regarded Tesla and Panasonic. Volkswagen and Tesla are both shopping around for huge quantities of cobalt and the suppliers are laughing at them.  Tesla/Panasonics sole provider of required cobalt powder, Sumitomo, is running at maximum capacity and using all of their mining capacity as well. That looks to restrict Tesla car production to 250,000 cars per year for the next five to 10 years. (At that rate Tesla loses money and goes bankrupt.)

Chinas cobalt production - and of several miners funded by Chinese money - is reserved for Chinese use. Thats almost 1/2 of world production. 

Longer term there isn't enough nickel, magnesium, lithium production, and other things to support electric vehicles production above 5% to 10% of existing car production.

I get that, and it's an admirable aim in many ways, but it seems kind of like teaching a fish to ride a bicycle, filling its head with meaningless concepts like 'handlebars' and 'helmet', when all you want the fish to do is swim from A to B.

I'd like to read up on artificial intelligence experts  who focus on more of an 'inhuman' aspect, particularly the ones whose endgames are quantum physics &amp; cosmology &amp; philosophy. Is there a program that is learning to prove or disprove God? I would love to know.

Instead people do creative or interesting works (tv, music, movies, games, programming, writing etc) for others purely for luxury items such as premium foods or other unnecessary but pleasing items. To monitor all the automation running the various aspects of life for signs of external influence or manipulation against the will of the people (as voted on in a typical democratic process) a bitcoin/trustless like system of monitoring is implemented. This monitoring is accomplished by basic computing devices everyone has as their access to the Internet and for entertainment purposes. These devices can be used personally or left to idle as part of the mining/monitoring process. You earn currency like you do with typical cryptocurrency mining and that currency is then used for luxuries for those that either choose not to earn more of these mainly merit like form of currency.


Hopefully the beauty of this system is that while we will be at an all time high in terms of guaranteed quality of life for all humans the luxury items will create a sense of climb and challenge that I feel is necessary for us to not just sort of collapse under our own entropy. Certain groups will feel oppressed because their style of creations or inputs aren't valued as well as they feel they should be, the amount of merits needed for some things will seem unfair etc. ",41,10,False,self,,,,,

If that isnt the case, you can stop reading to avoid my ignorance :)

The scenario I am describing is where a self-driving car is going to crash and it has calculated the odds of several outcomes.. Lets assume this is a really bad scenario (no minimal injury option) and the only outcomes to choose from are ie: Will it kill the driver inside, the person on the sidewalk or a third person crossing the street.

Accepting the principal computers will almost always make better decisions than humans, could the following (or anything like this) work as part of each countries laws and voted on by citizens as law?

We each get a life value score out of 100. You give universal attributes to people. For example, in general a 5 year old childs life is always worth more than a 30 year old. You remove the uncontrollables like race, gender and give little influence to things like income, but it would for sure hold minimal weight. I acknowledge there are always exceptions (ie: Trump or Trudeau outrank all, they run countries). 

I think you know where I am going with this... is it that crazy of a concept?  In theory, the autonomous cars example will have a HALO safety affect (benefiting everyone in society) which would net net decrease your likelihood of being hurt or dying by car.

I would see it being incredibly complex, tens of thousands of considerations going into ones ranking. But ultimately its the same rankings as Madden, just voted on by each country.

Crazy? Dumb? Poke holes, seriously I have no shame. :)

I am currently writing my dissertation for my final year project.The essay question is;

Has technology ""ruined"" travelling as we know it?

I am breaking up the essay into sections of past, present and future.

For the future section, I was wondering if any of you's would know of books, movies, anything that would relate to technology that will impact travel in the future and how it's changing.

I have found a few books on the subject but I don't want to buy them just yet as they might not be right for the subject.

[The Inevitable](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Inevitable-Understanding-Technological-Forces-Future/dp/0525428089)- by Kevin Kelly

[The Upstarts](https://www.amazon.com/Upstarts-Airbnb-Companies-Silicon-Changing/dp/0316396818)- by Brad Stone

I will probably get the second book.

It's more the fact that finding well-sourced information (that's not from some random website) that will look good in a bibliography is hard.

Any help will be great.

Thanks in advance,
Zack

Or just because we can.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/79qadm/oil_and_butter_production_from_the_lab_to_fight/,epSos-DE,1509393558,"Recently we see the production of meat-substitutes from plants and synthetic meat from the lab.

I think it might be much easier to produce oil or butter, or coconut butter from genetically modified algae.

Oil or butter is much more simple than the different cells in meat and the fibers for the texture.

The palm oil is literally in every other product like margarine, cookies, processed foods, and vegetarian products.

The palm oil or the use of farm animals is inefficient and bad for the environment, if we can produce the same result with genetically modified algae or yogurt bacteria.

Also, the price of olive oil is too high. Might it be reduced by the algae that produces olive oil ?


**Any examples, ideas, or experiences** with this idea that seems much more simple to implement than growing meat in the lab ?",0,1,False,self,,,,,

In terms of history, the French Revolution was a non-event. The French monarchy survived until 1871 in one form or another, and only the childlessness of the last Bourbon heir ended it. The political structure in 1860 was largely the same as that of 1560, with minor changes. Even now Britain has the House of Lords, which can veto the House of Commons.

Today's social structure is unbreakable. The elites have all the chips, tech, weapons, etc. And there is no revolution possible since it is very unlikely that the rebels will have the tech available to the elites.

The world will continue as it is , with increasingly many people falling from it to a life of destitution. We had 3 continents to dump the poor during the Industrial Revolution, but now we don't have any so they will have to be culled. Those who will emigrate to other planets will tend to be the best of species, not these people.

No change will be made. Today's tech giants will choose to be integrated into the System since making a new system is more expensive and causes too much disruption, just as the newly minted billionaires eagerly accepted the title of Barons , granted by the monarch and government, instead of going for bigger things (or, in America, marrying their daughters to such people).

As Transhumans become more prevalent, they will hold more political offices and will pass political decisions favorable to transhumans, but the structure will not change, as seen in many countries still having kings and queens. Transhumans are superior to humans but they will decide keeping the social structure is more beneficial than changing it.
