Trying to write a little blurb about impact technology will have on jobs. I want to know what are some of the best statistics (reputable sources) and technology that shows we're headed in this direction. Would be nice to have collection of links that gives a real sense of where we're at currently and an estimate where we'll be in 10 years, 20 years and so on. Such as the Oxford study that showed a 47% unemployment rate in 10 years. I think it would be good if we could come up with an idea of how it will happen (which technologies will able it), when it will happen and the possible solutions to the sustainability of a work free society. Just one big collaborative list since all the information is all over the place. ",16,21

We have 8 billion human population.    
From this point on, nobody ever dies, *ever*.    
Each woman decides to have only one child because:    
* it is the socially responsible thing to do.    
* all people become socially responsible.    

The result would be:

The next generation would only add 4 billion people.    
And the one after that only 2 billion.    
And we asymptotically approach a total of 16 billion.    
(If my math is not too rusty already. Please correct if wrong).    

Of course it is only a hypothetical ideal case. I'm not saying that this is what the future will be. Only that it could be more into this direction than the predicted overpopulation apocalypse that agers keep worrying about.",46,24

So unless you are one of the super wealthy who can afford it, you are still looking at the grave. This should make you even sadder as you get older in that if you had only just buckled down you might could have afforded immortality treatments.

So for those who CAN afford it, are those the type of folks we want to be immortal. There are tons of people out there who probably shouldn't have as much power as they do but there's not a lot we can do about them. The only grand leveler is the end. It comes to all of them, no matter what. Now take that away and Kim Jong Il or Josef Stalin can live centuries. 

Some folks already treat their fellow beings like trash, completely detached from the suffering they cause. Now make them immortal, give them even more reason to be detached from the condition that is human existence. One could HOPE for increased wisdom over the ages but its no guarantee.

I can only imagine that almost every facet of human life would be utterly and drastically throw into chaos but maybe I am wrong.

Anyone thought about how humanity might survive the realization of a functional immortality. How would we as a species handle who gets to be immortal, how we would treat others who are immortal, or even those who aren't? How would our economic and governmental structures work in a world with immortal people?

In this scenery, I believe it's very likely that some portion of humans will get access to these intelligence improvements, before some others. For example, wealthy people might afford it before than others. So I was thinking it would be likely to cause riots, complaints for the injustice and a separation between humans and intelligence-improved-humans (cyborgs). Injustice could come with better opportunities for cyborgs (please imagine human-like cyborgs, not robots) in jobs for example.

Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization (e.g., political, advertising, religious or public relations) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by a grassroots participant(s).

In the next Presidential election will astroturfing be done by a narrow AI? Will we even be able to tell that we're arguing with a human or an AI on reddit?

I envisioned it being configured with a list of subreddits to post non-astroturf stuff, but when election time rolls around it would be given a list of 'talking points' for the day/week and told to focus on /r/politics or whichever sub they wanted to focus on.",9,10

Each picture was circular, with a point labeling technology as it is today and as you worked around the circle you would hit a new node that showed a probable future advancement in the specified field. What made this collection interesting was that for each category, the creator put each advancements the order they would most likely be realized, how they would build on each other to realize the final node in the wheel, which always ended in far-out-there scifi dream technology.

Lets say that some astronomical phenomena was discovered that would destroy humanity if we do not develop to become a type III civilization on the Kardashev scale by the year 2200. Assume that meant that nations all over the world prioritized R&amp;D to try to get humanity there as fast as possible to prevent the species from going extinct. 

So lets assume money is not the problem like it is now (right now it seems like researchers are competing very hard for limited jobs and limited funds) and nations and private industry dump money into R&amp;D to help humanity get to where it needs to be. 

What would be the upper limit of what % humanity could spend on R&amp;D, and still get a decent return? There are lots of people who could work in R&amp;D who choose not to for various reasons (lack of jobs, lack of pay, better options in other fields, etc) and even among those who do work in the field there is a lot of competition for finite resources like funding and jobs. 

During WW2 nations were spending 40% of GDP on military spending (as opposed to the 2-3% they spend now). I seriously doubt there is enough human capital to take advantage of 40% of GDP devoted to R&amp;D, but what is a realistic upper limit for how much human capital there is for R&amp;D assuming that financial capital was prioritized? 7%?

At the beginning of this year, a couple fellow redditors and myself started a podcast based on the topics and concepts found here in this subreddit.  

Unfortunately, one of our previous hosts had to leave the podcast because of some crucial issues in his personal life. So we are looking for another person interested in hosting and further developing the podcast.  

We are looking for someone with the following qualities:  
- In-depth knowledge in technology and science related topics.  
- Ability to think on his or her feet when faced with unexpected questions.  
- Can lead a discussion and come up with interesting follow-up questions.  
- Experience editing audio using Audacity, Logic, etc.  
- Frequently listens to podcasts and is familiar with the medium.  
- Passionate and committed towards Futurology and wants to contribute to the larger conversation.  

If you are interested, send me a message telling me about yourself and how you relate to the qualities above. I will also send interested individuals a link to our website so you can listen to some of our recent episodes.  

Thank you!",3,6

277,2016-5-4,2016,5,4,5,4hq1pm,A look at a zero sum way to UBI,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4hq1pm/a_look_at_a_zero_sum_way_to_ubi/,AndyJxn,1462307394,"It seems that most examples of UBI assume that it will be a nett cost to government (&amp; therefore tax).  I was curious to look at how it could work as a zero sum.  I'm in UK so I use figures from here

We pay income tax (and National Insurance, effectively another income tax) at escalating rate, above a certain threshold.  Same is going to be the case in most 'western' countries.   We also have a 'safety net' welfare system, helping both the unemployed (job seekers allowance) and the low paid (working tax credits)

I did a bit of number crunching &amp; got to this.  If we leave everything exactly as it is bar three things, we can get UBI and it be broadly zero sum.  

Change these:  
tax ALL income, starting at the basic rate of 20%, and escalating (by virtue of NI starting at 8k pa) as before.

Eliminate job seekers allowance and working tax credits (leave all other benefits the same).

Pay everyone UBI equivalent to job seekers allowance. That's 3800 pa, not a huge figure but it's what the govt reckons you can survive on.

It comes out remarkably neutral no matter what income level.  A little bit of tweaking of thresholds &amp; rates &amp; I got it pretty damn close, just ironed out some of the oddities in the current system (such as the 10-13K range when income tax/NI PLUS benefit clawback means an effective marginal rate of 70%). If it's tweaked so no one loses, and it is neutral at the threshold of upper rate tax, then I think it'd be a nett cost to govt of about 650m, which is pretty minimal in govt expenditure terms.

Obviously there are a lot of other things that could be brought in to make it make more sense, and the 3800 is pretty low.  However it is a way to start without it being too much of a sea change.",3,3

Since Type I Civ is used for Kardashev Type I, which I now think might be too excessive since there are ways to do what it can without spending all these energy, I would call it Civ 2.0.

http://greyenlightenment.com/our-perhaps-less-lnteresting-times/

Tl, dr: The days for political and other discourses have ended. There is simply no more things to talk about, no more businesses to open, and no more entrepreneurship , etc. 

Things will stay as it is now with very minor changes. All the money will be made by the huge behemoths , like Amazon, with very little left for everything else.

http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/03/pinker-explains-the-long-peace/

Steven Pinker says the world will enjoy a long peace due to changed circumstances.

Sure, there will be wars in the hinterlands, but they won't affect the part of the world which does matter.

http://greyenlightenment.com/the-indefatigability-of-the-unparticipatory-economic-boom/

Tl, dr: Huge economic gains will be made but most of humanity will not be allowed to share their fruits and all the wealth and power will be claimed by the lucky few, with the rest having reduced to simply watch all these prosperity , having no power to say or influence anything.

===

All of these are preparing the world for Civ 2.0. With those who stand to gain nothing from in having been disenfranchised, emasculated and disarmed (with the high-tech weaponry still not completely disclosed. all the guns held by the poor will be as effective as the bows of the natives when Europeans invaded their land)

http://greyenlightenment.com/millennials-the-commoditization-of-intelligence-and-why-democracy-doesnt-work/

&gt;In a post-2008 world, tact, nuance, and not overgeneralizing has become important, compared to the shoot-from-hip style of writing that typifies independent blogging  which began its slow decline in 2008 or so with the rise of social media and professionally written long-form online journalism.

&gt;In the past, society was slow and uneducated, with interest rates too high. Now its smart and fast-paced thanks to the internet, education, financialization, technology, and other other factors. This is the transition from type-0 to type-1 civilization status, unfolding before our eyes

===

I do not agree 100% with the above opinions because resources could run out before we reach Civ 2.0. 

However, when resources begin to run out, population could be reduced to kick the can as far as possible. With most of the world's 7.5 billions having no say about their own destiny (i.e. basic income receivers), just stopping the food trains for a month will free up enough resources to kick the can a bit further.

It would be like the hapless natives of Mexica as the Spaniards (and a few tribes which helped them) dominated them without impunity and converting them to a religion revering some women they never even heard of before. Eventually only the genes of those who submitted survived.",2,2

The following is a (lengthy, sorry) description of how that may be experienced, in about 50 years.

You are subscribed to one of a number of traffic services that knows your schedule and habits.  It isn't necessary, but very convenient.  For instance, it knows that you left work very late last night, didn't generate any data until a half hour later than usual the next morning, and don't seem in a hurry to catch up, so it delays deploying a car from the traffic swarm to pick you up.  

This is convenient if you live in the suburbs.  If you lived in an urban environment with a major thoroughfare directly outside your building, you wouldn't bother with that aspect of the service - you would just step outside and stand at one of the designated access points on the curb (maybe painted a special color) and the next car in the swarm that's part of your service would pick you up instantly.  

If your account level is such, only an unoccupied car will pick you up, which might delay the pickup by like 30 seconds.  Or if you're cool with it to save $10 a month and a few minutes a day, any car with an open seat.  Urban-dwellers who were once accustomed to public transit usually opt for the share option, while suburbanites in their psychological shells prefer to ride alone.  

You may, in your subscription account settings, designate preferences about the cars that pick you up: Exterior color, shape, ride height, interior color and seat covering, etc.  The exterior paint is able to change instantly to meet your settings when a car picks you up, and for a special charge it may display personalized graphics or ads.  Cheaper traffic services display ads by default both inside and outside the car and make you pay for a higher account level to turn them off.

Most people ignore these settings and leave them to default, but for special charges you can go wild: Order any kind of street-legal car at all.  With no hassle and not long of a wait, you might - for a special occasion - order yourself a Rolls Royce.  And since you would only be riding in it briefly, average people would be able to experience executive-class luxury without going through the ordeal like today of renting the vehicle. 

Despite being shared, the car interiors would remain in relatively good condition for the obvious reason that employees of the service can see who did any kind of damage or vandalism and charge them for it.  This is one downside of this future: The cameras are always on, with one capitalist caveat to the Orwellian scenario - you can pay to turn them off.  Likely that option also comes with making the windows opaque.  

What people would do when they pay to turn off the cameras is easy to guess, so it might be that services automatically return cars to their center directly after a no-camera ride for cleanup.  Or, if they're a bargain service, they would instead just depend on riders to report an unclean car.

So now you are in your automated service car, and let's say you're alone, so it has adjusted to your settings.  You are not wearing a seatbelt because collisions or sudden stops are so rare that the cost of even installing seatbelts is pointless.  However, there are airbags throughout the interior, largely for rider peace of mind - much like the safety features on airlines despite the absurd safety of air travel.

The interior of the car is not like today, but more like a booth in a restaurant or cafe, with a table, TV/computer screen, electrical outlet, trash bin, and for some services a few disposable amenities like hand sanitizer, napkins, and other things like that.  Acceleration is so smooth that there is no need for cup holders, so you can just have beverages open on the table.

Again for peace of mind, there is a prominent Emergency Stop button that will force the car to pull over wherever it is and open the doors.  There is also a special button to take you to the nearest hospital, and another to take you to the nearest police station.  All of the emergency buttons override privacy settings and record all data in order to help hospital staff determine the nature of a medical emergency, police with criminal investigations, or just to protect the traffic service from liability claims.

The car assumes by default that you want to be taken on your preset routines - whichever is closest in timing - unless you tell it otherwise, and over time learns your quirks so that even seemingly spontaneous choices may be anticipated.  If it learns that being anticipated annoys you, it will pretend not to know in advance what you want.  :)  

Although the ride is silky smooth, your car *never* stops from the moment it picks you up until the moment it drops you off.  It speeds up, it slows down, and it may even swerve to avoid sudden intrusions by animals or people, but in the car's ""mind"" - and in the mind of the collective traffic system of which it is a part - these events are hardly surprises.  They sense them far in advance, and accomplish so much computation before they become truly dangerous that the resulting maneuvers are likewise silky smooth.  Almost balletic, even.

The traffic swarm flows like water, with cars merging in and peeling off fluidly.  Rapid changes in speed by one to deal with an emergent obstacle do not visibly ""accordion"" in the rest of the traffic, because the information is processed too rapidly for the human eye to see, with nearby cars making graceful maneuvers to compensate efficiently while the changes in more distant cars are too minute to notice.  

Cars cross intersections at full speed, interleaved with the cross-traffic.  They can make turns at whatever speed they are physically able without tipping over, although default settings on a traffic service would minimize lateral g forces on turns.  There are no lanes - cars move however they deem most efficient.  There won't even need to be medians: Although having two ""streams"" is most efficient, there will be no reason to forbid a car from moving against traffic if at some point it would save time.  Though people might still find that idea terrifying enough to restrict.

While it can happen in rare disasters, as far as the experience of the ordinary person goes, traffic jams are the stuff of post-apocalyptic horror movies - not real-world experience.  Even the total physical destruction of an entire road would only delay traffic long enough to calculate alternate routes.  Although brief software bugs and hacks have been known to mess with traffic in localized areas on occasion, making cars behave oddly, inefficiently, or in comical prankster-ish ways.

Because traffic is so coordinated, ""food trucks"" will take on entirely new significance: No longer just *parked* trucks where you order food, your car can drive up alongside them at speed on freeways and you can order food.  The exact mechanics of the transfer aren't worth speculating about, but both vehicles would be moving so smoothly that it shouldn't be either difficult or dangerous.

Occasionally, a vehicle driven by a human will be seen in traffic.  The vast majority of these vehicles are safeguarded up the yin-yang, with the car's AI watching every single move and ready to leap into action if the human screws up.  But on very rare occasions, a *classical* automobile with no automation will enter the swarm, and it will be given a wide berth by the swarm.  People in the surrounding cars will stare at the unprotected human driver, wearing a *seatbelt* and maybe even a helmet, and think ""What an idiot!""

They will stare and assume that a fatal crash is imminent, but of course it doesn't happen.  Because this driver is not like today's drivers - any random person who can pass a multiple-choice test and prove they can drive a car for five minutes without causing an explosion.  No, this driver is more like today's professional automotive test drivers and race car drivers, and had to pass similar standards in order to get a license to drive on public roads.

The driver may be the greatest driver in human history, with cat-like reflexes and the eyes of an eagle, but compared to the dumbest of the cars around him, he is a blind, deaf toddler on a wobbly motorcycle.  The ""thoughts"" of the AI system around him echo the ""What an idiot!"" sentiment in their own way: ""Network-isolated, sub-optimal guidance system at coordinates (x, y, z).  Special avoidance protocols active.""  

But that is a special rarity, to which few aspire: Most even of those who like to drive themselves are content to drive AI-protected cars, and even that much is considered a strange and pointless fetish by the vast majority of people.  

No longer limited by human senses and reflexes, but only by rider comfort and the hard limits of the physical systems, speed limits disappear.  Laws cease to be relevant, and instead are replaced by dynamic regulations imposed on the software: (Vehicle type) must, on road surfaces with (friction math), turning at (arc function), remain under speed (function of preceding variables) at (point along arc).

As a result, travel that once took half an hour now takes 10 minutes due to the combination of high speeds, no stopping, and optimized traffic flow.  You live pretty much wherever you want over a *vast* area, regardless of where you work.  Living 100 miles from your job is nothing, and even if it were a lot more than that, your ""commute"" can consist of sitting around watching TV and eating breakfast.

But the urban case is also improved: Living in a dense city no longer means that transportation is a nightmare.  Parking is irrelevant - something machines handle when you're not looking, in places you never see.  Being a pedestrian is no longer dangerous, except from other pedestrians and maybe cyclists.

And that's just the transportation future directly related to automobiles.  If more radical changes occur via systems such as Hyperloop, via upscaled drone aircraft capable of human transport, and the more typical ""whoa factor"" stuff in spaceflight, that's even more amazing.  But even right on the ground, right out your door, this is the stuff we pretty much *know* is likely to happen.    ",2,5

Snapchat has moved on from old-school 'smartphones' to VR and so now we can watch our friends snapchats in 360 video as if we were looking at the world through their eyes. All the celebrities I follow vie for attention with full vlog episodes of days in their lives, but I'm pretty sure most of them are faking it. I heard a rumour that most of them just employ people to film interesting videos of a lavish lifestyle for the attention and then claim it's coming from their goggles. 

I know, It's probably super weird for you guys to hear this, but Kanye West is one of the most popular vloggers in the world right now. He's actually grown sick of his egoic personality and now he strives for realism and honesty in his vlogs. I usually follow through Kanye's day, as he spends the weekend with young 13 year old North West and speaks maturely and candidly about his divorce with Kim and why you should always get a prenuptial agreement.

After I've caught up with everything in my feed, I log in to school via my goggles and get all my work done. I feel bad for kids with traditional parents, who have to actually physically go to school, rather than just logging in with their goggles. Once finished, I usually log in to Facebook, which these days, features a virtual world where you can socialise with others and play VR games. Hackers keep screwing with the physics, so it's a bit glitchy at times, but when it works, it's actually really fun and I've met some of my closest friends through Facebook VR.

To chill out, I like watching new release movies on Netflix. Netflix has decimated the movie theatre industry with Netflix Cinema - a subscription service that gives you access to watch the newest movies in a virtual reality cinema. In Netflix cinema you can view the movie on a big virtual screen in your goggles, you can pause the movie whenever you want and after watching it, you can talk in a virtual reality room to other people around the world that just watched the same movie. 10 years ago, most people would've been too socially introverted to talk to any random person at the cinema about a movie, but these days, given the anonymity provided by VR, and the fact you can just exit out of the cinema app whenever you want, it's easy to talk face-to-face to like-minded people and make friends through VR social apps.

It's annoying to hear my parents talk about VR ruining the social lives of today's kids just because we stay inside nearly every day. Like seriously, Dad was born in the 80's, before the INTERNET even existed. He's a dinosaur. Plus, his generation just sends messages with written text and pictures using different retro touchscreens and computers. How anti-social and impersonal is that? At least with VR, we actually have real conversations.

It's interesting how when VR first came out, everyone just thought of it only being used for gaming and porn. Now it's basically becoming the backbone to our society.

Since One Direction got back together, my little sister has been watching their music videos non-stop. Some of the immersion in VR music videos is kinda weird to me, but she loves it. She loves the way they make it feel like they are singing directly to her. I find it super creepy. Those dudes are getting to be a little too old to sing like that to my little sister...

I also like tuning into Periscope to watch one of the many live vloggers that let us follow them through every second of every day. It's interesting seeing life from the perspective of another person. My parents think it's weird to watch an unedited stream of someone's life, but I find the voyeurism and the immersion in someone else's life really engaging. Plus, it's cool how the most popular vlog streamers just wake up and walk through life being able to do whatever they want. Companies literally give them everything for free, just so the vlogger uses the companys products and services in their stream in front of their millions of followers. I really want to be a live vlogger when I finish school.

After a long day, I often order pizza with the Dominos VR app. It's kind-of gimmicky with the way I need to swipe through the pizzas in front of a virtual pizza oven and how I'm meant to physically add each ingredient I want with the VR pizza creator, but when they send out the pizza delivery drone to the house, I like the way I can view the 360 video feed from the drone as it flies here. I think that's really cool.

When having a shower, that's when I usually take my goggles off and start looking at the 'real world'. I used to keep my VR goggles on when having a shower, so I could keep watching live AMAs on Reddit while getting ready for bed, but I've heard way too many horror stories of hackers being able to see my goggles VR video feed without me knowing, so now I just don't take them in the shower or toilet at all.

When it's time for bed, I must admit, I do sometimes watch adult VR videos... Mum tried to block adult content, but I managed to find a tutorial on YouTube to get around that. The other night, I found a site where you just paste the link of someone's Facebook profile to the site, then it maps that persons face to the pornstar in any of their VR videos. Don't judge me, I know it's super messed up and I haven't done it yet, but it's certainly intriguing...

Virtual reality has brought on the biggest social change since the Internet. It really is funny how people used to think it was just a passing fad. I guess a lot can change in 10 years and everything really is much clearer in retrospect.

*I wrote this with the initial intention of making an animation of it for my YouTube channel. I'm not too good with animation, so if you liked this little brain dump on what it's like to live with VR in 2026 and you're into animation, send me a message and perhaps we can make a video for it :)*

My name is 'GeekBite' on all social media for those that are interested

Somewhere in between 2040-2070 we are supposed to have ASI. Artificial Super Intelligence - one which will either destroy humanity or grant us immortality: http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html

There is no doubt in anyone's mind that once ASI is invented, life will be tremendously different from today, granted that it doesn't destroy us first.

One of these changes that it is likely to bring about is unemployment. Most, if not all, jobs will vanish and be redirected to ASI.

We are already seeing this. There will be an unemployment spike of about 15% in the US in just ten years with autonomous driving taking over the trucking industry.

I'm a college student and I study hard but I can't help but wonder what if all my hard work is going to be for nothing. Once ASI exists, there is not going to be any need for human intervention at all.

It's really a crazy thought to think about. I like to think that our society today is close to a meritocracy, one in which we are rewarded for contributing to the human race's progression. In 50 years, it'll be all about leisure. Human progression will be up to ASI at that point in time.",6,8

I though, well, don't need it to respect human goals and values.  We need it to respect human intent.  We need AI to want to safeguard us, mostly as we are.

We need it to tend us like an organic crop.  We need it to understand our ideal state of being, with all of its inconsistencies and imperfections, as a balanced environment in which we are raised for the best result.  It doesn't need to understand good and evil, or make decisions about whether it's better to let one driver due to save seven innocent pedestrians.  It needs to understand that the elements of risk, randomness, adversity and affluence are a balance which is the best growing environment for us.  

If you really want to bake your noodle, consider that it may considered the best growing environment for us if we didn't know that the AI was tending the crop.

668,2016-5-7,2016,5,7,16,4i93bt,"Hi Reddit! I am Unc!e and I am working on a project called Game of Life. I believe it can form the basis of a futuristic economic system, but I desperately need your input [2].",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4i93bt/hi_reddit_i_am_unce_and_i_am_working_on_a_project/,polln,1462604774,"I already posted this a few hours ago but because I am a Reddit noob, I accidentally deleted it thinking it was a duplicate that got spam-filtered by the bot. I will reply to the comments that were there before --

&amp;nbsp;

Hi, Reddit! My name is Unc!e. I am a neuroscience graduate/programming hobbyist currently gainfully unemployed and living on welfare in Melbourne, Australia. Every day for the last year and a half, I have been obsessed with drafting a perfect/eternal socio-politico-economic model that can rid the world of all indignity and injustice (or come as close to it as it can). 

&amp;nbsp;

Recently, I had come to the daunting realization that my vision is extremely grandiose and that I, as one mere individual, possess very limited knowledge and technical capability to accomplish what so many philosophers/technologists/economic theorists tried to accomplish over many years. It is now clear to me that this must be a collective effort of the grandest scale; through meticulously and elegantly orchestrated collaboration. So I thought to myself: what better place to start than the one place that is so chaotically beautiful and saturated with talent and ingenuity - Reddit!

&amp;nbsp;

I believe that many societal problems have a lot to do with economic structure. We see unprecedented wealth inequality in many countries because the current global economic/political structures possess self-reinforcing feedback loops to direct the flow of wealth towards a small percentage of individuals. This effect is compounded by the commoditizability of political power. When a politician's political dignity is compromised for monetary gain and vested interests, it creates a void in our democratic system, which is waiting to be filled with corruption, war and bloodshed. It is unjust and indignant that the current politico-economy is a game for the few rich and powerful to exploit the middle and lower class. It is the same age-old story, powerfully narrated by this Orwellian quote - ""The upper class desire to remain so, the middle class wish to overthrow the upper class, and the lower class want a classless system"".

&amp;nbsp;

Another serious issue vigorously discussed is gender inequality. It is not coincidental that we see a correlation between womens' economic freedom and their civil freedom. Women who are economically crippled are forced to be reliant on their male counterparts to survive; effectively making them mere assesories to men, subjecting them to all kinds of indignity. We can see this effect being exasperated in countries and cultures where there are religious doctrines in place to reinforce it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Maybe I hold a pessimistic view about the economic status quo but when peoples' lives and livelihoods are hanging in the balance, I believe it is a Pascalian wager to be unreservedly pessimistic -  in order to avoid a dystopian future that is owned by a few rich and powerful(and probably predominantly male). This calls for a reimagining of current economic/political structures. 

&amp;nbsp;

I envision that in the future, there will be different modes where people can exercise their economic avatars (virtually or non-virtually). Giant tech companies like Google, Facebook and Uber have accomplished exactly this, creating their own ecosystems in which service providers and customers can exercise their economic endeavors, while largely circumventing the existing economic rules. And that is why new technologies are so disruptive to the politico-economic status quo. 

&amp;nbsp;

There's no argument that huge tech companies provide great and sometimes ""free"" services that enhance many lives. However, we have to be wary of many other hidden costs that are associated with these ""free"" services. For example, Facebook provides a ""free"" service at the expense of your privacy; they analyze your personal information, like browsing habits and interests, and sell them to advertisers so they can strategically place on your screens any information of their choice. This increases the demand for surveillance because there is now massive amounts of money to be made in the growing information economy, but at the same time, this greatly diminishes individuals' intellectual freedom and privacy. You can argue that if one is dissatisfied with Facebook's service, one can easily deactivate their accounts and use alternative means to socialize and browse information. The problem with extremely popular tech monopolies/oligopolies is that they shrink the market and create a punishing effect for escaping their ecosystems. So, even if you want to quit Facebook, it is extremely inconvenient for you because all your social contacts are on there, and even if MSN/ICQ are still around (which they are not), nobody uses them anymore. I guess you can use Whatsapp... Oh wait, Facebook owns that too. 

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, so we have gone through this narrative of extreme capitalism and its end-game where monopolies establish their eternal foothold by buying political power and people live in a happy dystopia where they are reduced to mere data to be extract profit from (but at least there is still Uber to get to where you're going, right?). What is the solution then? Communism? Socialism? Technocratism? Faith in the singularity to save everything and everyone?

&amp;nbsp;

Personally, I don't think any -ism is the answer to any problem. We tend to make the mistake of morally labeling ideologies and institutions when the moral implication lies with the people who use them and their intent of using them. Ultimately, it is up to us to make a change. But to make a change, we must demand power. And to demand power, we must be heard. And if they refuse to hear us, then let me ask you this: How do you snatch the ball from LeBron when you are the size of a garden gnome? You can't. You either gather all your garden-gnome-sized friends and break LeBron's knee caps and steal the ball while he's on the ground screaming in profane agony, or you say ""screw it"" and go play a different sport. History has taught us the latter option will result in a lot less bloodshed.

&amp;nbsp;

Game of Life (GoL) is exactly what it sounds like: a game (inspired by Conway's game of life in which a very simple set of rules can create the most beautiful and sophisticated patterns and interactions). Like I mentioned before, I suspect that in the future there will be many different ""games"" with different rules for which people can exercise their socio-politico-economic avatars. Game of Life is merely one set of rules that take form as an online platform/application. The following are some ideas:

&amp;nbsp;

1.) Non-commoditizability of power - Power should not be a commodity that can be bought but earned only by those who contribute and accordingly to the weight of their contribution. Imagine a company consisted of contributors who decide the direction of their own company instead of some venture capitalist. 

&amp;nbsp;

2.) Contribution-Distribution justice - People should not be obscured and reduced to mere entities to extract labor and profit from (like all those tech giants that provide the platform but no real content). Everyone should be paid and given decision-making power according to their weight of contribution. This is most tricky to do because deciding an individual's weight of contribution is extremely difficult. I spend the most time thinking of possible algorithms for this. Ted Nelson's project Xanadu also has some interesting ideas about two-way links and royalty-related micropayments. 

&amp;nbsp;

3.) Perfect Competition and Non-exclusivity - In the current economic model, it takes money to make money, making the barrier of entrance a hurdle for those who want to invent/innovate/start a business. How can we take money out of the equation and make any economic endeavor a collaboration instead of a series of monetary investments? Having many small companies with shorter/robust life cycles that reflect supply and demand is always more sustainable than having few giant conglomerates that tell the markets what they want instead of vice versa.

&amp;nbsp; 

4.) Ease of Collaboration - If economic endeavors are to become collaborations instead of monetary investments in order to decrease the barrier of entry, how can we build a platform that can easily let people search for other contributors and collaborate with the kind of top-down efficiency that non-lateral corporations have? 

&amp;nbsp;

5.) Decentralized Currencies and Book-Keeping - It is very important to define currencies and what they stand for. Jaron Lanier had many good ideas about what money should represent. He wrote: ""Money allows blood enemies to collaborate; when money changes hands, we forget for at least a moment the history of conflict and the potential for revenge. Money forgets, but ""god"" remembers"". In GoL, I had conceived of two currencies that are inspired by bees. Bees just want the honey but they pollinate the forests. Self-interest should still be an economic imperative (as John Locke commended).

&amp;nbsp;

Hunny - Block-chain based currency that allows players to purchase goods and services
Since economic activities will be largely collaborative and voluntary in the game, we can get rid of the idea of a wage as compensation. Instead, we introduce a currency system that keeps track of each person's contributions within that domain. Once the income flows after the collaboration results in some goods/services  and the fixed costs like work-hours and equipments are covered, part of the profits can be split based on individual contribution, and other parts can be paid to investors as dividends or put back into the company for further growth. 
 Maybe one hunny can represent one man-hour, and players get paid depending on the hours they work, multiplied by some difficulty multiplier (depending on the skills and the demand for those skills. For instance, cleaning toilets may not take a lot of skill but nobody wants to do it, so it would make sense that they should be paid more).
Hunnies cannot be exchanged for real money. This is done in order to create a non-inflatable economy. Every hunny created and put into the system will represent real work done by real people and real growth.

&amp;nbsp;

Polln - The domain-specific currency that represents a player's share of the company/project/community he is contributing to, possibly proportional to the Hunnies the player has earned in that domain. It is basically the player's socio-political capital and decision-making weight within the domain. Even customers can receive small amounts of Pollns since they also contribute to a company's growth. Pollns cannot be cashed out for hunnies but may represent amount of dividends one can receive. It can be thought of as a royalty system that guarantees a long term income for players.  Basically all companies will face a natural death when contributions/resources are exhausted or when there are no more market demands. Robust lifecycles of companies aren't necessarily a bad thing, as long as players still have a long-term royalty based income.

&amp;nbsp;

6.)Democracy - Players will have a say in whatever they contribute to, and it only makes sense that their voice is weighted proportional to their actual contributions. Decision making can be delegated or advised.
A nice democratic model for decision making called liquid democracy is worth checking out. We can possibly implement it. The link is here: https://medium.com/@DomSchiener/liquid-democracy-true-democracy-for-the-21st-century-7c66f5e53b6f#.n2otaenw0

&amp;nbsp;

7.) Honeypot - The honeypot is a taxation system and the community pool of wealth. Pollns can be assigned to people depending on the amount of tax/hunnies they put into the honeypot. They can allocate their own tax hunnies to invest in others' projects, in return for pollns and dividends from that domain. Or they can use their tax hunnies to start community projects. The idea is to encourage players to invest in others to secure a long term income in dividends, to ""pollinate"" them, so to speak. It can be thought of as a crowd funding mechanism that selects for in-demand and innovative products.
Loans from the the honeypot should be viable within limits, people may want to borrow hunnies to purchase some goods or services but do not have an income providing their own goods/services to pay back the loan. In this scenario, there needs to be a way to directly put hunnies into the honeypot, maybe through humanistic endeavors/work that benefits all of the community? 

&amp;nbsp;

8.) Humanism - What sits square in the center of any system or institution are the people that make them up. Human lives and our cultural legacy require utmost sanctitude and it is imperative that we do everything in our power to preserve it. GoL is conceived with the current generation in mind, but more importantly, it is to safeguard a brighter future for future generations - our very own progeny whom are going to further our legacy. And we must empower them to do so.

&amp;nbsp;

implementation strategy


Even if we have a theoretically perfect economic model, it would not work unless there are players. Strategies to implement such a model become of paramount importance. How can we push out an app that can attract users and achieve the network effects that giant apps enjoy before it is dead in the water? And to achieve all this without venture capital? 
All giant tech firms had humble beginnings(maybe except a few that became unicorns practically overnight), they all provided simple, non-ideological services that people could and were happy to use. That is my plan for GoL, a simple platform for people to find collaborators and work together while tracking contributions. I suppose you can think of it as a Github with a point system, but hopefully with IRL(or AFK, as the founders of TPB would prefer) applications. Another thing we have to think about is how we can make it seamless for the legacy(or outside my grand deluision - current) economic system to switch over, think about what debit did to cash!

&amp;nbsp;
My plan for the immediate future is to gather some programmer friends of mine to make a platform for ourselves to collaborate on and track our contributions by self-reported work-hours(and possibly peer-verified?). If we are successful, then the platform can also be proven to work in the real world. If you are a programmer reading this then I want you to know this: You are a modern-day magician, my friend. And if you have magical powers, what would you use it for? To make yourself mountains of cash? Or make the world a better place? This is your prerogative.

&amp;nbsp;

Lastly, I want to whole-heartedly thank you for reading this long post. I am a neuroscientist by trade so I know little about politics or economics. Some of the ideas I presented may be fundamentally flawed and unviable, both theoretically and technologically speaking. If so, please please PLEASE do contribute. I desperately need your input. We all do. 

&amp;nbsp;

May our future be bright and beautiful. In humanity we trust. 

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR:
I wanna make a cool app that I delusionally think can change the world, but I need your help.

They open-sourced their builds on github: https://github.com/OpenAgInitiative

as well as provided videos for building it:

https://youtu.be/iI56tVuDGcY

Now, what if we took that application, built a standardized container, built a modular nutrient delivery system, and made it into a storage grid, using a similar technology presented in this commercial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnyn9l0hxSs)?

Think of the all applications for this.

* Personalized containers where individuals grow exactly what they want, exactly how they want it, down to the exact taste they want.

* Privatized containers, where your key card only opens your container for harvesting. This could be great for people who want to grow plants, but do not have the space to grow them.

* Fully automatic harvesting, seeding stations, and packaging stations. The first human to touch the food would be the person eating the food.

There are quite a few downfalls of systems like this, however with places like San Francisco with high-demand for ""organic"" foods, and places like Washington and Colorado with high value crops for personal consumption, there could be a market for a product similar to this.",3,16

Well no shit.  If they weren't estimating the future but knew it instead, then they'd be fucking psychics.  

The thing is, no one knows the future.  We obviously don't know exactly what is going to happen.  But it is important to talk about emerging technologies, and what what the possible implications there so that we can best prepare for them.

And how far into the future are we talking?  If it's tomorrow then it's not very interesting.  If it's 300 years from now then it's not very likely.  I find this sub to be just fine as most of the posts are in the timeline between 5 and 50 years from now.

For the past decade, Crony Capitalism has defined the narrative.  Before discussing its future, we must first define Crony Capitalism:

*Crony Capitalism is a term describing an economy in which success in business depends on close relationships between business people and government officials. It may be exhibited by favoritism in the distribution of legal permits, government grants, special tax breaks, or other forms of state interventionism.*

Few have benefitted more personally from government capital and other government assistance than Elon Musk as the following article details:

http://reason.com/archives/2016/04/28/elon-musk-crony-capitalist

Since the bailout of the financial system by government, more and more capital exists and/or is coming from government that's now privately benefitting relatively few people.  Even Warren Buffett expressed his appreciation for Crony Capitalism in this OpEd submission published in the NY Times a few years ago:

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/opinion/17buffett.html?_r=0

In the past, under traditional capitalism, the creator of capital was owner of capital and new capital was primarily created by *privately* borrowing money from banks or using existing privately created bank notes. The private borrower would get the private benefit of the bank notes that were created by the loan and would be privately responsible to pay it back.

Further, in traditional capitalism, opportunities for people were limited.  Those people who were not born into families with capital, or people who were mentally retarded and/or physically impaired had relatively limited opportunities in the games of capitalism.  However, as rapidly advancing technology eclipses almost all human physical and intellectual capabilities, more Crony Capitalists will recognize that they too are productively retarded against remarkably efficient and intelligent technology including AI and robotics.

Once enough Crony Capitalists recognize that their traditional opportunities are limited in a world of hyper intelligent, productive, and efficient technology, then they too will likely embrace the belief that the benefits of public capital and opportunities should be expanded to more people as advancing technology makes the limitations Crony Capitalism obsolete.",9,4

Lots of us have had one from years now and have no plans on ever getting rid of it.  Even though we are just scratching the surface on what we can actually use these devices for,  what does the future hold for the .  My questions for the community are:

What will the smartphone look like in 20 years? Will our technology advance enough to put them directly in our brains? I personal think some company will make a device attached/embedded into our forearm. 

Will the smartphone ever reach the point were it is considered a human right to own one?

How long after we master quantum computers will it take for the technology to come to the smartphone?

Will the government ever give tax subsidy so that everyone will have access to a 'basic' smartphone?

It seems inevitable that paper money we be phased out at some point, but will our phones even replace our debt/credit cards as well? 

All opinions welcome,  there's no right or wrong answer,  just trying to predict the future. Feel free to add any other questions that you may think of.

The 1920's where a period of time where America seemed to dance their problems away, we where tired of being involved in outside affairs especially following the devastation caused by WW1. Americans splurged on new technology such as cars, radios and appliances, this was also followed by a period where lines between progressive and conservative became blurred. We also notice that people began to become more conservative as well. 

**Here is why the 2020's will be like the 1920's :**

American's are tired of the insecurity that we feel as a nation, from terrorist attacks to the seemingly never ending conflict in the middle east, a majority of Americans want out, and they want to focus on our nation at hand. This has led to the rise of candidates like Donald Trump who promise to put "" America First "", and Bernie Sanders who wanted to "" Restore our Crumbling Infrastructure "" . If you look closely you can notice a parralel, both decades are following a period of time which involved war, and horror. 

Lines are also blurring between **Traditional and Progressive**, we have the rise of new social movements as well as more conservative movements which seem to have divided parts of the nation, kind of like the city folk and farmers in the 1920's. 

Lastly, **Technology** is going to explode which will lead to people buying many goods boosting our economy, especially with the explosion of advanced technology which people will race to have in their homes, whether or not this leads to a market crash is unknown but  we can see very similar trends.



The 2020's will be a shift for America, I belive we will become in a way more family oriented as we begin to distance ourselves from external conflicts and begin to focus on our nation, this could also lead to a resurgence in culture, something that would be nice. The 1920's where a great time and I hope that in the 2020's trends will become more apparent, clothing styles will not be as unique and we will finally be able to notice individual decades again ( 2020's fashion and culture will be more prevalent as things are more magnified.) 

We shall see what the future holds but please tell me what you think! ",73,49

829,2016-5-9,2016,5,9,11,4ihp8n,"So, I have this idea for a future economic system that would need some thorough fleshing out, but I wanted to share.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4ihp8n/so_i_have_this_idea_for_a_future_economic_system/,chaelchasen,1462762412,"The basic idea is that there are two forms of credits; intrinsic credits, and earned credits.     
Intrinsic credits are of unlimited supply to all people and really are never counted. These credits are used to buy things like food, shelter, education, and medical care. Things that are essential to human survival and development.     
Earned credits are received when you provide a service (whether essential or nonessential) to another person. So everyone who provides food to someone or gives them a tattoo or whatever receives some amount of credits. These earned credits are what you use to spend on nonessential services like tattoos or video games.     
This system would allow every person to purchase what they need to survive regardless of their situation in life. It differs from an unconditional basic income in that you don't get ""free money,"" because the ""free money"" you do get is only to pay for essentials.     
The biggest thing I'm trying to abolish about the current economic system is inflation. Things would not be valued by supply and demand but rather have established values, and the supply would merely be what was available on a first come first serve basis. There would probably have to be some regulation on the supply so as to not wipe out anything for the future, but inflation is an incurable disease of the current economic system.     
Like I said, it needs to be fleshed out in order to be a viable alternative to the current situation, but it's an idea.

Plus, I'm not aware of any better solution to the loss of so many jobs over the next few years. Are there other solutions, indeed? I guess the Victorian-era solution would have been to let people starve. I'm supposing that's not going to happen today.

My initial thoughts on the subject are in this vlog I made the other day:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0tg8uSlsy4

I see this as the next phase in the long economic cycle - the innovative push that will get us out of the current Great Depression - and I talk about this in the vlog.

Bank notes are created by borrowing money from banks regardless whether the borrowing is done by individuals, businesses or government.

Today, Donald Trump said government can essentially borrow forever to pay back pre existing borrowing. This is often called printing money.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-right-in-theory-wrong-in-practice-that-us-can-avoid-default-by-printing-money-2016-05-09

Bernie Sanders, and the democratic party in general, also wants to keep borrowing burdening future generations with ever more debt to keep the current capitalist game going.

http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/20160509_ap_2147e7fb9f0646cf86f1c0a18ad36233.html

It appears that both Republican and Democratic politicians, and by default the citizens that vote for them, now believe that essentially unlimited amounts of debt can be forced upon future generations.

If this is the case, then how should the money being created out of government borrowing be allocated and what are the implications for future generations?

Professors from MIT have been addressing this issue for some time.

Today, this link was posted: http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/35946-robert-mcchesney-capitalism-is-a-bad-fit-for-a-technological-revolution

For the last fifty years, the average intelligence of humans has remained relatively consistent while technology has exponentially advanced. It's likely that a genius like Albert Einstein or Buckminster Fuller would be similar in intelligence to geniuses today while technology is materially more intelligent and productive than it was just a few years ago. And based on most experts, it appears technological advancement is accelerating.

As this video demonstrates, AI is beginning to learn on its own:  https://youtu.be/MI07aeZqeco

It seems like we are seeing new evidence everyday where robotic and AI technology is eclipsing human capabilities in productivity both physically and intellectually.

In fact, there is hope for the future that technology, like exoskeletons, will be able to address and resolve many of the mental and physical limitations impacting people today in traditional activities.

For a future where essentially all people will be productively retarded relative to technology, people better start thinking about what kind of economic model and rules we should embrace when AI is smarter than the Economists, Politicians and Lawyers.

There has long been an understanding that APIs are not code. If they had been, then Gary Kildall of Digital Research should have been able to sue Microsoft for copying all of the APIs in CP/M to make MSDOS. Oracle copied the SQL command structure from IBM, when it created its products. It made perfect sense, because the command structure was well know to the industry. It made it easier for developers to start using the Oracle databases. However, under what Oracle are claiming now, this was Oracle copying IBM's API. I guess that IBM should sue Oracle for Hundreds of Billions of Dollars.

There was this discussion (unneeded parts snipped)

MG:
The truth is that we need robots and automation instead of us, as:

1. We are not able to produce things cheaply anymore.
2. We are not able to handle the increasing complexity.

    Rodster:
    Except, robots dont buy cars, shop at Walmart or Amazon, eat at fast food or fancy restaurants. They dont buy houses or rent apartments, they dont take vacations or go on cruises. The only thing robots are good for is to take away from the economy as they dont contribute anything at all. They also replace workers who cant contribute to the economy to keep it functioning. So in the long run the economy collapses because there are not enough individuals with enough money to sustain the economy.

And this is the important part.
        Ed :
 &lt;b&gt;       Robots contribute to the owners. 

They increase profit. Work without salary. 

If it comes down to 1000 rich families owning robot factories that supply the other 1000 factories and families then it works for them. 

There would be not be seven billion overloading the planet. 

Yes, the transition will be tricky but again robot police, robot state police, robot FBI/DHS, robot military will help there. Gail I can already hear you saying economy of scale. 

Yes, the per unit prices will increase at lower scale but it does not matter 

The owners just apply the required level of robots, energy, and natural resources to make the number of units required by the factories and the families. 

The rule of thumb is 20% per unit cost reduction for a doubling in volume. 

So a reduction of 7 billion to 7 million is a cost increase of 10X. 

That is OK the owners can afford to pay it. This is the wrong wording really. 

The owners pay nothing they consume robots, energy, and natural resources. 

So the 7 million will consume as much as 70 million at the current economy of scale efficiencies. That is still a factor of 100 lighter load on natural resource and energy than today. &lt;/b&gt;

After that Norman Pagett, a published author, tried to dismiss 'Ed' by saying that he saw too many Terminator movies, and Ed answers 

	Ed says:	

Norman did you notice the AI designed dress at the Met Gala?

for which Pagett just said he did not see it.

Here it is.

====

Even without an AGI, soft AI can still take civilization farther than anyone can imagine and an economic singularity will probably come, which will probably make about 99.8% of humanity obsolete.

It's an interesting read. Some quotes from the article.

&gt;Anarcho-primitivism is an anarchist critique of the origins and progress of civilization. According to anarcho-primitivism, the shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence gave rise to social stratification, coercion, alienation, and population growth. Anarcho-primitivists advocate a return to non-""civilized"" ways of life through deindustrialization, abolition of the division of labor or specialization, and abandonment of large-scale organization technologies.

-
&gt;Modern technology is held by primitivists to be distinct from simple tools: a simple tool is considered a temporary usage of an element within our immediate surroundings for a specific task. Tools are not viewed as involving complex systems which alienate the user from the act. Primitivists claim that this separation is implicit in technology, which creates an unhealthy and mediated experience which leads to various forms of authority. Domination is said to increase every time a modern ""time-saving"" technology is created, as primitivists claim it necessitates the construction of more technology to support, fuel, maintain, and repair the original technology. Primitivists believe that this system methodically destroys, eliminates, or subordinates the natural world, constructing a world fit only for machines.",53,0

I'm sorry if this isn't a welcomed question but something was on my mind and it worried me. I'm a young man of eighteen and I'm a writer in the books and comic field. Not published but hopefully I'll get there someday. I'm somewhat worried though regarding the future that I'll be going into.

I do love technology and it advancing to improve peoples lives but I worry with things like augmented reality, virtual reality, robots getting smarter, better video games and even brain connectivity to the net or something.

All happening within my life time.

I worry if people will still like to read fiction like they do now? Ya know? Be it literary or fantasy or sci-fi or anything. I know paperbooks/hardcovers might not be around much longer. Nothing against books being on kindles, phones or ipads of course but I do love physical books and hope they don't vanish within my life time.

But I'm somewhat expecting it....sadly.

All in all whether its normal books or digital....I hope people still consume fiction that way.  It really is a passion for me and its been around a long looooong time wouldn't want it to go away of course. I know this is an odd thread but its been on my mind all day. I sometimes worry about strange things. 

So what do you all think, will books as a media (be they digital or physical or both) have a big place in future?",12,4

But I have been reading several articles on it and I even visited their freaking website trying to figure out if their using Elon's proposed ""air bearings"" or using magnetic levitation like a bullet train does. in order for it to be using ""air bearings' it'd have to be in a pressurized tube so from the looks of it, it looks like they're using magnetic levitation.

The other startup competing with Hyperloop One is Hyperloop Transportation Technologies and they say they are going to use magnetic levitation, here http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/9/11636460/hyperloop-transportation-passive-magnetic-levitation-inductrack-richard-post

So when Elon Musk proposed the Hyperloop back in 13' he mentioned nothing about magnetic levitation in his design, I mean there's nothing revolutionary about maglev, its been done already, what was revolutionary was his proposed ""air bearings"" idea.

And now we know that One of the startups is foregoing the ""air bearings"" idea and using the maglev tech. BUT WHAT ABOUT HYPERLOOP ONE!!!? I mean I feel stupid that I cant figure this little tid bit out myself.

And here's the magical question. If both startups are using maglev instead of ""air bearings"" is the latter impossible to invent then? Is Elon Musk fallible after all, I thought he was some super genius who was never wrong.

Because if, say, the amount of jobs in the world becomes significantly smaller than the amount of people in the world, that'd mean a huge amount of the population will have no jobs.

I can see two possible scenarios here.

1: As jobs get taken over by machines, welfare gets higher and mincome eventually gets put into place. Even if nobody in your family can find a job, you still receive enough money to live comfortably. It'd be a smooth transition from there to when all jobs are completely taken over by AIs, and the class gap is destroyed entirely.

2: Minimum wage increases exponentially (ordinarily, a good thing) as jobs become more and more specialized and rare, until the world is split between a jobless peasant majority living in slums, and the rich employed elite. Rich people tend to want to maintain the status quo, so from there, progress towards an ideal, equal future could be halted or made illegal, so the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor, for many generations. Especially if the Rich have access to medical immortality, because then the views of people in power would never change.",18,8

For example, *Wall Street* has the famous scene of Gordon Gekko talking on [his fancy new cell phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFTfzaWQQNM). Many years later, the sequel, *Wall Street - Money Never Sleeps*, [they made a nod](http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2010/09/23/gordon_gekko_s_cell_phone.html) to how dated the old film had become. When Gordon Gekko gets out of prison, he's given his old brick phone back. But of course, he is now in a world with the internet and iPhones.

Anyway, I think that in the future, as the rate of technological advancement increases, movies will become dated more quickly. In a decade, today's favorite movies will be dated by our non-autonomous cars and our non-virtual reality entertainment.

Eventually technology will progress so quickly that a movie which came out just a year ago will seem terribly out of date. One day movies will be out of date before they're even done being produced.

&gt; At the extreme, Stalins purges could have been justified on the grounds of utilitarianism, to promote the greatest good for his people, even if millions had to die in the process.

It can be argued that Stalin's Holodomor and other killings were 'good' since that eliminated those who could help the Nazis during the 1941 war and helped to defeat Nazism, which was the greater evil and brought a 'greater good' to the humanity.

Same for Mao's Cultural Revolution. It eliminated lots of old-minded scholars, and discouraged 'humanities'. 

Virtually all current leaders of China majored in STEM since it was not cool to major in the 'humanities' during the 1960s-70s when these people grew up, so STEM was the only choice for bright kids of good standing and it is helping China's STEM now. 

Thousands of years of 'Chinese culture' which hindered scientific progress were wiped out within 10 years and that truly changed China's mindset. 

It can be argued that all of them had to go to be able to put China into the modern age, and get rid of all the 'feudal' shit.

====



Right now, the world is facing a tech revolution unimaginable to anything in history. Any reference to the past no longer works since there is no precedent.

Morality established when people moved no faster than horses, or laws established when people could calculated no faster than a savant who did not even know what he was doing, appear to be quite obsolete to the tech world.

The payoff for entering a different level of civilization outweighs anything else mankind can bring up - in other words, the 'good' is incalculable, and no price is too big to pay.

I think we only have about 2040 to reach the next level of civilization, before population pressures grow too large to sustain. 

24 years is not a long time. Manhattan Project lasted for 3 years to have a working bomb , and Apollo Project took 8 years and 3 Presidents to get its result (men set foot on the moon on the term of the opponent of Kennedy!).

Elsewhere, I have argued that China or even North Korea, who have no restrictions on scientific and tech researches whatsoever, might reach the next level of civ if the West is not careful enough.

I think it would be necessary to charge helter-skelter to advance to the next level before it is too late.

1. The shortage of cheap oil will actually help civilization by reducing consumption by those who should not have consumed to begin with and just allow it to those who can afford it.

2. The inability of the non elite workers to afford oil won't hurt economy since they take less than, say, 1/3 of the entire economy and the consumption of elite workers in other countries will compensate for their inability to consume.

3. The world economy worked well in 1870-1914 without a sizable 'transfer' between the rich and poor, and the rich (the elite workers) will only get richer by claiming all the economic growth themselves but their consumption will more than compensate for the forced austerity of the non-elite workers.
--


In her AMA session, Gail just answered she does not agree with my opinion. That's OK. I will just express my counter to her arguments this time.


She said oil demand falls because of these factors:


    Lower affordability
    Lower productivity growth
    Falling relative wages of non-elite workers

But I can also add another one, namely 'better fuel efficiency on everything'

During the period when oil price was threatening $200/barrel, a lot of industrial process improvements and other fuel-saving measures, such as Obama's cash-for-clunkers, programs were introduced to increase fuel efficiency.

So we need less oil to do things. It's that simple.

What happens is, as the price of oil increases, less essential things, like bringing water to mountain villages with perhaps a population of 50, will not be done.  Sorry.

&gt;Can consumers really afford very high-priced energy products?

Gail just said 'No'. But the correct answer is, 'yes, some consumers can, although most can't.'

In fact, the demand destruction might actually help the overall environmental situation - those who can't afford the higher priced oil will be forced to make a much smaller environmental footprint.

&gt;Because of this affordability issue, the limit to oil production is really an invisible price limit, represented as a dotted line. We cant know in advance where this is, so it is easy to assume that it doesnt exist.

While I do not have a formula to assume where it would be, it can roughly be estimated as the limit of what an average consumer of the higher-income world can afford to spend per month without a significant reduction of living standards.

To have a growing economy, wages of non-elite workers need to be growing. 

&gt;Our economy is in a sense a circular economy, in which non-elite workers (less educated, non-managerial workers) play a pivotal role because they are both producers of goods and potential consumers of the output of the economy. Because there are so many non-elite workers, their demand for homes, cars, and electronic goods plays a critical role in maintaining the total demand of the economy.

No. The non-elite workers have ceased to be important anymore.

http://greyenlightenment.com/sorry-middle-class-youre-just-not-that-important-anymore/
&gt; the decline of the middle class is not such a big deal to Wall St.

&gt;Unless youre among the cognitive elite (top 1-5% of IQ) [READ; ELITE WORKERS], you may need to lower your expectations, sorry. Foreign competition, along with automation and outsourcing, is creating a hollowing out of the middle  a lot of low-paying service sector jobs, combined with self-actualizing jobs at the top, but not much for the middle.

That is the truth.

http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-much-money-do-the-top-income-earners-make-percent/

Top 1% makes 20% of total income.
Top 5% makes 35% of ti.
Top 10% makes 46% of ti.
Top 25% makes 67% of ti.
Top 50% makes 87% of ti, which is kinda of skewed since people living with public assistance rarely bother to file income taxes at all so the Top 50% might actually mean top 40%, and so on.

So, say the bottom 75% of America suddenly disappears into ether or something. It will only decrease economy by 1/3. Tough but survivable.

And, thanks to automation and increased application of AI, even the higher-paying jobs will begin to disappear. The machines might consume a lot of energy, but not as much as an upper-middle class person earning a fairly large income.

It is just that post-2008, most of economic growth and income will go to the elite workers, and the rest will just have to live with that or face harsh reprisals.

Economic growth is still occurring. It is just occurring in sectors which will not help the masses too much, and will only benefit elite workers who will consumer more to compensate for the forced austerity of non-elite workers. In others, more fancy meals for the few, and less spaghetti-os for the people.

&gt;As jobs are shifted to low-wage countries, the workers of the world increasingly cannot afford the goods that they and other workers are producing.

Supply and demand. Demand destruction means the companies will make products the fewer but wealthier consumers can now afford. Less Taco Bells, more Chipotles.

&gt;If the wages of non-elite workers are not rising sufficiently, rising debt can be used to hide this problem for a while. The way this is done is by allowing workers to buy goods at ever-lower interest rates, over ever-longer time periods. This strategy has an endpoint, which we seem to be close to reaching.

The increase of foreign elite workers and their consumption will compensate for the loss of domestic non-elite consumption.

As wages for nonelite workers fall, more debts are not needed. They can consume less, or they can enjoy the micro-loans

http://www.businessinsider.com/microfinance-has-been-a-huge-disappointment-around-the-world-2014-2

However, since their overall share of world's economy is so minuscule, their plight can be ignored safely.

Debt defaults will probably be resolved like what is done in India,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_bondage_in_India

with the blessing of courts in short budget.

&gt;We are reaching a head-on collision between (1) the rising cost of energy production and (2) the falling ability of non-elite workers to pay for this high-priced energy. 

When were non-elite workers ever able to afford higher-form of energy? For those who could not afford horses they just walked.

It is just that the world is going back to what it has already been, except the high-tech will be reserved for those who can pay.

Turchin,Turchin and Turchin. He does not know the game has changed. 

&gt;We could, in theory, fix our problems by adding infinite debt at the same time that wages of non-elite workers tend toward zero. We could then use this additional debt to fight pollution problems and pay all of the workers. All of us know that this solution would not work in the real world, however.

Actually it already worked in the world of 1871-1914, called the Belle Epoque. And it was the period of the greatest expansion of civilization. Unwanted mouths were simply dumped to the Americas or the colonies, whose people naturally had to suffer but who remembers them?

The decline of pay for the workers means more dangerous things will be done for lower prices. 

A lot of the cleanup workers for Fukushima were debt-ridden who were desperate for cash. (Japanese loan sharks are much less lenient on debtors than Western ones and often resort to violence, and the police and the courts side with the creditors since that maintains stability) We do not hear about them anymore. They just, well, disappeared and no one is interested on their fate.

Such will be how environment will be cleaned up. Cruel, but something which will have to be done.

&gt;Unfortunately, paying each others wages does not work well, if the wage level of elite workers differs too much from the wage level of the non-elite workers. A worker making $7.50 per hour in a part-time job is not going to be able to pay the wages of a surgeon making $300,000 per year, no matter how an insurance policy is designed to spread costs evenly. A worker in India or Africa will not be able to afford goods made by human workers in the United States, because of wage differences.

There will be enough people, both from domestically and internationally, who will be able to pay the Surgeon $300,000; the surgeon does not need the poorer patients unless they get govt subsidies. They are messy and do not mix with the patients who pay bills.

In gang movies there are 'surgeons' who fix wounded homeboys. The poor will have to resort on that. Sorry.

&gt;Part of the problem with our academic system seems to be excessive reliance on past analyses. Once one direction has been set, it is hard to change. Another part of the problem is that the focus of each researcher tends to be quite narrow. The result can be that it is hard to see the forest for the trees.

Ironically that is true. Old rules does not apply anymore. Technological and AI advances have destroyed all rules.

Since that will be how to adapt to the society of oil limits. 

At least in the advanced world the technically advanced elite workers will throw enough bone to the rest to prevent them from rebelling. They will be given enough food, passable shelters and cheap entertainment like Obamaphones,

* Smoother traffic flow.
* Fewer and fewer traffic jams until none occur.
* Increasing average speeds.
* As roads becoming dominated by automated cars that communicate with each other, much more coordinated movements.

If we zoom in on that last one, we find something interesting: With networked cars coordinating movements, self-driving automobiles can operate as de facto trains whenever and wherever convenient.  These would align into a closely-spaced line of cars flowing at high speed, into and out of which cars could move at their convenience.

The ""tracks"" of such a ""train"" would be all in the minds of the cars themselves, dynamically negotiated between them according to their respective needs, capabilities, and road conditions.  Particularly on interstate highways, the result could be ""quasi-trains"" dozens of miles long, operating like [standing waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave) in a liquid.

If this comes about, as seems likely, what then of literal rail?  The advantages of dynamic quasi-trains made of automated cars present a radical challenge to actual trains, likely usurping most if not all of their selling points: Speed, comfort, and (eventually) affordability among them.

The rail experience allows riders to relax rather than have to drive themselves, as would a self-driving car - but in the latter case, you will have the ready option of riding alone even if you don't own the car.  A train has connectivity and tables for eating or devices, and so would these cars.  But a train runs on a schedule, while an automated car runs on yours: Picks you up quickly, stops for bathroom breaks whenever you feel like it, and goes directly to your destination while a train likely requires intermediate transport to and from the station.

The implications for local and intercity light rail / subways are grim: Unless the cost curve for automated EVs has a sustained plateau well above the price of light-rail fares - which seems unlikely given the minimal operating costs compared to rail - these modes of transport will serve no purpose and have no advantages over short and medium distances.

A fixed-track train, and particularly a subway, involves massive up-front infrastructure investment to expand, and substantial recurring costs to manage and maintain.  All an automated car needs is a road, and apparently less of one than a human-driven car: It could manage much narrower and more curving streets at higher speeds than would be wise for a human to attempt.  

As it can dynamically manage its driving at a minute level of control, self-driving cars could also safely handle a wider range of road surface conditions, and drive in such a way as to help preserve the surface, meaning lower maintenance costs than we already have.

It appears likely, then, that metro/streetcar and subway rail will become rapidly obsolete.  The future of buses, however, is less clear, since they too would be automated: Will there be sufficient economic advantage to a dozen or more people sharing a highly specialized automated conveyance, or will self-driving autos have such industrial scale that the advantage is trivial or even erased completely?  The answer is unclear, but if there is some cost advantage to an automated bus over a self-driving car, it will surely be smaller than the advantage currently held by buses over cars.

Subway tunnels, interestingly enough, may end up being repurposed as automated roads, since - as noted - these cars would be able to move at speed in much narrower confines.  Since EV tech is proceeding in tandem with self-driving, and EVs don't emit noxious chemicals, the tunnels would not need the special ventilation that car tunnels do today.

*However*, for longer distances, there can be an advantage to rail or similar fixed technologies at sufficiently high speeds: Speeds such as those achievable by maglev bullet trains or Hyperloop, in the multi-hundred mph speeds that will likely remain impractical for wheeled vehicles.  Over such distances, the automated quasi-trains would likely remain in fixed positions anyway due to finding the most efficient routes between major destinations, and near such routes the HSR/hyperloop infrastructure could be built.

Moreover, these fixed transport systems need not entirely *compete* with automated cars: While it will be much more efficient for passengers to disembark the cars and just their bodies transported, it may be an option for the entire car to board a train or hyperloop pod and then drive off at the destination.  How practical that is will ultimately depend on the economics of the fixed transport system, and how light self-driving EVs manage to become (which intuitively seems like it could be quite a low number over time).

TL;DR: Metro/streetcar rail and subways are doomed.  Traditional rail is doomed.  The future of buses is uncertain.  Ultra-high-speed rail and/or hyperloop for long distances does have a future, and its routes may actually be pioneered by looking at automated car quasi-train traffic patterns.

Great coincidence because I was at the grand canyon today and had a chance to see what it could do to improve my lousy photography.

My first attempt was jacked. I used a [syd mead](http://imgur.com/a/Urb22) illustration featuring the grand canyon and it turned to dog shit.

My second attempt to stylize [my meh photos](http://imgur.com/a/cYtNX) turned half way to shit. At least it looks like the Grand Canyon this time.

And then I went for a combination that would be kinda hard to screw up. And [it didn't](http://imgur.com/a/mJZd3), at least not completely. Still wouldn't be acceptable in professional work, but it's interesting.

I got away from the grand canyon and decided to see more character focused illustrations and photographs would work and it gets interesting.

Without looking into [this one](http://imgur.com/a/hLWNI) too deeply it does look professional. It would indeed catch an art director's eye from across the room. But it falls apart when you look at the details.

This [last one](http://imgur.com/a/XaTun) turned out exceptionally well. It does in fact look like a quick but professional sketch, done on the fly. The funny part is the two base images weren't all that similar. But the color palette and aestetics were very similar, so it did a very good job mashing up the two and there weren't allot of details to screw up, so whatever inadequecies the algorithm has slipped by unnoticed.

This experiment is is lead by world class stem cell researcher **Dr Alexandra Stolzing** and was inspired by our scientific advisor and colleague **Dr Aubrey De Grey**.

The Major Mouse Testing Program is seeking to speed up scientific progress in the field of regenerative medicine and bio-gerontology. After ILA experts conducted an analysis of delays preventing the development of life extension technologies, it was shown that a serious problem was the lack of robust animal data for the potential of different compounds to promote health and extend maximum lifespan. Without this data promising interventions cannot enter clinical trials and become available to the general public.

**The MMTP is currently running a crowdfunding campaign** at https://www.lifespan.io/campaigns/the-major-mouse-testing-program/ 

For the first experiment we are testing a new class of drugs known as **Senolytics**, these drugs have been shown to help seek out and destroy toxic *senescent* cells that accumulate with age and improve various aspects of health. We wish to see if Senolytics can increase maximum lifespan in addition to healthspan. We have big plans for the future with combination testing of senolytics, stem cells and more to help speed up scientific progress. 

So go ahead ASK US ANYTHING!

Will all driverless car be stopless, because each car knows each other destination, and could calculate each other speed, time to be there, and eliminate the propose of street signal lights? Or will street signal lights still be an effective tool to keep driverless car in order?

Then you wake up by the warm smell of coffee, pancake, and bacon made by your own android robot maid. Imagine a world in were a robot perform the world most dangerous and deadly jobs such as inside a nuclear plant cooling pool, a heavy machinery manufacturing plant, etc. without risking a human worker which is sitting at a safe distance controlling the robot movements. Imagine a world in where a handicap person can control an android robot to perform tasks before impossible for him/her. Imagine a world in were robots help us colonize and build infrastructure on Mars and around our solar system and beyond. Imagine a world in where a healthcare android robot help the elder, or provide 24/7 care for quarantined patients with virus such as Ebola. Would you like to live in such a world? This is what my business Eden Robotics is trying to solve by integrating our android robot hardware with virtual reality technology all of this is possible.  ",1,1

2053,2016-5-19,2016,5,19,22,4k2jpj,Concept Trees Software,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4k2jpj/concept_trees_software/,KiLVaiDeN,1463665915,"Hello people,

Right now, I would like to share with you an idea of a software, that doesn't exist yet, but that I believe could really improve how we share, understand, learn and improve ideas. It would be a tool for efficiently create concepts visually, by combining ""atomic"" concepts.

The best way to explain how this would work, is an example that starts with a simple question : what is an ""apple"" ?

An apple, is a fruit. What is a fruit ? A fruit is the product of a tree. What is a tree ? etc.. etc...

We could, by using ""sets-arithmetics"", construct the definition of what an ""apple"" is, based on all the needed concepts to achieve this explanation.

Let's say now, that it doesn't exist yet, but someone discovered ""apple juice"". What is apple-juice, compared to apple ? It's the concept of ""apple"" joined with the concept of ""mixing"" it and eventually adding ""water"" or ""sugar"" etc. This is to explain how that model can be extended : by adding more relations between basic concepts. And sometimes, it gives a new element, that itself can be used for other explanations (if I have a recipee that needs apple-juice, I dont need to describe what the apple-juice is, i can directly use the concept, but if someone doesn't know what apple-juice is, he could enter that concept and observe how it's composed).

So in the software that I imagine, we would this way be able to construct every knowledge based on atomic concepts, and therefore, even when someone would have ""a new idea"", it would be expressed through that tool, and anybody could understand it, by exploring it's ""sub-concepts"" and their ""relations"" between each other.

This app could be very usefull for science : in science often, we improve and discover new things by combining a technique with a theory, or by applying one concept to another kind of elements : so this tool would allow those constructions, but mostly, it would permit to share such ""conceptual trees"" with anyone, given that the person has a translation of the ""atomic concepts"" in its language. So a team of chinese scientists could very easily share an innovation with a team in finland, even if both teams have no direct way to understand each other, because this tool would describe the concepts in a transposable way for each language, given that atomic-concepts are well defined in each language.

So we could describe this app as a ""shareable wikipedia organized through concepts relationships and combinations"". There would be a ""public"" tree, where anyone could add new combinations, but anyone could ""vote"" on good or bad combinations, and that ""knowledge tree"" would grow exponentially and visually show the wrong paths from the right ones in any domain of research, and based also on our personnal experience.

A ""private"" tree could be created too, with only the concepts that the user ""agrees"" with, and therefore each one could have his own representation of information, organized the way he pleases.

Then, someday, this tool could be ported to VR, and you could ""enter the dimension"" of the apple, see ""around you"" all that's related to this, and move from this concept to a linked one, and this way you would be able to ""travel through concepts"" :)

So what do you think of this idea ? I have thought about it for some years now, but the implementation is pretty hard, a simple relationnal or graph-based database is not sufficient to efficiently represent concept/sub-concepts composition and possible relationships.

If you think that this idea is good, you can PM me and we could think about it, and maybe make it a reality.

Thanks for reading :) I wish you a good day !",6,5

[Lower oil prices but more renewables: Whats going on?](http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/lower-oil-prices-but-more-renewables-whats-going-on)

Since renewables are growing as a source of energy and getting cheaper for electricity generation, this will depress the price of coal since it won't be competitive to charge more than renewables. The United States could get up to 80% of its electricity from renewables by 2050. 

[Renewable Energy Can Provide 80 Percent of U.S. Electricity by 2050](http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/smart-energy-solutions/increase-renewables/renewable-energy-80-percent-us-electricity.html#.Vz6aLWgrKM8)

There is a broad consensus that [global oil production will peak before 2030.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicting_the_timing_of_peak_oil) Since electric cars are now economically viable and the Model 3 is going to enter production by 2017, there will most likely be many affordable electric cars available that run on mostly renewable energy from a clean grid before peak oil occurs. 

Peak oil is going to happen, but oil is going to be much less vital to our future economy than it is to our present economy, so I don't think it is something to worry about. We are already getting off oil and coal. ",5,4

orangechat.io (OC) is an easy-to-use webchat, embedded directly in reddit.com.  It allows you to just click and connect with your reddit account and immediately start chatting with other people visiting your favorite subreddits.

There are two ways to use orangechat, the extension and the embedded version. 

Extension:  [CHROME](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/orangechatio/eikmifkdpckaoknomnbhoeoiiacopofh)  |  [FIREFOX](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/orangechatio/)

Using the extension is the easiest way to use orangechat.io - it will embed in the bottom right of your screen when you are browsing reddit and will display chat notifications.  However, we also have a stand-alone version available that can be used anywhere [HERE](https://app.orangechat.io/#/r/futurology) - no download required!  

#What are some of the benefits? 
* No registration: just connect directly using your reddit account.  We never have access to your password, and you never need to provide an email address.
* Easy to use: no commands to remember and no prior knowledge required - were trying to keep it simple - no one should need a manual to join or moderate a chatroom.
* Connects with reddit.com: integrating with reddit lets us make some things very simple - for example, subreddit moderators are detected automatically, and can immediately begin managing the chatroom (including bans and invites).
* Private messages, private chatrooms: turn a private message into a private chatroom by inviting other friends to the conversation.  You can also rename your private chatrooms, making it easy to keep track of friends and teams or just express yourself ;)
* IRC integration: Many subreddits already have existing IRC chatrooms, and we want to help you keep all of your subreddit chat in one place.  Weve been working with [Snoonet](https://www.snoonet.org), which specifically serves the reddit community, and have set up a system that will let you link existing channels on Snoonet with OC channels.   Users comfortable with IRC can stay part of the conversation using any client of their choice, while others can connect through OC.  

#It connects to our existing chat!

You can either use the new chat, or you can connect using your client of choice to #futurology on irc.snoonet.org, or you can use the [old browser link](http://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/#futurology).

""Hi Everyone, its been an amazing few months. In short, we have been tremendously successful in our efforts to rescue a mutation in the mitochondrial genome!

Essentially weve shown that we can relocate both ATP6 and ATP8 to the nucleus and target the proteins to the mitochondria. We can show that the proteins incorporate into the correct protein complex (the ATPase) and that they improve function resulting in more ATP production. Finally, we show that the rescued cells can survive and grow under conditions which require mitochondrial energy production while the mutant cells all die.

We have finished writing up our results and submitted them for review and publication. It may take a while for our results to be published (the peer review process can be lengthy) but as soon as it is Ill post an update here so you can see the full paper.

We have also started the project that you helped us get to our stretch goal on. We have made all the combinations of MTS with ATP6 that we proposed and are now working on testing them. Ill let you know when we know more.

Thank you so much for your support!

Capitalism advocates what sells. However, as seen in many incidents, what sells the most may not be what is the best.

A popular example is the Qwerty, which had its uses a long time ago but as tech improved its importance died. However, existing typewriter companies, and typists who lacked the vision to see beyond their old machines, defeated the Dvorak, which was superior. It still lingers on today although voice recognition tech will probably send it to the way of slide rules.

What the public likes the most may not be the best tech, and business owners care more about the bottom line than tech advances. 

Today's tech advance is advocated since it gives fun things to do on its way, but historically that was not always the case. History is full of advances defeated by vested interests who wanted to keep things as they are so they could keep their influences.

I think that tech is advancing too fast for capitalism to handle. 

All these Austrian and Chicago style of economists, while better than the gaggle of hucksters like Paul Krugman, are still caught in the smokestack paradigm which has died.

I don't think basic income, etc is good either since it is just postponing the inevitable and just consume additional resources for nothing.

Capitalism is good sometimes, but it does give a lot of advantages to the rentiers, who add nothing to the advances but just collect tolls and increase overhead. 

In fact rentiers are probably going to be the biggest opponent of Civilization 2.0. They don't want to see a system where they will not be able to collect rent, and want to keep it in a way so they can continue to benefit.

I don't think any of today's economists, all of them influenced by Smith, Marx and Keynes, have a good solution for the tech-induced economy, and the outdated economic systems might prove to be the greatest opponent for advancing humanity to the next level.",129,35

And I'm going to explain why I think that vertical farming isn't going to happen until at least the end of this century, if it will ever happen at all. 

I will use Soybeans, which is the ""gold"" of agriculture, as exemple. Where I live, a place with decently developed agriculture, 70 bag/hectare is a very good harves today. A bag has about 60 Kg, so we have 4200 Kg/hec. In an irrigated field, I believe it is possible to get 120 or more bags/hec, even more in places like Europe or the US with a very advanced agriculture. Let's say that in 20 years, we can make about 150 bags/hec, sice the ammount is every year higher due to technology and genetics. We have 9 ton/hectare in this future scenario.

The problem is: I don't believe we are going to harvest much more than 200 bags/hec, no matter how much technology we have. Plants have a limit, there is a maximum number of seeds per plant, even if you dump nutrients in it, and even if you make it's genetics better, there is simply no physical space. If you make the plants higher, you will need more space between them anyway.

So, think about it. We would need thousands and more thousands of expensive and huge buildings, robots, lamps, also a HUGE amount of energy, to make 200 bags/hec, the same you would do in a normal, natural and free field. You will need more space, but no problem, not even half of the world fertile land is occupied, and the infertile land will become fertile soon, and no need to cut a single tree.

Yes, this would make quality of food better, as we would probably not need to worry about pests and weeds, but it is still not worth it. Even if the world transform into a socialist paradise as some here like to think, it would still be a waste of resources. Maybe in a far future it is somehow feaseble, but I belive that in this future, humans will have found a better way to produce food, not needing to rise living things for them to eat.

What is going to happen is that there will be more technology, every field will be like a garden, humans won't even step there. Robots that identify and mechanically cut weeds and kill insects already exist, so they will take over our farms, there will be almost no need for chemicals, except for fungal diseases, for example. Also, every field is going to be irrigated and it's lacking nutrients are going to be automatically added. Many of these things are already in the prototype stage.

This is my view of the future of the world agriculture.

Edit: To add, it may also be more damaging to the environment. The highly nutritive substance used in hydrophonics is hardly treatable and is toxic for animals. If it is dumped into a river or something like this, the damage can be catastrophic. Also, agriculture is just after the military in technology, something most people don't know. Self driving harvest machines and sprayers, or drones which automaticaly identify deseases are every day more common.",42,17

They don't represent self. They represent our awareness and notion of self. 

Actually the meaning behind ""I"" is essentially our ego. Ego is the center of our conscious awareness. ""I"" and ""me"" is an idea based on the focal point of our perception, which we naturally attach the belief of our identity to, because of the nature of our senses. Traditionally we consider the meaning behind ""I"" to = self.

This is a delusion because ""I"" is entirely just an idea (by definition), but we're so attached to the idea that we hardly even question it - let alone analyze how we define ""ourselves"". It's long been ""common sense"" to believe in ""I"" as what self is, but isn't that curious? It's also common sense that we can't just rely on our senses to give us more than a shallow perception of the nature of reality. But for social convenience sake, we roll with it, and largely don't challenge the idea of ""I"". Such a personal thing afterall.

But I submit to you a few questions: where does the idea of ""other"" come from? How would you define ""self"" at an atomic level? How about subatomic? These object ""levels"" are more fundamental to the nature of reality than ideas and beliefs; certainly also more fundamental than our point of view. Humans, being inherently selfish by nature, center our lives on ego. We identify ourselves with ego, and (by and large) we are totally ignorant of this fact. It's no wonder why humanity has never been able to reach a state of totally peaceful coexistence! We're all going around believing in our ego as if it = what self is. But it's a delusion; a misunderstanding at best.

""Other"" is just a point of view. You think separation is anything more than an illusion? Quantum physics has something important to show you, and it's called string theory. The nature of quantum mechanics shows us (among other thing) how ignorant we are about what we call ""the laws of nature"". I want to reiterate human ignorance, shallow thinking, and all for the sake of social convenience.

A final question: is it truly convenient to ignore all this in lieu of putting off our insecurities? Everyone wants to feel secure, that's just a fact of human nature. What I want to know is when will humanity wake up to the depths of our own igNOREance, and accept/embrace our shortsightedness so we might actually know - not just believe - what's going on? After that then we can really figure out what's what, what's true and false, and maybe even rise above it to have a laugh at the craziness that we've all been partaking in over the course of human history. At the very least, this is something everyone should think about.",199,0

I was thinking it'd be fairly possible to have laws proposed in a reddit-style forum. Anyone would be able to propose a law, laws could take effect after a certain vote threshold or a certain date.

People would be able to change their vote on any subject (yay/nay), this prevents recreation of duplicate proposals. All community driven on an open-source and distributed framework that any can contribute to (think bitcoin sized distribution).

In a fully automated society, individual income tax would be completely eradicated. This shows that individual income tax is an indirect tax on productivity.

As society becomes automated, the tax system will have to be changed to deal with this. Personally, I believe that if we're going to have to change the tax system, we should give it a complete overhaul. The way I see it, all the various taxes that exist are indirect taxes on the wealth generated by productivity so why not scrap them and just tax that productivity directly?

So, given an automating society, what changes would you make to the tax system and why?

Edit: Whether you think automation will take 20 years to kick in or 100 years is irrelevant. Don't be short sighted, look at the big picture and think long-term.

Those porta-loo-like toliets you see in the cities will take a picture of the interior as you open the door to enter and another picture as you try to open the door to leave. The images will be erased after you leave. The images will be compared with each other and if the toilet detects that you've made a mess it will refuse to let you out until you clean the mess up. It will state this in a multitude of languages and even use a laser pointer to direct your attention to the mess it wants you to clean. It will give you 10 ~~seconds~~ minutes to comply before it ~~blasts you to to hell with a rotary autocannon~~ calls the police on you for criminal damage.

The toilet would basically be performing a ""citizens arrest"" on people for criminal damage. I find this idea to be hilarious and thought you guys might enjoy it too.

Imagine if all your monetary assets were stored inside your own body in the form of a small receiver(s), you could be paid instantly and wirelessly. 

If no-one carried cash, robberies wouldnt make sense. All transactions could easily be monitored and tracked, so it would be impossible to break the law (ending the war on drugs). On that note imagine how easy it would be to stop evil men who were untouchable before, simply turn off their money wirelessly. No more tax evasion, no more child support evasion, no more illegal laundering etc. There would be no escape.

The best thing is, once enough people come to depend on basic income, they will be obligated to vote for the political party(the left! go bernie!) that supports it, ensuring it *never* is taken away.

There are talks to blacklist, remove or lock this topic, before discussion turned into heated debate.

We as a community need to look forward into the challenges of the future and prepare ourselves for the coming revolution in AI and Robot Automation. In the ""distant"" future, some form of Basic Income will be a given. 99%  - of all other possible futures are usually dystopian. The question is how can we afford it.

Automation and machine learning - Its already here, its global and no-one has any clue what direction its going. Yet we can't have a discussion on how to keep society evolving and not stagnating? 

I understand that some are diametrically opposed to the idea of Wealth Distribution. However, Stifling debate and removing All references to Basic Income is only going to make the matter worse for both parties. 

Some very Vocal minority of The Pro UBI community is convinced there is a corporate and Governmental conspiracy to keep UBI out of the Media spotlight, considering the productivity and profits of both these entities it's not hard to accept as true when looking at the long term evidence against any ideas of Wealth distribution, the drug wars, private prisons and so on. 

Meanwhile there are some seriously salty Anti-UBI who claim that this is clearly just a generational thing and turning into a Millennials Vs Boomers Argument.

Clearly we need MORE discussion on this topic - as many haven't been given enough time to clearly understand the others position. To moderate the Subreddit around a single topic is to convince them its not worthy of attention or debate.

That simply is not true. Do you want this to become /r/politics or /r/all ?",60,0

I must repeat: ***a young, Singularitarian millennial is feeling the preliminary effects of future shock***. 

Even 5 months ago, I wasn't feeling the way I am now. I can tell you that something's changed. The whole mood's changed. It was once fun and even kinda silly to be a futurist, but now there's no jokes, there's no reason to speak with half-hearted inflections. Everything's gotten so serious.

The calendar reads 2016, and goddammit, it sure feels like it. 

What has caused me to become so excited, almost anxious even, over our technological changes? What's different now that wasn't there in 2015?

So many things, and I'll try to list them all.


- Reality augmentation has arrived, via virtual reality and augmented reality. Right now, I can put down some money and buy any of a host of virtual reality headsets. If I save up, I can buy a HoloLens developer's kit. It feels so strange to know this after living 21 years without being able to experience VR. Even right now, I can't wrap my head around it it sounds like something for the 2020s and 2030s. But then again, it *is* 2016.

- Domestic robotics. When you're lamenting how old your domestic robots are, you're living in the future. I've had a Roomba since 2011, and it recently died on me. While it's only recently that I've come to appreciate the Roomba, its death led me to scour the internet to find replacements. In that search, I kept reading about an emotional companion robot, Pepper. I'd known about Pepper ever since 2014, but I was *never* impressed with it. It always seemed to be little more than a life-sized toy. *And then Softbank teams up with IBM*. So now Pepper utilizes IBM Watson. And while it's not as impressive as ASIMO or Atlas from a mobility standpoint, it is something neither of those droids are or may be for some time ***available for purchase***. And not only that, but it's affordable for the middle class, coming in at $1,800. Science fiction always told me robots were emotionless, and here's an emotional robot that I could buy just by saving up a couple paychecks. 

- Autonomous vehicles. Just like with VR, my mind refuses to accept the fact that there are semi-autonomous vehicles driving on the road as I type this. So much so that Tesla owners have already logged 100 million miles of travel with the Autopilot feature. 10 years ago, I didn't even know driverless cars were a thing (I first heard about them on *Modern Marvels* back in '07), and now I can buy a car that drives itself (to an extent)? Back in 2012, I read up on driverless cars. I learned that not a single vehicle completed the 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge. That was just 8 years ago. So I figured we hadn't made *too* much progress since then, and I even plotted out how driverless car tech was going to progress. By 2018, there would be real world tests. By 2024, we'd see the world's first 'million mile' AV. By 2030, you might see one being driven in one of the big cities, though it would still appear clumsy. Then, in the 2040s, just in time for the Singularity, we'd see them regularly. That was my 'techno-optimist' timeline. Instead, we already have semi-autonomous cars on the road and driverless trucks are ready to be rolled out in Europe. What the hell happened between 2012 and 2016?!

- Artificial Intelligence. IBM Watson and Google Deep Mind have changed *my* world. I feel like they're real people, or eventually will be at least. When I learned about Watson in 2012 a year after its amazing domination of *Jeopardy* I was stunned. And why? Because it just didn't sound right. How could a computer understand natural language well enough to win something like *Jeopardy?* Since then, I've gained a basic understanding of various AI tasks, and yet Watson as it was in 2011 is still impressive to me. But Deep Mind? That's a whole other level of shock. It's not what caused my future shock, but damn if it didn't make it worse. Especially since everyone said Go is a game computers won't be able to beat us at until the mid 2020's! And since then, Google's revealed how they seemed to leapfrog 10 years of AI development via TPUs. [Just as this classic gif from Mother Jones said](http://i.imgur.com/xoSBN8k.gifv), we'd start seeing extreme progress right around 2015.

- Acceptance. This is easily the most important of them all. Even more important than VR, even more important than DeepMind or Watson or Viv or any of them. When I learned that the ***World Economic Forum*** was taking various futurologist subjects seriously, my mind was all over my walls, the carpet, the bed, the TV, everywhere. It just didn't sound right: these very serious, turgid people who clearly had important things to do were discussing *transhumanism?* And *artificial intelligence?* And *automation?* And they *weren't* doing it in a tongue-in-cheek manner?! How is that possible? 

The WEF taking all of this seriously was what infected me with a bad case of future shock. That was January. Exponential growth has subsequently fried my brain pretty badly, and it sees even that little sliver of time as being worth a huge amount of technological change. The tech world of January 2016 feels much more primitive than the tech world of May 2016, even though I know this to be false, that the world has clearly not changed all that much outside of some interesting developments (Deep Mind going from European champion to world champion, for example).

Current concepts (i.e. passenger drones, hyperloops, memristor computers, etc.) will exacerbate the feeling.

Because I'm a futurist, I know there are many predictions of what's to come. Naturally, I'm in the ""excited"" camp, and I want to feel even more future shocked than I already am. Others aren't the same, and I'm sure we're going to start seeing people who need psychiatric help because of the anxiety wrought by technological change. 

Within the decade.

Like I said, despite my disorientation, I'm excited. I need more. It's not just future shock, but also future lust. Exponential growth has become a sort of psychological drug, going so far as to alleviate my depression and anxiety. And when I combine it with a sort of 'metahumanism' doing things like staring at my hand or adoring my body and getting high off the knowledge that I'm both a simple primate as well as the primate that excelled I feel nothing but pure excitement for where we're going as a species. I'm proud of how far we've come, and I'm excited for where we're going.

I wonder if there are other people out there who feel this way, and at the same time, I wonder how many people are oblivious to it all? People like my mother, back when I didn't have a drone. Back when, to her, it might as well have been 2004. I actually fear for a lot of the people because I know future shock is going to hit them the hardest. My mother doesn't know she can buy a artificially intelligent humanoid robot companion, and she's heard little about autonomous cars outside of when I pestered her about them some time ago. What will happen to such people psychologically when the 2020s begin and even more sci-fi level tech and gadgets enter the mainstream?

________________

I've identified a few other things that help create a sense of ""future shock"" for me.


- My age. I found this neat sub, /r/FuckImOld, that helps to drive home that no one's getting any younger (yet). For example, I can't handle the fact that children people *I* used to call children even when I was a teenager are now teenagers themselves. Up to 2003, in fact! A child born on May 26th, 2003 is now legally a teenager. Children born after 9/11 are about to enter high school. Children born in 1998 aren't even children anymore, but legal adults. I clocked in back in 1994, so I shouldn't be feeling this way, and yet here I am. I was born in the very last year you can be born in and still be considered a ""millennial"", and very late in the year at that. I'm still in college, but I'm now a senior. After me, there won't be any more millennials. The marketing squads of every pop/youth culture obsessed corporation is beginning to shift their cameras' focus away from my generation and onto the next one, the iGeneration or Generation Z or whatever you wanna call them. 

- Social issues. When I was a kid, we openly mocked and insulted gay people on television and thought nothing of it. Now, homosexuality is fully legal across the entire US and in many countries. In fact, the latest controversy stems from conservatives not wanting *transgenders* using the 'wrong' bathroom. 15 years ago, transgender people could get stabbed in the open if anyone knew what they were. And underneath it all bubbles a new controversy, one that we probably won't hear much of this decade but will become a veritable issue in the next...

- Technosexuality. I mod /r/Robosexuality, and that one is pretty much limited to just humanoid robots as it were. And while there are sexbots of various flavors out there, they aren't particularly impressive. Nevertheless, another aspect of technosexuality is already being discussed at large VR porn. It seems every discussion of VR headsets invariably brings mention of porn and the fleshlight. It's a thing now, and it will only become more of a thing as technology improves. Men who don't need women and women who don't need men. The idea that this is true amazes me.

- Smartwatches. I said on a forum that I'm more astounded by our reaction to smartwatches than the gadgets themselves. They've *instantly* become passe. The fact you can watch HD videos on the surface of Mars, or video-call friends and relatives, or surf the Internet ***on your watch*** has been lost on a lot of people. I take it that's because smartwatches aren't the most practical piece of technology, sort of like jetpacks.

- Jetpacks, Dubai, and the World's Cities. Speaking of jetpacks, there was a news story about Dubai first responders getting jetpacks. And that made me marvel at how techno-progressive Dubai really is. Not socially progressive, very true, but they obviously love being as sci-fi as they can be. And it's not just them. The 2013 movie, *Her*, was actually filmed in Shanghai. They didn't need to digitally create a futuristic techno-cityscape because we have good enough ones for a near-future story anyway. Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Dubai, Moscow, Seoul, New York, and more all scream ""cyberpunk cityscape"". 

- SpaceX. Watching a rocket land vertically literally felt like it was ripped out of science fiction. In fact, my highest-rated post says about that much: [Science Fiction Becomes Reality](http://i.imgur.com/aebGDz8.gifv). That there are private space companies actively competing right now sounds like something you'd read in a cheap sci-fi novel. But it's real!

- Responses. This goes in addition to ""Acceptance"" because there's now such a widespread acceptance that sci-fi levels of technology are realistic. I use as an example: 6 years ago, in the summer of 2010, I was arguing online with others about economic issues. I was coming to the defense of communism, actually which was odd, as around this time, I was drunk on Glenn Beck. But the reason why I was defending communism was because I thought that was our *future*, not because I thought that's what needed to be done *today*. I was saying that robots would take our jobs and AI would become smart enough to keep us away from any new jobs. The response? Pure mockery. Telling me to put on my tinfoil hat. That was obviously Star Trek tripe for our great-grandchildren, if anyone. 6 years pass and now the concept of extreme automation is a *given* in economic circles. Some still doubt (or refuse to accept) the possibility of AI and thus fall back on the Luddite Fallacy as an argument, but everyone does admit that robots are coming for our jobs.

And *that's* another thing that gets me. All the technology in the world couldn't bring onto me as much future shock as people accepting that such technology is real. Hence why I was so taken aback by the Davos forum. Hence why I'm dropping my jaw every time I read politics or economics forums and see automation being heavily discussed.

Even 5 years ago, people wouldn't being discussing this. At least, not in polite company. And 5 years ago, we all thought we *wouldn't* be discussing these topics for 50 years. Yet here we are!

I'm not lying when I say watching the *World Economic Forum* discuss topics usually only seen on /r/Futurology actually sent me into a state of mild disorientation. It used to be that only fringe groups like transhumanists, Singularitarians, and conspiracy theorists cared about these topics. And yet now these topics are routinely on the nightly news.

**Tl;dr**: Watching the news cover automation, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and all that fun jazz gave me future shock.",73,91

**What the hell is a ""passenger drone""?**

Have you ever heard of autonomous cars? Driverless cars, self-driving cars, that jazz? Passenger drones are the same concept, except *in the sky*. They are drones you can ride on.

I used to really hate calling these things 'passenger drones' because I figured that it's just rebranding what it really is: flying cars. 

[Here's a video of the EHang 184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65X25g5Lyu)

Seriously, that's just a flying car. It's also just a helicopter. Of course, language changes and whatnot. 

However, the big innovation here is that it's autonomous, thus rendering obsolete the need for a pilot arguably the single largest issue holding back flying cars (very closely tailed by fuel efficiency). 

A personal passenger drone sounds nice, though it would obviously be a luxury. 

Getting away from rotor-drones, the arrival of passenger drones also means that airplanes can be fully automated. The concept of airplanes being ""flying buses"" will become even more true. 

The hope is that electricity will be used to power these things, rather than traditional liquid fuel. While it's still a long way off before electrical batteries will have roughly the same energy density as, say, gasoline, I can see there being an enthusiast's market for passenger drones in the near future.

I dreamt about having sex with a prostitute who would fulfill all of my desires. It was a cool dream, however, that is not the point. It is about what the prostitute in my dream was saying at the end of our little ""session"".

She said that if I wanted more, I just need to come to that very special place where I can have her whenever I want.
It was that sentence that later on that same day led to an idea that suddenly popped up in my head. What if that was actually a commercial planted inside my head advertising a service? Since dreams can be incredibly realistic I thought, that would be the ultimate advertisement to almost everything. Just think about it. In a dream we would be able to get a taste of a certain product or service as if it was reality, leaving us craving for more as soon as we wake up.

The question is if and how that could be realised. Of course something like that wouldn't be possible without any legal consequences, even if given the technology. Companies simply couldn't invade the dreams of people on a legal basis without permission.
But what If we as individuals give them the permission to do exactly that? Think about smartphones and apps. When we download an app, we are already giving companies permission to a number of things that ultimately lead to a lack of privacy. Things we don't even know about because we don't seem to care at all. Nobody reads the permission requests of a specific app before they download it, neither do they care. That is already a reality in today's society.

2825,2016-5-27,2016,5,27,13,4l98as,How do you view the trajectory of AI and ERT (essence recognition technology)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4l98as/how_do_you_view_the_trajectory_of_ai_and_ert/,sneesh,1464324459,"My guess is that sufficiently developed AI will allow for near-perfect ""essence-recognition-technology"". I don't know if this technology will be made available to the masses, or if it will only be available to HLO's (high level operators within the ecosystem of human activity).

Essence recognition technology (ERT) is a phrase to encapsulate the gestalt of technologies that can be used to conclude the identity of an entity. The entity could be a person, or even a business, or group of entities working together.

Advanced ERT may comprise not just facial recognition, voice recognition, and DNA matching, but could also include body recognition, and physical movement/cadence/disposition recognition, and also writing-style recognition.

My guess is that advanced ERT could be used to triangulate all of the internet writings of an individual across many (maybe all) of their anonymous internet posting accounts. If an account was used to write a one-word post on reddit or twitter or whatever, then triangulating may be more challenging in this instance. But I would imagine that only a few sentences are needed for the ERT to effectively triangulate the identity, especially considering the potential for context-recognition.

Context-recognition could be a powerful component of ERT, and is basically the ability of the ERT to predict the tendencies of an entity based on the given data surrounding that entity. This predictive capacity can be applied to define positive-match likelihoods between an entity and a given activity or component of data.

Anyway, in layman's terms, I kinda have the feeling that privacy and anonymity are severely threatened by the development of AI and ERT. But then again, AI development may lead to additional methods for entities to maintain their sovereignty over what and how they choose to broadcast.

All that said, truly transformative evolution of AI will probably lead to such profound changes to humanity that all of this ERT bidness is really just a single facet of a massively paradigm transmogrifying presence that super AI could catalyze.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on how privacy and sovereignty over personal data will be impacted by developments in AI?

On a fundamental level, I rest in my sense that ultimately nobody can truly know for sure if any other being is even conscious, or if they are perhaps an advanced being with power to shape-shift and perform essence-masking and operate as a native within any lesser advanced civilization. As such, no being or power other than the source of infinite-intelligence itself can ever fully know who you are. And does such a being or source of that nature exist?

We are now the year 2016 and I'm 25 years old.  
  
*Feel free to first read the previous edition (see link below) before reading any further.*  
  
The same questions remains:  
  
**Am I still young enough right now to prolong my life or become ""immortal"" at some point in time IF i have enough money to finance it?**
  
With technology expanding faster and faster I would really like to hear your opinion on the matter.  
  
Do you think any different than 1-2 years ago about life prolonging possibilities and/or how fast do you think it's progressing?  
  
  
**Previous edition's Opening Post [Version 1]:**  
&gt; I've been doing a lot of reading, thinking, contemplating etc etc.  
My main question is:  
  
&gt;Am I still young enough right now to prolong my life or become ""immortal"" at some point in time IF i have enough money to finance it?  
  
&gt;I might be a bit young to already think about this stuff but I already have my own business, it's going pretty well and I've already made up my mind to save a large amount of my money towards longevity of my life. I presume it will be a costly thing but if I live another 100 years longer, that money is easy to recuperate and maybe in another 50 years after that, the procedure to prolong life might have become even cheaper or even immortality in any form would be possible.  
  
&gt;So yeah, really been thinking about this a lot lately, hope for some likeminded people to share their opinion on the matter  
  
&gt;Edit: This blew up way more than i'd thought! Thanks everyone so much for all the input and comments! It's an incredible read and i appreciate all comments, it really made me think about some aspects.
Live healthy, live in the moment, enjoy the moment and hope and maybe plan a bit for the future is what i get out of it all. I wish all of you however long you wish to live :)!

Wells Time Machine.  They did no work and produced no goods.  The did not study or write.  They played.  They sang songs; They ate (only fruits and vegetables); and they made more Eloi.

Their lives were 100% supported by another race, the Morlocks.  Morlocks knew how everything worked.  They grew the food, they cleaned away the excrement and detritus, they ran their civilization of subterranean machines.  

The Eloi and the Morlocks began as classes, then became castes and then became races. (One tiny little problem:  The Morlocks were meat eaters and the only meat available was the Eloi.)

I see in our future the possibility of a similar class system (without the cannibalism) in which robots/AI do all the actual work, a small community of Techs and Engineers program and guide the robots and evolve the next generation of robots, and the vast majority of humans do nothing but consume and play and are supported by a Universal Basic Income.

If the predictions of the robotics guys are even mostly true, within the next 100 years labor will be completely separated from economic value.  Money will come from the state to the masses wholl spend it on goods and services provided by AIs owned by elites and managed by Techs.

Then what?",44,5

Why do we assume a human level AI will be able to improve itself ?  
It seems to me this is a huge assumption. We hardly understand the human brain, let alone have any clue to improve it.  
Singularity needs a first step before the *explosion*, and I do not see any proof that any intelligence can create a better version of itself.  
To anticipate all the answers about how computers have more powers and will do things millions times faster, it is not a problem of power / speed but a problem of quality / essence.  
Even with a human simulated AI with enormous computer power , that would effectively create a super human artificial brain, why would it magically be able to do things,  ourself cannot do. why would the AI be able to understand itself and improve itself ?  

If you want the Singularity to resemble science and not religion, you must answer this question    
tl;dr : prove to me an intelligence can improve itself, or I do not believe in the Singularity, which is supposed to be  a recursion of this phenomenon

Instead, a new and more robust test is needed while still remaining elegant and true to the original vision.  
  
The Tetraturing Test is a 4-player affair, with three of the players being humans and the fourth being an AI chatbot.  What happens is that for a period of time all participants have access to a chatroom where they are expected to interact for a certain amount of time per day.  The AI chatbot has access to only the same public information about the others, and pretends to be human in every way.  
  
The four entities interact for the length of the test (as little as a few days, or as much as a few months).  **At the end of the test, a private vote is taken from the three humans involved asking a simple question: Who was the robot?**  
  
In this way a score from 0 - 3 can be derived from the experiment. A score of 3 represents total failure as all humans successfully identified the chatbot.  A score of 0 represents absolute success as the humans actually all named *each other* as the chat bots and no one successfully guessed the real AI.  This would mean that for three different people the AI seemed more human to them than actual other humans!  
  
What do you think about this concept?  Is there any way to improve it, or any rules that need to be in place to prevent cheating/gaming (other than common sense stuff like no meeting in person). ",3,6

Or, better yet, could a game engine such as Unreal Engine be so simple to use one day that we won't need tutorials or a manual or a wiki? 

It seems to be heading that way, since there are a lot of just point and click apps (made for tablets and phones), so why wouldn't desktops (if they're still around) go in this direction?

My point is that I'm learning everything I can about Blender and Unreal Engine, but I get a feeling that it's a waste of time sometimes, and that, in ten years, my grandmother or my kid could make a decent game with little to nothing in terms of technical competency.

To me, this would take the fun (although stressful) part out of the equation - learning a computer program or language and feel accomplished. Then again, one click software would allow more time spent on making a game fun to play.

I'm aware of the game makers like Stencyl, which is close to what I'm going on about, but even that program requires tutorials and knowledge of the program.
