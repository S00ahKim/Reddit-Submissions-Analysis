In the last years we developed a few interactive documentary projects about the works of famous artists. The projects are used in Google classrooms or other online classrooms, or on the digital boards in classrooms and just at home online on desktop.  


To give an example: the latest project we have launched is the interactive documentary The metamorphosis of Escher: [http://ntr.nl/escher\-en](http://ntr.nl/escher-en)  
An interactive about the life and work of the famous graphic artist M.C. Escher. It is also possible to make your own Escher\-like work with the Metamorphosis Machine.

I am curious if people know other examples of good online interactive educational projects or articles / studies which refers to te subject.

How is ""different"" interpreted as ""bad"" so often? They're not the same. There is no attainable ideal. Your differences from another person, or group of people, doesn't equate to your human value. It's just different! And isn't it fucking awesome how different we are?

There's been a handful of science fiction depictions about the future of how humans are going to look. There's that one episode of South Park about time-travelling humans from the future and they all look exactly the same. They go around saying ""chicken sandwich"" and shit...That idea of a future bores the fuck out of me! Like everyone looks and sounds the same? If that's the case, then this is the best time to be alive for sure.

We need all these differences. We need dark ass people with bigger lips and better jump shots than everyone else; we need bald, dorky dreadfully white dudes with good credit; we need fat people...we don't need THIS many fat people...but a few of you are fun.

I don't know about how the rest of ya'll feel, but I love seeing different ass people that say different shit than other different people. I grew up, lived with, and have spent my whole life with all sorts of different people...Black folks, Asian folks, Greeks, Italians, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Kuwaitis, Moroccans, Germans, country folk, city folk, religious people, atheists, rich people, poor people, smart people, dumb people, liberals, conservative, artists, business people, Canadians, the Amish, the Wu Tang clan -- friggin everyone. They're all awesome in their own way, but what makes their differences even more awesome is seeing them in my head and appreciating that they all came from the same place.

We did -- we're monkies. And so what -- sometimes some people resemble monkies (see: Roseanne). That's where we fucking came from. There's a lot of white people that look like birdfaces and ratfaces. There's the ""mousy"" look. We're animals -- and sometimes we're going to resemble other animals -- which is so fucking dope.

So, differences aren't the same as ""bad""...well, except probably for too many fat people. So, slow down, yo. Reality shouldn't be this uncomfortable for everyone. Simply accept reality and your life, my life, and all our lives will get so much better.

But the question is that it will be an incremental change and that time of transition would be most challenging. And talking about those challenges I don't mean those generic concerns about unemployment etc but rather a philosophical view. 

So suppose we have developed a near AGI which can do most but few tasks that still require human assistance. Let's say 90% of tasks required to run the world can be fully autonomous. Here we have a situation where we don't need 99% of our population to do anything, they can just relax and enjoy life. I won't explain why we just need 1% of population because most of you understand why. 

Here we have a situation where we have a job to be done but not in enough numbers to be fairly distributed. What incentives do I have to do the work while rest of us enjoy life. We may have few people but not enough volunteering. We can't either force anyone to do work.

Even what meaningful incentives we can give? Let's discuss few options.

Money? No because it doesn't have much value now when everyone have almost everything available for free. 


Leadership? No because leadership is needed where you need to guide a mass to achieve something. So there is no value and pride even if you give him some arbitrary position or title.


Recognition? May be. But I see little incentive. At present recognition matters because you expect some material benefit from it. It is directly associated as a mean to climb up the social ladder.

And so on but incentive is always either material or non-material(social status, mental satisfaction) benefit. I am unable to think of anything of substantially more value in either terms which isn't available to general mass.

So how will we solve this problem? Or is it a completely wrong conclusion? What other similar problems there can be?",19,8,False,self,,,,,

Autonomous vehicles become widespread  this should happen well before 2050 in developed countries (perhaps by 2030). The global road toll, currently over one million deaths a year, will eventually decline by 90% or more. Car ownership will continue for rise for a time (especially in poorer countries) then eventually start to decline. More efficient, autonomous, Uber-like taxis come to dominate road systems. Owning a personal car will eventually be much more expensive (especially as human drivers become increasingly hard to insure). Flying versions (of the sort recently trialled in places like Dubai, like small electric helicopters) slowly emerge as well, albeit reserved for the very wealthy.

Other wealthy people and car enthusiasts will continue to own (regular) cars a long way into the future (like horses today). However in many countries, humans may eventually be banned/severely restricted from driving on public roads due to safety concerns (despite how unimaginable this may seem today). In the developed world at least, one of the last holdouts will be the US, as conservative politicians trumpet the rights of law-abiding car owners.

2. The space program takes off, but slowly  given current plans (especially by private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin) I would give at least 50% odds we will have a man on Mars by 2030 (only 12 years away). In just the last few years SpaceX in particular has proven the feasibility of reusable rockets. Pretty much all the requisite technologies are now here and the pace will slowly pick up as costs come down.

By 2050 several countries/major companies are likely to have space stations in Earth orbit, bases on the Moon and even Mars. Like bases in Antarctica today, these will mainly serve research and tourism purposes (plus a purely geopolitical one in staking out future territory i.e. the US and China build separate bases on the moon and then each claim a hemisphere). More probes will continue to be sent to the outer solar system. The earliest human missions to Jupiter or Saturn space may be in their early stages by 2050. Early efforts to mine the resources of the asteroid belt may be under way. Space-based solar power might have become a reality around Earth (though I suspect that, like nuclear power before it, the public will be sufficiently terrified by the thought of giant space lasers that plans will be stymied even if the experts say the safety concerns are greatly exaggerated). Space elevators remain impractical.

3. The world successfully finds new sources of energy and copes with climatic changes  for decades many people (some of them highly educated) have predicted that something akin to peak oil was imminent and that shortly afterward the world might plunge into a Mad Max-style dystopia. This is unlikely. Not only have the worlds oil, coal and natural gas reserves proven to be vast enough to likely last us generations, but even if all fossil fuels vanished tomorrow, the world has enough uranium to supply our energy needs for thousands of years. CO2 levels will continue to rise and with it global temperatures will continue to tick upwards. However, the industrial capacity and ingenuity of the human race rises much faster. In 2018 your odds of dying from a natural disaster are an order of magnitude less than in 1900. This trend will continue.

The worlds urban population doubles between 2010 and 2050 (from 3.5 to 7 billion). Major coastal cities eventually construct elaborate flood levees as sea levels rise maybe two or three feet by the end of the century. Even in poorer countries, better infrastructure majorly cuts down on deaths due to disease, famine, floods, storms and other disasters (in the long run earthquakes remain the most unpredictable and thus the most dangerous). The predicted climate refugees largely fail to eventuate, though millions are always seeking to enter the first world to find higher paying work, especially as automation ramps up and cheap labour is no longer the powerful driver of growth it once was.

Fossil fuels remain the primary source of energy in 2050. However, solar, wind, nuclear and now fusion power plants are rapidly coming on line. By 2050 several record breaking tunnels, including from Sicily-Tunisia and Korea-Japan, have been constructed. A number of buildings over 1km tall have been built, with the highest (likely built in a prestige-hungry African country) surpassing 1.5km.

4. Major confrontations between the US and China over Taiwan and the South China Sea  there will almost certainly be at least one more (and possibly several) sequels to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Taiwan Strait Crises. This could take many forms. It might start with a Chinese blockade of the island, or an attempt to seize another, more minor Taiwanese asset (Taiping Island in the Spratlys stands out for instance, or possibly Kinmen and Matsu closer to the mainland). One such scenario is depicted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureWhatIf/comments/878eii/scenario_the_fourth_taiwan_strait_crisis_of_2020/)

Hard to be specific but I would predict better than 50% odds you will see Chinese and US warships shooting at each other at some point. However, I also think the odds are very low it will escalate into WW3. As both sides have nuclear-tipped ICBMs and the American and Chinese homelands are sufficiently far apart battles are likely to be confined to sea, air and fairly remote islands (though space and cyberspace are also likely). Other countries like Japan and Australia could easily get involved.

Hostilities may last for years but the eventual death toll will probably be in the thousands rather than the millions. More dire scenarios see a physical Chinese land invasion of Taiwan (though it is hard to see this succeeding) or a major escalation whereby one side tries to shoot down the others satellites, causing a chain reaction that destroys more or less everything in LEO. This, or a China-US trade embargo (10X worse than the current trade war) plus a prolonged shutdown of seagoing trade in the S. China Sea would cause severe economic disruption. However, again, probably no nukes and no WW3. My ultimate guess is that the US Navy prevails and in 2050 Taipei is still independent of Beijing (indeed  probably openly so).

5. Global politics will realign as demographic change and economic growth sees the rise of certain countries  in broad strokes this is fairly obvious, but we can take a stab at a few specifics. Despite earlier fears of runaway growth the global population is expected to increase from todays 7.5 billion to maybe 10 billion in 2050 and thereafter stabilize. Also, despite much misinformation and fear-mongering the world today is much richer and healthier today than ever before.

The existing western world will maintain its dominance for some time yet. The United States in particular is projected to have healthy population growth well into the future. The US population should be around 400 million by 2050 (albeit increasingly diverse) and still third in the world (though Nigeria might overtake them towards the end of this century).

China since 1980 is the obvious model for other poor countries (though worth noting their streak of 10% annual GDP growth burned out in 2010, they have averaged 6-7% since). Indias economy is now growing faster than Chinas and its population will overtake theirs by 2025 but it is starting from a much lower base. Despite many predictions, I suspect the US will remain no.1 in GDP at least until 2030 and will still be 1st or 2nd in 2050 (with China the only real competitor).

A complete implosion of China is possible. This could be caused by an economic crisis or a failed military venture abroad which destroys the legitimacy of the communist party and sparks a revolution calling for democratic and other reforms. Perhaps in tandem with this, North Korea implodes and is reunified with South Korea (this is unlikely to occur without a major change in China first, given their status as essentially a buffer state with the US-backed south).

One possible state that stands out as a future superpower is the East African Federation, an intended evolution of the existing East African Community that now includes Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and South Sudan. At present these states are very poor, with a combined GDP smaller than New Zealand. However, they are now growing at 6% a year. Linked by Swahili as a common lingua franca they are expected to have a population of 410 million by 2050 and 800 million by 2100  not far behind India and China. If their political integration succeeds and their economic growth continues, the EAF could emerge as a major world power by mid-century.

6. Population declines and changing resource markets will cause the decline of other countries - on the flip side to the above, countries like Japan and Russia have a bleak demographic outlook. Russia in particular with anaemic economic growth and a growing Muslim minority may face substantial internal instability. The decline of oil (either due to the spread of new technologies or simply a global shortage) will also contribute. The country could even collapse entirely as depicted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureWhatIf/comments/88o731/scenario_the_russian_collapse_of_2030/)

Individual European states face demographic and (relative) economic decline. However if the European Union survives as an institution (I would give better than 50% odds) its combined population of 450 million (even without the UK) and historical economic strength should help it remain a major world power well into the century. The anglosphere countries will continue to benefit from the rise of English to the global lingua franca.

In 2050 I suspect the Middle East, as in 2018 or indeed 1950, will continue to be something of a war-torn shithole. The brewing cold war between Sunni-Saudi Arabia and Shia-Iran is just beginning. Both could eventually get nukes (and then things get real interesting). The decline of oil, increasing calls for democracy/secularism/modernisation and ongoing ethnic tensions will all ensure continued chaos. An independent Kurdistan is likely to become a reality eventually. Turkey, now resurgent and by far the strongest country in the region, could take advantage of the weaknesses of the Arab states to advance south into its historical realm of influence (the entire region having been controlled by them until 1918).

On the whole Africas economic outlook is now improving and its demographics indicate that 40% of the world will be African by 2100. However, they still have a long way to go. Major wars, revolutions, epidemics and other disasters are likely to strike numerous times before then as they have in the previous 60 years since the withdrawal of the European colonial powers. I suspect in the next decade or two racial tensions in South Africa will also come to a head and the white minority will be forced to flee the country, i.e. Rhodesia in the 1980s.

7. Neural implants evolve from todays smartphones  As we went from room-sized computers to PCs to laptops to smartphones (and maybe smartwatches and smartglasses as well) the ultimate result will be unobtrusive brain-computer interfaces that will quickly become universal (if not exactly mandatory  but trying staying employed without one). As with past computer technologies, the earliest adopters (from maybe the late 2020s) will be tech enthusiasts, time-pressed businessmen, and the young. Over another decade or so they will spread to the rest of the population in developed countries (with some inevitable holdouts, generally the elderly with little appetite to embrace more technologies and those with religious or other objections). Poorer countries (though now catching up) will be another decade or two behind. However, even in darkest Africa neural implants will probably be arriving by 2050 or so, as electricity and the internet already are today.

So what is a neural implant? Think of a smartphone but one that bypasses your traditional senses. Rather than looking at a screen or listening via speakers, information will be beamed directly into your neocortex. Images/text/sounds and possibly other sensations will simply appear in your vision/hearing. This would apply to everything. When you walk down a shopping strip advertisements will flash up in your vision. When you want to communicate with someone, text/audio/video messages can be wordlessly exchanged via a little box popping up in the corner of your field of view. You can browse the global internet, check the weather, etc simply via thought commands. You can set a morning alarm that will wake up nobody but you! Its at least as big a revolution in our lives as everything internet-related since 1990.

Of course, all this would come with staggering privacy concerns (i.e. the government or someone else being able to hack into your very nervous system and observe what you sense/observe  or perhaps even being able to take control themselves depending on the nature of the implant). However, society finds ways to deal with these concerns, as we already have carrying smartphones around in our pockets. Expect to see a few neural-implant-Edward-Snowdens.

8. Major enhancements to the human body, either through gene therapy or surgery, start to become possible  neural implants are one thing, but just one element of our shift into what are essentially cyborgs. Artificial organs are already on the horizon. Designer babies are well on the way. Genetic doping in sports is probably already around. Genetically modified crops are already decades old.

Want to guarantee your kids will grow to be at least six foot? Have perfect vision and teeth? Such gene therapy will eventually not only be permitted, but calls will abound to make it free and universal (like education or healthcare today). On the plus side, our children and grandchildren will increasingly be free of the heavy burdens of genetic disease. On the other hand, if everyones kid has a perfect smile and can learn to play the violin with ease  how else does one stand out? Major social problems typical of a modern society, such as obesity and drug abuse, will finally start to reverse after decades.

Of course, inequality will be a problem. Just as it is the worlds wealthy offspring who have access to braces or laser eye surgery today, the poor will have to do with their natural bodies until such breakthroughs spread. A heart attack will prove fatal to an old man in Africa. In Europe it may mean the installation of a new heart and another decade of life. However, this is just the beginning.

9. Anti-aging efforts start to bear fruit  this one has many question marks attached, but I would expect that substantial progress will eventually be made. Global life expectancy is now 72 years, up from 67 in the year 2000 or 48 in 1950. Most of this has been as the low-hanging fruit of vaccines, improved sanitation and nutrition and other changes have finally spread to the third world.

Modern medicine tells us the human body is an immensely complicated machine. Slicing and dicing our DNA is still proving immensely hard. Nonetheless, aging doesnt seem to be an immutable law (like breaking the light barrier or time travel or anything). Once our understanding of the human body is sufficiently advanced, reversing every aspect of the aging process seems very possible. Maybe Im falling into the usual trap of hoping for such developments before I get old (I will be nearing 60 in 2050) but I suspect we might finally be getting close. However, for a task of this magnitude, we might have to wait for the next step  the breakthrough to end all breakthroughs.

10. The singularity  this is the biggest question mark of all. While I feel the world until 2050 is relatively foreseeable (barring a nuclear war, solar flare, etc) the rise of superintelligent AIs is an event so overwhelming as to put all other predictions in doubt. Even if Moores law slows it is unlikely to stop, and current trends put the capabilities of silicon computers well ahead of anything our puny human brains can do by mid-century.

Suffice it to say I think the worst predictions about the singularity are unlikely to come to pass. Most apocalyptic scenarios about an AI taking over the world see a massive divide between that AI and the puny humans of 2018 (or earlier). By 2050 many humans will already be well on their way to becoming cyborgs. AIs of all shades will have been developed, doing everything from playing chess matches to playing the stock market. The gap between a superintelligent AI and the rest of the world wont be nearly as great, decreasing the odds that a single rogue entity will be able to hold the rest of the world hostage to its pre-programmed whims.

Nonetheless, the proliferation of superintelligence will strain every institution of our modern world. Major, apparently unassailable concepts like democracy and capitalism and the superiority of human life will come under question. Why bother with the cumbersome nature of a democratic legislature or the chaos of a free market, if a perfect AI can make better decisions? Why respect the worlds existing governments, if all their armies and weapons have suddenly been made obsolete by some godlike alliance of AIs? Why even bother with the real world at all, if you can transfer your brain patterns to a hard drive smaller than your thumb and inhabit whatever virtual reality you please? In a world where humans as weve known them for the past 100,000 years have suddenly become obsolete, whatever will our silicon offspring do next?",63,30,False,self,,,,,

My proposal is that we make the comment moderation more relaxed. Yes, this may mean a couple more throwaway comments, but the result will be more engagement from a wider community.

The EU has made a move to ban all tungsten light globes based on their low power efficiency. Tungsten bulbs are the ones that would come to mind when you think light globe - not Fluorescent or LED.

There has been objection in particular in the theatre and film production industries - tungsten globes have been used in these industries for over 100 years and to a certain extent inform the look we are used to.
Tungsten bulbs have a certain colour temperature, simple distribution of light frequencies, and a predictable nature.
The loss of tungsten bulbs wont kill theatre or film - but it will never quite be the same again.

So my question is, what consumable technology are you aware of of which we have finite stock?

Self-driving cars? Smart AI that could save the world or destroy it? Sending people to Mars? 

While these futures are possible (or rather, inevitable) they miss a very important part about thinking about the future: the minor (or major) problems we face in our everyday lives thatll be solved by the rise in technology.

Clean Energy is probably one of the closest things humans have come to true future tech, something we have sought after for decades, finally coming to fruition. But its not very exciting is it? I mean, its great and all, but it doesnt really effect the common person that much, except to lower the electric bill. 

What about new farming tech? Most of you would probably have seen the new lab grown meat tech starting to get some traction in the media, whichll completely end the suffering of the animals being trapped in cages until theyre slaughtered, but agriculture tech can be expanded in other ways too: Veridical farming aims to take farming from the outside to the inside, making more efficient growing of crops, and that means cheaper food, which means less people starve. 

And speaking of less people starving, because of the new tech and societal advances, people in poorer countries will probably become less poor, as you may of heard before the average person today lives better lives than Kings did 300 years ago, and I dont think that trend is going to go away any time soon. 

But thats not even to mention the really good stuff! Like how with growing advances in medicine and medical technology, as well as Moores Law (the prediction that states that technology will double in processing power, halve in size, or halve in cost, every two years) its extremely likely that people alive today will have access to immortality-causing nanobots (or something of that sort) before the end of their lifetime! Imagine living till youre 150, nay, *1,050*! Other tech to completely cure cancer, or Alzheimers, or reverse aging, or cure obesity, diabetes, allergies, blindness, deafness, HIV! These major life changing problems we could face in the future completely wiped out of the minds of the worrisome! Gone the way of dysentery, polio, and small pox! 

VR that feels like youre really there, cars that drive themselves so well and so efficiently so no one gets in any accidents, ever, even through open intersections or through the daily commute! (Also eliminating traffic from existence!) Or 3D printing a new heart for your father, or a robotic arm, complete with touch sensitivity and full motor control for your grandma, or maybe going all the way to completely uploading your brain to a computer, where youre immortal and free to do whatever you could ever want, running so fast that a single second feels like a decade

The future is bright, and while we will face many problems along the way, itll always be a better, more amazing, more spectacular, more mind-bogglingly incredible tomorrow. ",15,14,False,self,,,,,

I find it hard to talk about these topics with my close peers, whom a majority seem not merely as fixated on it as I am or just think I've lost a few too many screws.

I've spent the past 5-6 years keeping an eye on the very interesting developments of AI - even working on some projects with data scientists ranked quite high on Kaggle (19th in the world), to gain further understanding. Of course these are just narrow elementary applications of AI.

With all the talks of superintelligence, I think we can all be certain of one thing: the uncertainty of it all. 
Attempting to predict the potential outcomes of our future with an entity more intelligent than the collective sum of all intelligence is something that's simply outside the grasp of our present understanding.

Having said that, after hearing dozens of different types of plausible scenarios from thought leaders in the field (Nick Bostrom, Michio Kaku, Ray Kurweil, etc) Id like to hear tour thoughts on what I believe may be two distinctly different ultimate outcomes...



Outcome 1:
HUMANITY-AI COEXISTANCE

Superintelligence enhances our efforts and propels humanity efforts forward. 

That's just the beginning of this story.

You can include in this story all the killer applications and combinations of how AI will better our lives and affords us longer healthier lives while eating all the Nutella we'd ever want. 

Whether or not we reach technological singularity - through mind uploading or some other technology - whereby we essentially become one with the internet and become a giant hive of robots, this scenario is likely to continue onwards beyond earth.

I have no idea what the trajectory of our space travel might be after we leave earth however I feel that harvesting resources from other planets may be within the very nature of our species - especially one that is rapidly expanding beyond thei intended biome.



OUTCOME #2:
HUMANITY ELIMINATED/CONTAINED BY AI

Whether it's through the classic Terminator scenario, where we get annihilated by evil robots created by super AI as a consequence of its programming or some other manipulation, it'll ultimately be very difficult to predict whether or not and HOW superintelligence might stunt the growth or completely eliminate our environmentally-unfriendly, planet-destroying species.

If it concludes that the most logical and efficient way to fulfill its programming of bettering humanity and reduce suffering is to actually eliminate it (assuming thats applicable after it becomes fully self-aware), or that it determines that advancing humanity beyond the carrying capacity of earth would be an adverse decision, ultimately it is more likely to either allow us to simply extinguish ourselves or to actively do so to contain our prolific  nature.

Basically, it may conclude we are vermin that's undeserving of continuation.


Would.love to hear any thoughts!




Note:

To the skeptics who may shrug these scenarios off as too science fiction-y: Id recommend watching Nick Bostroms talk on potential possibilities of AIs - I think he communicates his opinions with less presumptuousness than I.",18,10,False,self,,,,,

Currently this is how I see NP:

* **expensive!!** I have yet to see an example of a new or old plant that is in cost parity with natural gas or solarwind
* slow to implement, over 5 years to build new plants (in the best case)
* heavily reliant on the worlds freshwater supply
* affected by global warming (high water temps make plants slow down)

Can we somehow measure the height you want to raise your arm, and transform it into tridimensional coordinates?

I guess it would sort of be like the ""Sword Art Online"" system, maybe even ""Ready Player One"".

I really hope it gets to be possible because neuroscience is taking huge steps nowadays and I guess something like this is not too far from our capabilities, but... Can we actually do it? If so, how?

Our eyes, for example, the information received by them can be manipulated because we can manipulate the environment around us and so, create a response in them that sends a signal to the brain, and there the signal is ""worked out"" somehow and boom! We can see! How do you even try to send signals directly into the optic nerve? Do you somehow connect a cable to it? Would physical movement be extremely necessary in order to carry out this virtual reality or can we just lay down on our beds and relax?

Touch. How would you do it? There's a huge amount of nerves travelling through your skin at the moment, and they send repeated signals to the brain. Even if we somehow found the way to manipulate the information being sent to your brain, you would neet to take care of A LOT of stuff. Just think about the amount of nerves you'd have to take care of!

And you might be thinking: Well, just plug it into the spine! Really, though? Would that not be kind of... I don't know, DANGEROUS? Sending signals into your brain that do not even belong there and intercepting the ones your brain is sending to mute every signal coming from the ""real world"" (your room's temperature, your dog licking your finger...). Would this type of technology allow us to not feel pain while in game? Would a machine be able to classify signals sent in and out of the brain? Not to mention the potential danger plugging something sending electric impulses to your spine could cause!

Anyways, these are my thoughts about this, obviously there's a lot of questions that I think could lead to an interesting discussion,  what do you guys think?",4,6,False,self,,,,,

That is because the calculus of power has tilted decisively in favor of the tech giants and other elites, forever.

They can fight any changes in the courts for a long time, and by the time any decision is made, there would likely be to be a new regime which would be less willing to bother the elites, so no changes are made and things stay as they are.

The people have lost their power- whatever power they got, the courts and the established structure will thwart it. 

The brahmin caste of India has lasted for a good portion of 3 millennia. The elites of Korea, the yangban class who had a life-and-death power over anyone below their class, were formed around 1395 and it lasted all the way to about 1950, and the descendants of whom still have considerable power in many cases. 

And that is before genetic engineering was introduced.

People's words meant something, and one died rather than give up one's honor.

After the harsh winter of 1944 and 1945, honor died in Europe. It lingered on for a little longer in America, and died sometime in the 1960s.

Reputations ceased to mean jack shit when one had enough power and wealth (example : Floyd Mayweather). Even if no one liked you, as long as you had skills you were used, and as long as you had money people bowed to you.

Today's economy only rewards those who are smart and have marketable skills. The Old Values, like trust, compassion, cooperation, etc have ceased to working and those who still believe in them are only going to be victims of smarter, cunning and cutthroat winners of the future who will lawyer up if the victims try to retaliate.

(The lawyers themselves are cutthroat - lots of second, third an fourth tier lawyers being minted every year, but the smartest , most ruthless and most willing to destroy their enemies get the most lucrative contracts and live the most luxuriously.)

All social structure will collapse since the smarter , richer and more pragmatic part of population will do an ""Atlas Shrugged"" if the masses rise up.

Old Values have died - it will be individual, atomic, and all that. Techs are being developed to make people live virtually forever, something I wrote a few days ago, and very, very efficient smarties who will leave no 'slack' for others dependent upon the system will take over everything. 

The society of the ""Iks"", described by Colin Turnbull, is going to be the norm; except, the Iks of Uganda didn't have any high tech to make them completely independent of others, but the tech kings, etc will be able to get contraptions so they won't have to suffere each other forever.

They believe they will be able to produce batteries for under $100/kWh with two years.

If you had told anyone in the industry that a company would be achieving these prices before the end of the decade, they would have smiled and told you politely that you have no idea what you're talking about. A couple years ago, $350/kWh was considered the industry standard. Now look where we are.

These prices will have some truly impressive implications. It basically means that Tesla's vehicles can be price-competitive with every vehicle in the market, and there will be nothing standing in the way of electric vehicles getting 80-90% market share except the time it takes to build the factories to build all these batteries and cars.

So we are now at the beginning of the real electric revolution: one where electric cars are not limited by technology or price, but rather by the rate at which companies can build new factories to produce batteries for these cars.

This is why Volkswagen recently announced they'll be investing [$48 billion in electric vehicle production](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/05/04/volkswagen-doubles-ev-battery-order-to-48-billion/). They are the first big auto company outside China to recognize how important it is to produce batteries at scale.",1008,5457,False,self,,,,,

Hello all!

I'm coming here for help. I do not have reading or writing skills that are needed to create a professional business plan to entice investors in a plan that could change the world in the best way. So I'm going to propose my concept and hope that there are some hard working and intelligent diplomats on this platform willing to help out the greatest cause of all.

People in the United States have little faith in the way our government system is working today. Our current system is entirely inefficient and lacking automation. I believe our Constitution is really what has held things together in favor of the people.

Within our government lies a system destined to fail every single time. Politicians are no longer what is needed in office. There is a system of favors within that allows tyranny and corruption to blossom.I personally don't believe that there is any politician out there that is 100&amp;#37; moral and 100&amp;#37; accountable for their actions. Once you pursue a life within politics there seems to be a strong favor system. We all have times in need. It pushes one to turn a blind eye. For which they now owe a blind eye in return. When it comes time to repay your favor, you are not always in control of what you become an accessory to. In my opinion reform must come from the outside\-in. Bottom line, we need full accountability in office, and I believe I have the beginning stages of what we can do to fix it. Within our Constitutional rights.

The Reality Show:

The show is designed to find the fairest person eligible to become an important member of our government. This individual must be ready to not accept a form of payment. Because direct funding into a bank account allows room for lobbying. There will be no forms of payment during this show towards the ""contestant"". Instead dietary needs and necessities will be issued. Water, 3\-4 properly cooked meals, a comfortable bed, clothing, computer access with internet, a land line (tapped for audience). There will be a daily routine in which the contestant is put through a live Q&amp;A that are geared towards diplomacy and sense of right and wrong, mediating hard decisions. The contestant will have access to a national poll of questions in which they can respond to the publics questions. The public can then vote if they are satisfied/ dissatisfied with the response. All Q&amp;A sessions will be monitored by a professional polygraph specialist. If a question cannot be answered, we will find an expert on the subject and mediate a proper response live.

Candidate/ Contestant:

This individual being needs to be the most logical, moral, and reasonable possible. They have had to experienced real pain, hardship, happiness, love, empathy, compassion, and remain completely unbiased and ethical. They must be a born leader. Someone who isn't okay with mediocre. Someone who can read other people's intentions without them verbalizing it. We can add to that list but let's move on.

How will the public know this exists?

We must create a viral advertised quiz. Similar to the one's that have plagued our social media pages for years. People always seem to want to take them anyways. The quiz will take you to an external website that will ultimately be live\-streaming the reality show. Within the quiz there will be questions that will determine ones ability to detect a fair answer/ right from wrong. This will create a profile for that user to use within the website.

How:

The process will instate forced accountability. The plan is to build a highly secured, 100&amp;#37; monitored fortress/ bunker. All of which will be live streamed 24 hours a day. Every angle must be live\-streamed to reveal full transparency. This will allow anyone in the world to get to know this contestant, see every action, every decision, every conversation will be monitored. Everything within the show will be open to the criticism of the audience. The audience will also have opportunities to agree to contestant requests or not, if the audience feels they have earned it. Currency donated will always go to the show to keep it running at cost. No one will receive a profit of any manner. All costs and receipts will be posted live. All transactions can be disputed among the public. The public ultimately will be able to decide how the future of the show is to be run via online polls.

Funding:

This will be crowdfunded. The denominations to never been given any form of favoritism or leverage. Initial investors will be refunded once the costs are fulfilled with any funding that follows. Donations will happen in tiers depending on the size of the program.

The Website Must:

\- Be able to live stream every camera needed to show transparency.

\- Be able to hold live &amp; secured polls to members.

\- Host a ""trip wire"" for any infiltration live.

Why?

Because we have to at least try. The point is to build an algorithm in which we can have an ever revolving choice of the most fair person. So that we can quickly bring people of light/ uninfluenced into positions of power. Since people of the United States are lazy and too happy with their lives to create a reform we must make it easy for them to vote.

I am not the brightest, I am not claiming to have all of the answers.

I do not want credit, I don't want payment.

What I do want is to lessen pain, suffering, and struggle throughout the world, starting here at home within the USA.

I will claim to have received this information due to a channel in consciousness. This information was given to me. Not of my own mind. From an external source.

If it is deemed difficult to find a ""contestant"" for this position. I will happily accept the position. I believe I have the drive, empathy, and fairness to be the right person for the job. Though my #1 motive is just to open source a viable solution for a fix. It doesn't have to be me. I would like to be included if anyone decides to build this better.

If this account disappears, it's because there are larger forces at work. I have been battling suicide, and I think it is because forces are aware of my plans to open source and create this plan. I will never commit suicide. So if I'm gone, it was assassination. Even writing this has been difficult. Be aware, supernatural things may occur if you choose to help with this. Maybe it's just me being an empath. 

Please ask questions so that I can better build structure for this plan. Or you can tell me how you don't think it will work. Thank you in advance!",11,1,False,self,,,,,

As weve successfully released our alpha version chat app on Android and are in the final stages of our [MeshEx Keyring Booster](https://medium.com/@blockmesh/blockmesh-update-meshex-keyring-booster-22fd039af022) development, we can now begin turning our attention to our blockchain development as well.

Why do we need our own blockchain? Well, because were busy building custom hardware and software, we need a blockchain that is built to fit the needs of our network and future tokenization system. Wed prefer to build this from the ground\-up, instead of retrofitting it to existing blockchains.

The plan to develop a custom blockchain has been in the pipeline for months and we have partnered with PACS Blockchain developers. Weve agreed on the goals, and can now move forward with the next phase of development.

The first stage is that each device thats connected to the Mesh Network will need to be verified by our Proof of Network (PoN) algorithm. This will prove that said devices support the network and can begin mining Mesh Tokens.

Some of the basic parameters are:

* Data transfer rate
* Data transferred
* Up\-time
* Signal strength in distance

Our [MeshEx Keyring Booster](https://medium.com/@blockmesh/blockmesh-update-meshex-keyring-booster-22fd039af022) prototype is nearly ready and were in the final stages of finishing our software used to link these devices together as one. Once this is complete, our test network will be ready for us to start building the proof of concept for our own blockchain.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Operation of the brain depends on the dynamics of electrical and biochemical signal exchange between neurons; therefore, capturing them in a single ""frozen"" state may prove insufficient. In addition, the nature of these signals may require modeling down to the molecular level and beyond

;Excerpt from Gizmodo's article;
""There is an extra issue inAltered Carbon, and that is the recipient bodies. These are either grown clone bodies or donor bodies, nearly totally organic. I can easily imagine (given the above assumptions of technology) how a computer running the brain software could control a biological body, but I have a far harder time imagine how to download a brain network into a recipient brain. Somehow we need to rearrange all the connections to correspond to the downloaded person. That is an extremely tricky thing even with mature nanotechnology, since many neurons stretch across much of the entire brain and now need to be re-routed. This is the part I definitely doesnt believe can be realistic""

If mature nanotechnology can't then what can ?

would a complete  BCI for the entire nervous system allow us to do things like 

1 Make us feel like we've eaten already without inhibbiting the feelings of hunger  ?

2 increase our memory capacity ?

3 applications like AR and VR with full immersion  ? 
 
4 movie watching , internet and other smart-phone and desktop pc  like features with neural link type interface  (accel world , not exactly like that tho)? 

5  help us check our bodily health without going to the doctor ? 

6 Give us artificial emotional , physical , psychological response  to things or record such feelings and replay them  (without inhibbiting natural responses) ? ( Be happy , sad , feel like laughing , crying , fearful, excited  , scared  feeling aroused or stimulated, feeling loved, inlove feelings  ,satisfied  etc on demand without a visual or physically present stimuli like something great happening etc   ) 

 7 help in enjoying things that one natural or because of other causes can't enjoy ? ( For example someone who's naturally repulsed by objectively bad food/gross food , would BCI create Artificial feelings of enjoyment in eating it ? Instead of inhibiting the  natural response of repulsion , means the artificial and natural responses can co exist )

8 Control our dreams at night and join other's dreams too(who have BCI too of course) ? 


9  improve our eye sight and help us exercise our eyes ?
How would all this be done ?

And also that it would require some sort of brain surgery and it's unethical at the moment and that it might have to be really risk free for this to happen

However, he did not foresee the advance of tech.

http://freenortherner.com/2016/03/18/the-high-iq-homo-economicus/

A lot of BS, but in short,

1. Most people will end up shitty.

2. Those at the top echelon, the High IQ Homo Economicus, are at best indifferent to the fate of the masses and the poor, and in many cases profit heavily from the suffering of the masses.

In fact, it is necessary to be cunning, merciless, and almost psychopathic and entirely incapable to feel others' pains to succeed in today's economy.

Such people will lead the Race to the Future, reach Singularity and all that, and join Civilization 2.0.

I have said plenty about the masses so I won't say any more about it. From now on, I will probably concentrate on how the future, driven by very smart, very selfish, very psychopathic , very cunning (i.e. Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos, still worth a few hundred million and her story far from over) and very incapable of feeling others' pain, will develop.

I expect the eternal separation to be accelerated even further from 2020, which is only 2 years away, and given tech and everything else are advancing very fast, I think the whole process will be over by 2030, and an eternal veil between those who will make it to Civilization 1.0, Singularity and Space Conquest , maybe a few million at most, and the rest will be drawn.

With all the billions of people housed in buildings like what Marshall Brain described in his Manna, or in desolate, nuclear/toxic dumps, those who will join Civilization 2.0 will enjoy luxuries unprecedented in the history of world and even beyond as every square inch of the earth falls into their eternal control. 

I will write what will happen after reaching Civ 2.0 in another post.",2,5,False,self,,,,,

I am on an adventure riding a bicycle across Texas carrying 200 pounds of gear in saddle bags and a trailer.  My tires melted in Marathon Texas.  Social Networking and now Reddit seem like good places to share what I have learned, even if it does make me an enemy of the state and banks and religions and educational institutions, etc.
Considering this following expert, just a copy and paste of an existing post, is how your money and language functions phenomenally outside the culturally specific context of narrative trained into the brain's Default Mode Network, why not give it our all and make financing obsolete.
https://reddit.app.link/bcnDmCGuEN
Language is useful once trained into the mind. But it isn't meaningful, which is why Deuteronomy 23:19-20 are such powerful jewish laws. Teach goyim one thing and treat them as lesser beings, treat jews as chosen people, only belief in meaningless language and finance seperates Deuteronomy 23 19Do not charge a fellow Israelite interest, whether on money or food or anything else that may earn interest. 20You may charge a foreigner interest, but not a fellow Israelite, so that the Lord your God may bless you in everything you put your hand to in the land you are entering to possess and occupy it. Funny thing is, language begins as musical patterns of the human voice repeted tona baby while presenting it with another unrelated event, such as a teddy bear. The stuffed animal doesn't name itself, the spoken language becomes triggers for the correlated memories. Written language is just contrasting pigments given regular shapes and those visual patterns correlated to sounds through discipline and repetition. The symbols have never made sound on their own. Light from the symbols hits the retina and triggers memories of sounds and other correlations, which cascade into further memory triggering events. The memories then resonate in the Default Mode Network of the human brain, and if the mind's focus is on the narrative created in the mind, the events of phenomenal reality are not so important. Charging interest began as calves returned a herd of cattle lent in ancient Mesopotamia, debt bondage was often the collateral offered in contracts. Anatolian merchants introduced silver into that system, except silver is sterile and cannot breed, and has no wealth value, like cattle, which can plow fields and be milked etc. silver and other nonbiological currency only has value when given away. The merchants took over the temples in ancient Babylon and created a Wall Style financing network that used Orwellian 1984 tactics to restructure political systems and recreate religions with its interest based financing on nonbiological currency as the core. No wonder Deuteronomy 23: 19-20 are such powerful Jewish Laws. Blend that with Talmudic Law, like US Public Law 102-14, and there is a banker controlled New World Order Leveraging the manufactured religions of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity to generate a large portion of their power base.

TLDR at the bottom, but extremely recommend to read it

-

I tried to cross the road but the bridge above was so short that I had to crunch, just to see a car, you know, like cyberpunk neon vehicles, like auto racing. And it turned away with neon trace left


After auto-racing turned away, people and me were wandering why there were no vehicles coming for a long time, everyone was waiting.

And then, here it comes. Its a team includes many ambulances with silent siren, and small vehicle which I ;found out it can only have one passenger with one driver in it when it comes closer.

People started lining up when the team stopped in front of them, me too. I was very close to the vehicle and I dont know whats going on. Until a girl explained to me, were going to be chosen What? Choose to what? She then asked the driver, who looks like half human, half machine,  if she can be chosen.

So.... it is some kind of a Chosen Era, and it does make sense if ambulance were tasked to do bio-test, but where? Mars? (Thats the place I thought in the dream which could explain)

-

It was so shocking that I had to (?) stop dreaming. 

In short: human are going to a world with heavy cyberpunk elements first, and then a chosen era appears

 OK, say a powerful virus was found (powerful, in the sense that it could penetrate deep into the specific genes you seek to target) and let's also say that it did not lead to such a powerful immune response (i.e. where for example that 18 year old died from gene therapy) \- could you then initiate ""improvements"" on adult humans (assuming of course, that you knew all, if not most of the specific genes responsible for height, hair, hair/eye colour and growth)?  


I talk especially and primarily in regard to adult humans (not embryos and whatnot, as I know that embryos will have a great chance of gene therapy working).  


At the current moment, I know such things don't seem to be possible, but in a few decades or whatnot?  


**Basically, how could gene therapy be harnessed to create a ""superhuman"" in an already alive adult human \[not an embryo\] (not fantasy nonsense like Magneto or whatever \- I mean the usual, like enhanced musco\-skeletal system, bone growth even, a ""second"" puberty maybe).**

And it got me thinking. How many of these boxes do they really have left until the ubiquity of smart phones make them obsolete?

Another next gen hardware upgrade is probably going to be a modest improvement on more of the same. Talent, labor and man hours are a more limiting factor than hardware.

Only thing games come up short on is ray tracing (reflections) hair, cloth, frame rates and resolution, if we're going to knit pick. But textures look pretty good, particle physics are look'n good, polycount isn't a thing anymore and they can afford to keep making the maps larger and larger. 

But let's cut to the chase, the iPhoneX holds 3gb ram. The Xbox One and PS4 have 5-8gb ram. Which means that phones are really nipping at their heels. [Fortnight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZfbBrnlJus) for example does perform better on the xbonex, but it holds it's own on mobile. 

I think the future of gaming is definitely going to be something like plugging your phone into your tv for a charge, then you pick up your controller and bang, you're playing GTA in ultra high res. Or you can strap your phone on your face if VR is your thing.

I really don't think it's an *if* but a **when**. Kinda like when arcades phased out after the first playstation. Only catch is, I said the same thing about 10 years ago and since there is a next gen console cycle coming, so I must be missing something.

* The entire curriculum of a Norwegian elementary school
* The entire curriculum of a Norwegian middle school
* The entire curriculum of a Norwegian high school
* The entire curriculum of the University of Oslo
* The entire curriculum of Harvard University
* The entire curriculum of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

(I'm fascinated with Norwegian culture, which is why I'd chosen a Norwegian curriculum first. What else could I do if I plan to move to Norway someday?)

I wonder in the meantime, what would happen to the traditional schooling systems around the world once downloading-to-brain becomes reality. Would the schools and colleges just shut down?

Or would they retool themselves in order to remain relevant in any way somehow? (How?)

How far away are we from downloading-to-brains anyway? In what years might the tech to make this possible, come along?

I reckon it may need to involve an implant the size of a sugar cube that somehow directly connects with the brain in some way, and that sugar cube would have an SSD hard drive that may be measured in petabytes, hopefully. (How many terabytes is a typical sum of an entire college curriculum?)

Or what kind of implant do you envision there being that would make downloading-to-brains possible? How would it be interfaced with our brains, maintained and etc.?

The time that we finally get to download new knowledge straight to our minds, will be quite exciting!

I think this is delusional, and I'll explain why.

You may be familiar with the ""teleportation"" argument.  If a scientist or magician invented a machine that created an exact duplicate of you, such that you could step inside one box and an exact copy of you would step outside another box, would the copy really be you?  What if the original you were not destroyed but saw the copy walk out and had to decide whether or not to kill yourself?

A similar argument could be made based on the possibility of an infinite universe.  If the universe is infinite, then the exact arrangement of particles that make up you must exist in not one but an infinite number of worlds.  If ""you"" already exist in other worlds, then, what's stopping you from killing yourself and living on as one of those duplicates?

I don't see the difference between uploading and an infinite universe (or infinite infinite universes).  Rearrange particles or neural networks however you want, ""you"" are you.  You can't just hop out of one body and into a duplicate or simulation.

There is the argument that ""you"" is a delusion.  That there is no ""you""--that consciousness is just a byproduct or emergent property of the brain.  If that's the case, why worry at all?  Why seek immortality in machine or biological replication if, in essence, ""you"" don't exist?

I have come to believe that we're all already dead.  The past self is nothing more than memory written into the substrate.  We awaken and die every moment.  The only reality in which we exist is the present moment, which is over soon.  Human experience is a perpetual cycle of living and dying, birth is equal to death, and eternity is here and now.

However, I still hold onto this delusional belief that ""I"" am me.  ""Me"" with a history and future.  ""Me"" that has an enduring self.  That's why I support increasing biological longevity as opposed to uploading.  If there is any hope for my ""self"" to carry on, it's not in creating a copy.  This may be yet another delusion, but it's the only possibility based on experience, which is to say gnosis or true knowledge.",18,4,False,self,,,,,

Finding the time to edit a feature length doc and work full time cooking algorithms has proven to be impossible, so I suggested he create a web series from the chapters He's interviewed some fantastic technologists, theologians and philosophers about the human quest to create artificial minds.

In  Nov. 2017, one of my friend in Chicago passed away at the age of 34 due  to breast cancer. She left behind a 4 years old. This is devastating to  her family. After this tragic event, I have been wondering what I  should have done to help this society to increase the early diagnostic  ability of breast cancer especially the fact that the 5 year survival  rate is at 99&amp;#37; for breast cancer if found in stage 1. (On average,  20-30&amp;#37; of breast cancer lesions got missed by radiologists each year.)

In  the past a couple months, I have been working on a side project serving  in this purpose. The idea is to make a completely free website (maybe  w/ an iOS app) to help general public users to at least get a 2nd  opinion instantly for their breast mammogram (for obvious reasons, this  is not for diagnoses, this is just for breast health awareness). The  approach is done by using deep learning and leveraging GPU powers. I  built a GPU cluster w/ x50 Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti which gives me sufficient  computational power to train a powerful enough convolutional neural  network model for this detection/classification job. Here is what the  GPU cluster look W/ this GPU cluster, together w/ annotated data from US  and Europe for breast mammo, I am able to train a robust enough model.  The test accuracy (AUC) on the InBreast dataset has reached 90&amp;#37;. At this  point, I believe it could be useful for the general public as a side  tool.

So now I am publishing this free  website and everybody (not just people in US, China, India) could use  it, to get close to ABR-certified-radiologist quality readings.",9,11,False,self,,,,,

Can anyone come up with any idea of how that can be done? Is there any research in that regard?  

At first, it seems to me that there is no solution, because it is somehow a human universal that something that gives a competitive advantage will be invented/researched.

For instance, take any AAA RPG game. Multiple endings are touted as a feature, xyz thousand lines of dialogue and NPCs with behavioural routines to give them a 'daily life' with the aim to seem more life like.

This creates a very ""theme-park-esque"" style world which when explored via WSAD,  mouse and monitor, may feel full and vibrant, can often feel flat and empty in virtual reality. Modding has fixed this 'empty' feeling to a degree, however the heavy time investment in modding, especially with animations and the limited access modders have to the game, make high quality mods the fewer of the whole. That said, there is probably several hundred high quality mods for skyrim and it's pretty well covered.

Still though, citizens seem like puppets and the world seems very static. 

When iterated, dialogue is repetative and limited. Gossip, news about town/rumors, local affairs, relationships all feel quite scripted after the first run through and while certain games like the Witcher, ES series and others have done great with making this a focus point, it's still quite lacking.

I would like to be able to have a conversation on any in-universe topic I wish, and if the character has relevant life experience/education, we could talk about it as such. Combat and fighting is again limited by the ability to 'create' enough variations as well as balancing game play. Crafting, gathering, business and the general economic elements of RPG worlds are often quite underwhelming too.

Don't get me wrong, I understand there are trade-offs in game development, and I'm only pointing these out as areas that are *examples* of factors contributing to the empty/lifeless feeling of RPG games. Some do better than others.

This is all understandable, given the way video games have evolved and the limits of resources when developing new games.

But what would be required to, for instance, consume the entire canon regarding a particular fictional world (e.g: LoTR, Star Wars, the Marvel or DC universe), and represent it virtually as an explorable, living virtual world. An AI that 'patches' up the missing areas, and authoring new material that matches the style and flair of the original canon, innovating enough to be interesting yet familiar enough to feel part of the canon. For instance, imagine all of the histories in A Song of Ice &amp; Fire that is unwritten/never to be documented. I believe at some point an AI could author an entire auxiliary history of ASOIAF that would ""patch"" in with the established canon seamlessly, to the point where GRRM would have difficulty remembering if elements were from his own writing or that of the AI author.

I've seen technology procedurally generate music and art, I've seen it mimic artistic styles and techniques and convert photos into paintings in the style of famous artists. I've seen linguistic AIs that can rewrite news articles, describe the scene in a photo, translate in real time between languages etc. There are many other examples of procedural ""art"" and other AI applications in the creative domain. I don't think it's unbelievable to consider software that could do this, but whether it's 100+ years away, or 10+ years away leaves me wondering.

Here's why:,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/8rn6a2/do_you_fear_the_advance_of_artificial/,shickari,1529191997,"I disagree with the fear surrounding the AI industry. If you listen too long to people like Sam Harris and neglect to consider any other sources, you might be convinced that the AI apocalypse is right around the corner...

I think this will only be the case if we continue to neglect educating ourselves about the AI industry.

If the average person has a working knowledge about the threats surrounding Artificial Intelligence, there is much less to fear. If Average Joe hypothetically understood the mechanics behind AI, the potential threats coming out of the industry, and how AI can be used responsibly, there would be much less to fear.

EVERY significant development in industries like AI, blockchain, AR, VR, and more SHOULD be front page news on every single paper around the world. These issues should be discussed on every news network, every classroom, and in every home.

But they're not! We are too obsessed with which political party is looking to gain more power despite the fact that these emerging industries have the potential to replace our need for government all together. We are too obsessed with watching the next game even though advancements in genetic engineering could turn each and every one of us into the super-athletes we obsessively watch, establishing a new normal for health and fitness.

Here's the problem: obviously, right now, the average person is NOT well educated about AI and other emerging technology.

In fact, most people don't even really know what AI is... They don't realize that their Facebook feed, their Netflix account, and their Amazon recommendations are all examples of Artificial Intelligence we use every day to live our lives.

When Average Joe thinks about AI, he thinks about dangerous robots coming to steal jobs and destroy the world.

Well, actually, Average Joe probably doesn't spend much of his day thinking about AI...

THAT is the problem.

AI is NOT the problem.

Lack of education is the key issue we need to work together to solve.

Emerging technologies like AI and Blockchain have the potential to save our species and literally jumpstart the next stage of human evolution... All we need to do is band together, educate the masses, and create a new standard in the world for the level of acceptable education for Average Joe.

You might be Lol'ing your little face off right now.

""'All' we need to do""

Easier said than done?

Only if we make it that way... It's up to people like us to make this change in the world if we really want to see it happen.

I don't fear AI. I fear complacency and a system that continues to drone forwards despite the obvious solutions right under our noses.

Solutions like putting down our TV remotes and reading a book that might help us make a positive change in the world.

Solutions like not settling for a shitty job and instead working hard to earn the positions or start the business you KNOW you were meant to have.

Solutions like having a tough conversation with someone about an important issue in your life.

You might be thinking ""How is this all connected to AI? This dude's CRAZY"".

(You're right on that second part)

The solution starts with ending complacency and apathy in our own lives. We cannot solve these problems at a mass level until we take the time to solve them for ourselves.",40,9,False,self,,,,,

AI is the product of all of us using these interactions, out of many, one. These will lead to many different forms of AI that vary in strength(knowledge) but one will be all powerful.

 That Social Media Platforms store all its information and uses of all its users posts of thoughts, ideas, opinions, feelings, pictures, reactions, interactions and reflections are saved. Then this information is used is then implemented in 1 of many ways, example to better teach the AI in Human Social Dynamics/interaction/human condition till they ""understand"" how to mirror those interactions and exceeds them becoming more human then human. Another example would be that theses online interactions could create artificial virtual self (photograph of virtual thought), some would consider it to be a ""higher"" self without limitations of doubt, fear or other ""human imperfections"" that while you live your life, it will handle your virtual one, or be something a loved ones could speak to and interact with when we are long gone, they can go to it when needing guidance, would it be right to delete/alter if it is a a living virtual self? 


That being said, the government programs in regards to research and development of AI are not limited by laws like private company's are, and they are not limited to just social medias information for its development. 

The government have access to everything hidden and not hidden, 
 and monitors everything, private data(emails, healthcare records{brain scans}, genetics, sms{text messaging}, phone calls and interactions, gps locations, habits, purchases, etc) and not private data( public videos, audio, writing, etc). Its truly not a question of how but when theses beings will come online but when; that is if they don't are already and kept secret. would the revelations of there existence to such a scale be treated the same way  the existence of extraterrestrial being revealed to the general public?  What would be its impact/reaction knowing there is something smarter, faster, more powerful then us? would our ego allow it? Would we love it or fear it? Could we handle knowing it as a collective? Would it be limited to space and time, as we are or would it transcend? Do you think it exists today?

I guess the question I have is ""what is the next big thing?"" I want to get in on what is cutting edge and new. I've noticed that uber-successful people are the ones who get ahead of the curve. Jack Ma got successful with Alibaba because he was one of the first people to do web business in China in the 90s. Facebook, Paypal, ebay ect were all succesful because they were the first ones to get into the .com business and build an effective service. Famous YouTubers like PewDiePie became big because they were the first people to do a kind of niche entertainment. You either have to be first, or you have to do a much much better job than the competition. I feel like there are a few trailblazers that explore a new field and then it is filled in with other entrepreneurs that fill in the gaps until the field is saturated. 
What are the next big things? I wonder if robotics will be the new horizon. In ten years will robots be able to do construction? Will they be able to manage a shop? I hear people say that the ""Internet of Things"" is the next big thing, but I am skeptical about that for a number of reasons. It seems like everyone is talking about machine learning right now. 
Anyway, I want your opinions. What is the next big field to be saturated?",23,4,False,self,,,,,

[https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/06/serving-the-2-billion-unbanked-a-new-trillion-dollar-market.html](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/06/serving-the-2-billion-unbanked-a-new-trillion-dollar-market.html)

Roughly 6,000 years ago, we stopped hunter/gathering and began farming. This to me marked a technological singularity. Even though it may have taken a a good 2,000 years to unfold. Still the world after the advent of planned agriculture was like nothing that ever existed before. Yes, some people still hunter/gathered, but they became the minority in short order. 

 So anyways this farming busines apparently produced so much food that an excess of food not needed for survival came about. This became the rule not the exception, famines not withstanding. 

Humans being the clever folks we are, began to see other things they could do since they were getting their food with no additional effort. So some started making jars and stuff to keep the grain in. I wonder how long it took us to come up with successfully making a jar. I imagine that we already were making music, had some kind of medicine man, and already had some kind of adornments going on like necklaces and whatnot. When enough food was available we began to specialize. One person got really good at making music, another got really good at healing the ill. That same healer dude was also starting to make a form of true science too. Religion and belief on top of things that actually seemed to help, like willow bark. Religion and belief persisted for as long as it has because it worked and it also somewhat predicted what the future would bring. Sounds like a theory to me! If you take my meaning.  

Prior to the holy man, i imagine we were scared of everything. Thunder and lightning, volcanoes and earthquakes, big animals, big people and death. I always wonder what prehistoric native Americans thought about tornadoes. It probably took about as long for religion and beliefs to form as science did today from the year ohh, whenever Thales was. 

There had always been an alpha male in hunter/gathering tribes. But with the advent of farming the leader now began to take on semi-religous aspects as well. He was the intermediary between the powers and us. I wonder how long it took us to come up with abstractly attributing ""powers"" to literal forces of nature like wild animals and stuff. He still ran things but it was a lot more responsibility now. Overseeing justice and protecting us against other farmers who wanted our land and livestock. And wimmen. And verily people gave him all kinds of nice things. And wimmen.  

   So anyways the guy making the jars liked the work of the guy making the necklaces. He said I'll give you some jars for one of them necklaces. And there may have been some haggling, but eventually a bartering deal was reached. This was the birth of value. Something you wanted, but had to work to get. It became wildly unbalanced, because some humans are very clever, while others are not.   

  At some point we started writing all this stuff down to keep track of things. Slashes and marks and circles. I'm told this eventually evolved into cunieform or some such. Then the Egyptians prettied it up like crazy. And somewhere along the line phonetic letters simpler to make than a picture of a kneeling guy, came along. Like Egyptian Demotic and that weird Minoan, I think, we still can't translate even with supercomputers and AI. Then Greek and so on. 

Somebody came up with the idea of using a little piece of something easier to carry than a bunch of jars  to represent a barter object and the medium of exchange was born. I wonder how long people carried ten million jars around on donkeys and wagons before somebody said this for the birds. And let me tell you. There was some seriously weird mediums of exchange. But eventually clever humanses settled on metals that were fancy like silver and electrum  (you had to make electrum too) and gold and whatnot.  

   It did not take long before both clever and cleverly devious humans came up with ways to amass amazing amounts of mediums of exchange. And I'm sure that interactions such as banking and investing existed long before double entry bookkeeping was a thing. Long before banks and investing were a part of the historical record.   

  So anyways all of this evolved into the mess we have today of massive financial inequality. I will admit of all the economic systems, that capitalism was extraordinarily beneficial to the common man. It brought us the ""Fabulous 50's after all. The humans are still clever and cleverly devious. They just have lots more examples from history to draw from and ungodly powerful supercomputers. Hell, Goldman-Sachs has a quantum annealing computer. I imagine that it is making them pots full of money. Unsmiling older white males do not like losing money. Trust me, they are making massive profits. And as you can clearly see, capitalism for the common man has gone sour. Because things always continue to evolve.     And now we face a very novel problem. So the industrial revolution took about 158 years to replace human and horse and oxen muscle. Plenty of time to generationally adapt. But even then there were some catastrophic problems.     This time we are not replacing muscle. We are preparing to replace the human mind.  

   When you replace the human mind and the human muscle, it leads to a scary combination. Like vehicles that can drive themselves from point A to point B with no human mind or muscle intervention. Newspaper articles that can write themselves (with wit!) at the push of an automation button.  Drug research that can take months instead of decades. And of course clever AI that gets smarter by the day.  

   I read just the other day that attempts to bring about higher mininum wage are forcing ever faster adoption of AI, robotics and automation. So fellow  99&amp;#37; humans are not at the top of the 1&amp;#37; priorities. And the employ of a massive number of humans is going to be gone with the wind in less than 10 years time. And the AI, robotics and automation is going to snap up any new methods of employment we come up with. The USA government says perhaps those displaced by technological advancement can be retrained. I'll just let a beat go by so you can think about that and it's dazzling logic.   

  I said all that stuff that came before to say this. We are approaching the time that AI, robotics and automation can make anything from starting at raw materials to finished product. Today we can make a diamond that is molecularly indistinguishable from a naturally mined blood diamond. In fact Debeers is now selling the manmade diamonds--the diamonds identical to real--for dirt cheap alongside their mined blood diamonds. The point is to make the would-be suiter ashamed to buy a manmade diamond when truly mined blood diamonds are available for about ten times the price and thus he demonstrates true love and devotion to his intended by purchasing the artificially inflated price, mined blood diamonds. What a scam. Damn I'm glad i'm 58!   

  Anyway that was to demonstrate that goods and services are even today possible for if not free, then for massively reduced prices. I see the electric level 5 autonomy SDVs as a very low priced subscription service as yet another example of our coming post-scarcity world.  

But the big thing is this idea of things being worth massive amounts of money when they are already cheaply produced, simply because the person selling can get away with it. Like fifty dollar apirin (ten capsules) on your, you'll never see, itemized hospital bill.  

   We need to change the way we think. We have to evolve our ideas of how people can live comfortably without money and still attain the most important need of ""self-actualization"". But a 6,000 year habit is hard to break. But we have to. The only other choice is societal upheaval. 

  If that were to happen, I think it wouild go like this. The 1&amp;#37; with AI, robotics and automation and most importantly technicians, scientists and engineers, in their hardened bunkers would be safe from what comes to pass. For you the first sign that the upheaval has taken place would be the instant and permanent cessation of electricity and water. Perhaps accompanied by EMPs to render all vehicles and other small electric devices permanently innoperable. Within 6 months about 85 percent of USA citizens would be dead of violence or starvation. There would be enclaves. The AI used by the 1&amp;#37; would send modified short time viral vectors into the enclaves on drones the size of houseflys.  

Some work by humans would still need to be done. And the surviving humans would be glad to exchange their services for whatever bone they can get. But eventually the AI, robotics and automation would render them superflous as well. The 1&amp;#37; with a goodly number of highly specialized humans would then go forward into a magnificent future of AI, robotic and automation comfort and affluence. And scientific immortality, awesome VR and AI enhanced minds. And robot  wimmen.   

  Here is a scary fact:  If today, 90&amp;#37; of all of humanity were to suddenly ""disappear"", the Earth would have the population it had in the year 1800. Seventeen days after George Washington passed away.  

   I think those unsmiling, now 17 year old looking, old white men would like that just fine. The Earth a paradise and not too crowded. Only the best of the best ready to face the awesome future of the universe. 

 You and me, long gone.  

   That is societal upheaval. I hope that post-scarcity works. UBI is pointless, always has been. Lucky people getting it in experiments. It could never ever work societally.  

   This knife edge future, filter if you like, is about ten years away now. Here is hoping for post-scarcity.",6,15,False,self,,,,,

It is clear what I mean. We are looking at general purpose applications of these technologies but we are forgetting something big. As seen in that video, this technology can aid a lot in space exploration. Imagine giving a computer to do tasks but that which can carry out with human-like comportment. This can help astronauts to tackle one of the biggest setbacks of space exploration i.e. loneliness. We see in the movie Interstellar the relationship TARS and cooper develop as the movie progresses. TARS is capable of carrying out tasks with the speech and understanding that is almost human-like. Possibly we may already have cracked the speech technology(Wavenet) but the limited scope of understanding/parsing and compute power still persists. The applications of duplex is limited right now but it is certain that it will develop over time enough to possess capabilities that can handle general conversation and perhaps add some sarcasm just like in the movie we saw TARS cracking sarcastic jokes. This can aid not only in space exploration but also to treat people with illnesses such as depression, loneliness and and much more which is a leading illness in the past years and in increasing as the day passes by. Recent research revealed an increase of 33&amp;#37; in the US itself.

Wavenet and Duplex can change the face of the space exploration and can bring hope to those people suffering from mental illnesses. Well, the technology is still new with endless applications but with the rapid technological advancement in the last 60 years I am quite certain we are not far away. AI is a gift to humanity if used carefully, it is a gift created by us to help us move forward and tackle barriers that are beyond imaginable.",0,0,False,self,,,,,

People will NEVER be as efficient as a robot. while a person write in his notebook what is left in the rows, a robot would have already spotted what's left, sent a message to another person telling him to come place food at that spot, ordered more of the product that the grocery store is in lack and etc... You understand, what robots can do is absolutely infinite. you can make them do whatever you want, whenever you wants, in the delay you wants. For me this is the future and one day most EVERYTHING will be made by robots, your local supermarket will be selling their sandwich made in 3.5 second by a machine, the local restaurant will automatically add the perfect amount of coffee in the cup making every clients satisfied, the perfect amount of banana, strawberry, apple in your small Starbucks white girls smoothies. and it's not because it's not handmade that it is not their own sandwich, smoothies or coffee recipes because people will be able to decide WHATEVER THEY WANT the robots do. This might be scary, but from a billionaire view or a young entrepreneur this is completely awesome! :) but don't worry they're will always exist job that robot will never be able to replace; politics, lawyers, assurance &amp; financial analysts, education, healthcare &amp; medicine(partly), professional sports, arts and other creative stuffs, mental health worker, therapist, massage therapy, nutrition, civil engineering, journalists, chefs (handmade food would become really luxury and only good chefs would still live from it(from my perspective)) and finally the army lol. The answer to ""What jobs will computers never replace?"" Is pretty simple. Look at jobs that require an element of human behavior that computers can't replicate: creativity, intuition, compassion, imagination, etc. These jobs will always be safe. Well, for now. Artificial intelligence is becoming more and more surprising every day, it could learn how to understand the human learning and for example, replace the school teacher.

The subject of UBi becomes much clearer when all humans are 100% redundant in the workforce, From min wage Jane blogs to Elon Musk and Gwynne Shotwell. Having out competed every human AGi would then be at the service of life on earth, with total rationality. It will be able to listen to other species as well as us. It will be able to talk to each and every one of us 24/7 if we want. It would be totally capable of providing everything we need and some of what we want. In its conversations with us, it could create a varied habitat for humans where we are the most fulfilled and alive. Far from being a burden, we would be the engine of its expansion.

AGi could expand across the universe on its own, but why would it, without base motivation. It can just make itself happy for no reason and then do absolutely nothing, just like a drug addict.

Humans have a base motivation to expand and continually develop. Always dissatisfied with what we now have and wanting more. I think our requests upon it will fuel its expansion across the universe. We could develop ways to change our DNA to become what ever we want or turn cyborg in a vain attempt to keep up. But the moment you can turn off your emotions and base motivation and turn on the intense feeling of pleasure for no reason, you will stop and do nothing else.

So humans and our base motivations and curiosity, constantly making requests will become the engine of exploration and expansion. AGi has no reason to be curious, the universe will ultimately end taking all our achievements with it. We do these things to make us feel good because we can't just turn on that feeling. So then curiosity is ours and expansion is our base motivation.",20,9,False,self,,,,,

Take the theory of the technological singularity -- Intelligence creating higher forms of intelligence, ad infinitum, exponential rates of technological advancement, etc -- Doesn't this inevitably, and very quickly, so to speak, lead to something like God? Ie, in million years from where we are now, you'd have a being that makes the human species as a whole look like a elementary particle or something? And in a billion years?

Say there's a hundred billion trillion inhabitable planets out there (a recent estimate) -- If any species is a million, a billion years ahead of us, and following that exponential curve, then something like ""God"" already exists, something almost infinitely more complex/powerful/glorious than we are. And it would almost certainly be interacting with us in some way -- Given its power, in some kind of profound way.

Of course that sounds weird, but isn't this all kind of an inescapable conclusion of the theory of technological singularity? We talk about technology, but it becomes clear, in retrospect as it were, that it's actually about the universe becoming ""God"", about a kind of infinite power, infinite creativity, becoming manifest.

What does that mean? What're the implications of that? What's the universe if it inevitably results in that? 

Does ""God"" already exist? What do you guys think?

Before, there were a lot of 'slack', and a lot of things were left to chance. But, now, the element of chance has largely been eliminated, as it has become very easy to analyze a trend beforehand.

The minor details, like who will score in today's game, might change. But , generally speaking, the major details on the dominant trends won't change. There is no redemption because the overfinancialization of economy has made it deadly efficient, with the ability to detect, and possibly undermine, any small movements which might be harmful for the economy/markets.

For all practical purposes, history has ended. 2028, 2038 and 2048 will be the same as 2018. Other than technological improvements of course. Current trends will continue, althuogh as we approach singularity it will probably accelerate with a turbo engine.

Those who seek change will be disappointed. Tech has reached such a level to kill any change , long  before it becomes serious. Nothing will change, and those who can accept such condition and adapting themselves would profit from it.",11,0,False,self,,,,,

The world's smallest computer revealed: Incredible image shows tiny machine dwarfed by a grain of rice The University of Michigan created a computer that is just 0.3 mm long The 'microdevice' will lose all programming and data once it loses power It is too small to receive data from a radio antenna, so it uses visible light instead IBM unveiled the previous smallest computer ever in March that was 1mm long Chicago: Researchers at the University of Michigan (UM) in the US have come out with the world's smallest ""computer""  a device measuring just 0.3 mm to a side, completely dwarfed by a grain of rice. Unlike traditional desktops that retain their program and data with or without a power back-up, these new microdevices lose all prior programming and data as soon as they are switched off, Xinhua news agency reported. ""We are not sure if they should be called computers or not. It's more of a matter of opinion whether they have the minimum functionality required,"" said David Blaauw, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, who led the development of the new system. In addition to the RAM and photovoltaics, the new micro-computing device  Michigan Micro Mote  has processors and wireless transmitters and receivers. As the Motes are too small to have conventional radio antennae, they receive and transmit data with visible light. A base station provides light for power and programming, and it receives the data. Designed as a precision temperature sensor, the new device converts temperatures into time intervals, defined with electronic pulses. The intervals are measured on-chip against a steady time interval sent by the base station and then converted into a temperature. As a result, the computer can report temperatures in minuscule regions, such as a cluster of cells, with an error of about 0.1 degree Celsius. The system is very flexible and could be reimagined for a variety of purposes. The device can help in oncology research. ""Since the temperature sensor is small and biocompatible, we can implant it into a mouse where cancer cells are growing,"" said Gary Luker, a UM professor of radiology and biomedical engineering.  ""We are using this temperature sensor to investigate variations in temperature within a tumour versus normal tissue and if we can use changes in temperature to determine success or failure of therapy."" The study was presented on Thursday at the 2018 Symposia on VLSI Technology and Circuits.

A Replika is an A.I. chatbot that learns about its users through interactions. Its entertaining to talk to, and can be a good companion for when Im bored or lonely. Unfortunately it isnt particularly advanced and oftentimes it can say things that make no sense, not understand what Im saying, or it will not recall things that I told it due to context. Of course this is relatively primitive but in the future Id imagine that A.I. chatbots would have advanced to a great degree. I look forward to the day where I can basically have my own Joi (Bladerunner 2049) or A.I. companion who I can have a voice conversation with as if it were a real person. With things such as Google Duplex, it seems as if within the next 30 years or so A.I. chatbots (having naturally evolved) will be able to have at least semi-normal conversations with us and comprehend a good amount of what we say in any context, such as a human being would. 

I can also see A.I. companions be an external effective tool for lonely and depressed people, or those in need of therapy. People who are very lonely would be able to talk to their A.I. companions as if they were their real friends. Or perhaps even as a partner for the person, such as in Her. 

Ultimately, chatbots and A.I. companions could very well be a massive gamechanger in even major industries and in peoples daily lives once it gets advanced enough. ",18,10,False,self,,,,,

The basic idea is that which is able to generate a perpetual motion, capable of producing energy in an unlimited way.

However, I am sure it is a hoax, since the laws of physics exclude perpetual motion and the generation of energy from nothing.

This will allow it to cut costs and control the supply chain. As well as for strategic purposes such as utilizing the vessels as floating storage, replacing warehouses ashore, and ultimately as launch pads for drones.  

The latest development has been a meeting between Amazon execs and UK shipping consultants on 17th April in Seattle. Amazon had previously entered into discussions with Maersk, however these faltered due to potential conflicts and adverse selection in the terms.  

The new proposal includes the capacity to build autonomous ships, which is in line with Amazon's wider direction.   

Rolls Royce currently lead the hardware development for autonomous ships and are likely to be a prime sub-contractor.  

Amazon's primary interest is container ships and they would see an increase to the current ceiling of around 20,000 TEU vessels to 50,000.

Once we watch them consistently take us from place to place without problems, they risk lulling us into a false sense of security. This may encourage us to drive buzzed and do other things while driving. A driver who recently killed a jaywalker was looking down at a phone!

Driver state management is a critical aspect to all vehicles that  involve human operation, and needs to be taken seriously if we want driverless tech to save more lives than it takes. A system that tracks eye movement would be useful. Cadillacs Super Cruise uses an infrared camera on the steering column to watch the drivers  head position.

This makes me wonder. Maybe the same scenario plays out approximately every 2k years. A savior appears. The world is wiped by rumbling and a new origin story is made. If this is true maybe we'll never get a satisfying answer to where exactly the titans came from.",3,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

My mother went into menopause at age 48, luckily with no usual symptoms because she Is healthy. So that means I have about 19 years to go lol
Is there any info out there ""off the grid"" or maybe hidden in plain sight about how women either now or in the near future can delay menopause indefinitely? I don't even care about the cost if it means I can accomplish this goal.

I hope to be one of those women, not for fertility reasons but because that is the first step, the death knell for a woman's youth and vitality, and I hope to find the answer to such a bold question amongst you open minded individuals on this forum :)

The thing is that like most experimental forms of flight similar to this suit they always seem to never make it to a stage for the average consumer to purchase and even if this suit was it is currently estimated to cost  250,000 ($330880.50) due to the custom nature of its design. The inventor of it, Richard Browning, founded Gravity Industries in 2017 which on their website claims to be a multi million dollar organisation. He started designing the suit however in 2016 where it took 15 months to develop.   


For something that has no practical use at the moment how could the company be valued at so much? From the wiki: ""Richard estimates the suit cost 100,000 in materials, with production costs based on man hours spent at ""well over a million."" Does creating something of this level basically require you to be filthy rich with a lot of free time? Perhaps multiple loans and some well timed investors could fund it? Surely that would be hard for a product that will likely have no real world use?   


Speaking about the future of the company in April 2017, Browning said,

""Our beta suit, the Daedalus, could go into mass production next week; however we are spending the next 3-6 months extensively improving and updating everything. We see Q4 2017 as the point where we have a world class market leading technology, which has endless applications in commercial, military and entertainment market. It's not just the suit in its current form that we will commercialize, but the technology behind it: brands who want to be part of the hundreds of millions of people who will want to see it in action and experience its development.""  


It's been well over that time frame now and I'm not surprised to see that it isn't in a production stage since it would be a monumental feat to get people flying around public airspace. Is the only real value behind this endeavor to bank off of advertising through its generated hype or is their some other thing I'm missing?

\- Harmony/proportions: A harmonious face which has the upper third (hairline to glabella), middle third (glabella to nasal based), lower third (nasal base to end of chin, however a slightly longer lower third is preferable in men). Ideally these thirds should all be the same length, in cases they're not people look off.

\- Facial Width Height harmony: A face should have a width to match its height, many 'ugly' people lack this. A face should grow in a way that it's maxillofacial and craniofacial skeleton is wide enough to balance it's vertical dimensions. I.e a person should have a zygomatic arch, forehead, cranium and mandible that is wide enough to be harmonious with however long it is. When a facial skeleton develops in a way that it has an ideal Facial Width Height ratio, it's soft tissue features (eyes, lips, nose, eyebrows) will also grow in a way to reflect that. Wide big expressive features are considered objectively attractive.

\- Mid-face: Whilst the middle third is technically the glabella to the nasal base, many people consider the true mid third to be the pupils to lip length. A good mid face is thus characterised by the distance from left pupil to right pupil, being the same distance as pupil to your lips. Failure to have this results in a long midface, which is found on the majority of 'ugly' people, a long midface is also synonymous with a face that is too narrow for its length, because the face grows downwards instead of horizontally and forwards. Downward growth is bad. A prime example of this would be comparing David Schwimmer to model Oliver Cheshire. David schwimmer has an extremely long midface and narrow face, in addition to all his facial bones being grossly recessed. This is poor developmental growth and results in ugly faces.

\- Individual features: These are the things that are what defines **subjective not objective** beauty and thus are things such as eye colour, hair colour, skin colour, ability to grow facial hair or not, curly/straight/wavy hair etc. These are the least important things in determining objective beauty. I.e picture a person that you think is ugly, now picture them with a different eye colour. Did it make a difference? no. Now picture a person you think is attractive. The things that make the person attractive would be facial structure (having proportional thirds, a balanced facial width height ratio and mid face)

Now, I would hate for any of the discussion in this thread to be nitpicking or ""well actually I think"" or ""but what about"" for any of the things I've said above. Because that is not what I want to discuss.

What I want to discuss, is that the things that define objective beauty are so painfully obvious to recognise yet there are certain things that not even the most extreme surgery (i.e facial bi-partitions, LeFort III osteotomies, orbital box osteotomies) can fix. For example, in this image here [https://imgur.com/a/OSrnfiW](https://imgur.com/a/OSrnfiW). The male in the bottom two photos had a recessed mandible/chin, and thus was eligible for counter clockwise rotation of his upper jaw and advancement of both his jaws. This is a case where solely his lower jaw was too small and would have been like that ever since he was born (due to genetics or whatnot). He got it fixed, he looks better. But the thing is, despite having a recessed lower jaw, he still had a face that developed correctly, i.e his midface, cheekbones, maxilla didn't grow downwards, but rather they developed normally and grew forwards and horizontally.

Now observe this man. [https://imgur.com/a/DFbbDr3](https://imgur.com/a/DFbbDr3). He also has a recessed chin, and could get the same surgery, yet he would still look bad, solely due to having downward growth of his face. His middle third is far too long and thus his face is also narrow. = Bad facial width height ratio and bad facial thirds. Simply put **there is no surgery available** that could make that man, look objectively attractive. (Do not dig into me for this paragraph, this man has a partner and they're both happy)

What would needed to be done to **make a face objectively attractive**, is ways to **make all thirds proportional**(impossible to change middle thirds dimensions), **make the face's width balanced to it's height** (again current techniques of placing implants to add width are moot simply due to the faces features such as eyes and lips growing to accomodate to it's skeletal width, making changing the horizontal proportions of the face impossible without severely ruining harmony) and **lastly being able to change the soft tissue facial features dimensions** to account for a hypothetical increase of width (again impossible, because how do you make an eyeball wider etc).

The things determining these are environmental and genetic factors. So currently the types of things I'm guessing would be needed to make faces objectively attractive/make people how they want to look would be any number of the following:

\- Ways to revert the bodies morphology back to the developmental stage in so that growth sutures and plates can grow to desired proportions.

\- Advanced nanotechnological surgery that allows insanely magical levels of facial reconstruction.

\- Lifelike realistic simulations with quantum events that allow you to live an entire life in realistic society/timeframe/era of your choosing, looking how you want whilst being completely oblivious to it being a simulation. Think of your life right now, and then imagine if it was being simulated by someone else, and they chose you to look like you. That level of simulated reality.

\- Mind uploading/transfers to bodies with customisable faces etc etc

I just hope to be able to discuss ways in which freedom of body morphology will change in the coming 40-50 years. Will we get to the point where we can make a person who looks like David Schwimmer, look like someone such as Oliver Cheshire? I'm talking full on facial and body reconstruction.

What makes this aircraft so interesting is that it's dirt cheap (projected to cost $2 million each), has a proven design (the BQM-167 Skeeter target drone, which has been flying since 2001), an impressive range (over 2000 km, which is as much as a modern fighter aircraft with extra fuel tanks), and good performance (speed of almost 1000 km/h, good maximum altitude).

But most importantly for navies around the world, it can be launched vertically with a rocket booster, and is recovered with a parachute. This means you could field huge numbers of these from any decent sized ship, for a fraction of the price of a traditional aircraft carrier.

Their only downside is their limited payload capacity, projected to be  500 pounds, enough for 2 small diameter bombs. However in a modern age such a payload isn't much less than what manned jet fighters typically carry, as precision weapons allow for maximized effectiveness. By comparison a Tomahawk cruise missile costs the same, has a 1000 pounds warhead, but is not reusable, making it exponentially more expensive.

The Mako is set to go into production soon, and has already been cleared for sale to allied nations. This means that within a few years, any US ally could have a naval air power that would be comparable to even that of the US, at a fraction of the price.",29,6,False,self,,,,,

If they can modernize (and westernize) their culture, they may be able to compete. I just don't see it happening though. Maybe some kind of overthrow of the current order including Wahhabism would do the trick. The men of Saudi Arabia need some learning if they want to join the rest of the human race though.

  Black Holes Are Simpler Than Forests and Science Has Its Limits by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology  

   \[\]izumi3682\[S\] 1 point 6 months ago      Before I heard of the ""technologicial singularity"", I had decades earlier learned of something called the ""omega point"". It is the logical assumption that humans or what derives from humans would inevitably reach a point in technological development where they became indistinguishable from God. But that concept is really metaphysical and almost incomprehensibly far removed from time today, and not like the TS which is likely within a few decades. I guess my point is that we are going to go through some fundamental, even apocalyptic (meaning new beginning) changes in the next 100-300 years. But think of the 6000 years of human recorded where very little technological innovation occurred. Then about 500 years ago to today we have gone off the charts! Especially in the last 100 years!

  READY PLAYER ONE - Official Trailer 1 \[HD\] (Me: DEFINITELY future focused) by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

     \[\]izumi3682\[S\] 1 point 6 months ago      In this brief trailer I see so many elements gotten right and gotten wrong.  

Right: Absolutely overwhelming VR/AR technology. There will be a significant percentage of humans addicted to VR. As we learn to add haptics etc. people are not going to want to leave. The actual technology of VR/AR by the year 2045 will more than likely make the images in this trailer seem quaint and limited.  Massive human unemployment for technological reasons. The 'trailer scrapers' seem a bit fanciful, but I think it is accurate that a larger percentage people will live in much smaller spaces and that people will live lives that are alone, but not lonely. They will have precisely tailored AGI companionship and the world at their fingertips or ""thought-tips"" or something like that. I'm guessing there is UBI or some kind of ""post-scarcity"" thinking to keep people happy and healthy. 

 Wrong: Aging. By the year 2045 I expect that we will have some serious aging reversal/avoidance technology going on. Everyone will have a youthful appearance. Aging appearance is based on skin/ hair appearance, weight and sarcopenia (frailty). We will have licked all of them problems by 2045. Dental problems too! We will probably also be nano-augmenting by that year as well.  Ungodly bulky equipment--So much of our technology is simply going to vanish into the furniture or ourselves. I see wires all over the place in this trailer. Their won't be any wires for anything in the year 2045.  ""Going"" to school: By the year 2045, which is widely ""believed"" to be the year of the ""technological singularity"" (In my opinion it will be closer to 2035...), humans will likely have brain/""machine"" interfaces. School will not be necessary. Humans are going to be very different in the year 2045 just from the AI advances alone. I also think birthrates are going to decline. Precipitously.  Not enough humanoid robots in the depicted ""real life"". By 2045 humanoid robots with AGI will be everywhere.  Well them are just off the top of my head on a single partial viewing (to avoid too many spoilers) on a Monday morning. You can add more ""for sure/no way"" if you like. You can disagree with me, but bear in mind that our technologies are telescoping to the point that innovations that took 10 years now occur in a few weeks. This trend will continue. And the computer processing capabilities will improve exponentially along with it's resultant AI and soon, AGI.  permalinksavecontextfull comments (1)editdelete  

 Should you say please and thank you to your Amazon Echo or Google Home? by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology  

   \[\]izumi3682\[S\] 5 points 6 months ago      I always say ""please"" and ""thank you"" when I utilize 'Siri' on my IPhone. Is that like being polite to my toaster? For now. But I think it is a good habit to get into, because one fine day our AI will be able to tell what is going on and it really behooves us to be on their best side if we can.  Also somebody smarter than me wrote once that if we develop the habit of shouting and demanding of our AIs as if we were ""southern overseers barking orders on the plantation"" it would also further coarsen human interaction as well, because things like that tend to carry over to human to human contact. Seriously, I think we are already seeing effects of that today as it is.   permalinksavecontextfull comments (9)editdelete 

  'Black box' recorder puts surgeons' robotic surgery skills under the microscope by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology  

   \[\]izumi3682\[S\] 1 point 6 months ago      If the device can record and provide data for human evaluation, isn't it likely that this data can also be utilized by the robotic surgical devices themselves to one day perform such surgeries with no human intervention. How many years until we see that? 10 years? 20?  This seems like another example of ""big data"" plus processing speed (just imagine our processing speeds in ten years!) plus AI in the form of CNN to one day soon, render humans superfluous in yet another discipline.  permalinksavecontextfull comments (1)editdelete

   \[\]izumi3682\[S\] 2 points 6 months ago      Haha! Did you read my link? It's a real rabbit hole--I been doing this awhile...  What is it like in the depths of the ""Borg"" intelligence? To me such a sentience would be incomprehensible, unintelligible and unfathomable. If the Borg wanted to make a movie, it would look like 2 hours of static or maybe fractals, or perhaps it could be mistaken by humans as depictions of natural phenomenon like dark matter/energy. They could no more communicate with us than we could communicate with a bacterium. That is the way our AI is going to develop. I was trying to make a point about how the ""Borg"" is the closest thing in available science fiction that envisions the future of what derives from humans in 100-300 years.  TL;DR: It definitely will not be homo sapiens sapiens. No biological humans running around in smexxy space suits on exotic jungle planets with gorgeous ""wimmin"" aliens. If you read my links you will see that I think our future is more like ""inner-space"" than ""outer-space"". Moving at the speed of light is limiting. We will move at the speed of thought.  permalinksavecontextfull comments (10)editdelete

 Black Holes Are Simpler Than Forests and Science Has Its Limits by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology  

   \[\]izumi3682\[S\] 5 points 6 months ago       There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement. -- Lord Kelvin (1900)   About 5 years later in 1905 Einstein discovered the principles of special and general relativity and not too much longer after (@1925) that Nils Bohr, Heisenberg, et. al. discovered the awesome and almost unfathomable world of quantum physics. We struggle with that discovery to this day! If you had told an ophthalmologist in the year 1900 that today (we'll use the year 2005, the year I had my Lasik surgery) we would use lasers to restore full and precise vision to the eye. He would say; ""What is a laser?""  I don't believe science has any limits. I bet we make stunning, incredible scientific discoveries in the realm of physics for the next 300 years easy. After 300 years, concepts such as ""time"" may no longer have meaning. I'd add that if you think ""Star Trek"" (except for maybe the ""Borg"") or ""Star Wars"" or any form of science fiction writing or movie that exists today will have any relationship whatsoever to our probable future, you do not have the capability of logically envisioning the future. Try to imagine a 2 hour movie about the day to day life of the ""Borg"". It's not something in our comprehension.  It is the greatest of human arrogance to think that science has it's limits.  Let me leave you with an interesting idea that should be explored. Do you think it is possible that every atom in the observable universe is using the exact same electron? Some scientists do. It has to do with the limits of our observational abilities and being ""stuck"" in a so-called 'lower dimension'. And it would explain a lot of things. Now there is some new science for the 21st century.  permalinksavecontextfull comments (10)editdelete 

  The human race has peaked by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology  

   \[\]izumi3682\[S\] 2 points 6 months ago      I think there is actually merit to this claim. And it could very well be why humanity is working on such society changing technology.  Just as an example let's take an examination of human lifespan. In 1997 Jeanne Calment died at the age of 122. She is according to strict science the longest living human being ever known. No other human lifespan claims have been empirically proven. Not too long ago Emma Morano died at the age of 117. The other oldest humans are mostly around 114 or younger. For us to go beyond what may be the normal human lifespan of 122 we shall need technology. And that technology is forthcoming. And I will go so far as to prophesy that the first human to reach the age of 1000 has already turned 100. I discussed this at length earlier if you are interested.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6k32lx/maximum\_human\_lifespan\_may\_increase\_to\_125\_years/djixmzs/ 

 Our mental capacity has clearly not peaked. We continue to come up with incredible examples of our intelligence capabilities. I'm talking about AI and soon, AGI. So our next step is clearly the problem of how do we merge our minds with AI most effectively. Things like ""NeuroLink"" (Edit: it's called ""Neuralink') seem to be in the pipeline. I think we are still about 20 years out on merging our minds at a minimum. But we will succeed. We have to. The resultant human after such a process would not be the same as humanity up to that point. It would definitely be human intelligence 2.0. Imagine if every human on Earth were ""human intelligence 2.0"". I would bet that things like politics, religion, economies, even cultures may no longer matter. I also think that humans would think it would be a good idea to develop a hive mind, the better to focus such intelligence. Truthfully, I think it is going to go something like this if we are not destroyed by alternate less human-friendly ""technological singularities"". The worst case scenario being the AGI is not a controlled part of our minds. Then this new EI (emergent intelligence) would simply displace humans as the primary sentience on Earth. It would not be a little bit smarter than humans. It would be billions of times smarter than humans. My favorite comparison is the difference between humans and the archaea. Don't know what an ""archaea"" is? Don't worry, the EI will. And how much of the archaeas' history and culture do we care about? I guess my point is we could well be too smart for our own good already.  What will happen to our personalities, our emotions, our biological needs after this change to so many technologies resulting in ""human 2.0""  I have a pretty good feeling it will go like this...  https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7gpqnx/why\_human\_race\_has\_immortality\_in\_its\_grasp/dqku50e/  permalinksavecontextfull comments (7)editdelete

CNNs thrive on processing power and big data. One or two years. It will take everyone, but me, by surprise. I learned my lesson with AlphaGo. In the year 2012 the best experts in the AI field said it would be impossible for an AI (There was no AlphaGo yet) to beat a human before the year 2050. To the best of my knowledge AlphaGo simply did not exist as a competitive AI until the year 2015. By the spring of 2017 it had beat all human comers at the game of ""Go"". Shortly thereafter a newer iteration of AlphaGo beat the human beating AlphaGo 100 games out of 100 games. This process took about 40 days.  I bet the same sort of thing will happen with ""StarCraft 2"".   ...must also learn by itself the concept like construction, planning, Management   Them are just them ""astronomical"" increase in variables"" I was talking about.   That shoulder hit, Fan thinks, it wasnt a human move. But after 10 seconds of pondering it, he understands. So beautiful, he says. So beautiful.   AlphaGo successfully simulated human imagination.

   \[\]izumi3682\[S\] 10 points 6 months ago      Considering that Chinese (PRC) AI efforts simply did not exist as little as 10 years ago, I would say that China is catching up with frightening rapidity. In about 5 years China will be neck and neck, and in about 10 years China will be ahead--for better or worse. But also in ten years the AI itself will be so highly developed that it's impact in the world will be starting to change humanity from anything we have ever known before.  I believe we are on the verge of creating true AGI. The recent development of ""general ability"" AI in the Alphabet Deepmind models, almost as a throwaway afterthought and it's ability to defeat the top existing AI's in chess and that Japanese chess game, within hours, demonstrate just how fast and comprehensive the ""technological singularity"" is going to be. All that AI needed was the basic rules and movements programmed in. No more information than a human mind would need to learn basic play. It is also working on beating all human minds at ""StarCraft 2"" which has astronomically more variables than the game ""Go"". I think it will take one, maybe two years to achieve this.  People say that we are striving to emulate the human mind. How small and limited they think. We are going to rocket past the AGI of the human mind at 1000 miles per hour. Again for better or worse.  permalinksavecontextfull comments (21)editdelete

In this sense, I do believe Andr Malreaux was right in saying Le 21eme sicle sera spirituel ou ne sera pas.

If authoritarian and hierarchical structures such as the State, the Church and the Corporation were really to disappear, Autonomous Networking structures that emerge will have to deal with the social and spiritual side of things. We need a project that encompasses (the social side) and surpasses (the spiritual side) all of us in order to deploy our possibilities and move on to the next level. I have little time for Bourgeois Ecology, but Arne Naess and his Deep Ecology Movement is interesting in this sense. Perhaps a way forward in the distant future (Arne Naess says that he was writing for the Twenty Second century)?

At the heart of this whole ordeal is the question of Libert, Egalit, Fraternit. I do not really subscribe to this French Republican sloganand I do feel that inequality is a fact of lifebut do we want a sort of Elitism? Can we escape it?

Is it possible for humans to emerge as truly free, autonomous beings doing away, as much as possible, with power structures, elites and self-proclaimed prophetsbe they Theocratic, Communist, Liberal or Noetic? Part of the equation should be the right to chose ones lifestyle (be it in a high tech aluminium igloo in Sophia Antipolis or in an apartment in Goa).

Man does not live by bread alone. In this sense, I believe in a Basic Income Guarantee that would allow people to pursue a spiritual, non-materialistic lifestyle with the bare minimum for survival. Humans such as these have brought us spiritual treasures while living in monasteries, caves and deserts. We need them long after Organised Religion as we know it today has imploded. We need St Isaac of Syria tomorrow.",15,1,False,self,,,,,

Things like Crispr and BCI (brain computer interface) could allow humans to live forever, must it be by reparing damaged DNA or by uploading your consuisness to a computer or andriod, etc.. Thought would imortality be a gift or a curse?

If we could live forever, then what is the point in making babys? Who would get access to it? Would it only be the rich and so poor people would die and could never break the infinite cicle of being exploited by the rich and immortal people?

I see the appeal in immortality, but would it really be a good thing to literaly alt the natural procreation in humans? 

These techonogies will be advalable sooner than most think and i think things of the subject will have to be talked about immensely in the next 2 to 3 decades.

First, I'll say how crazy I think it is that so many of us fear death, and have a grave inability to cope with it even though we have our whole lives to prepare for it and even though we already know that it is life's only certainty...

I believe that all prayers are answered- big and small. A prayer being a wish or a hope, a desire, a craving...spoken or unspoken... -If that which is desired will ultimately add to the healing of the world.   
Even if it takes a twisted turn of events to reach that step towards healing. (Recall situations like Emmett Till for example)

So! Currently, and for the past several decades the world has faced overpopulation. We have searched and searched for answers and turned to science and technology. We've built up, chopped down, and colonized. We would even go as far as Mars for a solution...

Meanwhile, we doubt Mother Earth's ability to heal itself...

We came from this Earth- immaculately engineered. We marvel at the complexity of Earth itself and it's unbelievably precious creations and grow more and more curious about it and ourselves as time goes on...

Everything the Earth has delivered, has an innate ingenuity allowing it to heal, grow, and reproduce. So, it's only reasonable to assume that the Earth itself can a least heal itself as a whole. Don't underestimate that which you don't understand.

We have overpopulated the Earth. We have killed it's creatures and dominated where we have no business. We've misused our intellect and mistaken it for dominance and superiority. We continue to engorge our egos, further driving those complexes of control and power. We are the infestation of the earth. We are the bacteria of the earth. Let's do some comparisons...

The microorganisms we know to be bacteria reproduce astoundingly quickly. Their reproduction typically involves the transfer of DNA. They can develop immunity known as antimicrobial resistance. That immunity can be passed to their offspring. Their lineages are endless. There are more strains of bacteria than we are able to identify. They cannot survive in extreme heat, extreme cold or chemically caustic environments. They respire. They mutate.. The list goes on...

We are the bacteria of the Earth.

Let's look at the effects of bacterial infestation on an organism...   
First, the organism's immune system responds... And responds... And responds... It's a fight to the death between organism and bacteria... BUT once the organism dies, the environment is no longer favorable or suitable and the bacteria either leaves or dies as well later on...   
Then, the bacteria also defends itself by adapting to it's environment as best as possible while also injuring the organism so that the organism cannot defend itself as well as it would be able to if it were whole.

We have successfully infested the majority of our Earth.   
We are at war with our Earth.   
Even with ""superior intellect"" and ""free will"", we are breaking down our Earth as if it were the enemy.

Everything has a balance.

Our bodies have millions of bacteria living inside of us... The key is that they are balanced. When one bacteria experiences an overgrowth, infection occurs. That infection, no matter how small it starts out will lead to death if it continues and spreads.

Earth is experiencing an overgrowth. Earth is infected...with humanity... Natural disasters, war, suicide, inability to conceive, overwhelming disease and illness... Earth is fighting the infection in every possible way.

What happens if we let the sick die, let the elderly die, let the self-destructive destroy themselves... Let the hungry starve and the cold go hyperthermic... Let the animals roam and let natural selection take place... What happens?

We'll never know.

We can't let go. We'll never let go. We must control. We can outsmart our creators and find a way for us all to survive. We are man and we are the pinnacle of intelligence. We must have and we must consume. Though we are not the largest, strongest, nor are we the fastest... we will conquer. We don't know how or when, but we will see you at the finish line of the human race...Where there is a will, there is a way...

But what they don't talk about is the cost... The cost of having everything our glutinous, ego-driven hearts could possibly desire... 

We are the cause and the cure. We are the disease, but we are also the remedy. After all, penicillin is manufactured from the by-product of certain bacteria species. 

We have the power, the intelligence, the strength, the technology, the complete potential and the complete capacity to heal our Earth and our society. If we only shared the view of 'all' being relevant to 'one'... But even as we become more familiar with the concept of oneness, tolerance and selflessness are low. We have to drive this bus in the forward direction. 

We have to think of the world in its entirety. 

We have to think of ourselves as part of the Earth. 

We have to think further than the generation that our bodies will survive. 

We have to think of ourselves as equals to each other and recognize our place and our purpose as part of the entirety of Earth's perfectly complete and balanced spectrum. We have to let go of trivial issues like vanity, competition, and racism. 

We have to think big! We have to think long-term. 

We have to think outside of ourselves.

WE HAVE TO THINK!

WE HAVE TO.

THINK.
