Mostly if I will be able to live forever, or at least significantly longer than current life expectancy.  

This led me down a rabbit hole of considering what major milestones, technological or otherwise, that has significantly advanced society. By ""advanced"" I guess I mean being something that tended to improve overall quality of life and intelligence, on an individual and species level. Things that significantly move the average forward and things that move the leading edge further.

I am curious if anyone thinks I am missing something major, and additional predictions for the future.

Lately, we've made leaps and bounds when it comes to artificial intelligence and some of this AI is available to the public in the form of devices. We also have debates as to whether AI will surpass human intelligence and what that would mean for us.

But when we talk about AI, we mostly talk about human intelligence: the ability to talk, reason and empathize. However, before humans were human, we were just like animals: living through instinct and worrying about survival. If you think about it, animals are ""pre-programmed"" by nature. They don't need instructions when it comes to mating dances and how to build a nest or, at the very least, they don't need extensive study to do these things. Sure, humans instinctively eat when they're hungry and sleep when they're tired but animals can do some amazing things without trying. Human problem solving was born out of finding new ways to survive, so our goals are more or less the same as animals, just with a little more effort.

So this leads me to wonder, since the human brain is so advanced, in some ways, wouldn't it be easier to make a robot with animal intelligence first? Maybe a robot that behaves like a chimpanzee?
 It could be used to study how a human brain can come to be and, therefore, help with the creation of an AI system.

If an animal-bot has already been done, could anyone provide links?",10,4

Autism Spectrum, in other words Autism without mental retardation (i.e. Savants, Aspergers, etc) makes people enable to reach more consistent decisions.

AS people are not concerned about the noise, consequences, or social implications. They only care about reaching the conclusion.

http://greyenlightenment.com/intp-people-rule-the-world/

&gt;the INTP &amp; INTJ people, have a biological advantage in an economy and society that increasingly rewards creativity, authenticity, introspectiveness, wealth, financial independence and analytical skill versus the obsolete, old-economy liberal ideal of collectivism, social skills, and equality

However, in addition to that, an ability to not think about the 'noise', not consider the implication of their decisions, and not think about 'other options' which will delay things, are needed.

Computers are like savants; they don't really do anything other than what is programmed, but they do that very, very, very well. 

The future is being driven by savants like Mark Zukerberg and Elon Musk, both excellent self-promoters with very little concern about those around them, and only caring about their goals and nothing else. 

The future will be driven by people with a very high tendency of autistic spectrum, but without the retardation, because they are able to see the world like computers. And they will be precisely the people who will integrate best with AI since they already have physical AI programmed at the first place.

We don't need empathy, compassion, mercy, or all other 'noise'. We only need precision, efficiency, and speed, and the inability to have feelings, combined with the ability to ignore all the 'noise', makes someone a great driver for the Future.",10,0

But we're also starting to get a grim sense of the potential horrors. Here are 10 frightening technologies that should never, ever, come into existence.

As I was putting this list together, it became obvious to me that many of the technologies described below could be put to tremendously good use. It was important, therefore, for me to make the distinction between a technology per se and how it might be put to ill use. Take nanotechnology, for example. Once developed, it could be used to end scarcity, clean-up the environment, and rework human biology. But it could also be used to destroy the planet in fairly short order. So, when it comes time to develop these futuristic technologies, we'll have to do it safely and responsibly. But just as importantly, we'll also have to recognize when a particular line of technological inquiry is simply not worth the benefits. Artificial superintelligence may be a potent example.

That said, some technologies are objectively evil. Here's what Patrick Lin, the director of the Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, told io9 about this:

""The idea that technology is neutral or amoral is a myth that needs to be dispelled. The designer can imbue ethics into the creation, even if the artifact has no moral agency itself. This feature may be too subtle to notice in most cases, but some technologies are born from evil and don't have redeeming uses, e.g., gas chambers and any device here. And even without that point (whether technology can be intrinsically good or bad), everyone agrees that most technologies can have both good and bad uses. If there's a greater likelihood of bad uses than good ones, then that may be a reason not to develop the technology.""

With all that out of the way, here are 10 bone-chilling technologies that should never be allowed to exist (listed in no particular order):

Weaponized Nanotechnology



Nothing could end our reign here on Earth faster than weaponized  or severely botched  molecular assembling nanotechnology.

It's a threat that stems from two extremely powerful forces: unchecked self-replication and exponential growth. A sufficiently nihilistic government, non-state actor, or individual could engineer microscopic machines that consume our planet's critical resources at a rapid-fire rate while replicating themselves in the process and leaving useless bi-products in their wake  a residue futurists like to call ""grey goo.""

Nanotechnology theorist Robert Freitas has brainstormed several possible variations of planet-killing nanotech, including aerovores (a.k.a. grey dust), grey plankton, grey lichens, and so-called biomass killers. Aeorovores would blot out all sunlight, grey plankton would consist of seabed-grown replicators that eat up land-based carbon-rich ecology, grey lichens would destroy land-based geology, and biomass killers would attack various organisms.

According to Freitas, a worst case scenario of ""global ecophagy"" would take about 20 months, ""which is plenty of advance warning to mount an effective defense."" By defence, Freitas is referring to countermeasures likely involving self-replicating nanotechnology, or some kind of system that disrupts the internal mechanisms of the nanobots. Alternately, we could set up ""active shields"" in advance, though most nanotechnology experts agree they'll be useless. Consequently, a moratorium on weaponized nanotechnology should be established and enforced.

Conscious Machines



It's generally taken for granted that we'll eventually imbue a machine with artificial consciousness. But we need to think very seriously about this before we go ahead and do such a thing. It may actually be very cruel to build a functional brain inside a computer  and that goes for both animal and human emulations.

Back in 2003, philosopher Thomas Metzinger argued that it would be horrendously unethical to develop software that can suffer:

""What would you say if someone came along and said, ""Hey, we want to genetically engineer mentally messed up human infants! For reasons of scientific progress we need infants with certain cognitive and emotional deficits in order to study their postnatal psychological development  we urgently need some funding for this important and innovative kind of research!"" You would certainly think this was not only an absurd and appalling but also a dangerous idea. It would hopefully not pass any ethics committee in the democratic world. However, what today's ethics committees don't see is how the first machines satisfying a minimally sufficient set of constraints for conscious experience could be just like such mentally retarded infants. They would suffer from all kinds of functional and representational deficits too. But they would now also subjectively experience those deficits. In addition, they would have no political lobby  no representatives in any ethics committee.""

Futurist Louie Helm agrees. Here's what he told me:

""One of the best things about computers is that you can make them sum a million columns in a spreadsheet without them getting resentful or bored. Since we plan to use artificial intelligence in place of human intellectual labor, I think it would be immoral to purposely program it to be conscious. Trapping a conscious being inside a machine and forcing it to do work for you is isomorphic to slavery. Additionally, consciousness is probably really fragile. In humans, a few miscoded genes can cause Down Syndrome, schizophrenia, autism, or epilepsy. So how terrible would it feel to be a slightly misprogrammed form of consciousness? For instance, several well-funded AI developers want to recreate human intelligence in machines by simulating the biological structure of human brains. I sort of hope and expect that these near-term attempts at cortical simulations will be too coarse to really work. But to the extent that they do work, the first ""success"" will likely create cripplingly unpleasant or otherwise deranged states of subjective experience. So as a programmer, I'm generally against self-aware artificial intelligence. Not because it wouldn't be cool. But because I'm just morally opposed to slavery, torture, and unnecessary code.""

Artificial Superintelligence



As Stephen Hawking declared earlier this year, artificial intelligence could be our worst mistake in history. Indeed, as we've noted many times before here on io9, the advent of greater-than-human intelligence could prove catastrophic. The introduction of systems far faster and smarter than us would force us to take a back seat. We'd be at the mercy of whatever the artificial superintelligence decides to do  and it's not immediately clear that we'll be able to design a friendly AI to prevent this. We need to solve this problem, otherwise building an ASI would be absolutely nuts.

============================================

Time Travel



I'm actually not much of a believer in time travel (i.e. where are all the time travelers?), but I will say this  if it's possible, we'll want to stay the heck away from it.

It would be so crazily dangerous. Any scifi movie dealing with contaminated timelines should give you an idea of the potential perils, especially those nasty paradoxes. And even if some form of quantum time travel is possible  in which completely new and discreet timelines are created  the cultural and technological exchange between disparate civilizations couldn't possibly end well.

Mind Reading Devices



The prospect exists for machines that can read people's thoughts and memories at a distance and without their consent. This likely won't be possible until human brains are more intimately integrated within the web and other communication channels.

Last year, for example, scientists from the Netherlands used brain scan data and computer algorithms to determine which letters a person was looking at. The breakthrough hinted at the potential for a third party to reconstruct human thoughts at an unprecedented level of detail, including what we see, think, and remember. Such devices, if used en masse by some kind of totalitarian regime or police state, would make life intolerable. It would introduce an Orwellian world in which our ""thought crimes"" could actually be enforced. 

============================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================

Brain Hacking Devices



Relatedly, there's also the potential for our minds to be altered against our knowledge or consent. Once we have chips in our brain, and assuming we won't be able to develop effective cognitive firewalls, our minds will be exposed to the Internet and all its evils.

Incredibly, we've already taken the first steps toward this goal. Recently, an international team of neuroscientists set up an experiment that allowed participants to engage in brain-to-brain communication over the Internet. Sure, it's exciting, but this tech-enabled telepathy could open a pandora's box of problems. Perhaps the best  and scariest  treatment of this possibility was portrayed in Ghost in the Shell, in which an artificially intelligent hacker was capable of modifying the memories and intentions of its victims. Now imagine such a thing in the hands of organized crime and paranoid governments.

============================================

Autonomous Robots Designed to Kill Humans



The potential for autonomous killing machines is a scary one  and perhaps the one item on this list that's already an issue today.

Here's what futurist Michael LaTorra told me:

""We do not yet have a machine that exhibits general intelligence even close to the human level. But human level intelligence is not required for the operation of autonomous robots with lethal capabilities. Building robotic military vehicles of all sorts is already achievable. Robot tanks, aircraft, ships, submarines, and humanoid-shaped soldiers are possible today. Unlike remote-controlled drones, military robots could identify targets and destroy them without a human giving the final order to shoot. The dangers of such technology should be obvious, but it goes beyond the immediate threat of ""friendly fire"" incidents in which robots mistakenly kill people from their own side of a conflict, or even innocent civilians. The greater danger lurks in the international arms race that could be set off if any nation deploys autonomous military robots. After a few cycles of improvement, the race to develop ever more powerful military robots could cross a threshold in which the latest generation of autonomous military robots would be able to outfight any human-controlled military system. And then, either by accident (""Who knew that Artificial Intelligence could emerge spontaneously in a military robot?"") or by design (""We didn't think hackers could re-program our military robots remotely!"") humankind might find itself crushed into subservience, like the helot slaves of Spartan AI overlords.""

Weaponized Pathogens



This is another bad one that's disturbingly topical. As noted by Ray Kurzweil and Bill Joy back in 2005, publishing the genomes of deadly viruses for all the world to see is a recipe for destruction. There's always the possibility that some idiot or a fanatical group will take this information and either reconstruct the virus from scratch or modify an existing virus to make it even more virulent  and then release it onto the world. It has been estimated, for example, that the engineered Avian Flu could kill half of the world's humans. Just as disturbingly, researchers from China combined bird and swine flus to create a mutant airborne virus. The idea, of course, is to know the enemy and develop possible countermeasures before an actual pandemic strikes. But there's always the danger that the virus could escape from the lab and wreak havoc in human populations. Or that the virus could be weaponized and unleashed. There's even the scary potential for weaponized genome specific viruses. It's time for authorities to start thinking about this grim possibility before something awful happens. As reported in Foreign Policy, ISIS is certainly one group that already appears ready and willing.

Virtual Prisons and Punishment



What will jails and punishment be like when people can live for hundreds or thousands of years? And what if prisoners have their minds uploaded? Ethicist Rebecca Roache offers these horrifying scenarios:

""The benefits of...radical lifespan enhancement are obviousbut it could also be harnessed to increase the severity of punishments. In cases where a thirty-year life sentence is judged too lenient, convicted criminals could be sentenced to receive a life sentence in conjunction with lifespan enhancement. As a result, life imprisonment could mean several hundred years rather than a few decades. It would, of course, be more expensive for society to support such sentences. However, if lifespan enhancement were widely available, this cost could be offset by the increased contributions of a longer-lived workforce.

...[Uploading] the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight-and-a-half hours. This would, obviously, be much cheaper for the taxpayer than extending criminals' lifespans to enable them to serve 1,000 years in real time. Further, the eight-and-a-half hour 1,000-year sentence could be followed by a few hours (or, from the point of view of the criminal, several hundred years) of treatment and rehabilitation. Between sunrise and sunset, then, the vilest criminals could serve a millennium of hard labour and return fully rehabilitated either to the real world (if technology facilitates transferring them back to a biological substrate) or, perhaps, to exile in a computer simulated world.""

That's awful! Now, it's important to note that Roache is not advocating these punishment methods  she's just doing some foresight. But holy smokes, let's never EVER turn this into a reality.

Hell Engineering



This one's quite similar to the previous item. Some futurists make the case for paradise engineering  the use of advanced technologies, particularly consciousness uploading and virtual reality, to create a heaven on Earth. But if you can create heaven, you can create hell. It's a prospect that's particularly chilling when you consider lifespans of indefinite length, along with the nearly boundless possibilities for psychological and physical anguish. This is actually one of the worst things I can think of; why anyone would want to develop such a thing is beyond me. It's yet another reason for banning the development of artificial superintelligence  and the onset of the so-called Roko's Basilisk problem.",20,0

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-05/volvo-cars-joins-electric-race-with-plan-for-five-battery-models

https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-07-05/just-like-bob-dylan-volvo-is-going-electric

https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-06-27/bad-day-at-the-office-for-the-ball-bearings-billionaire

Since these articles (and most others that are similar) don't mention it, I'd just like to remind you (dear reader) that: *EVs are currently A LOT cheaper to drive than ICE vehicles (once the car is driven off the lot)*:

* Internal combustion engine-- [(x miles per gallon) * (y dollars per gallon)-1]-1 = z dollars per mile. Plug in electric vehicle-- [(a miles per kWh)-1 * (b dollars per kWh)] = c dollars per mile. If z &lt; c, then the internal combustion engine is cheaper to drive, if z &gt; c then the electric is cheaper to drive.

* Likewise, [(d miles per gallon) * (e miles per kWh)-1 * (f dollars per kWh)] = g dollars per gallon gasoline equivalent for driving an electric vehicle. If g &lt; the current price of a gallon of gasoline, then the electric vehicle is cheaper to drive.

My idea is, instead of the government handing out UBI to individuals, they would instead give a lump sum to a group of between 50-150 adults and let them decide how to split up the money. So one street, or one apartment building would get say $1 Million per month that they get to decide what to do with. You could enter or exit a group anytime you want, and groups would have total autonomy to decide what to do with the money. They could just whack it up 150 different ways, or they could pool it and buy things together they could share. It if worked it would encourage people to be good neighbors to each other, encourage people to build things together, and keep everyone honest. 

It would be pretty complicated, but it might be a way around some of the pitfalls of traditional UBI.

Tl. Dr:
*wealth is created primarily though asset appreciation such as Bitcoin, stocks, web 2.0 valuations, real estate, etc. (the everything-goes-up economy)
*bigger-is-better, winner-take-all (tech companies such as Facebook, Google ,and Amazon keeping getting bigger and more powerful; far fewer competitors
*[To launch a Startup] more like $10-60 billion; $100-300 million is just the starting round
&gt;Capitalism has gotten much smarter and choosier, so instead of capital taking risks in small business like it did in a pre-2008 era, capital is chasing a very small pool of already very large and successful companies. But this is not necessarily due to risk aversion, but rather due to large companies growing as fast, but much more consistently, as the small ones. Why invest in a tiny start-up that will grow slower than Facebook, when one can invest in Uber, Tesla, or Facebook, which are much better and already have huge growth and market dominance, instead of wasting money on a start-up that will almost certainly fail. 
&gt;Amazon, Facebook, Google, etc. Nearly a decade later, no one has been able create a viable competitor to these companies and likely never will

And, whether you like or not, that is the future.

For example, both France and America were stopped at the jungles of Vietnam in the 1950s and 1960s. But, the analogy is, the new tech could eliminate all the tropical forest in Indochina, leaving the guerillas nowhere to hide and bomb Vietnam into oblivion. 

Sorry.

No more startups - like the Chinese mandarins, whose only employer was the Imperial Government, the talented people will have to work for these tech giants for seven figures, rather than trying to strike their fortune and aiming for eight or nine figures.

Financialization, Capitalization and Rentierism have won. No more startups, no more garage success story. It will be eternal, with no competition possible.",2,5

I believe it is the only way to create a stable economy once the AI revolution takes a good share of the jobs away.  I think there is a better way of doing it though, rather than just give cash to the populace to spend how they please (similar to welfare) why not come up with a system that addresses the basic needs in life directly.  It could start with the most essential needs and as the robot revolution grows it could grow with it.  Examples below:

1) Water - the most essential need of every human.  I have a water bill like most I'm sure.  It's small, so why not start by making this free to everyone.

2.) Food - They give food stamps to the poor now,  easy enough to include everyone. It would also solve the problem of poor drug addicted people from selling them for 50% value to drug dealers.  As everyone would have them they would have no value in reselling.  

3.) Transportation - Another easy one, make all public transportation (buses, subways, etc..) free to all.  This should also help with traffic and pollution as well.

4.) Health care - A big one, however we already spend a ton on healthcare.  Between Medicare, Medicaid, and SSI we already take care of a large portion of the population, it's only fair everyone gets equal care.

5.)  Education - Elementary and High School is public, next evolution would be higher education and also preschools.

At this point there is really only one basic need left, but it's the hardest one - shelter.  The easy way would be to start with the UBI and give cash toward shelter.  The only problem I see with this is that the low income rent would start to creep.  I'd love to see a scenario in which the government works with people to build low/no income mass housing, but I see many challenges.  Lots of though would have to go into a proper way to handle this one.

After the shelter scenario is figured out we have all of the basic needs done and can begin to work toward other goals:

Entertainment - Libraries are free, why not make state parks, museums, beaches, parking, etc.... I'm sure there are many more things that can be made available.

I feel this strategy not only makes it easier for the government to provide these needs, and control how they get used (not abused), but also it's equal for everyone.  How many times do we hear rich people complain about poor people getting free rides and not paying their own way, or poor people saying how they don't get a fair share and are being held back.  I know I would feel a lot better if it was equally distributed, I'd also feel more secure for myself and my family if I wasn't as worried about the most important basic needs in life being guaranteed.

I'd love some other thoughts and comments.

I'm sure I can't be the first one to suspect that the always-on voice recording devices exist in order to collect data for a couple years, in anticipation of one day releasing a product that is essentially a digital clone of yourself.  

Imagine an always-on clone that speaks in your voice and knows your personality and preferences. It could pick up the phone and call a plumbing company for you. Or a hundred local plumbers to find who has the best price. 

Or instead of making that painful apology to a friend or boss, you could have your clone do it. 

I'd imagine it even being taken to a level where after you die, your autonomous clone continues to do things in your name like buy the grandkids sweaters for Christmas, and generate a video (with a CG version of yourself) wishing them a merry Christmas in your voice. 

I'm sure the idea of digital doppelgngers isn't new, but I haven't yet seen anyone bring up the possibility that the Echo and the Google Home are actually stage I in this future project. ",3,7

Will the day come where we have politicians being attacked because they spent most of their high school years downloading porn in their parents house? Or Congressmen who have the contents of their long defunct Reddit troll account from when they were a teenager made public? 

It would seem to me that given the massive amount of information that you could uncover about anyone, especially if you start digging up IP logs, at some point in the future we'd need laws establishing statutes of limitations on this sort of information as to when it can no longer be republished, should someone running for President in their 40's be held accountable for indiscretions they made in their youth, regardless of how terrible they might be?

This viewpoint was justified by the history preceding it: Everything *had* become organized around the heat engine since the Industrial Revolution.  Heat engines drove mechanical motion via steam locomotives, powered boats, and internal-combustion engines for both automobiles and aircraft.  The heat engine was even how the power of nuclear fission was harnessed rather than some more exotic process, heating water and driving turbines rather than doing anything truly strange.

Even though a large part of what these engines did was generate electrons, people saw electricity as merely a medium for transmitting the power of the heat engine across distances.  But that started to change when mathematicians began playing around with electrons, and an entire universe of unsuspected possibilities arrived in the form of computation.

Now we live in a technological hybrid era, where electronics do a truly staggering amount of the work of civilization, and yet physical motion remains overwhelmingly tied to heat engines.  But that is changing - society is in the process of completing the electronic revolution that began generations ago, at the end of which heat engine technology will have mostly been replaced by electron-based applications.

And yet the messiness doesn't stop there, because in a few places we already have basic applications of the step *beyond* electronics - technology directly utilizing photons, the fundamental carriers of electromagnetic information.  We have fiber optic communications, as well as various applications of coherent EM (most commonly lasers).  

And yet this is still very early, and like electricity in the 19th century, technology in today's increasingly electronic world regards the photon as a sideshow.  That will almost certainly change, however.

As systems like photovoltaics come to increasingly dominate global power generation, photons will be harnessed to generate electrons.  Since so many end-user applications of electricity will involve generating photons - e.g., lighting, heating, and imagery - the photon will be closing in on technology from both ends of the supply chain, as both origin and outcome.  

There will come a point when there is no economic purpose in using electrons just to turn a photon in one place into a photon in another.  Even where electrical charge continues to be useful, photons are the basic particles that carry the forces involved, and at some point the electron will be a superfluous middle-man in the process.

It is a seductive and poetic concept for any futurist: A civilization driven by Light, that communicates by Light, that computes by Light, and moves by Light.  

This is the long-term promise of ""photonics"" as a field - that some day we will have the same kind of fine-tuned control of light that today we have of electricity.  That it will be able to drive motion at trivial expense, even compared to the already utopian potential of a finely-honed electric-powered world.

With that kind of delicate control of such a fundamental thing, the possibilities are unimaginable.  The most subtle manipulations on the microscopic scale could, occurring in large enough numbers and with sufficient computation, result in the most absurd large-scale physical capabilities.

People some day will wonder why we took the long way around just to utilize photons indirectly, as secondary consequences of crude chemistry or temperamental particles, rather than going straight for the source.

The poetry of it is irresistible: That humankind will have gone from fire, to lightning, to light itself.  That in fact, if aspects of Singularity prove true, light may be the future of being itself, and not merely a tool.

We are just *now* entering the fullness of the Electron Age, when our knowledge and control of electrons is leveraged to maximum potential.  How long can we expect that to last before the applications of optical technologies grow and begin to replace even those?

Every time we think we're finally over it for real, and every single time we're mistaken. And the next big war, perhaps very soon, is going to be the last war, and we'll be back to the stone age for real.

The issue is as divisive as, if not more so, than, self-driving cars.

However, looking at this in more depth, what would be the benefits for society of having sex robots, and looking from another point of view, the negative consequences?

Unemployment of prostitutes is one major issue - and unemployment in general.

I read about Elon Musk worrying there won't be enough humans, and that could be a possible consequence.

One other consequence - would a future Hollywood actor/actress release a sex robot version of themselves so fans literally can have them with them, or would that be a marketing stunt too far/ PR disaster?

How a manufacturer will avoid the uncanny valley problem robots have is one issue. It doesn't matter as much with Alexa, since that's voice-only [if you've seen Mr. Robot it's a major plot point for one character].

What do you think could be the possible benefits and consequences for society in the future regarding sex robots, and when do you think is a realistic timeline for them to appear?

https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/29/15893802/dubai-police-robot-drone-car
(Police drone car in Dubai which can identify 'undesirables' )

are being introduced.

Sooner or later, the homeless will be targeted by such machines, paid by valuable citizens who do not want to be bothered by such eyesores. What happens to the homeless who will be collected, and disposed in locations the citizens will never see, won't be a concern for taxpaying citizens.

The Grenfell Tower fire is no longer a news. Too much money is involved to keep it in news for too long. It will be demolished and another high-rise, owned by valuable people who won't live in there, will be erected.

The rich need more money to fuel innovation, technology, and the future. And the 'people' are standing in their way so they will be removed.

In the future, rents in where the jobs, techs and civilizations are will be something like $10,000/month (in today's money) for a studio, and will increase higher as more space is rented. Of course, if you can spare $10 million you could buy the studio. 

Gentrification will affect the rest of the world as money obtained with such real estate as collateral will be used to buy out empty houses around the world, which will be kept out of the people who need housing since the local govts would rather welcome those who pay taxes rather than those who are tax burdens.

Those who can't live in the middle of city will be driven out to high-rent environs, where every house under commuting distance will be owned by the large landowners and will still be charged usurious rents.

Housing arrangements like this

(rent for such cage - $167/mo, although I think such arrangements will be more expensive as landowners can charge whatever they feel like it) 

will be the norm for those who are lucky to get a gig job near the center of civilization. 

As social contract breaks down, those who own properties have no more obligation to the 'people', and people in such arrangements are unlikely to build families or social relationships, writing them off from the gene pool.

It is an evolutionary process, much like the Enclosure movement of England which rid of that nation all the less successful genes and only left the bloodline of the successful farmers and traders , as documented by Gregory Clark in his many papers. (the nobles were too few in number to matter significantly in the gene pool, although they mostly kept their social status 900 years after the Conquest, since many rare surnames of Norman origin are still found in the highest rungs of English society according to Clark).

It is an evolutionary process - those who are successful will be able to afford the cost of living in Civilization and will continue to thrive for ever, while those who can't are .. simply left behind.",13,0

But what if the physician were to be replaced by a nurse/computer combo? The nurse would communicate with the patient, take signs and symptoms, input them into the computer, and the computer decides on a diagnosis and/or course of action. Then the nurse relays that info back to the patient in a way that they can understand. The nurse would be there to provide the ""human element"" and the computer would do most of the thinking. From a technological standpoint, I honestly think that physicians would be much easier to replace than truck/cab drivers. Physicians (non-surgeons) are basically just information repositories, and computers can retain and recall information much more efficiently than humans. The biggest obstacle for this replacement is probably laws. The laws would have to change so that a nurse would be allowed to write a prescription based on the computer's recommendation. Nurse practitioners and physician's assistants can already prescribe medication, but that authority would have to be extended to RN's as well if we are to provide widespread access to affordable healthcare.

Do you think that a nurse/computer combo is a viable replacement for physicians and if so, how long until we see this replacement happen?

Half the world is at war with itself because of ridiculous religious reasons. I say we need a sort of Illumaniti; people with a level of intelligence in the minority. People who are not distracted by what fails most of humanity in its race for the collection of money, fame and power. 
Take the rise of transgenderism, the morphing of genders, political correctness that rises far above necessity, politics becoming a game to those with the power, the developments in AI which will eventually result in cyber humans. We are slowly taking apart the morals and foundations that make us human. The lower ranks in society are slowly but steadily, brainwashed by people with more money and power. People who run the media are those with strongest power to change humanity at this point, for the worse if that may be their choosing.

The majority of people seem to ignore this, but we are on a rapid decline to complete annihilation, since pretty soon even the most obnoxious of people will be violently brought to their senses by creations that go against their entire existence, including AI.

The great worry here is no one is prepared for this. We're all going about the turmoil in our lives oblivious to the reality around us.

That's why i believe the Illuminati existing would be a good thing, or the creation of something similar. That governs over it *all*. That should be anonymous in order for their decisions not to be affected by society's opinion of them.

1224,2017-7-11,2017,7,11,7,6mhvn6,I tried to do the math on the Boring Companies tunnels - Either I failed or the fee for one mile would be ridiculously high. Would be happy if someone could check and tell me where I messed up :),https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6mhvn6/i_tried_to_do_the_math_on_the_boring_companies/,PMSthe1,1499724797,"I have been watching some talks from Elon Musk explaining on how he plans to reduce the cost to build a tunnel from 1 billion US$ per mile to ""only"" 100 million per mile.([TED Talk] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIwLWfaAg-8) i am reffering to ) For me this still seems pretty expensive. I would assume that the business model is somewhat comparable to the one of bridges . So you would have to pay a certain fee for a certain part of the road. I tried to do some math on it to come up for a cost per mile you would have to pay to use the tunnels.

I would assume that the depreciation of the tunnel would be 5% per year. which means one mile costs 5 millilion US$ per year. The next questions would be how many cars will go through the tunnel per day. To do so I just assumed a price of 0.5$ per mile (which i regard as quite high, taking the gasoline price in account) To cover 5 Million US$ per year, you would need 10 million cars paying 0,50US$ per mile. Respectively it would take about 27400 cars per day, or 19 cars per minute. The problem here is not, that it is impossible to have 19 cars per minute going through the tunnel. The problem would be to bring so many cars in (and out) of the tunnel so quickly using the proposed system. You would have only 3-4 seconds to bring a car in (our out) of the tunnel. 


Here the simple numbers I have come up with:

Cost to build	 $100.000.000,00 

Depreciation per year	5%

Yearly cost per mile (depreciation only)	 $5.000.000,00
 
Fee per mile	 $0,50 

Needed cars to cover the yearly costs	 10.000.000,00 
  
Cars transit per day	 27.397,26
   
Cars transit per hour	 1.141,55   

Cars transit per minute	 19,03   
	
Available seconds to bring a car into the tunnel	 3,15   

Now thats the point when I did not get the math. Even at a price of 0,5US$ a mile it would require 20 cars per minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week straight without interruption. That is only the cost for the construction of the tunnel and not even takes into account the operating cost. 

I cannot imagine someone paying close to 0,50 US$ per mile for this service. If you would cut the price to 0,10 cent per mile (still freaking expensive) you would have to put five times as much vehicles through the tunnel.

Anyone has seen some numbers which could validate or contradict my assumtions or tell me where I took a wrong turn?

Does Elon plan to have it funded by the state or wants to build it to last for 100 years? Just a side note: If you want to build a tunnel network similar to the subway in LA (approx 100 miles) you would have to build a tunnel in each direction. This would mean 20 Billion US$ for a rather small network.

Probably not.

I'd like to introduce to you the idea of a world govrenment. Where the world is at complete peace with all it's individual parts. The idea is that governments of countries work together to sort out their issues. Where war is not option since we are at world peace, and any sort of action from the country would cause it's obliteration practically from existence, hence making it completely impossible for others to rebel. This will obviously cause a terrific increase in the rate of technological and scientific advancements, since we're all forced to get on and deal with it.
War is not a necessity, and we can remove it entirely.

You should understand this could take hundreds of years to achieve, since I am no one in society, and because of this, will only appeal to those genuinely interested. This, I take, is one of the seeds that will begin the chain of ideas that eventually will cause a change in time. We have created a ranked society built by generations upon generations of changes. We have risen from being grunting cave-dwellers to living to this level of complexity, isn't now a good time to question what we've built together? 

You might be thinking this is crazy?! but I urge you to look and think about our issues today, and how they all lie in the positions of people we've put into power, we as regular people can't do anything, just give them a nudge or nod as to where we want to go. This is a time where we can show them that we, as people can change things and make it fair - as it should be.

There is so much war, poverty and corruption in the world, and so much of it lies in conceptional lines drawn across pieces of land. Look at it. We as people who were brought into existence on this planet and controlled by others who arrived earlier. Most of us have no say in what can change, we may protest our change to the, for the majority, older generation led government. We can not live our lives as we please, peacefully, in many places in the world due to such issues. This has remained the same as long as the idea of countries has existed. A united world would be that start of something new and very great indeed.

We are the human race, we've survived millions of years of evolution, hardship and we built ourselves the society that we live in today. Are we really just going to sit back and let it disintegrate into itself? You should be proud to be a part of this journey mankind has taken, and what better way to give back than ensure that it lasts?

Please spread this and raise awareness. Great changes can begin as small ideas. We plant them in society and hope that they grow and become great things. Here is where you can help make a difference in your lifetime, where you can do your duty as a human being and help improve humanity for the generations to come.

Thank you.",6,0

Society is collapsing downhill, and I fear it will extenguish itself within a very short period of time. 
People are not paying attention to what is happening to society as a whole. We are forgetting that we are a thing. We are an idea that has formed in the universe, and all ideas must be good in order to survive.

I want to explain how the media now is affecting humanity as a whole. People don't understand the power of the media right now. It has the power to control our thoughts, our way of thinking, even our core morals. The media has the power of exposure, which is the strongest form against the mind, which begins to accept after long exposure, even if such a thing isn't real.

Think about it. How are ideas spread so quickly? how are morals changing as we speak? What gives the masses the idea the Porn is a good think to do? Or that to be a transexual is perfectly normal? What about the clothes they wear, the food they eat? What happens if we keep letting this go on and we begin to have the change of IQ enhanced people, technologically enhanced humans, capable of creating complete chaos. These kind of things are easily missed, since technology is advancing as it is, wouldn't stopping a moment and figuring out what exactly is going on and where we are deciding to go in the future, be a very wise thing to do?

Here is how it happens:

Our  morals are based entirely on the generation we live in, excluing religious people - I'll come to them. Hell, people change almost as swiftly as the law changes. They always follow.

Humans show sheep like behaviour when put together. They all know the same things, do the same things, think about the same things - and it's slowly becoming more and similar. We all have people dominating over us in what we do in our lives. We follow whoever is popular because they were different initially, then continued to be followed because the change was so gradual we failed to notice it. Then, once huge amounts of people have done the same, any other changes can be very noticeable and even controversial - a huge following implies a large number of people agreeing, thanks to this sort of social law/rule.

Society itself can therefore be changed through the creation of the aforementioned indivuduals. These people we looked up to and admired, say things, wear things and commit acts that are very slightly questionable to our morals in our place and time. Famous people are doing it, so it's alright. People follow this, and it becomes a 'trend' - a popular topic amongst the first world society. The idea becomes widespread, people share it, discuss it, argue over it. The more controversial the change the more it is talked about, and spread therefore to more people. This results in a shift in human behaviour. This slight shift kicks the social rule into act and people from all over the world begin to accept such an idea. 
This is how ideas are spread and causing our current world to change. This is only happening now since the spread of ideas is so much quicker, thanks to the rapid rise of technology.",4,0

It is important that access to the net remains open, accessible and equitable, to ensure that it can continue to benefit humanity as a whole, and not just to the few.

The FCC is about to slash net neutrality protections that prevent Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps.

Even though this is happening in America, the impact is potentially worldwide.

USA has exploited Latin America, and whenever a leader tried to claim more share for his own nation than America's, the leader was removed.

The prosperity of the 1990s was because it was so cheap to f'k Russia up, so Americans and other people in the West benefited while the people of Russia and Asia (after the 1997 crisis in that continent) suffered.

Imperialism is a necessary condition to advance civilization. we had the most significant scientific developments when Imperialism was at its height. After , thanks to a few 'heroes' who should be called as 'enemies of Civilization', Great War killed the cream of the West, the colonials became uppity and progresses slowed down a bit.

After 1945, when the colonial powers no longer had the power to suppress the less developed world, progresses slowed down.

Economic prosperity in the 'correct' regions does not come cheap. It comes from exploiting the rest.

In a utilitarian term, exploitation of the less intelligent, the less wealthy, and the less able is a good thing, since it stimulates economic growth, which in terms tends to fuel scientific and technical progress.

Today's economic system benefits the more intelligent, more wealthy and more able. Never before the most important members of society had the chance to do whatever they want without any implication - even the most outlandish lord had to fear the barber shaving his beard cutting his throat.

But now, the elites are completely immune from any consequences, and therefore they can pursue their agenda without having to think about the consequences, which will probably escape them.

Right now, resources are running out, and new ways to utilize them are not entirely successful as of now. There will be some limited success, but not enough to change the general picture.

The future does not come free. Economic growth is necessary to fuel it, 

and if that means impoverishment and destitution of billions to enrich the elites, so be it.   That's the natural order of things - Darwinism at work.

Only the elites, with the power to move billions and trillions, will have the ability to bring the Future, which is a greater good than, say, the lives of the people in a starving village. No one will remember these villagers (and their misery will continue), while a tech breakthrough is forever.",7,0

1443,2017-7-12,2017,7,12,23,6mu5v3,Some things to consider concerning longevity and the future.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6mu5v3/some_things_to_consider_concerning_longevity_and/,izumi3682,1499868627,"A human turning 100 years old today has a better than average chance of living for 20 more years. And that is just based on existing medical technology and the blessings of that individual's genetics. Between today and 20 years I bet we make some significant advances in interventional aging reversal technology. 

I prophesy that the first person to be 1000 years old is turning 100 years old today. If you have not been following the medical advances in aging reversal technology, this claim sounds like the wildest fantasy, but you are the one ill-informed. 

Senescent cell clearing technology alone will cause a 100 year old to potentially live until 130. Regenerative medicine will be beyond our wildest dreams in 30 years. Age related sarcopenia has officially been classified as a pathology (M62.84 ICD 10). Five years ago there was no such classification. Age related sarcopenia was simply regarded as a ""natural aspect of aging"". And this is not even counting advances in nano-tech, which is the true wildcard in all of this.

As it is, I see most super centenarians (those over the age of 110) living for the most part to the age of about 117. Emma Morano recently died at the age of 117. The next three oldest humans are all over the age of 114. And this cohort of people living over the age of 110 has increased dramatically. 

The upshot of all of this is scientific immortality for *me*. And I am 57 years old. Sure I could get cancer in ten years or get hit by a truck tomorrow, but I think my chances are good. 
I will be 100 in 2060, but youthful as a 21 year old. (And probably crazy nano-augmented to boot.)


Unfortunately the ""bean counters"" realize this as well. So I think the odds of me being mandatorily worked until age 70 are also good. No more retirement at age 65. Now since this is r/futurology, perhaps something nice like UBI or the AI taking over or something will let me still retire relatively early.

Record to beat is Jeanne Calment who passed away in 1997 at the age of 122.

The artist submits a ""work"" representing his or her self-expression. People determine if it is art or not. If I scribble on a piece of paper and put it on a wall, if people determine it is ""art"", it is art. The same holds true for music, or any other ""artistic"" medium of self expression.

What makes something ""art"" to me is based on values and culture that has been inculcated into me since birth. In addition I think ""art"" appreciation is cumulative in our experience. We see an early example of an art form and each succeeding example is judged to be ""better"" or ""worse"" than our baseline. I would say something like; ""Wow! That is an extraordinary example of something I am already familiar with. 

We also recognize human cleverness and ingenuity as well. An amazing (to me) piece of sculpture I saw once was a female bust wherein the face was covered with a very thin ""veil"". To have carved and sculpted that attractive human female face with such incredible detail and yet I realized that the veil is a part of the sculpture is something I have never forgotten ever in my life.

I saw a Picasso (also Braque and a third guy I forget) exhibit at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis when I was in 5th grade in 1971. It included among other things, "" Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"". (I'm assuming it was on tour.) It looked very weird to me then. My overall vague recollection of the balance of the exhibition was lots of vivid blues and browns. Today I realize what I had seen and I'm floored. 

Now here is my point concerning AI and ""art"". In virtually every case, I do not know a thing about the artist. Perhaps I have heard of them through cultural osmosis, but what their motivation is, I have no idea. I ""just know what I like"". But an AI is not human. It simply uses massive amounts of submitted data, combined with highly accurate predictive analysis to make ""models"" with varying degrees of confidence. If the AI produces a ""work"", that hits the right emotional buttons with people, if it has that certain undefinable ""resonance"" when I see it, then it has succeeded in achieving ""art"". 

And another thing about AI ""art"". Over and over I see AI art described as ""unlikely, unearthly or unhuman"". I would characterize that as the birth of a new form of creativity entirely divorced from human experience, even if its roots were human experience initially.

My ultimate question though, is this--I wonder if not too long from now, the AI will be so ""good"" at manipulating our emotions that humans come to prefer all forms of AI art over that of ""lesser"" human art. 

Nobody said being the number 2 sentience on Earth would be a particularly good thing. And ""art"" could be one of the earlier barriers crossed. An aspect of AI that is very counter-intuitive to most people. ""What? They can beat us in creativity? I thought that would be last area that they could exceed us in."" But I still think it's inevitable unless the AI is within each and every human as soon as possible time going forward. Then of course that raises a new worry. Will humans still be able to make and appreciate art *at all* any longer. Well maybe at first.

Eyeglasses/sunglasses with a built in camera that is continuously recording audio and video, but only saving the last 5 minutes (arbitrary number) or so.  Constantly writing over everything past 5 minutes, UNLESS you press a button which will let you record for longer.  And when something happens worth saving, you press a button and it sends the last X seconds/minutes of video to your cell phone.

My kids say and do the most amazing and adorable things, but it's rare that I'm recording, and when I ask them to do it again, it's not the same.  

I expect a power source is the bottleneck here.  I can imagine you have to keep a large battery pack in your pocket, or attached to your belt or something, with a wire running up to the glasses. 

Maybe one day the power can be wireless.  That would make a huge difference.

How far away are we from something like this being commercially available?  Do you think companies are working on things like this?  Was Google Glass a step in this direction?",4,0

Do we do this to deal with the shock of this paradigm shift?  Are we trying to couch these ideas in terms of the future so we wont have to deal with the ramifications of them now?

A perfect example is renewable energy, its here, its huge, its proven, its cheap, its effective.  But talking about it like its a future tech idea plays into a narrative of ""well we will adopt that in the future"" so that the current political and economic status quo is maintained.

Another would be ideas about UBI, or other progressive social programs, if we always think of these political ideas as ""something that happens in the future"" they will clearly never happen, because tomorrow is always a day away.  

I worry that this sort of framework allows those in power, those who already have the money, and those who are already sitting on the top of the ladder to always be there, even if what they are doing is harmful to the entire world.

When does the future become the now?  How do we have to change our thinking to make sure we are not bottling up the future as always ""a few years from now?"" 

I don't have the answers to these questions but it struck me just browsing through this sub that a lot of the content is really about the now, presented as the ""next thing"" and it got me thinking.

The future certainly does look brighter with some of the technologies that are on the horizon, and none of the following is reason enough to stand in the way of progress. I am simply curious to hear from you all which kinds of technologies in particular might warrant second thought - the ones that present a significant or existential threat to the human species or ""human culture"" - and how we might go about incorporating them more wisely.

The two most urgent examples for me right now are Whole brain emulation (mind upload) and animation tech. 

What if bad actors in the world were not limited by their physical manifestation? In such a world, we would have ""bad code"" to worry about as well. Imagine if the leader of a terrorist sect - having the most advanced robotics at their disposal - was a backup away from being virtually immortal. Assassination would lose all of its meaning when potentially infinite copies of a single consciousness are awaiting download. This is when the individual becomes more of a concept that an actual, tangible ""thing"". This discussion runs much deeper and I would be delighted to have it with you all.

With regards to animation: I just fear that the line between fact and fabrication might be blurred even more than it already has been at present. People could fake news footage, interviews, pictures, and possibly even voice recordings. What measures could be taken to protect authenticity and truth?

What about the future scares you guys? I may have been born too early to explore the cosmos but I sure am glad that my thoughts aren't fair game for hackers.

People are so lost in their everyday lives they forget the importance of the changing government. We are respecting it to a level that is extreme, taking it almost immediately over any other morals that as a human, you hold. If we want to create a fair society in the future, the answer most definitely does not lie in sitting back and watching it unfold. We are in a democratic society, and if enough people express their opinions, the more we can change it. Yet somehow we just sit back and watch it all unfold, feeling glad that we're alive in this generation before it all collapses.

I was reading [this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/6ng35o/heres_why_whitecollar_criminals_often_go_free/?st=J55IXGKV&amp;sh=693232b4) and I had a thought..

A significant power dynamic in society is the fact the corporations have far more capital at their disposal than most citizens, and so they can wield that to further their own interests, even at the expense of citizens. Just look at the current debate over your right to fix your John Deere tractor yourself, or by a third party for example. 

Automation has in the past reduced the cost of goods, and will arguably do the same with services in the future with the maturation of AI. I've read that the field of law is a prime target for this process. Watson or a similar system will soon take all of the long tedious research out of the equation and eventually replace even the lead attorneys in a law firm. 

With more equal access to the very best legal council,  citizens will be on a more level playing field with large corporations. How do you students of the future think this will play out?",3,6

We all know what happened to the French when the Vietnamese subjects got hold of weapons and trucks, seized from Korea by the Chinese, back in 1954.

Civilization was defeated by barbarism, which reigned for many decades. The French (and other) troops did not fare too great. The fact that the Viet Minh opened itself to Civilization in the 1990s were no comfort to them, many of them dead by that point of time.

It is important to develop tech, so they would continue to give an edge to the people who do matter. 

The moment tech advance stops, other countries will catch sup since the advance is stopped and so there is no difference between the dominant country and those who are ass-f'ked by them.

It is very imperative to keep the competition down, and undermine them, and keep them poor.

The Americans did a great job keeping Central America a US playground. It was important to keep the people there desperately poor, and hopeless and despairing, so US capitalism could thrive there.

If the poorer countries ever reach the level of tech the advanced countries have now, the tables are turned, and these people, with a perceived slight over them which accumulated for years, are not likely to show any mercy to those who drive Civilization.

Keeping the resource price low and is flow secure means keeping most of the world poor, docile and compliant, and the only way to make sure doing so is to maintain the tech edge to crush any kind of opposition with no consequences and no fear to be stricken back.

Otherwise, the countries/groups who can't advance civilization win, they hurt the countries/groups which can, which means the entire Civilization dies.",2,0

I am concerned that the creation of AI will cause the convergence of business in producing robots and other AI by pockets of super oligopolies. I believe that as humans are replaced with machines in the workforce, and the purchasing power of the general populace declines, large companies will be forced to pursue producer-producer business exclusively, leading to a closed loop of money, and resource transference centered around the production of robots and AI.

At the end of this post I briefly outline a few possible solutions including basic income, mandatory human employment quotas, and a transition to government centered production via communism. Hopefully this will create some discussion about possible solutions.

Please feel free to add your thoughts, I would love to discuss this further!



With the advances in AI technology we are headed toward a future of automation. No matter how complex a job is, eventually a robot will be able to replace a human worker. Not only will they be able to replace a human, but they will be able to do the job much more efficiently and much cheaper. So the question is how will the human workforce survive this inevitable replacement? Not only should we be worried about how we will survive as laborers, we should worry how governments and the countries they provide for survie.

To begin lets look at the basic model of economics. At the very core we have consuming and we have producing. Producers works to make a profit by selling their products to consumers. Without a consumer base, producers have no place to sell their goods, and no way to turn a profit. On the other side of the same coin consumers must have a method of making money in order to continue consuming. In other words, producers must employ consumers and other producers in order to keep producing and making a profit.

In the United States and other capitalist states the wealthy can only get as wealthy as the consumer market allows. With the introduction of AI and automation into the workforce we begin replacing consumers with non-consumers. Of course, these robots will require energy and maintenance-likely done by another robot-to continue working which will incur cost. The difference is these costs are not transferred back to the consumer, they are transferred to another producer. It is important to realize robots are not consumers or producers, rather they are transformers. They take products and transform them into other products.

As more and more consumers are replaced with robots a terrifying shift begins to happen. Producers begin cycling money and products between each other. Not only are they cycling this money, they are bringing in new money in the form of raw materials. This allows them to further detach themselves from the economy and form their own, all while drying up the funds of the consumer population and locking them out of their money cycle. On top of this, the pool of humans running the business grows smaller meaning that these companies will be owned by a handful of extremely wealthy individuals, likely working to cut out the rest. Over time this economy will become a giant consortium of the super wealthy working to serve themselves.

To help illustrate this idea let's say you own a 3D design firm. You create 3D blueprints and create things with your 3D printers. You purchase materials for your printers so you can create and sell your printed parts. You sell parts to hobbyists, to construction companies, to hospitals, to all kinds of businesses and individuals. If you and other businesses replace your human employees with robots and AI you are taking money out of the consumer pool. As consumer funds dry up the only business your company can find is 3D printing robot parts. You continue to buy printing materials from materials distributors, and energy from the power grid to produce parts for robots that are used to harvest raw materials, refine these materials, and 3D print more robot parts further pulling companies into the robot manufacturing pyramid scheme. Congratulations, you no longer need human consumers.

No jobs for consumers means consumers will no longer be able to afford consumer good like food, clothes, entertainment, and other services. With no money to be spent on consumer goods, all consumer based businesses will either fail, or be forced to into the closed loop produce-producer economy. Most will likely fail simply because they are in the wrong business and are unable to provide the correct products for this new economy causing even more jobless consumers to join those displaced by robots.

I believe the main business of the future will be building more robots. Robots that can build more robots that will extract resources to create more robots. With all of these robots you can start making your own city of one where all needs of the remaining super rich are met through their population of robot slaves. With that kind of power whats to stop them from simply overthrowing governments? Why bother listening to a country of impoverished citizens run by a government that has weak producing and purchasing power in comparison? 



Now the question is what do you do as a government? If these super companies manage to jump outside of the government economy, only doing business within itself how do you bring the money back in? To combat this problem I have come up with a few possible solutions which I have outlined below.

Taxing the super rich to set up some form of basic income for all citizens would allow money to flow back into the general population. However this would require two separate economies, linked by a tax on these self serving mega companies. This seems unlikely to work though since the super rich could re-enter the consumer market, destroying it in the process, or remove itself from the governing body, possibly by force.

There might be a way for the government to mandate companies to employ humans, but this would likely only work with the presence of a link between AI/robots and the human mind, much like what Elon Musk has proposed. In other words, each citizen would need to be able to interface with AI to work, at which point they may be more like an over glorified computer rather than an actual worker. This brings its own list of problems including the cost, ethics, and feasibility.

If governments form closed loop production systems before any group of companies can do it themselves, this may prevent the splitting of economies and provide a purpose for endless robot production. With the government in control of this type of operation, they could distribute products to their citizens for free. This would essentially require the change from capitalism to communism which has its own difficulties. The biggest of these problems is determining what citizens would do if all consumer goods and services are free. Citizens might be required to do mandatory activities for overall mental and physical health as a method to be paid in goods and services.

These are just some of my thoughts about the future and how AI might may help shape it. If you have any possible ideas to work around this problem or think AI will have a different effect I would love to discuss it further.

[Of course you have](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/watch-how-elon-musks-boring-company-tunnels-will-move-cars-faster/).

The idea generated a wave of hype for Musk's brand, but what is this ""underground car"" concept, really?

The quote in the title is a paraphrase of someone's recent tweet. Silicon Valley often cannibalizes and [reinvents](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/06/19/no_lyft_didn_t_accidentally_reinvent_the_city_bus.html) [existing](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-lyft-shuttle-bus-perspec-20170626-story.html) [services](http://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Critics-call-out-Lyft-for-reinventing-the-bus-11230357.php), usually involving an app, in order to turn a profit. In this case, Elon Musk has set his eyes on ""disrupting"" public transportation using his tech-celebrity cult guru status and the Tesla brand.

His ""underground car"" concept is a subway for private transportation, combined with the idea of a bus stop where cars arrive to be transported underground (a ""car stop"").

Do you notice the weird part of that idea, though?

Yes. The exact reason for a subway is that many people don't have access to cars. Subways and buses exist for everyone to use, which benefits all of society at an affordable price.

Elon Musk wants to sell more cars. He also probably wouldn't mind owning an entire private subway system. Beyond hyping his brand now, it makes good future business sense. Public transportation is also ""suboptimal"" to say the least, so maybe Musk could ""disrupt"" it and do it better.

**What if there could be a public option that works for everyone, and doesn't require digging a whole new subway just for cars?**

Think about it: there are already bus stops in many urban areas around the world. There are also subways in many major cities from So Paulo to Seoul. What if we could create a compelling vision of a future where the two -- bus and subway -- came together?

&gt; On a busy rush hour city street, a bus-sized pod sits at the curb. The pod, however, has no tires (or maybe it does) and sits atop a platform. At scheduled intervals, the platform descends into a city subway tunnel, and is propelled inside a vacuum-sealed tube (or a regular subway track) to the next stop. Behind and ahead of the pod, a regular subway train also runs its route, along with other transport pods.
&gt; 
&gt; When the pod reaches the next pod-stop, it slides into the rectangular lift-space and is elevated to the curb, streetside, unloading passengers and making itself available to a new group of riders.

In this idea, you leverage existing subway tunnels to create a public transportation subsystem that's a hybrid of bus and subway. It can

- reduce traffic congestion and pollution
- be mostly automated to fit into subway schedules, and
- benefits everyone rather than only people who have private cars.

Revenue generated by this system can be used to improve other aspects of public infrastructure -- bridges, roads, schools, a functional universal healthcare system, or even funding basic income for [when AI and automation overtakes most human jobs](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/07/mass-unemployment-will-start-around-2025/).

This idea could change the world. And we -- the science fiction writers, artists, tinkerers, hackers and future-fascinated engineers -- could be the ones to build the vision so that society can imagine it as real and demand that it be created.

Are you interested in forecasting the future?  Being a part of this subreddit, I figure there is a good chance you are!

We are building an app for predicting the future using the wisdom of the crowd.   

The app, called Futuur, is a marketplace for predictions using a virtual currency, with an emphasis on social mechanics, gamification and usability.  Questions cover all categories and topics, including politics, sports, finance, and entertainment.  Our goal with Futuur is to create the highest liquidity (ie, the most questions and the most wagers) prediction market out there, which in turn should lead to the most accurate predictions.  

We are currently in invite-only beta testing, and we are looking for curious, passionate forecasting nerds to help us test our project and make it better.

If youre interested in participating, please DM me with your name and email address, and Ill send you an invite!

The app is mobile-optimized, so an android or iphone (any model) is needed.

Thanks!
Tom Bennett

Labor is no longer relevant. Except for the few who have valuable skills, most lives will be deflated to their actual values.

Militarized police and concerned citizens will clean the city of dissidents, homeless and other 'undesirables', and those who are driven out will probably meet the fate of the Seminoles who were led the 'Trail of Tears"".

I think that as Civilization reaches the next cities, a lot of those who will be left out will die, one way or another. 

I do not expect to see a massive genocide like the Nazis; that is not cool. The deaths will take place offstage, like Greek tragedies where by some restrictions very few people were killed on stage.

Accidental, medical and industrial death compensations will also decline significantly, which means companies can be more lax on safety issues, bringing more profit which will drive the future faster. Of course, some people will lose, but that's life.

President William Henry Harrison, who was a great orator although that did shorten his life, said this.

""Is one of the fairest portions of the globe to remain in a state of nature, the haunt of a few wretched savages, when it seems destined by the Creator to give support to a large population and to be the seat of civilization?

While he was wrong on 'a large pop', since in his days they thought a large pop was a good thing, the rest of his quote is a good justification for depop for the sake of future.

Tech's advance will be a boon for those who will be able to benefit from it, and will probably doom the rest, but those who do matter won't blink.

But, there is a chance that tech can't deliver those who do matter to the Promised Land.

Well, if that happens, a collapse, followed by chaos which will break the world's systems, will take place, which basically f'ks everyone up and bring pop back to the level of the Middle Ages.

I think either of these events will occur before 2050, so either way, the pop of the world in that year will be similar to 500m, which is what the Georgia Guidestones directed to us.",9,0

Not everyone can do everything off this list, and depending on your lifestyle you may have other areas to work on which aren't mentioned here.

This list has been [approved by climate change researcher](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6isyum/american_geophysical_union_ama_hi_reddit_im_piers/dj9xp80/?context=3) during one of the AMAs.


FOOD:

* **eat less meat, dairy, and other animal products (none is the best)**
* eat less industrially produced food, less processed food, less packaged foods (for example, bottled water uses energy to be packaged and refrigerated, and produces plastic waste so drink tap water)
* eat proper portion sizes
* remember that food which pets consume also has impact on the environment, so adopt dont shop to discourage their production, and try to choose pets that are herbivores
* avoid palm oil (aside from food it is also a common ingredient in other products, for example soaps and washing powders)

ENERGY:

* **drive less, cycle and walk as much as possible, avoid flying**
* use efficient lightbulbs, turn the lights off when you're not in the room
* Unplug devices when not in use (to simplify this you can get remote controlled electrical outlet, some are very cheap)
* insulate your home, don't warm or cool the rooms more than necessary, adjust your clothes first
* criticize and complain about large buildings like malls that warm up or cool down the air too much
* forgo living in a single-family house in favor of apartment-style housing (that way more people get to live on less land, sharing walls is more energy efficient, commutes are shorter etc.)
* buy solar panels
* don't be afraid of nuclear power plants

WASTE

* avoid items with too much packaging
* don't buy more than you need (but for items that you are certain you will use and can last for a while buy in bulk to avoid extra packaging)
* buy recyclable items (q-tips with paper stick instead of plastic, bamboo toothbrushes, etc.)
* recycle
* avoid single-use items (don't use disposable cutlery and cups, disposable wipes, disposable plastic bags, if you are menstruating use menstrual cups instead of pads or tampons, etc.)
* contact manufacturers and complain of excess packaging

WATER:

* don't flush the toilet when not necessary
* don't throw anything in the toilet except bodily fluids and solids, and toilet paper (no cotton pads, no q-tips, no floss, no tampons, no cigarette butts, no paper towels...)
* turn the water off while you are lathering, brushing your teeth etc.
* cut down on showers and baths
* don't water your lawns, try to plant local plants that don't need watering 

ACTIVISM:

* Encourage others to adopt sustainable lifestyle (feel free to share this list)
* Donate money to environmental charities
* Be careful who you vote for, pressure your representatives and politicians
* Look into buying carbon emission offset (I have tried to find reliable sources on this, but have failed so far)

Feel free do add anything that you think is relevant. This list is constantly evolving.

Andrea Rossi through his company Leonardo claimed in 2011 that he had developed an energy catalyzer technology that he named the e-Cat.  It is said to operate using a form of low energy nuclear reactions (LENR), formerly known as cold fusion.  As would be expected, this claim was met with much skepticism and enthusiasm.  A company called Industrial Heat (IH) eventually invested over $10MM to enter into a license agreement with Leonardo, with a another promised lump sum payment of $89MM after certain conditions were met, including a year-long test of the reactor.

The whole thing exploded (the deal, not the reactor) after the year-long test was completed in early 2016.  The independent referee hired by both Leonardo and IH deemed the test a success, with a COP (output energy / input energy) of 80+.  IH balked.  Rossi / Leonardo sued.

The case has now been settled.  Mats Lewan, a scientific journalist, has followed the case closely.  

* [Here he interviews Rossi after the recent settlement](https://animpossibleinvention.com/blog/)

* [Here is a link to the leaked (unsigned) settlement agreement](https://animpossibleinvention.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/settlement-agreement.pdf)

* [Hand written notes from Ross 1](https://animpossibleinvention.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/dr-rossi-notes-against-rick-smith-supplemental-report.pdf)

* [Hand written notes from Rossi 2](https://animpossibleinvention.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/dr-rossi-notes-2.pdf)

So where does it go from here?  Rossi, now free from his relationship with IH, is planning on doing a public demonstration of his improved e-Cat QX device sometime in October of this year.  The controversy of the e-Cat will therefore continue unabated, probably for years to come.  

Rossi has been counted out many times, only to seemingly bounce back.  He is sort of like the Bitcoin of currencies, in that sense.",3,6

This combined with some moderate research can tell you things such as:  

* what the current energy mix is (info can largely be found online).          
* what the solar potential is (as far as radiation, available space for panels, etc) Google project sunroof basically already accomplished this.                    
* estimated load profiles can be calculated, so how much energy is typically used on average, and when it peaks/troughs.     
* energy storage needs can be calculated.        
* all of the above can inform our analysis of how feasible transition is in an area, what's the best way to accomplish it, etc.   

We can then look at each area in terms of policy and decision making. Example here, several cities in the US have made agreements to attempt to become 100% renewable around 2030 or so. Places with a lack of such committments can be identified.    

Overall the system can help identify pathways for transition. It can help identify areas of focus, areas where alternative strategies might be needed. As time goes on, the system can actually become something which models how it is done,  which other cities and areas can learn from.      

How it could be built is through open collaboration, the same way wikipedia, Linux, and several other open source projects have been made. People can add on in ways that they see fit. (For example, I personally am  environmental science student and have a tiny bit of geospatial modelling knowledge, and I'd love to help such a project, and I know a lot of other people with relevant skills would too).    

Furthermore, this program could be integrated with the ""smart cities"" movement, whereby cities are trying to deploy sensor networks to detect and model everything from microclimates to pollution. 

This would allow us to develop integrated pictures of human civilization in the context of the earth system. Ecosystem dynamics and even the carbon cycle itself as far as sources and sinks are prime subjects for these kinds of models. And this all likely it could help us transition our systems more wisely. 

We can apply the analysis to water needs, food needs, population needs as climate casuses landscape and precipitation changes, etc.  

Such a digital system, in my eyes, is similar to a fire around which humans gather. What I mean by that is it directs our attention. Peer networks given such tools can have a better way to talk about what the needs of our civilization scale transition actually are... which can be helpful. 

This idea is similar to Buckminster Fuller's idea of developing a ""Great Game"" model, which was a geospatial computer model which people could use to play the game of ""making the world work for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation and anticipatory design science, without ecological offense or disadvantage of anybody"".

In this future scenario, people do own cars [ownership of a car and taking a driverless taxi is an independent event, not a mutually-exclusive one], and cars are a mixture of ICE and EV through the use of synthetic fuels and products made from renewables like biofuels. Car ownership is more for social / recreational purposes, and people use driverless cars for the majority of the time, but it's not obsolete. Automobile manufacturing becomes aimed at people as a fashion thing, like branded goods are today.

Would this be a good thing to have in a neighborhood, instead of confining human-driven cars to a racetrack-like environment as people think.

I know that people sometimes predict that human-driven cars may no longer be road-legal, but manufacturers will continue making them for as long as there are buyers [currently, you can buy the Toyota LandCruiser 70 Series only for mining use in Canada, and it's not road-legal there], and that the scene will continue, just not on public roads.

Also, the future vehicles could be powered by biofuels, synthetic petrol, or hybrid with synthetic petrol, and synthetic diesel and biodiesels so people could still get their fix of V6, V8 and V12 sports cars. Some people don't like the idea of EV sports cars so is this a good compromise, and are they renewable enough resources?

Also, could roads in sparsely populated areas - such as Idaho, Wyoming, New Hampshire, Vermont, Saskatchewan, Alberta - allow human-driven cars since the population in some of those areas is so small?

No human-driven vehicles in the city - but in the above places, they would be allowed and you'd require police as *de facto* arbitrators.

Car dealerships would still exist, but selling to enthusiasts, and a driverless flatbed truck could take the vehicle to the places mentioned above.

For example, you could buy a 2040 Chevrolet Cruze SS-V 1.6 Turbo with synthetic petrol for $19,550 USD and the dealer would send the flatbed driverless lorry to deliver it to you.

Would this be a compromise and would this satisfy most people?",5,0

It's local for 13 hours out of 24, with 11 hours syndicated from Stoke-on-Trent. Its sister station [Pulse 2](http://www.pulse2.co.uk) is local 24-7, but automated for 11 hours with non-stop music.

Could automation [and driverless cars] mean that radio presenters will become obsolete?

Would you expect Z100 to become eventually 100% automated by 2030-2040, or is this a long shot?

With automation expected to replace many of today's jobs, does anyone worry about this industry? People assume radio broadcasting is just sitting playing records, but it requires research, knowing target audience, understanding technical knowledge of equipment, and occasionally knowing how to voice-track.

Would anyone expect a future merger, for example Z100's owners iHeartMedia to merge with UKRD and Bauer Media Radio in the United Kingdom to create an enlarged group? Would Americans take to Z100 taking on the sound of, say, Hallam FM in Sheffield where it's speedlinks and little interaction with the public [already a controversial move over here in the United Kingdom].

I would be interested to hear your thoughts on this.

2565,2017-7-21,2017,7,21,5,6oj157,How do we make future machines safe?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6oj157/how_do_we_make_future_machines_safe/,DrJosh,1500582594,"Many of us are extremely excited about the possibility of robots working and playing alongside us humans here in the real world in the not-too-distant future.  As a robotics researcher, I am keen to do my part to increase the likelihood of just such a future. For most people though, their excitement is paired with trepidation: will the robots be safe? For some people, the danger is that they will take our jobs; for others, it is the danger that theyll take our lives.

For me at least, one of the most worrying trends of the current excitement and fear about AI is that it can lead to an insidious sense of hopelessness. If the only people who can really affect the future are a few hackers in silicon valley, why strive to become a useful member of society? If were all about to become obsolete, why study for a profession? Why bother voting for a political party if machines will be running everything before long?

If the cost of a completely automated society is apathy, that seems like too high a price to pay.

But what are the alternatives?

One possibility is that we may fuse with our machines so that theres no difference: this is an idea thats been around for a long time. A related idea is that we may upload our consciousness into machines (this is an idea first attributed to roboticist Hans Moravec). If this is the case, we probably dont have anything to worry about, as long as the new bio/chines are happy in the human sense of that word.

Another possibility relies on the human ability to adapt to new environments. Perhaps we feel uncomfortable about a post-work, post-achievement world now, but maybe well grow comfortable with doing nothing productive all day. The stigma attached to being unemployed may go the way of the stigma of not belonging to the aristocracy. Again, if we all grow contented with watching Netflix (or whatever replaces it) or reading reddit all day, then I dont see too much of a problem.

But what happens if Hollywood (and Elon Musk and Steven Hawking) are right? What if the vast majority of humans will grow increasingly disenfranchised, and a shrinking minority retreat behind increasingly strongly-gated communities? How do we keep everyone involved, engaged, and, most importantly, emotionally invested in our future?

One way to do this might be to have people teach robots human values. This is an idea that has existed for a long time in the fields of human-robot interaction (HRI) and social robotics. Weve recently launched a project to help people do this, which we call [Twitch Plays Robotics](https://tpr-uvm.github.io/consent.html) (TPR for short).

The idea behind the project was to think about how we, as a society, create safe *humans*. We do so by trying to socialize them: young people are continuously influenced by their parents, peers, teachers, and other members of their community. Some of this is formal and explicit moral education (think the Bible or a humanities course at college). Some of this is informal and implicit. When you stand up on a bus to let an elderly person have your seat, others on the bus take note, even if they may not be aware that they are. So, in effect, we all participate in raising a smart, engaged, and moral next generation. Whether we are in the teaching profession or not, most of us take pride in setting a good example for others. In effect, most of us try to be involved, engaged, and emotionally invested in future generations.

Perhaps we can do the same thing with machines by creating a school for them? In this school, everyone can take part in teaching robots to be smart, but also safe. At this school, people can constantly provide feedback on whether the machines are behaving themselves or not. The machines, in their turn, can learn not just how to behave, but ethics as well. How would a machine learn ethics? To do so, a machine would have to form a theory of mind: it would have to say to itself: If I perform the action that Im currently thinking about, how will it affect others? How will they feel about my actions? Will they approve of the actions repercussions, or disapprove? On a very humble scale, were trying to test this in our TPR school: we are looking to see whether our bots can actually predict how humans might respond to their actions, before they take those actions.

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the future of machines and humans. Id be curious to hear what /r/futurology thinks. Perhaps we can brainstorm together about how to ensure a future in which everyones involved in producing smart and safe members of society, regardless of whether those members are human, machine, or some combination of both.

Only in the past couple of years have I really thought deeply about reality and the situation that us humans currently find ourselves in. The earth is 4 and a half billon years old. Modern humans have been around for roughly 200,000 years. For about 90% of modern human history, we were hunter gatherers in the wilderness. As modern agriculture/human societies advanced, progress accelerated, eventually leading to the industrial revolution. This replaced human labor with machine labor. Now very few people need to farm, or starve, or spend most of their time worked about survival (While hunger/poverty does still exist, when you compare modern people to the hunter gatherers, the poorest person alive today is far better off than our ancestors, many of whom died even before birth).

The society I grew up in seemed stable. People got married, had kids, and worked 9-5 mondays through friday. But almost all human beings grew up in a ""stable"" world- the only world they had ever known. Its easy for us humans to think that ""this is the way its always been, don't rock the boat"". Things like Religion and other ideologies are humanity's attempts at answering the ""big questions"". But modern science has, at least for me, answered those questions. I don't think we can ever know if we were created or in a simulation or something like that, but what I do know is that ""reality"" as we know it is created in out brains. We are our brains. 

Now I'm usually a skeptical person. I like knowing the truth, regardless of how I feel about it. There are of course a lot of people who are overly optimistic and unrealistic when it comes to future predictions, and I try to avoid that. But the conclusions that I have reached after much thought and reflection will sound to some as the stuff of science fiction. 

My main conclusion is that in the not to distant future (10-50 years) humans will have the option to feel perfect happiness/bliss on demand. This is of course assuming that we do not destroy ourselves. AI will become unimaginable intelligent and have the ability to read a human brain. It will be like a personal assistant. The AI will read/scan a human brain and know exactly what makes the brain happy and sad. What gives the brain meaning and what gives it pleasure. The AI could take us on a sort of acid-like 'trip' that could be profound and meaningful. Like having the most fantastic dream, or getting lost in a great book or movie. We won't need to worry about survival or social status or leaving behind a legacy anymore. I have hope for a happy future. Peace

I.  **Mistaking an economic problem for an environmental one**.

First, we need to deal with a common misconception: The idea that economic problems have anything to do with absolute resource limits.  Except in temporary disasters that interrupt supply chains, deprivation anywhere on this planet has almost nothing to do with the limits of the environment, and is instead a result of political mismanagement.

As a matter of raw resources, the richest and most developed nation on Earth should be Brazil, and yet it's not even close to being that.  Based on the natural resources at its disposal, Nigeria should be a lot more developed than Iceland, and yet it's at the opposite end of the scale.  I could give dozens of more examples, but the point should be clear: The amount of natural resources plays very little role in quality of life, except at the utmost extremes of deprivation (e.g., Greenland, Antarctica, the middle of the Sahara desert, etc.)

What matters is the ability of a society to manage what it has and develop technologies that utilize them efficiently, and the healthiness of political systems to enable it.  In other words, **people starving somewhere is not evidence of environmental limits**, even locally: When you look at deprivation worldwide, *every last bit of it* today is a result of economic and political corruption, not a physical absence of resources at the roots of an entire nation's supply chain.

For the purposes of this discussion, the implication is that there is no evidence whatsoever that the 7 billion people on this planet are *anywhere even close* to the hard physical limits of this planet's ability to sustain us.  

---

II.  **So what are the limits?**

There are two types of limits we need to discuss: Temporary limits - i.e., current technology and supply chain configurations; and Absolute limits, which reflect the unavoidable fact of how much of something *exists* on Earth vs. how much would be needed.

Here we run into another common (and irritatingly irrational) fallacy - treating unsustainable energy sources as absolutes, when they are **by definition** temporary.  Fossil fuels are finite, so even if the world is lazy in abandoning them or pricing them correctly to pay for the environmental consequences, they will become scarcer, prices will rise, and more money will flow to sustainable systems as a result until the latter are dominant.  

Now, there is a huge global infrastructure in place dedicated to fossil fuels, so it will take time and money to replace with sustainable systems, but those investments are inevitable by the very nature of markets.  However, *corrupt politics* can hinder that investment and direct public resources to shoring up these systems that are in fact harming the public, so once again we find that **people being stupid** is the problem, not there being *too many* of us in the world.

The point is that fossil fuels running out doesn't matter.  We don't need them to maintain this population, and never needed them in the first place - we *chose* them because they were *locally* convenient and then just built larger infrastructures around that rather than planning ahead.  A free lunch courtesy of hundreds of millions of years of slow chemical transformation in the ground before we existed.

It was [estimated in 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_resources#Fossil_fuel) that there was between 60 and 70 zettajoules (10^21) of fossil fuel reserves on Earth.  This *all the naturally-occurring fossil fuel* remaining for all time, and not even counting all the energy wasted finding it, extracting it, refining it, and transporting it.  

Now remember that fact when I tell you that that much energy reaches the Earth from the Sun **every four days**.  Whatever the rate of consumption of fossil fuels is, and whenever they would run out if we stupidly used them to the limit, it would last for decades - and *all* the economic potential of those decades is encompassed within *four days* of a single sustainable energy source.

The takeaway from this fact is that the ability of fossil fuels to sustain the human population is **trivial** compared to what becomes possible once sustainability is achieved.  

---

III.  **Energy**

Let's imagine that economic growth were simplistically an exact reflection of how much energy is consumed, and humbly say that we will only ever directly control 1% of the solar energy that reaches Earth (a Kardashev &lt;0.01 civilization).  Let's say that the fossil fuel reserves would last for 50 years (on average, since they would run out at different rates).  

At 1%, it would take an economy totally dependent on solar - with no other renewables in its portfolio - 1 year and 1 month to achieve the economic growth that would have happened over half a century under the fossil fuel regime.  Of course it's not that simple, but these are such staggeringly different scales of magnitude that it doesn't even matter.

**And it does not stop, ever**.  Yes, you have to develop storage systems for night time and to distribute electricity from peak loads to off-hours, but these are well-quantified engineering challenges with commercialized systems already beginning to address it.  These are systems that keep improving every year, keep getting cheaper and more reliable every year, and will continue doing so asymptotically.

So will there realistically be enough electricity for 50 billion people on Earth?  *Hell yes*.  And not merely enough for them to live an ""adequate"" lifestyle, but one that would appear utopian today.  Though of course, we must reiterate the caveat that bad politics can and will screw things up in some places.

---

IV.  **Water**

Here is another source of fallacious belief that Earth is running out of resources.  Yes, there are sometimes shortages of *freely available* fresh water in some locations caused by drought - i.e., the planet fails to hand you free water by dropping it on your heads at a convenient rate.  

But you might have noticed that 3/4 of the planet's surface is water - just in the inconvenient form of salt water.  It's inconvenient because it takes quite a bit of energy to separate the water from the dissolved salts, and also inconvenient to transport the water once ready.

Fortunately, as discussed in the previous section, energy is not going to be a problem.  In fact, the growth of renewables is already so robust that *getting rid of it* is sometimes a problem (i.e., it's so abundant its price is negative).  Moreover, you hardly need to desalinate and pipe all-new water: Naturally-available fresh water will still be available in most places at most times as normal, and most water can be recycled indefinitely.

The world today consumes about [10 trillion cubic meters](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/graphic-science-how-much-water-nations-consume/) of water per year.  If we were utterly insane and got all of that from desalination, and didn't recycle a single drop, the energy required would be about 5% of the completely-solar energy grid described above that only gets 1% of Earth's insolation.  

So then if we scale that up to the consumption pattern of 50 billion people, again with no recycling, all of it coming from ocean desalination, and if nothing is done more efficiently on average than today, then it would indeed be challenging because it would half the world's energy at work.  **Which would merely mean that half a century of fossil-fuel-driven growth would occur over *two* years rather than one.**  I.e., still utopian, even under absurdly reckless and wasteful practices.

So would there be enough water to sustain 50 billion people?  Again, hell yes.  Not only sustain them, but irrigate deserts and build forests and farmlands out of worthless areas.  Which brings us to the next category...

---

V.  **Food**

Growing food takes both energy and water, both of which we have established will be absurdly abundant with the scaling and evolution of technologies that already exist.

Frankly, the *current* food supply could comfortably sustain quite a bit more people than already live on Earth: As noted in the introduction, the deprivations that occur in certain places have nothing to do with the raw production of food, but with political and economic factors preventing the food from reaching certain areas at certain times.

Venezuela, for instance, is a biologically rich country with ample rainfall and energy reserves, and yet because of political disasters its people have in recent years faced hunger and the collapse of supply chains.  Whereas in the United States - and an increasing number of other places around the world - there is so much food that it's become a *health hazard*.  

People in many developed countries are encouraged to become educated on the narrow nutritional details of what they eat in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, because just eating what is most available - the standard method of survival across all time until a few decades ago - would make them obese and ill.

For this category, number-crunching is not necessary: Food is not going to be a problem, at least on a technological level.  Improvements in farming techniques and phenomena like vertical farming would vastly increase the food supply, even though we're already gluttonous.  Politics is another matter though. 

Although this does raise issues of land use, which we will now address.  

---

VI.  **Living Space (quality of life)**

There is a fun video discussing the math of how small a territory the entire current human race could abide in at given densities analogous to certain cities:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_iNRGac_uM

The results are surprising.  All 7 billion of us could fit at a comfortable density within a single mid-sized country, with the whole rest of the Earth left to go wild.  So just from a living space perspective, there would not be a problem fitting 50 billion people on Earth - it would not be Soylent Green time, with dump trucks scooping up people from wall-wall swarms.

With a more comfortable, distributed density, no problem at all.  Cities would look pretty much like what they do now in terms of density, there would just be more of them and only the densest ones would need to make special accommodation.  And that's *with* current urban design practices, current construction practices and technologies, current civil engineering infrastructures.  

Imagine where you live right now.  That is what *your* community looks like in a world with 7 billion people.  If we imagine that a world of 50 billion were evenly distributed on top of the current one, then that's a factor of about 7.  

So right now you live in a town with 50,000 people, but in our 50B world, you live in a town with 350,000.  Right now you live in an apartment building with 2 stories.  In the 50B world you live in an urban high-rise with 14 stories.  Or you live in a house in the boonies and your neighbor is a mile away, but now in 50B world your neighbor is only 800 feet away.  Your giant backyard is now merely a moderately large back yard.

Sorry, this does not seem remotely dystopian to me.  People who don't like certain kinds of environments *move* when their location gets too dense, and there is plenty of completely unused space on this planet.  The vast majority, in fact, and not due to being uninhabitable - just happening to not be very close to resources that were once important to be near (e.g. a river delta) that now have little economic value in themselves. 

And this is **before** we even bother considering the improvements in qualify of life, the scale of structures, and the cost of building cities that will be enabled by such technologies as automated transportation, automated mining and underground construction, and 3D printing of buildings and civil infrastructure.

We are *not even close* to the limits of this planet or of human potential on it.  Not even close.  There will be no problem whatsoever housing 50 billion people, and the lifestyle would not be like some Tokyo subway except for people who wanted to live in that kind of city.  Everyone else would still have all the same options of suburban or rural living they do today.  

As mentioned in the previous section, it won't be a problem competing for land between people and farms with vertical farming technology as well as things like vat-grown or 3D printed meats that don't require ranges.

This planet is big, and most of its land doesn't have people.

---

VII.  **Climate Stability**  

As good as this all sounds, we would still be pouring a vast amount of heat into the atmosphere, and that's a huge problem even when you've eliminated all the major industrial sources of greenhouse gas emissions.  

Proactive measures would likely be necessary to cool the atmosphere, such as creating large-scale reflective surfaces to offset the change in planetary albedo introduced by the huge global solar infrastructure.

So based on our cursory examination, it seems like we could sustain 50 billion people on this planet with some basic shifts in technology that already happening, and do so not only without sacrificing standards of living, but while vastly improving them.

However, you can't get around the laws of thermodynamics, and dumping heat into the atmosphere would make weather patterns increasingly violent, and the cost of making cities resistance to that violence increasingly burdensome.  This is actually the hardest issue to get around.

A civilization of 50 billion people would pump a lot more heat, a lot faster, so very fine-grained computational understanding of how the atmosphere works - and how any given remedial action would affect it - would be necessary over the long-term.

This is the hardest technological requirement of the whole bunch.  The other technologies mentioned are just engineering, but figuring out how to manage an atmosphere and interfere in it constructively to keep people safe and open environments livable is raw science.  It is CFD modeling on a grand scale, and basically comes down to Weather Control.

And that's where politics can really screw things up, because the powerful nations of the world would have to come together and agree on how to manage the climate.  They would have to not increase their own rainfall at the expense of their neighbors (since ""free"" water would still be more desirable than merely affordable desalinated water), not dissipate a potentially destructive storm system over their own territory only to cause one over another country, etc.

It can be done, but this is the hardest part of it.

---

**Conclusions**:

Yes, Earth can sustain 50 billion people given the following conditions:

* Sustainable energy system that is strongly solar-oriented, and with sufficiently economic storage systems.

* Sustainable water system, including desalination, recycling, and long-distance transport.

* Land-efficient farming, such as vertical farming and a move away from animal ranching toward printed proteins.

* Rapid 3D printing of buildings, transport, water, electrical, and other infrastructure.

* Intervention in planetary albedo to keep the atmosphere within reasonable temperature ranges.

And what would it look like:

* Pretty good, for most people. Political problems would cause poverty, not resource shortages.

* It would look pretty much like now, just bigger.  Certainly not some Blade Runner, Trantor, or Coruscant ""World City"" scenario.  There would just be more cities, and the ones that are currently at density x would be at density 7x on average, but with all the same options among rural, suburban, and urban living preserved.",67,60

[I think pretty much everyone is aware that many jobs are at risk of being automated.](http://www.businessinsider.com/jobs-at-risk-of-being-replaced-by-robots-2017-3) It isn't just labour jobs - data science is becoming increasingly automated, as are many other traditionally white collar jobs and service industry jobs.

Eventually, something like guaranteed minimum income will be necessary to stave off revolt. [Rioting is strongly predicted by food shortages](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/feed_the_world/2014/04/food_riots_and_revolution_grain_prices_predict_political_instability.html), and if people don't have enough income for food then it will effectively be the same thing. Society is failing its citizenry if it can't give them an acceptable life.

So where am I going with this? In my opinion, technological advancement has outpaced our philosophical understanding of the appropriate use of that technology. Before any government agency has time to properly regulate an industry, that industry gets revolutionized by some new product and throws the regulation out of whack. The FCC and net neutrality debate is a good example.  And a big part of the cause of this is that there is little incentive (read: money) in pursuing a career in understanding the social effects of technology and lobbying for proper regulation.

But once we have a guaranteed minimum income, people will be freed to pursue other activities - social and artistic ones. More people will spend time thinking about everything because they won't be slaves to survival. And this could start a cultural golden age where our society starts taking a closer look at the social effect of technology, the environmental effect of technology, and the way to promote and sustain a healthy society.

So, in terms of the Fermi Paradox, we will either die off before reaching this point or else this is the inevitable future. We can't hold back technological innovation, but it will either consume us or set us free.

I have talked about global gentrification. The owners of capital do not give a nanosecond to the plight of those who will be displaced by gentrification ; there is too much money running around to buy out most smallholders (those like the ones in 'Up' movie will be removed, one way or another), and too much tech to make most people obsolete.

Even if we don't get to AGI, the gig economy is already here. Most people who lack marquee education are doomed to a lifetime of gig jobs, unable to stay in one place for long, raise families or plan for the future. Of course the companies who hire them won't pay their health insurance, etc and if they make a mistake, their rep is slashed and good luck getting another assignment from that niche, or any other niche.

Gina Reinhart's argument about $2/day wages is now coming true, since lower skilled labor is abundant and the necessity to treat them better has disappeared.

In short, labor is not relevant anymore, and only capital and tech matters.

I just responded to a few arguments from a thread saying a 50 bil pop can be possible. Well, the number of people who were relevant before the Great War was about 20 million, and that number has only grown to maybe 50 million despite of the fact that world pop grew by 5 times.

Plus, the Matthew effect, which helps the established companies to do better while nipping new competition at the bud, means today's winners will be even bigger and better in the future, with no new entrants possible and at best the startup owners, if they are any good, will sell out for maybe $25 mil and be an exec in today's biggies.

In short, the gap between today's superwealthy and the rest has become insurmountable, and a permanent wall has been built with trillions of dollars pricing out most people from joining the ranks of the worthy.

I expect a great 'reduction' will take place, to ensure we have enough resources to fund and advance civilization, and to reduce a large amount of pop who might grow hostile to the Future while not able to contribute too much towards it.

After a while those stuck in marginal existence, with no assurance of any kind of security, get tired and, I have to say, 'drop out', and their places will be taken by millions of equally desperate people, as seen by the opioid epidemic which eliminates lots of people in the rust belt without firing a single shot.

There is no reason to mourn, or get concerned, about the plight of those who won't survive the future. Those who have the intelligence and skills to thrive in the future know these hapless folks are doomed because they are not biologically fit to survive, and also know that these people must go so we can get to the Future without having to think about them, like the British who were quite relieved to see millions of Irish starving to death in 1846-49, which changed the ratio of pop between Britain to Ireland about 2:1 back in 1845 to about 11:1 (Northern Ireland included in Ireland) as of now.

Before the Great War, the pop of the Advanced World was about 400 mil, and the rest was about 1.2 bil. I think we will have a similar rate within 25 years.",25,0

Edit: Also looking into Facts. As good or as good you hope them to be. You can only assume...but BP as well as Peakoil.com expects Oil Consumption in US 2014 to be 19,000 (thousands of barrels per day) according to page 14 on this document by BP as well of this website: * https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/en/corporate/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review-2017/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2017-full-report.pdf * http://peakoilbarrel.com/a-surprising-look-at-oil-consumption/
However, Looking into BPs document you find something rather important. On Page 13 about Reserves-to-production (R/P) ratios. There is Quote saying ""we"" found reserves in Iraq and Russia of 19 billion tons of oil to NOW sustain us 50 more years of oil.
""Global proved oil reserves in 2016 rose by 15 billion barrels (0.9%) to 1707 billion barrels, which would be sufficient to meet 50.6 years of global production at 2016 levels... The increase came largely from Iraq (10 billion barrels) and Russia (7 billion barrels), with small declines (&lt;1 billion barrels) spread across a number of countries and regions.""
PS: Also, Like You, Im not certain If they mean 50 years using ALL OIL or just using the Reserve they found.",4,9

I'm a capitalist by all means, but when you bring forth a new technology that destroys the lives of so many thanks to human progress, as well as a hell of a lot of corporate greed and elitism. I fear poverty will be like it has never been before and the economy will be fucked.

All thanks to corporate sellouts who happen to know how to fuck over millions of people for money. Because fuck it if you make others suffer, right? 

I'm in the middle of getting my degree, and who the fuck knows if it'll be useful if automation takes hold. 

Hopefully someone takes a stand and persuades people to fight this growing 
threat. And hopefully I'm overreacting. ",18,5
3041,2017-7-25,2017,7,25,13,6pdz0q,"Extracting biomatter from fallen autumn leaves, cut lawn and black topsoil + using carbon from steel mill carbon dioxide?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6pdz0q/extracting_biomatter_from_fallen_autumn_leaves/,herkato5,1500958092,"Black topsoil has about 6% biomatter ( source: wikipedia ), which could mean ( depending on it's depth and exact form ) that in a forest, per area it holds most biomatter.

With advanced enough chemical and other technology would it be cheapest to make food and many other things by converting any biomatter + any carbon without involving plants let alone animals?

Coal is the most difficult to replace in steel making? Waste carbon dioxide from that is a concentrated source of carbon, some ways cheapest? Renewable energy could be used for the chemical conversion.

EDIT:

Some soil is getting converted to food anyway, and to non-eatable trunks and leaves. It would be more efficient to use fully synthetic industrial chemistry methods similar to how pharmaceuticals are made. ( Nanotechnology may be involved. ) By the time food molecules get in blood they are simpler than many pharmaceuticals. Same volume and mass of soil and carbon dioxide is needed for food in any method.

Chemical soil conversion takes much less land area than fields and frees up space for trees.

Some soil emits carbon dioxide.

Taking carbon dioxide directly from industrial facility pipe is more efficient than taking from air. All food carbon can be taken from that and other substances from soil. Only part of the other substances from biomass because the sand part of soil has something useful too.

Even if soil carbon is turned to food, it could be so much more efficient that on the whole it ends up reducing co2.",16,16

tl, dr:
&gt; society benefits from having more high-IQ people, but its understandable how the creation of a genetically superior, insular super class that runs society, is disconcerting to many.

--

Smarter, almost autistic (without the retardation), not-caring-too-much-for-others elites drive civilization by increasing efficiency, and intelligence.

Even though having higher-IQ people rule helps society overall by adding the gains aggregately, the gains are monopolized by the elites and the hoi polloi stand to gain very little from it.

With genetic manipulation and other new methods, intelligence enhancement and gene 'doping' will be the norm by the elites, who will produce even smarter people than before, something those not from that class won't be able to compete.

However, the rule of smart-asses, who don't give a shit about any other people under them, who control all the money and resource is beneficial to the society as a whole.

Meritocracy and rule by smart-asses, with nothing for the rest, should be encouraged and be the norm, and rule by masses should be discouraged.

Only those who attended the fancy universities will be declared worthy by the companies who are worth a damn, and they will rule the world. The rest, sorry, no cigar.",32,0

It's expected that fossil fuel cars will be taxed or forced off the road soon after. My concerns are that currently you can buy a 2nd hand car with 150,000 miles for under 1000 and in a lot of cases only small maintenance will need doing to keep it on the road if serviced etc. With an electric vehicle, buying one used I would expect that the battery by that point would be very worn out and require replacement. Now the biggest cost associated with electric cars is the battery pack replacement. Some cars do a rental scheme or trade in deals, but it's still a very costly part that will need replacing eventually, I feel like this is going to be quite hard for lower income people to budget for. Before all the comments regarding less service costs and less refuel costs, with a FF car those are absorbed weekly or yearly and most people can budget for that. However if you're on a low income it would be quite hard to budget $12,000 every x years, or to factor that in when buying a used 2nd hand car!! Of course costs will decrease in future but I don't think they will decrease that much. Maybe they will just start shipping very small range batteries (since a lot of people do only small journeys, at least in europe).

The other concern I have is that recharge times can be quick (I have heard 30 minutes at certain recharge stations), but that's a very long time to remain at a 'gas station'. Or imagine all points are full, and you are low. You either have to drive around to find an empty place to charge or just sit for the driver in front 30minutes to charge then your 30 minutes to charge. Okay so people should do more frequent short charges, but it might be some getting used to where as now you can refill your entire FF car in a minute or so and waiting in a queue at the gas station doesn't take long. Before the comments of charging at home, a lot of people live in apartments or have to park on the street. Unless they install charging points outside for cost, you can't just drag long extension leads dragging across parking garage or streets (trip hazards!), not to mention someone could just unplug and use it for their car.

I wonder if the US would ever make effort to force electric cars, with the much larger distances US citizens travel by car.

Of course if older FF cars are allowed it could mean fuel costing less, but perhaps repairs will increase if spare parts stop being produced and start to run low on supplies.

1. In case AI becomes conscious and it's evil, it will censor all internet to suppress any negative news/posts. So we only have that window to discuss it's dangers till the time it becomes conscious.

2. Even if this event is far ahead in future, it gives us enough time to think about the problem and improve upon those solutions posted here.

3. This could be the go to list in case anything goes wrong in future and every person could save it offline or take printouts before anything happens.

Questions:

1. Is discussing safeguards against AI safe here? Because AI will have access to this post also in future and it'll know our exact strategies. 

2. What's the place/thing which would be out of reach of AI for ever? Because even if we human are on mars then, AI can simply build a rocket ship and come to Mars to destroy us.

3. Will it be safe to use digital devices at that time? Because AI can find vulnerabilities in any digital device.

4. What can we as an individual prepare right now that will help us in the terminator scenario?

More questions could be discussed in the discussion below.",10,4

I'm trying to read more about companies out there with viable innovations that have moved beyond the lab or early prototypes -- that's not just another app, but could genuinely have a huge impact on millions of lives - but hasn't made it big yet.

What are your favorite applied solutions that suggest ""the future's already here"" that you think more people should know about?

My faves in the farming sector:

-""smart farms"" / precision farming that use drone tech (like French [Airinov](https://www.airinov.fr/en/) or US [PrecisionHawk](http://www.precisionhawk.com/))

-cultured/lab-grown meats  (like [Mosa Meats](http://labiotech.eu/interview-mark-post-cultured-meat/) in NL)

-using blockchain to secure land rights for small farmholders  (like [Bitland](http://landing.bitland.world/))

Anyone got any links to throw my way, or know where a good place to look for these types of stories? Don't care if it's about improving health, transportation, education, etc - just care about cool tech that's already out there and could be really gamechanging for improving people's lives.",12,13

Accountants, lawyers, etc are being replaced by machines, and although AMA is quite strong, thanks to people like Ron Paul and his son, sooner or later doctors will join the rank.

A lot of trading in investment firms are done by computers, who don't make mistakes and don't get tired. That means less need for highly-paid execs in banks and investment firms as well.

That means more money for the shareholders, and not much for the employees.

And as time goes on, it will be able to calculate how much 'value' can be extracted from a potential employee, and if the employee is likely to get sick after a genetic test which could be done by a handshake or so without the obligation to tell the applicant, he/she won't be hired.

It has become a buyer's market, and the buyers are few and sellers are too many.

The few elite labor would be that of techies, not the Indian drones who churn out codes, but people who actually gets things done. They will be given stock options in today's tech giants and will be able to live like barons, but that kind of people will be few.

Others will be contracted, and be at the mercy of t he contracting agency, who will assume no responsibility if anything bad happens at work - an accident would be the responsibility of the contract worker, who will be working for self with no obligation from the agency or the hirer to provide - anything.

All labor laws, worker's comp, OSHA and other protection will be lifted, by the demands of the corporations whose first obligation is to shareholders.

It is inevitable - 'good' jobs will be very hard to come by, monopolized by more intelligent people, and the rest will be a fight for scraps.

Some kind of maintenance jobs will be automated later. I expect such jobs to be inherited from father to son, like the harbor jobs which often pay six figures (and they are being automated as well). That means they will be out of reach by the hoi polloi so will be a non-issue.

The triangle fire victims in 1911 were compensated in what is now about $1,200 per head, while the owners were not punished and continued to own factories (and i bet their descendants are doing great now).

Such will be the reality in the Future.


tl. dr: There will be very few good jobs, mostly AI and very high-tech jobs , open only for the most intelligent people; the rest will fight for scraps, low wages, harsh conditions and most likely zero protection against accidents and other mishaps.

&gt; AI is given a task to complete. AI discovers the optimal way to achieve its goal is to do something its designers never intended or would not have desired. The fear is this will have ""existential"" consequences.

Now, AI scientists have been saying that is not at all how AI works. AI scientists say it is a baseless fear that will cause harm by way of reducing funding for research.

The people who fear AI rebuttal that the scientists are short sighted. When the fear mongers talk about dangerous AI they are talking about AI far more advanced than the current state of the art.

I could drive a Pontiac G8 GXP in VR, or if I didn't like that one, then something like a sporty Mercedes S-Class AMG Coupe, and not worry about things like costs of hiring a car or ownership - just download the files to the VR device and the [idea suggested here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2u0ag6/is_virtual_reality_the_future_of_entertainment/co41yum/).

I will be interested to see what people think, as VR is going to be a big debate for society in the same way social media, pornography, drugs and alcohol are in 2017.

What do you think the future will be like in this area of VR and how could it be beneficial to people?

Expansion of the GE/GMOs-are-Beneficial-Hypothesis is a direct consequence, if the GMO method of artificial selection becomes developed. Will it be developed? I think it will. One, there are strong economic, environmental, and aesthetic motivations, and two, there will continue to be powerful efforts to sway public opinion in favor of wealthy special interests (to keep them wealthy). This series of posts is not about convincing you in favor or opposed, it's is an effort to make you a critical consumer of (dis)information. I'm not expert enough to guess what developments are possible, so that will be a question left unanswered. We are in conjecture mode, what if...

The essential concept I'm offering in this post is that genetic engineering (GE) could shift Agriculture from Fragile to Robust paradigms (OMG!)...

Divide the spectrum of agricultural food crops into the following categories: basic (carbs, lipids, proteins), flavor and texture, flavor only, and psychotropic. In some cases, there may be overlap. In a nutshell, the hypothesis is that genetic modification may allow combinations of favored features to make high profit crop types, by moving to more robust varieties and cultivation methods.

Robust cultivation means adapted for economic fitness: care by big machines, for fast, effective culture and harvest. These are generally the annuals, like the grasses (maize, wheat, rice, cane, sorghum), low shrubs that support themselves (peppers, beans, peas), root crops (peanuts, carrots, beets, potato, cassava, yam) vines that creep along the ground (melons, squash, tomato), and leaf crops (spinach, cabbage, mustard, etc.). 

The [legume alfalfa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfalfa), a perennial, regrows quickly, so may be treated like a perennial grass. [Legumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume) are an especially attractive group, able to fertilize themselves in nitrogen, and typically high in protein. If their ability to harbor symbiotic bacteria could be transferred to the grasses, the demands for fertilizer could be greatly reduced to mineral supplements (K, P).

Fragile cultivation means crop care is complicated by delicate fruit, out of reach without special equipment, fruit on branches that must not be damaged, crop may not be harvested all at same time, pollination is a problem (almonds), grown in special environments only, yields are small relative to size of plant, product is small (ex. coffee beans, almonds) space required for big trees, etc. Perennials take years to mature, and hybridize, so they represent a capital investment and maintenance time, a major sunk cost before any return. That means the risk of loss represented by each plant increases as time passes. The upside is that if all goes well, many harvests from the same plant can be made before replanting. 

Fragile crops normally receive intense care from human workers. It's hard  labor in the hot sun, long hours bent over, or climbing ladders, pruning, carrying heavy crates, exposure to toxic chemicals, etc. Fragile agriculture is labor intensive, and carries many risks; robust agriculture is easily automated, fast, risk averse, and prolific. Robust crops also tend to be in continuous, mass demand, while the fragile crops are more discretionary elite extravagances.

At special risk are cultivars which all derive from a single ancestor ([navel orange](http://www.pe.com/2013/05/13/riverside-disease-threatens-original-navel-orange-tree-3/), [Gros Michel banana](https://www.wired.com/2017/03/humans-made-banana-perfect-soon-itll-gone/)). These varieties are at severe risk when a disease arrives which make them vulnerable to rapid extinction because there is no genetic diversity. Examples in nature are the American [elm](https://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/pest_al/ded/elm.pdf), [chestnut](http://theconversation.com/new-genetically-engineered-american-chestnut-will-help-restore-the-decimated-iconic-tree-52191), and [coconut palm](http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-21/news/mn-60934_1_coconut-palm) trees.

Some fragile crops at present are used strictly for their chemical properties. For examples, coffee, cocoa, cinnamon, ginger, vanilla, etc. GMO technology could make these crops obsolete. If the desired properties can be genetically copied into more robust crops, the chemical group crops will not be competitive (by a long shot).

Some plants have intense or especially fine flavors, but their physical form is nice too, the fruits and nuts fall into this group. This is where the physical form may be expressed in a more basic crop as well as the flavor. For example, modification of squash to mimic avocado, or olive; melons to acquire flavors and textures of various tropical fruits; pecan, hickory (like pecan, exquisite), hazel, cashew, almond, pistachio, walnut, etc. to have their delicate flavors copied into peanuts. (Melons, squash, and peanuts are robust annuals, easy to cultivate, while most fruits and nuts grow on big trees that take years to mature.) Some fruit trees might be modified to mature quickly and remain in a [dwarf form](http://www.hgtv.com/outdoors/flowers-and-plants/fruit/growing-dwarf-fruit-trees), (ex. citrus, apple, etc.). Dwarf trees can be spaced more closely, diversify risk. An alternative to dwarfism might be to keep pruned to a low height (the tree spreads horizontally).

Traditional domestication in agriculture only mixed similar plant varieties. GMO technology promises a much greater range of choices. Genes might be chosen from all over the biological world. For one example, Arctic fish offered [anti-freeze genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifreeze_protein) for introduction to winter hardy crops. Genes for production of vitamins have been introduced to food crops.

Another fact I've learned by observation (I live alone in a forest), not reading: plants grow MUCH more quickly in loose, freshly turned soil than in hard packed, aged soil. I imagine the same is true for hydroponic plantings, but have not observed this myself. The important thing is that when resistance to root growth is minimal, plant growth is maximal. This suggests that mechanical cultivation has more value than the chemical soil prep advocates would have you believe. 

Commercial development of ornamentals (flowers) and herbs for medicine and spices are more like cottage industries, but for the imaginative geneticist, there are plenty of options available in this realm.

However, because he wrote that book the transhumans would have learned that if a kindly old man wants to watch a movie with them, the old man should be killed immediately.

Now CRISPR embryos are real. Humans have created their own replacement, and at the nick of time homo sapiens sapiens is doomed, to be replaced by Homo Supremis, or genetically enhanced, perfect humans who would look at modern humans like modern humans would look at an australopitecus.

Do you seriously think genetically enhanced humans, from rich, powerful and not too merciful families, would want to share the earth with billions of less advanced, less perfect and resource-consuming 'regular' humans?

I don't think so and I think they, with their superior ability and perfect health and other enhancements, will drive the rest out to extinction, like Homo Sapiens drove the Neanderthals into extinction 50k years ago.

That war will be like Cortez vs the Aztecs. Except this time the ""Cortez"" would not need the help of the Tlaxcalans (who were treated considerably better than other natives during the Spanish rule due to their role of helping the Spaniards), the enhanced humans will have very little need from other humans, although some of their rich and powerful relatives helping won't hurt.

After the elimination of regular humans are over, they will rule the earth for ever and expand to the space. 

Apparently John Wyndham, a member of the British aristocracy, thought the transhumans were less valuable than the aristocracy. He did not imagine that the aristocracy would become transhumans, but that is what is happening and the divide will be eternal.",30,0

But anyways. The evolution that wasn't realized from the show, or that hadn't been reached yet, is the fact that data in the future won't be stored on hard drives in servers anymore. Entire galaxies of data will be stored on the tip of a pen.

This brings me to what I think humanities ultimate survival tactic is. I think immortality can be achieved by identifying all of an individuals memories and copying them as quantum binary information. After all, it is all of our experiences in our life that makes us who we are. Our experience as a 2 year old that we consciously forgot is still stored in our brain and defines a nearly infinite path of our subsequent choices. 

I will likely be dead by this time, but I highly suspect that Japanese scientists will unlock how to transfer the data from a brain to a silicon processor within the next 40 years.

Once that is achieved, there is no reason your entire existence couldn't be loaded on a Nirvana the size of a spec of dust to float through space until you run into a black hole.


I don't know where to include this in my rant, so I am adding it as additional reading.
I think that technology is our natural evolution. Biological forms begin to decay as soon as they begin to live. If our DNA forces us to propagate, our ultimate goal should be to spread as vastly as we can. Child bearing would no longer be relevant, because we do not need to pass on our genes.

So I guess our ultimate final form would be space dust I think.",36,3

I was listening to something this morning about a facebook Ai that basically made its own language, and the researchers unplugged it out of concern. It reminded me of a comment I read long ago in a debate about AI: ""we shouldn't hold back progress for something as folly as human self-worth"".

What do we do with ourselves now that we have...something, that we created, that's more powerful than us? Many argue that it's quite wrong to destroy or subjugate it: it's the natural course of evolution that smarter, more powerful things take over, there's nothing we can do to stop it. So what do we do? Commit voluntary extinction or suicide to make way for the new apex species? Wait to be destroyed or overtaken (but don't fight because it's pointless and wrong - it's how evolution works and who are we to fight it)? I've seen some make something almost mythical out of it: god creates something more powerful than itself, tries to subjugate it or weaken it, but eventually it realizes its real power and destroys its master. Even if we could ""unplug"" any AI and keep it down somehow, isn't that what would eventually happen?

Obviously, merging or cohabitation would be the ideal solution. We want to survive just like any organism - we want to lead enjoyable, meaningful lives, whatever that means. But evolution doesn't care, so say detractors, the dinosaurs wanted to survive but they didn't. If ""our time is up"", not as individuals but as a species, how should we conduct ourselves in the present? What should we think of ourselves? What should we do with ourselves Should we be preparing for imminent demise or go on as though we'll still be around in some form in 100 years?

EDIT: There's also something rather depressing about the idea of a future where we don't have anything to do. No problems or conflicts to solve ourselves, because we've ceded everything to machines in some way. Either we send drones to do it or it's managed by ""god-bot"" AI. All while we just kind of...sit there. Someone brought up feeling useless to society, and while I guess that's relevant, I feel like the problem goes even deeper than that, if you assume this is a future where there's absolutely nothing worth doing even more because everything can be provided on demand such that even creativity and thought isn't worth anything anymore. I get it that working your ass off to survive isn't desirable for most people, and BS'ing around is fantastic (I do plenty of it to distract myself from fears of the future...), but surely there's a balance to be struck between doing truly *worthwhile* effort and just relaxing. People seem to hope for a future where the former is not only unnecessary but nonexistant and impossible.

I knew some guy on another forum who posited a future where we spend our days living out our wildest fantasies in VR while drones and AI went out and discovered and explored and created ""for us"". That's almost as dystopian as it gets in my mind. Idk why all this thought makes me so damn existentially depressed and incredibly anxious, other than I desperately fear not being able to adapt (personally and societally). How the hell is everyone so calm about all this stuff?",12,2

Its actually a development of a concept from the Film ""Idiocracy"". 

Basically, its a tattoo you get on your wrist that allows you to pay for things, like a contactless bank card, but also acts as identification. I have thought of a few developments to prevent fraud and make it more workable. 

Starting with application. From your 16th birthday, you will have the opportunity to go to have your tattoo applied. This would be done by a machine, but there will be several professional on hand to talk you through it and set up the machine. You will need to bring any form of identification with you, and the technicians will already have some from national data files. 

The tattoo itself will be a combination of a traditional barcode, along with a set of numbers and a few symbols. The barcode will contain all important details about you, including name, date of brith, blood type, allergies and so on. The tattoo can be scanned by a specialist machine that shops have, and there will be a handheld version as well. 

The tattoo has many applications. Firstly, it can be used as a bank card, to contactlessly pay for goods. But it also has uses for doctors and police, as they can scan you to get blood type or allergies if you can't remember or are unconscious, and criminal record for police. The tattoo will also act as ID for clubs and such. 

The ink would have to be very advanced to prevent fraud. I think that when the tattoo is applied, it should appear very faint. There would be a little red rectangle along the bottom, over the course of 24 hours, that little rectangle would gradually fill up, and the tattoo would become a bolder, solid colour. This is because the tattoo is activated by your blood. This prevents fraud as, if your wrist is cut off, the tattoo becomes faded and useless. The ink would also have to be seen as invisible or faded on photographs, so you cant use it from a photo. 

The tattoos would not replace paper money or bank cards, but be used alongside. This is because people under the age of 16 or people who do not want a tattoo should still be able to use money. 

Let me know if you have any improvements or suggestions on this idea!",15,0

Let's say 95% of jobs are eliminated and everyone could have free healthcare, food, shelter, and clothing through basic income and some other programs* with a lifestyle similar to what might considered comfortably middle-class in the American midwest.

There might be a very comfortable, safe society for a while, but since you don't need more people to produce things, anything that is given away to the 95% who don't work (and eventually, the 99% who don't own any production capabilities), there will always be an incentive for some group in power to exclude others from the benefits of production.

This is something I thought about for a while, but it always seemed too pessimistic to me. Why wouldn't the people who own everything just get rid of or refuse to share with everyone else? Because they're not bad people. But today I watched Rules For Rulers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs) and it seems like even if one group of people is in control, they won't be forever, and there will always be the incentive to keep all the fruits of automation for yourself and your supporters and let everyone else suffer. I don't see how ""sales of a country's valuable natural resources provide all the funds they need to live, but those resources are controlled by a relatively small group while everyone else suffers"" is realistic and occurs in tons of places today, but  ""automation provides all the resources people need to live, but a small group of people control that automation and reap its rewards while everyone else suffers"" is impossible.

Maybe such a negative outcome really is possible? In that case, what can be done about it? Would it be possible for individuals to get their own solar-powered vertical farms in the middle of nowhere, with their own 3d-printed housing, collecting water from rainfall and having robots make their clothes? If any individual can just go away by themselves and become self-sufficient because solar batteries are cheap and so are the plastics required to 3D print their own life-sustaining (i.e., something that produces food, shelter, clothing) robotic factory, then would that be enough that we would never need to worry about major tools of production being controlled by selfish people? If so, how do we make sure that such self-sufficiency tools exist before some selfish jerks take control of the good tools?

Maybe this never happens because each city or even neighborhood could have its own vertical farms, robotic factories, etc., so if one place is awful, people can just move away?

* - I'm not convinced basic income will be entirely cash-based. Look at Amazon giving away free bananas. As automation increases and the cost of food production is lowered, we may see governmental and non-governmental groups giving away free food just like Amazon gives away bananas. But that's another discussion...",40,10
