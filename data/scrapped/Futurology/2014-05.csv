There's also the technology that's increasingly becoming more intrusive in our privacy/lives, for instance the social networks and google glass.

However, the data which these technologies gather is not the actual problem, but how its used, by whom and for which purpose. So it makes me wonder, what if these technologies could be used to make a more transparent government for example? could massive vigilance of the police cause a reduction in corruption. Could social networks enable cooperation between the police force and the citizens?

There already are ideas about using social networks to increase democracy. What Im talking about is that, if the surveillance state is inevitable, then let it be both-ways (reciprocal, mutual) between a government and it's citizens

Im solidwhetstone- and I am trying to change the way people get jobs online. I Have created and moderated many of the subreddits you might have used to get work such as /r/forhire, /r/chicagojobs, or /r/designjobs. I also work with redditors like /u/7oby and /u/thepoopsmith who have an equal passion to help redditors get work.

The bulletin board model of job search that demonstrated by sites like monster, dice, and indeed all benefit from a cynical job ecosystem that favors those with the jobs. I believe that the reddit model of job posting holds job posters accountable for their claims. Scams, misinformation, and other kinds of deception saturate the other job boards- most notably craigslist. Introducing a new approach:

**http://karmajobs.net** : [Here's the release post on /r/forhire](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/24ga8p/introducing_karmajobs/)

Ive been working on this idea for nearly two years. The premise is simple: Make it easy to find jobs on reddit- and change the way people look for work. I feel that job search shouldnt be filling out hundreds of online applications. So many times, we have questions about a job post- the salary, the work conditions, the exact location- and we cant get those answers because we only have the option to apply.

The internet job search model hasnt fundamentally changed in a decade- but I think reddit could be the catalyst for it. Community job search is the next evolution- and I created KarmaJobs so that we could realize it. But my team cant do anything unless KarmaJobs becomes a success. So please, come and take a look at it and if you feel like its a better solution- share it with your friends who are out of work!

If youd like to read about the features weve built into this 1.0 release, take a look at the stickied post in /r/karmajobs (and give us a subscribe if you want to get updates on new features in the future).

I believe that community job search is the future- but I cant know for sure without you.

Here's a link to the official release post on /r/forhire.

Thanks for reading and happy job hunting!

If all of the nutirents that a body needs is known, and moslty the proportions of this nutrition are quit known as well to each body type, then are we on a path to where  the construcution of food as we are familiar with, will be obsolete? I am seeing a future where there is no cooking of any sort, kitchens, restaurants, cafe's, etc will all be replaced by food only a form of nutrients in its pure form suplied in its approriate quanitity with any persons' intake.  So that food, when seen, is only in powders, oils, and water. For example, a banana could be exactly replicated to the quantity of lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, vitamins and minerals, to where the banana would now be unrecognizable but have the same nutritional value, just organized and seperated. 

A side question would be that could this and is this being utilized with 3d printing food. Especially I find this perspective useful when attempting to construct food for space travel. I understand that a company Soylent kind of does this, but not to the extent that I am trying to express. And possibly one day nutrition will be genetically integrated. But I think they are on the right track. Also this curiosity was derived from my studies with food culturally, how it varies, and how preference and familiarity comes into play when travelling the world. That food is so variant from civilization to civilization, where preference and familiarity and numerous other factors are prominent in distinguishing an areas cusisne.

Would this still be a legitimate question to ask or is this not even possible...I just find it a bit frustrating at why things vary so much from civilization to civilization, and why there can't be a universal with sustainability of nutrition and health.",9,6

Many of the students at FIRST go on to work at very influential titans of technology, or at future oriented organizations such as NASA. This documentary on FIRST Robotics is our eighth main piece in our Galactic Public Archives series in which we explore compelling visions of our future from influential individuals. So far, we've covered an interesting collection of viewpoints and topics regarding our possible future, ranging from the future of longevity, to the future of search and even the future of democracy. FIRST seemed like a natural opportunity to explore another 'puzzle-piece' of what the future might look like. And of course, the competition features Robots, which are an integral piece of any self-respecting utopian or dystopian future. What we did not realize as we started our exploration of the program was that FIRST is not attempting to be a humble building block towards the future. Although only time will tell to what degree it succeeds, it aspires to be a catalyst for much more far-reaching change.

In a society that praises the utmost competitive spirit in all the wrong ways, Inventor Dean Kamen noticed less and less youth using this spirit towards opportunities in math and science, instead aspiring to become celebrities, or sports superstars. In turn, he provided an answer to make kids excited about changing the world through technology. Kamens endeavor, FIRST Robotics offers teens a chance, in competition form, to use their skills and teamwork to problem solve a piece of machinery to life. 

FIRST was modeled off the allure of professional sports leagues but without  hopefully - the dog eat dog spirit. David Lavery, FIRST Robotics Mentor and NASA Engineer, grew up during the Cold War when competition through technology meant joining in on the race to the moon. An interesting aspect of FIRSTs philosophy, is that as much as it embraces competition, students are also forced to realize that your greatest competitor could  in the future - work as one of your greatest collaborators. This generation may be bombarded with news about Kardashians as opposed to scientists, astronauts and cosmonauts - but what FIRST aims to cultivate, is a hunger to make a difference  made possible now more than ever due to widespread access to information. 

Directly and tangentially, the experiment of FIRST both tackles and raises an entire swarth of deeper questions about our future. What values will our culture celebrate in the future? What will the repercussions be of the values that we celebrate today? How much time do we have to solve some of the great challenges looming on the horizon? Will there be enough individuals with the skills required to tackle those problems? To what degree will the 'fixes' be technological vs. cultural? How will the longstanding ideological struggle of competition vs. cooperation evolve as the next generations take over? What is the future of education? What is the proper role of a teacher? A  mentor? Where does cultural change come from? Where should it come from? It's an impressive list of questions to be raised by a competition involving robots shooting frisbees. We hope you find it as compelling as we did.

* **10 years from now, or 25 years from now, what will be different about the internet from what we have today?**
* What will be the economic impact of net neutrality being dismantled by Comcast &amp; Verizon lobbyists?
* Would a tiered internet be used by agencies to effectively censor non-mainstream media?
* Will fears from the NSA revelations promote the segmentation of the internet among nations.
* Does a pervasive surveillance state and a hyper-commercialized political body destroy the necessity of democracy and will that impact the freedom of the web?
* If we created general artificial intelligence in the near future, how would it react to the direction the web is moving?
* Right now we live in the period of the responsive web with HTML5+JS+CSS3, what will be the next big paradigms of interactive media?
* San Francisco, Seattle, and other tech cities are experiencing severe rent hikes and tech-company FTE's enjoy free transportation while public transportation is getting gutted by state budgets. There have been several reactionary forces in protest. What will this evolve into?
* Cryptocurrency shook the world, but laws passed in China &amp; Russia have hurt Bitcoin's growth. Moreover, a plethora of coins emerged amidst spiking BTC prices. What will happen with ""coin""?
* Internet culture has formed around social networks and content sites like reddit, but the rising popularity of ""broadcast"" sites like the gawker network are starting to conquer social media and changing it into something different. How will people consume media in the next decade?
* If we are truly facing massive unemployment from automation, what functions could the internet provide to change the way people earn a living? (Gittip or Tipbots on steroids?)
* What will happen with the ""internet of things?"" What about the proliferation of drones everywhere? Will decentralized meshnets be achievable? Or will legislators make non-centralized networks illegal for their own monetary benefit? (The TPP already hints at this)

There is so much out there that describes what the internet is today. However, this could just be a fraction of what the internet could become? I fear that a tiered internet would have dire and near immediate economic consequences.. But maybe I'm wrong.

**So let's make some predictions, what are your:**

* **BEST CASE:** When/What
* **WORST CASE:** When/What
* **EXPECTED CASE:** When/What
* **UNEXPECTED CASE:** When/What (what crazy idea could catch everyone off guard?)

Well, that's true and it's not true. In reality, they have done better research than any game I've seen in quite a while on emerging tech-and I'd know. For the last year, studying and predicting emerging tech was my job.

So! Where exactly did the technology shown in the video come from? I've decided to do a scene by scene breakdown of what I recognize, which admittedly isn't all of it. I'm also leaving out the politics, of course. For gaming journalists, defense journalists, or anyone who might want to hire a market/business/tech analyst, please send me a PM. Or if you just want to know more cool stuff!

[:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=10) We see an exoskeleton from the back. It's not incredibly bulky. It reminds me of the Lockheed Martin HULC bulked up a bit in the upper body: http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/hulc.html

[:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=13) We see the same soldier again, alongside some peripheral shots of other soldiers wearing what looks like similar armor. The soldier in the middle has a red visor. Looking at that, it brings to mind the current efforts to build a new suit for SOCOM that is climate controlled, includes next generation materials, exoskeletons, and ballistics protection. Don't believe me? Here's a link to more details, and a terribly cheesy video. http://breakingdefense.com/2014/02/socoms-iron-man-suit-talos-sees-astounding-progress-adm-mcraven/.

Moving on from that, we get a front shot. Nothing particular of note I haven't covered, except for the smartphones on their uniforms. I don't know how common it is, but here's an image from Jane's showing a less flashy, real life version of the same thing. http://www.janes.com/article/12385/pentagon-approves-smartphone-use . Walking is also very mechanical, supporting my belief they're using something like the HULC. Or I could be reading into that.

[:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=18)  VTOL. Y'all know about those already. Then lots of VTOLs. A shot inside a cockpit-there might be something I'm missing, but nothing really special.

[:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=24) And here we have invisibility. Okay, most people don't know about this one. Invisibility is a thing being seriously worked on-we've had great success with a variety of sizes of waves, like [earthquakes](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/510716/first-test-of-seismic-invisibility-cloak/), non-light [EM](http://phys.org/news/2013-11-thin-invisibility-cloak.html), and even (to a limited degree) [visible light](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3275922/). Hell, extremetech has an entire category on it. [Here's](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/179973-the-first-large-scale-invisibility-cloak-that-hides-objects-from-visible-light) an article about Lockheed Martin expressing interest. Hmmmm.

[:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=40) A dude jumping with what looks like a jetpack? New to me, let me see what I can find. While there has been (and continues to be, to a limited degree) military interest in jetpacks, I can't find Titanfall-esque projects on the books. Sorry guys.

[:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=43) Holograms! Disregarding the possibility that what's being seen is via augmented reality contacts, there's been a lot of work in holograms. If you can accept the argument that there is a very clear surface between them, it's not so hard to believe. Apple [recently patented](http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/24/apple-patents-a-3d-hologram-display-system-with-gesture-input/) a 3d hologram technology, though it's nothing like this.

At [:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=48) we get a better look at the optics in the visor,  which reminds me of the mil-spec AR glasses sold [here](http://www.six-15.com/products-detail.asp?REC_ID=12).

[:60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=60) Hover bike. Okay, this one I don't think we'll see get any traction in real life, but it is, at least, based off of something real. The [HoverBike](http://www.hover-bike.com/)

Not sure what's going on at [1:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=63). It might be LIDAR/area 3d scanning, like what's used in the [Google Car](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/181508-googles-self-driving-car-passes-700000-accident-free-miles-can-now-avoid-cyclists-stop-for-trains). It also reminds me a bit of [structured light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_light).

I THINK at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=65 he's using a flexible phone, and honestly there's too many links to sum up. [Click this](http://www.extremetech.com/tag/flexible-displays).

At https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=66 we see personal scale invisibility. This reminds me of the (fairly old, now) other optical camouflage work being done in Tokyo, which had a lot of attention [ten years ago](http://files.tachilab.org/publications/intconf2000/inami2003ISMAR.pdf).

A grenade is thrown at [1:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=67). A whole bunch of lasers shoot out, and a visual effect is rendered to show the player what's been scanned, as well as the locations of individuals. While in real life it wouldn't keep tracking, this isn't...impossible. [Here's](http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/09/long-range-laser-scanner/) laser scanning of people from half a mile away, though it's not very portable.

At [1:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=88) we see something new, one of my favorite things in this video. Powered armor. Real powered armor. Bulky like it should be for legit strength enhancement, and to support the extra armor. This is one of the -most- realistic things in this video, believe it or not. [Here's](http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/28/raytheons-sarcos-xos-2-military-exoskeleton-just-does-the-heavy/) the Sarcos XOS-2. Four years ago. There hasn't been much public about it since.

A dude looking at camera, a dude taking cover, more bridge footage, drones at [0:95](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=95). They most remind me of [Shrike UAVs](http://www.avinc.com/uas/small_uas/shrike/), though those have four rotors (quadcopters).

Gecko gloves are seen at [1:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=102). Also real, also being worked on. Check [here](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/gecko-adhesives-moving-from-robot-feet-to-your-walls)! They will, hopefully, allow for things like what's shown in the video. Though glass is one of the worst environments.

At [1:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=106) the lady throws a drone into the air, which can already be done, [even for hobbyists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8U1QzEwXUg). She also might(?) have a [bionic](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/30/dod-funds-mind-controlled-bionic-leg.html) [leg](http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/BTO/Programs/Revolutionizing_Prosthetics.aspx). There's two links there, click both.

At [1:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=109), soldiers are dragging cover across. Cover seems to be bullet resistant-probably either [synthetic spider silk](http://www.gizmag.com/spiber-synthetic-silk/28267/) or a [carbon nanotube weave](https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/nanotechnology/carbon-nanotube-super-fabric). Can't find much on the deployment method being planned, though.

At [2:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFu5qXMuaJU#t=137), some form of raised, automated tank. Don't have something on that, though it could be a far future version of the [Boston Dynamics LS3] (http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_ls3.html). The automated gun (assuming it is one) could be an integration of [this](http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/us-army-testing-auto-aiming-rifles) with the already heavily computer controlled cannons on some vehicles.

Something lifting off. Walking tank (discussed above). What might be a railgun, though it doesn't have any of the normal characteristics. Still, [here's](http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140412/NEWS04/304120024/Railgun-tests-from-ship-set-16) recent news from the BAE Systems prototype going into testing soon.

I don't see how an uploaded brain is not just a computer simulation of someone's likeness, with only an illusion of continuity. I understand the go-to procedure for tranhumanism proponents is to replace each and every single neuron in the body gradually with a nanobot, but all that achieves is a brain made of nanobots instead of neurons.

These nanobots would have to function in the same ways as neurons, that is passing neurotransmitters, ect. It's a complicated system of chemical, electrical, and mechanical interactions, ones barely understood to science. It could still be done, but to what end? These nanobots would limited in the same way as neurons, they are physical *things*, not a collection of 1s and 0s.

You could take this nanobrain, translate all the information into 1s and 0s using a computer model, but then it'd be exactly that, a computer model. A simulation. You'd have a data file named ""Bob's mind"" while Bob would continue to live as a separate entity with his nanobot neurons still clocking away in his brain.

I understand that the brain is ""just a computer"", but it's one that does not support uploading or making copies of itself. You can't access it digitally. Before you attack me for it, no this has nothing to do with me having an overinflated sense of sacredness for the human body or some religious notion of a soul. In fact it's the opposite. I don't believe in souls or incorporeal essence that can exist in other forms, and a part of me wonders if other atheists find the concept of brain uploading so appealing for the same reason theists find the afterlife appealing.

It's already illegal for anyone to cut open someone's brain and tear pieces out just because the individual wants to, it's only allowed if a licensed medical professional deems it necessary for medical reasons. That won't change, and if it does it will result in a humanitarian disaster.

I understand using nanobots to make the brain more rugged and longer lived. You could even scoop it out and put it a robot body,  you could put in a jar and hook it up to a computer/brain interface and teleoperate whatever you wanted, but the brain is a physical thing. You can't change it, no matter how convincing the replacement is.

Am I mistaken in this assessment? CMV.",17,2

So one thing I'm quite sure that will happen in the next thirty years as nanotechnology grows, as others hear believe as well, is that we will enhance our mental capabilities by replacing parts of our brain with artificial components.

The way I see this best occuring is by replacing individual neurons, one at a time (although then thousands every second) so that you don't have a lapse in consciousness and seamlessly integrate the better components without risking destroying your mind. Then additional neurons could be added to increase a person's mental capabilities. That, I understand.

The problem is where people say that you'll be able to upload your mind into a different body, or just upload into a computer and leave a physical form at will. (This is +100 or more years from now type stuff)   Since there's no brain or mental process, and assuming no soul to carry the consciousness, how exactly would you be you and not just a copy of you once you get into the computer?

Should we just assume that we don't know yet and we'll worry about it when the time comes? Or are there theories of how our mind will be preserved?",10,5

Everything was envisioned to be powered by Nuclear energy: ships, cities, airplanes, cars, and even machines that tunneled through mountains using the intense energy of nuclear reactions. There was always a dark side to this coin, however: these same reactions could be used in weapons that could annihilate the Human species, and nearly all life with it.

As accidents happened at power plants, the optimism for nuclear power turned into fear of it, as people became convinced that if one slight thing went wrong at one of these power plants, a huge area around it would become an irradiated wasteland where nobody could even live for thousands of years afterwards. The public no longer became convinced of a nuclear future, instead, turning their eyes towards such sources of power as the sun, wind, hydroelectricity, and geothermal sources.

A recent resurgence of interest in nuclear power has occured, arguably as a result of environmentalists reconsidering their long-held stances on the power source, and a documentary that has become widely talked about on reddit, *Pandora's Promise*. Instead of a future powered by solar panels and wind turbines, many redditors are now envisioning a future powered by Thorium reactors and Fusion reactors.

What do you personally think the future of nuclear power will be? Do you think the resurgence of interest might lead to a nuclear revival?",22,21

A century ago we did not have a lot of advanced technology running everything. When we has made telegraphs, a global storm caused the telegraph cables to spark and in some cases start fires. Before hand, these storms never caused a problem for humans. 

The power grid, and many different types of technology we have now are much more advanced than the telegraph, but can suffer the same fate. A solar storm can destroy every electronic device on earth and we have no way of stopping it. We are likely not prepared. 

A powerful solar storm is not speculation or science fiction. We recorded a storm capable of destroying Earth's electronic devices in 2012 when it missed us by a week. The sun is at it's lowest point in a century (or just past that) and it created a large storm that luckily did not hit us. 

I am not trying to sound like a pessimist or someone who thinks the world is going to end. We do not know how common such an event is as electronic technology has only existed for a short period of time, though we may be able to use other methods to see what happened in the past. We have ways of stopping asteroids, but how will the world deal with every electronic device (or at least a large portion of them) becoming unusable? Can we even stop such an event?

Such an event could knock us back from achieving futuristical goals like curing aging and creating AI. This could also be a huge problem with extending a persons life by putting them in a computer or giving them a robotic body. This would mean we would need to enhance the human body biologically.

As you read from the title I want to read your opinions on powerful A.I. which are smarter/have more processing power then every human brain on earth combined (the likes of which many expect to see on the verge of singularity) and either debate with you on it (in a respectful manner using logic and reasoning please!) Or learn something new about the subject I haven't considered before. I'm a huge supporter of A.I. and can see the vast potential of it as a tool to launch humanity into its next step of evolution! So please share your thoughts or fears about the subject and let's have a scholarly discussion (or debate) about it because it's coming soon and it's fascinating!

Edit: I know I've very opinionated on the subject and I don't want to come across as you all thinking that I think only my opinion is right I'm basing my replies off of my logic and what I've read about the subject so I'm sure it's flawed so I really do like reading what you all have to say on the subject!

They are also becoming more and more prevalent in the broadband industry, providing internet etc..

To me that seems pretty dangerous, especially if automated cars and robotic automation take off more than before.  Search is the way we view the world, and while certain other companies have near-monopolies (ie Microsoft with Windows and Office), they do not participate in multiple completely different industries like Google does.

Personally I think Google will have to be broken up eventually, in order to preserve a free market and prevent a monopoly over a huge amount of future tech from forming.  Google is buying so many of its competitors or up and coming tech firms that it could get pretty dangerous soon.  ",6,1

In a future without consciousness, there is no future.


It is difficult to predict what will occur, but it is difficult to speak of an evolution of consciousness,
yet when we are concerned about the destruction of our planet. Here I present several scenes about what could happen .

- Mass extinction of living species, produced directly or indirectly by the human race. The destruction of habitats, pollution, poaching causes the eradication of species being few. 

1) The disturbance causes of biodiversity, species cloning attempts to repopulate the areas where they lived. 

2) Recreation of life, creating animals with artificial life, hybrid a cross between artificial and natural. 

3) Beings digital, with superior intelligence consent. 

4) Pets recreating animals, feelings, reactions and awareness. 

5) I watch largely a lone human, perhaps destructive nature, we become creative means to be a pseudo life that could have preserver. 

6) Genetic manipulation to create new species, is difficult to imagine that you can get out of this, just want to sight it seems natural.

The nature and inventive mind, we are always going to lead to the creation of new roads, even if they seem negative, we're headed for deep learning of life, find the reflection of the hand of technology. And always will exist tomorrow.",3,4

One of those that I think is a mainstay is Crypto Currencies and I thought /r/cryptocurrency might want to read about one that I imagined up called Smile Coin. While Bitcoin and Dogecoin are currently duking it out for PR I wanted to conceptualize a currency that had more than monetary benefit and perhaps impacted our world a bit more closely.  

Smile Coin is based off of technology like Google Glass and this current Indie GoGo project: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ipal-capture-pictures-and-videos-with-your-eyes-and-share-with-a-blink-or-wink  

Since my book is set in the future I cant roll with current tech so Im more looking at the tech from these devices to improve and shrink down to contact lens size, and that appears to be something that is already going on and should be ready for consumers in a few years time (I need to hurry up and finish this dang book!)  

Mining:   
The goal with Smile Coin is to reward people whenever they make someone else happy. Instead of a currency built on labor (warning cheesiness ahead) this is a currency built on love and joy.
Instead of working like a Bitcoin where computers consume large quantities of energy to mine, Smile Coins mining mechanism works with just human power. The app/software will have facial recognition technology (oh scary I know.. relax its a concept), this technology isnt used for anything nefarious but just to identify someone as having smiled at your before or not. For every new person that smiles at you, you get 0.01 of a Smile Coin released to you. Each time the same person smiles at you the value of the smile drops at first by , then by , etc... The goal is to give a high reward to the first smile from a unique person but never make it of zero value to get a person to smile. I cant math so if you have a better solution speak up!  

Usage:   
At first, think the year 2014-2016, Smile Coins will have a niche usage. The number of Smile Coins you've ever unlocked is always visible so Smile Coins can be used to help judge your character where appropriate. Smile Coins will also be used as coupons or discounts on various products from merchants that want to help make the world a better place. Think a pair of Toms shoes, medical expenses, etc..  

Right now our society uses money as a means to take care of their needs, and to a lesser extent their wants. As our society progresses (and we are well on the way) away from this way of thinking about money as some reward for making someone else money, Smile Coins will grow in prominence and in the way they are used climaxing with the ability to make full purchases just from being a good person.
Trading, Selling, Gifting Smile Coins are meant to reward the immediate person that unlocked them. As such they lose a small bit of value when traded, sold, or gifted. This will lead to a dwindling supply of Smile Coins ensuring the need to continue unlocking them and in the short term ensuring their relative value to fiat currencies. When trading or selling a Smile Coin it should lose value by 0.001 SC, when gifting it should drop by 0.0001 SC.  

Side note: Smile coins display 3 types of information, 2 are public and 1 is private. Publically it displays all the Smile Coins youve ever mined and all the Smile Coins youve ever owned (because you can trade for them, purchase them, or have them gifted). Your current supply of Smile Coins is private.

I never knew it existed until it became a default sub. In my 1.5 years on Reddit, I have posted memes to Advice Animals. I have earned most of my comment karma from joke threads. 

In other words, I'm that guy you all hate. And I'm glad to be here. 

More importantly, YOU - ye sage pre-default futurists - should be glad I'm here. Why? A few reasons: 

1. I am fresh to futurology. Sure, I'll ask annoyingly basic new-guy questions, but I'll also ask annoyingly relevant new-guy questions.  If group-think exists (and, let's face it, it usually does), there will be a new set of participants who can disrupt the conversation. 

2. More stuff. Since joining, I've heard all kinds of panicked posts that we noobs will clutter the sub with irrelevant content and comments. Folks, this is similar to how vote suppressors have always justified their actions. Yes, it means there'll be more junk. Yes, it puts more pressure on the mods to curate. But it also means you'll see more interesting stuff as well. And anyone who thinks more participation is bad for a fundamentally democratic, UG web community, is probably someone who wants to preserve a place where people think *just like them.*

3. Impact. I would expect a group of futurists wouldn't just want to talk about what's possible - they'd also want people to notice and take action. There's some really mind-blowingly smart shit on this sub, stuff that can have a profound impact on present and future generations. People outside your echo chamber should know about it. Ever seen an off-Reddit article that started from an AskReddit thread? Me too. Ever had a FBF post a meme that you saw last week on Advice Animals? Yep, me too. Ever seen a story that started here and directly went mainstream? Liar, no you haven't. Me neither. And that's a shame. 

/screed. I expect I'll incur a squall line of downvotes for this post. I don't give a shit. I feel like there's a hue of doom surrounding the defaulting of the sub, and people need to consider the upside. ",9,5
453,2014-5-9,2014,5,9,4,252cjm,"The human mind, transferred to a computer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/252cjm/the_human_mind_transferred_to_a_computer/,darkmortem,1399576259,"-------------------------------------------------- -----------------

Many want to preserve the mind and observe the near future and not so near as complex as consciousness can be brought to the digital world , many questions can ask us about it and something I can say , is that thoughts are signs electric traveling by neurons and generate response by chemical stimulation.

Taking our consciousness to a computer , It will be a good replica of us. But not us and is the best example is how the creation of a file, the moved file , copied , it is always created works , what we see are replicas of original, never the original, that means that will only replicate, not keeping our conscience, to the extent possible, the important thing is to let the essence of us in time, you can live and stay in time, it would be an extra-corporeal and extra-temporal process.

Consider some of the benefits of safeguarding our mind, as a replica of us, a being who think, feel, express and can keep our memories, we would be a cloud version, but with all the information and inventiveness, it would be interesting view, what better than a human mind replicated, to a simulated.

benefits maintain replicated the minds of geniuses, and keep producing knowledge, familiar to those who appeal to a problem, suggestion or maintain their existence.

Being aware of what this means, but it seems inhumane, we are talking digital replicas, not digital slaves, or trapped in a virtual world. I think a person with access to information will never be an unfree one.

Where possible, many of our actions are not mechanical, and many of our emotions influence what we do is hard to imagine something, but to chemical sensations can be replicated, this story is not new,
inventive mind and artificial brains, take us to these roads.

A very interesting topic we really like a lot, at least we can replicate our memory somewhere, or our conscience, to make a better world. Something like donating our body but our conscience would donate to science.

**Some clarification regarding the post**

* The theme is a theme predictive of what might happen, based on existing studies, and what many futurologists predict. 

* When I talk about a computer I'm talking about something very different from what we have in our house. They have to go forward 300 years or more, a computer pocket that has the architecture of a current supercomputer. 

* When I talk about moving the mind, clarified in the text, which is a replica of the same, never the original, what I want to endure perhaps somehow your reasoning to solve problems. And create new solutions. 

* Remember to futurists nothing is impossible.

Yes technology is getting better, but that's not the only thing going on. Wealth inequality (in the U.S. and parts of Europe at least) is rising, antibiotics are beginning to lose their efficacy and the environment is deteriorating. But there's one other thing that worries me and that is the nature of humanity itself. Simply put: we're hardwired for short term gratification over long term survival. Whether that's an oil baron spreading FUD about environmentalism so he can become even more wealthy, or the people of Arizona [voting against sustainability](http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2012/04/25/20120425arizona-tea-party-anti-sustainability-bill-advancing.html) there's no other way to dice it, we're going backwards as a species. To sum up that thought here's a quote from Alexander Lamb:

&gt;To explain what I mean, consider this: intelligence doesnt happen in a vacuum. It happens in brains, and brains have the shape they do for a reason. Specifically, brains are packed with mechanisms to make it really hard for you to quit bad habits.

-[Source](http://thetinkerpoint.com/2013/01/23/why-ray-kurzweil-is-wrong/)

Ultimately we're a species that came about ~200,000 years ago and we've been put in control of a highly destructive industrial apparatus. We've known about the dangers of this apparatus for a while (for example Arrhenius was the first person to warn about anthropogenic climate change), but we just haven't been making the right decisions. So my question is: if we haven't made the right decisions so far, what's to think we ever will? While many people here seem of the optimistic Kurweilian camp, I see the future differently. We either wipe ourselves out through war or just plain negligence and If that doesn't happen there's still the singularity; an event that disruptive has more ways of going wrong than going right. As Bill Joy warned in The Future Doesn't Need us, we're putting destructive capabilities into the hands of more people, some of whom get pleasure from [terrorizing others](http://youtu.be/ZfjvGmdXoOY). And I know some of you have seen these dangers, but what exactly are you doing to mitigate them? Joining a group or signing a petition is easy, but actually effecting change is difficult and requires effort. So far I haven't seen the large scale effort needed to proactively avoid problems.",5,3

I've been thinking about alternatives that will make me relevant and that might give me an edge when I hopefully graduate in a few years time.

3D-printing is probably going to be a big thing but I'm unsure how to tap into it, could some kind of engineering degree be relevant? AI is of course another thing that'll make an impact eventually but I feel like it's going to take some big progress before it's big enough for that job market to be stable, bit of a gamble. The energy sector is likely to be evolving also I guess? I think we can assume marketing will become increasingly important also as production requires less resources.

What are some other fields that you think could be growing in the near future? Does anyone know of any universities that offer programs that might be interesting? Any input is appreciated, cheers friends!

(It feels like this has to have been posted before but didn't find anything in search so sorry about that)

Edit for clarity: I'm just talking about something that'll be relevant for the next 20 or so years, not something I can do until we hit the singularity. Also I'm mainly looking for 'new' markets, where you could have an edge if you're early with having an education, but any suggestions are welcome of course! ",6,1

How does it work? Because it plays on our emotions, something strings of scientific data and numbers cannot do. But to work well, it must be credible. It needs to build suspenseful stories about people like you and me struggling in a changed environment that has a high degree of ""likelihood"".
So climate fiction is necessarily linked to futurology as it makes use of the various alternative scenarios that futurologists come up with. 

So far, climate fiction, cli-fi for short, is a new genre (the term was coined by climate activist Dan Bloom in 2008), with still relatively few book titles though it is growing. Professor Adeline Johns-Putra, chair of the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment in the UK and Ireland, in a recent interview on the Financial Times, noted this was a definite growing trend. Until the 1990s, there were ""only a handful of novels using climate change as a setting, she said, but since 2006, some 150 have made it into print, including at least 50 in which [climate change] is a central theme.""

What is the future of climate fiction in your opinion, taking into account the success of some recent cli-fi books like Barbara Kingsolver's Flight Behavior or Nathaniel Rich's Odds Against Tomorrow?",26,23

I don't think we'll be able to find someone quick enough for tomorrow. Looks like we may have to postpone and regroup. Thanks for all your thoughts and questions.

It could fly using rocket propulsion. It'd be 1000 times stronger than humans. Sight could be magnified allowing you to zoom in to the microscopic level or to galaxies far away. The avatar would run on solar and wind power and would never run out of energy.


You'd be in a capsule controlling the avatar. Your brain's electrical signals would pick up the avatar's senses. Senses are controlled by dimmers so you can temporarily dim touch to remove pain, or amplify smell. At any time you can choose to connect to a new avatar to change how you look or to replace a destroyed avatar.


However, disconnecting your brain from AvatarOS gives you permanent brain damage so once you decide to control an avatar, you can't return to society with your physical body.


10% of the global population are avatars.

My understanding is that they could simplify and reduce the size of a circuit mimicking a neuron and therefore allow for more neurons per chip and reducing the price per neuron.

Found this 2011 article on IBM's learning chips [article](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/93060-ibm-creates-learning-brain-like-synaptic-cpu).

The Three Laws apply to machines but if a human has machine parts, are they considered part of that category? Or do they need to be more than 50% robotic to count as ""robot""? Or would they have a totally separate set of laws?

Also, the Three Laws for anyone who needs a refresher:

Isaac Asimov's ""Three Laws of Robotics""
1.	A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2.	A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3.	A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

* Time machines with the compactly determined Cauchy horizon. 

* A Non-Metric Approach to Space, Time and Gravitation : a 4-dimensional space-time manifold equipped with a one-parameter family of Lorentzian 4-metrics parameterized by a (unique) global time function.

* Missing black holes in brightest cluster galaxies as evidence for the occurrence of superkicks in nature. 

* Decay of Graviton Condensates and their Generalizations in Arbitrary Dimensions. 

* Superradiant instability of black holes immersed in a magnetic field. 

* Kaluza's procedure applied to Eddington-Born-Infeld gravity in five dimensions. The resulting action contains, in addition to the usual four-dimensional actions for gravity and electromagnetism, nonlinear couplings between the electromagnetic field strength and curvature.


* Dirac fermions on an anti-de Sitter background: using an exact expression for the bi-spinor of parallel transport, we construct the Feynman propagator for Dirac fermions in the vacuum state on anti-de Sitter space-time. 


* Multi-Loop Zeta Function Regularization and Spectral Cutoff in Curved Spacetime. Do prime numbers give us a handle on spacetime?

* Constraining f(R) gravity with PLANCK data on galaxy cluster profiles. Our results do not rule out that clusters are dynamically dominated by Dark Matter but support the idea that Extended Theories of Gravity.

* Conditions for Sustained Orbital Resonances in Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals. 
 
* Energy carries Information.

I'd like to start a discussion about the ethics of becoming immortal, or achieving extreme longevity, and all that entails the subject. 

Such as the possibilities for human exploration of the stars, for example. Having a virtually unlimited amount of time to do this would greatly benefit humanity in my opinion. 

Also the downside. Having someone who was born five hundred years ago in a position of power can probably be detrimental to a civilization's growth. What are some solutions to this problem? Should there be an established code of conduct for those who choose immortality? Is there already one? 

The implications on the economy? How will it affect it? 

What about education? Will we simply become a society that strives for learning, acquiring knowledge for the whole of our lives? Or will we become too lazy, seeing as some might have the mentality of, "" Well I'll have the rest of time to learn, I do not need to do it right now.""

Any hurdles that we must overcome before we can achieve immortality? Any obstacles that we have already overcome?

A semantic web would help partly first generate a real catalog of the information presented on the web, this in HTML5 one of the tags { META } for example , is the beginning of a bold plan for the web this more organized now evolve pages and this allows search engines evolve , that the search for suit both the person who seeks the information as required .

Having a clear web , free directory , the next step is an intelligent managed to all this information , basing on some readings , it is easy to predict what is coming, many of the attendees , with artificial intelligence JARVIS are in the process of development in each version improving the level of complexity, automata assistant who can really help us produce and manage internet .

SIRI , GOOGLE NOW and CORTANA . It will be a long process to get to something as complex as JARVIS .

Which bring us to a totally autonomous internet and adapted to each person , a more personal internet .

Missing asking people if they wanted fries with that. Dealing with customers who felt it was my doing; and my intention to deprive them of their ketchup packets. Thinking back on it, I should have put a lot more effort into that job. But it's gone now. And I don't mean I lost my job, rather, the job is gone. It's all automatic now, all done by robots. To be fair, they are much better at it than we ever were, but that job was my livelihood.

It all started a few years ago when employees like me decided to demand a better wage. There were a couple prior attempts to spur protests for a higher minimum wage, but workers seemed hesitant. Nobody wanted to rock the boat given how hard it was to get the job in the first place. Competition was fierce. That's to be expected I guess... There were a lot of us looking to get our foot in the door, to get a start in life. While the pay wasn't great, and the work was pretty numbing, those jobs gave us that little bit of real-world experience we needed to land a better one. Looking back, we would have been much better off to just smile and scrub the toilet. If I could do it over again, I know that's probably what I would do. Though I'm not sure it would make any difference. By demanding a better wage, we unknowingly created a huge incentive to replace us. And unfortunately, at that moment in time, the ability to do so was becoming increasingly accessible by the minute.

Nobody seemed to realize it, save for a few, but the explosion in popularity of cell phones was ultimately what led to me losing my job. When they first started to make their way into the hands of businesspeople, cell phones were huge. Nothing like the smartphones we have now, these things were bricks. But at a blistering speed they were refined. Soon, they had screens displaying phone numbers and contact information saved in their memory. Then they started having little games, like Snake, that people could play while waiting for the bus or whatever. Nobody expected that these screens would end up being so central their operation, but before long, the resolution on them began to increase. People wanted to watch videos on them, and then browse the internet. Then someone came up with the idea of having a touch-screen, and the buttons on the phone disappeared. They transformed into black monolithic devices, and spread to almost every pocket on Earth. And then came the apps. Applications for everything, from flashlights to translation. Along with the apps came a slew of new components (new for phones, at least). Mercury switches, cameras, super-bright LEDs, and more. The innards underwent just as radical a transformation. The power of the processors expanded at breakneck speeds, the energy needed to power them fell, the batteries became capable of storing ever more of it. All of this happened within two decades. Pretty amazing when you consider that the leap from scroll to book took hundreds of years.

But what does this have to do with me, the freshly unemployed frycook? All those components, all those advances do not exist in a vacuum. As the demand for them skyrocketed, their cost fell. We call this economies of scale. That fact meant that they became readily accessible. This led to people creating devices which made them easier to use, which in turn led to it being much easier to learn how. What that meant is that anyone with a couple stepper motors, a microcontroller, and Google could create a crude robotic arm in their garage in an afternoon. I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this.

My demanding a better wage directly led to my parent company being willing to pay that much more for a solution. A solution to me, and my demands. And the thousands of people I beat out to get my job were only too willing to spend the couple hundred bucks, and couple hundred hours needed to learn how to make robots. It didn't happen overnight, and I won't say how much I was making by the time I received my notice. But I did.

I stopped in for a burger the other day. The terminal where I placed my order had no trouble with my accent, and even got everything straight despite my initially ordering a diet-soda by mistake. I opted to specify exactly how things should be made, instead of picking one of the presets. I outlined how many pickles I wanted, exactly how much ketchup, mustard, mayo, and that I wanted two patties with a slice of cheese in-between them. It even let me pick precisely how much salt I wanted on my fries. Once I confirmed everything with the ordering terminal, it politely said: That will be $10.98 sir. before indicating that I could either pay with my card, or put the balance on my digital tab to be paid at the end of the month. I simply held my debit card up to it's camera and pressed my thumb to it's scanner.

Thank you for your purchase. You can retrieve your order to the left. Is there anything more I can assist you with today sir?

After dismissing the machine, I watched the robots in the back through the viewing window. I guess the company figured it would help people be more comfortable with the idea of machines making their food. They did everything perfectly. The pickles were sliced seconds before they went on my sandwich, all of the condiments went on exactly in the order I specified, the patties were charred to perfection, then the robot took extra care to ensure the whole thing sat nicely in the box, and there wasn't any stray ingredients or anything messy about it. After salting my fries with exactly one quarter teaspoon worth of salt, it carefully put everything onto a tray, placed a straw into my pre-chilled cup of root-beer, and put the tray into the airlock-type conveyor that shuttled it over to where I was standing.

Thinking back on it now, this only makes sense. Having worked behind the scenes, and seen what goes on, I like it better this way. When it was me back there, I didn't give a shit about how long the pickles sat, or whether the patty was cooked to perfection. I was paid the bare minimum, and that bought the bare minimum of effort. But these robots... They didn't have any preconceived notions of worth or value. They did exactly what they were programmed to, every time, perfectly, without fail.

As for me, tomorrow I go to pick up my basic income check which I've been using to pay for food and housing while I write my book. I'd always wanted to, but I'd just never had the time. Between working as a fry cook, gas attendant, and occasionally helping out at my uncle's scrap yard, I just didn't have it in me. Perhaps that's what used to set people apart. Those who were willing to put off their couple hours of sleep, who were content to simply eat ramen noodles instead of taking the time to prepare a meal so they could claw back an extra hour or so a night to put towards their true interests, those were the ones who achieved success. I'm glad it's not like that anymore. There has been so much in the way of new creations, new ideas, and wondrous new inventions since our government implemented the basic income. People are genuinely happier.

Of course not everyone uses the money to be productive. Some people use it to travel, others invest it into people's ideas and projects, and of course, some people use it to live off of without doing anything notable to contribute. And others, of course, waste it on drugs or alcohol. I tried that. Back when they first rolled it out was not long after I had lost my first job. I was in a bad place. I wasn't making enough to make ends meet and working on my book seemed as out of reach as ever. Getting high and drinking myself to sleep helped me to forget it all. Nobody cared. Part of the basic income proposal was that there was no oversight. It helped to reduce costs, not having all that bureaucracy policing how people used it.

But it wasn't long until options arose that allowed me to do as I do now. Some people used their basic income to learn and build robotic systems. Then they created processes that made food, and purified water and stuff. Someone created a great big 3D printer that made shelter. Doing this reduced the costs of those basic necessities by orders of magnitude, and before long, I could afford to actually live decently on my BI. Now I have a small, but comfortable three-room home that was printed. It's situated by the ocean, in a small community of other authors. We have a self-driving shuttle that takes us into the city whenever we want, which we setup to do two trips daily. I bought a laptop, and me and my neighbors all pitched in and bought a kit that included a robotic greenhouse, a desalination plant, and a waste-to-fertilizer setup. We're mostly self-sufficient, but what we don't create for ourselves we can easily afford with our basic income payments.

Someday I hope that my book will make me a famous author, and perhaps generate enough money that I can use to buy my own property. But for now, I'm happy. I'm much better off than I was. It's certainly not what you might expect from a country with an unemployment rate of 63%, but we get by. Things could be better, but then again, they could be a lot worse too. But for now, we're making due, making progress. And that's what really matters.

[x-post from r/Rad_Decentralization]",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/25dqjr/ray_kurzweil_as_decentralized_technologies/,ThatchNailer,1399921056,"""**Decentralization.** One profound trend already well under way that will provide greater stability is the movement from centralized technologies to distributed ones and from the real world to the virtual world discussed above.  Centralized technologies involve an aggregation of resources such as people (for example, cities, buildings), energy (such as nuclear-power plants, liquid-natural-gas and oil tankers, energy pipelines), transportation (airplanes, trains), and other items.  Centralized technologies are subject to disruption and disaster.  They also tend to be inefficient, wasteful, and harmful to the environment.

Distributed technologies, on the other hand, tend to be flexible, efficient, and relatively benign in their environmental effects.  The quintessential distributed technology is the Internet.  The Internet has not been substantially disrupted to date, and as it continues to grow, its robustness and resilience continue to strengthen.  If any hub or channel does go down, information simply routes around it.

In energy, we need to move away from the extremely concentrated and centralized installations on which we now depend... Ultimately technology along these lines could power everything from our cell phones to our cars and homes.  These types of decentralized energy technologies would not be subject to disaster or disruption.

As these technologies develop, our need for aggregating people in large buildings and cities will diminish, and people will spread out, living where they want and gathering together in virtual reality.""

While I realize there are a large amount of discussions posted on this topic already I feel that I have something unique to contribute to it, though the questions and thoughts have most likely been posed before.

First being the the state of technology in the future and a amalgam of multiple technologies working in synchronicity to provide radical life extension and intellectual and mind expansion.

My question is how do you think the various fields and technologies of nanotechnology, immortality, mind-uploading and virtual worlds will come about and how they will interact with one another.

My thoughts on this are how will mind-uploading work and how will nanotechnology allow this to happen. I think that the only proper way for this to come to reality is if nanites were designed and constructed to systematically replicate and replace neurons in the brain. Allowing for a nonbiological replication of the human brain and creating a link to the digital universe making it possible but not entirely necessary for mind-uploading. By way of removing the biological factor in human neurons this would allow for a mechanical neurons to take their place and create a doorway for digital immortality. Thus having a nonbiological mechanical brain one could assume that it would allow for the essence of ourselves to be uploaded into the internet and virtual worlds without destroying the brain or making copies that are not ourselves, and give humans the ability to interect with digital constructions in a way similar to the Matrix.

Thank you for taking the time to read and respond and I do apologize if this question has been posed before.

Actually, I always have that feeling that what we are experiencing of the current technology should've been experienced long time ago. I mean that our current technology is not wow enough for today's scientific and technological achievements. Yes, I've checked what's going on in those so-advanced agencies such as DARPA and Boston Dynamics but still I'm not convinced that we are living at the top level of tech.
Something is hidden. something is really so advanced has been invented, made or discovered long time ago and whoever responsible about the timing of tech release is controlling that through some movies, documentaries or even what they call sci-fi books.
Why don't we just enjoy the latest tech up to the moment and develop more and more?

The pipes for water are controlled by a handful of huge corporations. Each of these corporations makes an unspoken agreement to not compete with each other, and instead focus on creating de-facto monopolies in their own geographic regions.

Problems soon start to arise. 

The handful of corporations, without competition, start to charge increasingly higher prices, for the various tiers of water flow they offer.  Consumers begin to complain that they arent getting enough water. The corporations respond by pointing out that they have plans for every amount of water that anyone could possibly need. If a consumer wants more water, they simply need to upgrade to a higher tier of water flow, for example the $150 a month business plan. The corporations point out that, since barely anyone signs up for this tier, it is quite obvious that there is not a very high demand for this amount of water flow.

Consumers arent happy about this line of logic though. They point out that there is little choice in where to get their water supply from, and this is what causes the prices to get so high. It isnt that there isnt demand for higher water flow, it is that these upper tiers are priced too high. The corporations respond again, they point out that there is plenty of competition. For example, consumers are able to purchase bottled spring water from stores, or filter their own water from lakes and streams. They say that because water can be obtained by these alternate methods, it doesnt need to be a regulated utility. There are multiple sources for consumers to purchase it from, so it cant possibly be a harmful monopoly.

Consumers balk at this idea, realizing that buying enough pricey bottled water to take a bath or wash dishes simply isnt feasible. Some cities get fed up with the corporations. They band together to fund creation of their own community water supplies, which will increase they flow well beyond what is offered by the corporations. Some cities are successful, but many are blocked when lobbyists from the corporations rush to get laws passed which prevent cities from supplying their own water.

The problems keep piling up though. Until recently, the corporations controlled both the pipes to deliver water, and most water sources themselves. This caused complaints about the quality of water, in addition to quantity. The solution looked like it may have been on the horizon though, as some companies bought higher quality water supplies and made agreements with the corporations to supply it. However, soon this too caused a problem. Consumers almost always picked this new, higher quality water over the corporations supply. The corporations solution? Simply charge both the suppliers and the consumers for moving the water. This would drive prices up, and force consumers to go back to considering the corporations water supply.

Meanwhile, the branch of government designed for watching out for the free market considers whether allowing two of the largest corporations to merge and control 40% of citizens household water is a consumer friendly move

So, if it wasnt obvious from the first paragraph, Im not talking about Water. Every paragraph above is a metaphor for the current state of the internet in America. When you look at how our system for ISPs would work for water, it is pretty clear there is an issue with allowing ISPs to continue to operate as de-facto monopolies instead of they utilities they should be.

Now I think it's a good idea to use the space to collect as much sunlight as possible, however roads are dirty covered in debris, get damaged from vehicles driving on them, and are not always in the sun from buildings, trees, and cars. I believe it would be in our best interest to follow Germany's example and put Solar panels along the sides, and on top of the roads, collecting sunlight, and not being damaged by vehicles and random other debris, also manufacturing, upkeep, and development costs would be much cheaper, with a greater and faster return on investment.

It's something I imagine you would enjoy if you have an interest in transhumanism or the future of human evolution. The basic idea is that transhumanism - including AI, modified humans, and nanotechnology- is just one natural step in the evolution of matter and complexity. The process is one that all intelligent tool-building species in the universe will go through. The second half of the book asks ""what will come *after* the post-humans?"". I hope it will not only be an accessible introduction for readers unfamiliar with the technological singularity, but food for thought for you seasoned Kurzweilians out there. There are fictional passages throughout the book for those of you that identify more with allegories.

**If this is something you think you might enjoy, just drop me a PM with an email address included and I'll be happy to send you a mobi, epub, or word version of the book for free. In exchange, I'd be extremely grateful if you wouldn't mind putting up a review - whether negative, or positive - on Amazon once you're finished.**

I'm not particularly interested in profiting from the book itself, to be honest; I'd prefer to just get it out there after a year of tearing my hair out writing it. Incidentally, the book will be free to download all day tomorrow (15th May), if you'd prefer to get hold of it that way.

Have a look at these predictions of Paul Allen and Oren Etzioni from a few months back:

http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/11/business/star-trek-siri-machine-reading-revolution/

They're talking here about computers that can actually read scientific literature, and reason about that -- not simple keyword searching or basic relation extraction; but the ability to read articles at an expert level.  

What have they got so far?  Check out the Inquire intelligent biology textbook:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wpGeN4jLUo

The Aristo project aims to go a few levels beyond that.

But what about the commonsense reasoning problem, which we've all heard about?  This is where text-mining comes in.  Here, for example, is an abstract of a talk by Oren Etzioni:

http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm14/sdm14_abstracts.pdf


&gt; **The Battle for the Future of Data Mining**


&gt; Deep learning has catapulted to the front page of the New York Times, formed the core of the so-called Google brain, and achieved impressive results in vision, speech recognition, and elsewhere. Yet researchers have offered simple conundrums that deep learning doesnt address. For example: The large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of styrofoam. What was made of styrofoam? - the large ball - the table.  The answer is obviously the table, but if we change the word Styrofoam to steel, the answer is clearly the large ball. To automatically answer this type of question, our computers require an extensive body of common-sense knowledge. We believe that text mining can provide the requisite body of knowledge. My talk will describe work at the new Allen Institute for AI towards building the next-generation of text-mining systems.

Once you have machines that can read ordinary narratives and even scientific papers, and that can suggest new ways of looking at problems (or outright produce new solutions), we could see very rapid, explosive gains in science and technology.  There is still the need to do experiments, which will create a bottleneck, and to do deep theorizing; but maybe even some of those will be done by computer.

How will it turn out?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/25kkrt/technology_is_displacing_unskilled_labour_at_an/,Haleighoumpah,1400102140,"Here is my armchair economic analysis.  I'm very curious to find out if this is way off the mark or if I have some legitimate points.  From what I gather, things will end up in one of outcomes A, B, C or D (see below). Which one is most likely?  Am I missing any?

1.	Technology improves
2.	Firms continue to find ways to replace labour with capital investments in new technology.
3.	Firm expenses are reduced, increasing profits, which increases the income flowing to the owners of capital -&gt; upward pressure on equities and economic growth.
4.	Income flowing to the unskilled workforce declines and the middle class shrinks.
5.	Credit expands to temporarily substitute for income as middle class income declines.
6.	Revenue to firms declines as middle class incomes decline and credit expansion reaches its limits (with the exception of NINJA mortgages, credit limits are always a function of incomes).
7.	Return on capital declines as revenues to firms decline, reducing the flow of income to owners of capital -&gt; downward pressure on equities and economic growth.
8.	The unskilled workforce develops stronger incentives to develop relevant skills (many government policies will try to amplify this). 
9.	Some percentage of the unskilled workforce retrains to increase their income and the rest settle with reduced, declining or no incomes. 
10.	Skills development and retraining will somewhat counter a declining middle class. -&gt; Upward pressure on equities and economic growth.

So what are some possible outcomes?

	For outcome A, B and C, suppose a small percentage of un/underemployed people are able to develop relevant skills and the unemployment rate increases significantly.

	**[OUTCOME A]** A ""base Income"", collected from owners of capital, is distributed by the government to these people who are uninterested or unable to develop a relevant skill set.  All of these people living on a base income have decent living conditions and are able to spend their free time as they please  making art , exercising, playing video games, watching TV etc. Base income allows un/underemployed people to consume more than they would without it -&gt; results in higher firm revenues -&gt; some upward pressure on equities and economic growth.

	For outcome B and C, suppose no ""base income"" is distributed by the government and any un/underemployed people who do not retrain find their living conditions decline to poverty levels.  -&gt; results in lower firm revenues -&gt; downward pressure on equities and economic growth.

	**[OUTCOME B]**  We end up with a large segment of the population who are unable to afford the necessities of life and life for them is very difficult. 

	**[OUTCOME C]** Technology makes everything so accessible and cheap that all these un/underemployed people can still live a decent life with either no income or very limited income. These people are free to spend their time as they please making art , exercising, playing video games, watching TV etc.

	For **[OUTCOME D]**, a large percentage of un/underemployed people are able to develop relevant skills after being laid off (as a result of having no skills or irrelevant skills).  The unemployment rate and labour participation rates remain at historical levels as technology continues to transform the economy.  Economic growth continues as normal.",16,44

Growth of the circulatory system in a developing organism is only necessary up to a certain point as each body part only needs so much blood to remain healthy.

I'd like some input.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/25ktk1/im_building_a_webbased_textbased_grand_strategy/,JordanLeDoux,1400107541,"So I'm programming a space-based, browser-based, text-based strategy MMO right now. It will be... very complex/immersive. Just to give you a brief idea of the kind of game it will be:

- Each player will control a species that's just graduating into interstellar travel.
- You will choose a species classification type (humanoid mammal, humanoid reptilian, humanoid saurian, morphic, energy based, etc.)
- The game will run in real time, like many MMO strategy games. This means that you can log in and take actions, but in your absence the game world will ""tick"" or progress, calculating events.
- It will run for a set period then ""reset"". Something like three months at a time.
- After the game period is over, the community of players will be allowed to vote for who was the most of several categories. (Most imperialistic, most diplomatic, etc.)
- The first few days of gameplay you will have to guide your society through the final stages of species unification and into interstellar travel. This will not actually be trivial, and some people will simply lose (become extinct) at this point.
- If your species ever becomes fully extinct, your game is over.
- All species will operate on a Resource Based Economy, where free energy is the ""currency"". That is, the energy that the species can dedicate to doing things is the only currency that you will have (sorry, no building a Ferengi empire). Labor will also be ""consumed"" in some fashion, though it will generally be less important and less difficult to grow.
- You will have to dedicate effort and energy into extracting raw materials and resources from deposits. All known elements (and some unknown ones) will be available to be extracted and refined. You will use these elements to construct things, or create other materials.
- After discovering it with materials sciences, you will be able to combine refined natural materials into new materials, or synthesize them directly if you are sufficiently advanced. (Just to give you some idea, there will be at least 200 raw materials, and at least 2,000 composite materials, but most of them you'll have to unlock.)
- Better materials will allow you to construct and discover better technologies.
- Your actual ships will be modular. You'll separately research the components, then create blue prints from the parts. You'll also select what materials (that are appropriate for the task and you have available) you'll use for each component.
- There will be space battles. They will not be mandatory. (In other words, there will be valid modes of play that do not involve armed combat.)
- If you conquer a species you can choose to exterminate them (ending that players game), subjugate them (slavery), or integrate them (make them culturally part of your species).
- If you ARE conquered, and they do not choose to exterminate you, your game play options will change, and you will attempt to ""break free"" from your new masters. (If you succeed, you will start again with a portion of their technology and resources.) Again, violent and non-violent options will be valid (but both will not work in all situations/against all players).
- In that vein, the mood and sentiment of your society will affect the options you have and the quality of those options.
- And lots of other stuff...

This is just some of the stuff I've mostly fleshed out in the game design. I'm just getting into the programming part now (which I do professionally and have over a decade of experience with). This should give you a decent idea of the *kind* of game I'm looking to make.

My question is this: from this description, what sort of ideas/features/gameplay would you be most interested in?

How much would you be willing to pay (subscription) to play a game like this (I'm going to try to simply run it at cost)?",7,6

&gt; Watson is generally promoted as helping with decision-making, but that message has to be scrutinized carefully. So far as Ive been able to guess, the true core technology of IBM Watson is extracting knowledge from text  or primarily from text  and representing it in some way that is reasonably useful in answering natural language queries. The hope would then be to eventually achieve a rich enough knowledge base to support the Star Trek computer. But automated decision-making doesnt just require knowledge; it also requires decision-making rules.

The world is leaderless. Humanity runs loose, guided only by arbitrary economic forces and outdated social instincts. As a species, we don't plan for the future; we don't foresee calamities. We have no master plan, but desperately need one. As we progress into the millennium, we move faster and faster; the time to make the correct decisions is running out. Our actions in the next few centuries will define us forever. As the human meta-organism settles in, it will become harder and harder for revolution to happen. There will be very little space for revision; if the correct foundations are not laid down, we will fail as a species. 

Despite our ingenuity as a species, we have created a prison for ourselves. Roads tell us where to go, lights tell us when to go, and the economy tells us what to do. People are driven by selfish desires, rather than a desire to contribute. There is no master plan, no common vision worth living and dying for. Our existence is self centered because we feel powerless. As the specialization of labor continues, we are individually unable to comprehend our collective existence, let alone steer it. We are but mere cogs in our unconscious collective. I aim to awaken our collective mind.

I believe that humanity has a destiny; I don't know what it is, but I know what it isn't. It isn't to destroy each other and our planet. It isn't to carelessly burn through fossil fuels and plunge back into the dark ages, and it isn't to distribute wealth as unevenly as we have. Whatever potential that humanity has, I will not see it ruined by the careless mistakes of politicians and the selfish, shortsighted goals of world leaders. 

A vision must be built which can unite all people. A message must be spread which can penetrate any culture, any race, and all people. A vision so pure as to deteriorate the puny disputes among the nations of the world. 

I would ensure that a new code of ethics is written, revolving matters of the new world: artificial intelligence, life extension, and the various side effects of globalization. I would ensure that the hardest problems of the future are dealt with as appropriately as possible. I do not trust humanity to make the right decisions on its own. I would design a creative, just, peaceful future for humankind. I would ensure that humanity spreads throughout the universe and defends itself from all calamities. I would ensure that humanity attains its destiny, rather than succumb to its fate.

Your tire pops and your vehicle becomes unstable at the exact same time a smaller vehicle with two parents and a newborn in the backseat are approaching the opposite direction at 65 mph.

It sounds over-the-top.  Also see this, even more grandiose statement:

http://www.ipsoft.com/promo/turing-centennial

On the other hand, the company has some bragging rights.  See what Gartner analysts had to say about the company:


&gt; Both Blue Prism and Interactive Media are at the first level of an extended spectrum of autonomic platforms, as these platforms primarily use structured/repeatable rule-based processes with a defined start and endpoint, such as data re-entry tasks. IBM, with Watson, is several levels higher on the spectrum; **and IPsoft's cognitive platform is the next level up from that.**

&gt; In October 2013, IBM announced the Cognitive Systems Colloquium where IBM reached out to partners in academia, industry and its client base in ""an effort to hasten and guide the progress of cognitive computing."" And just one month later, in November 2013, there was the announcement of IBM's Watson as a development platform on the cloud. Additionally, Crdit Agricole CIB in the U.S. (financial advisors) have predicted that the market for Watson-derived smart advisors will account for more than 12% of IBM's total revenue in 2018 (see ""Smart Machines Mean Big Impacts: Benefits, Risks and Massive Disruption""). Similarly, albeit with less fanfare, IPsoft is a global managed services provider of autonomic-based services that is also generating a significant amount of interest and insider buzz within the IT services marketplace. **Gartner analysis of IPsoft's cognitive platforms is that its approach is a breakthrough innovation in service delivery and serves as a proof point for the end of outsourcing as we know it. Gartner verified over 10 direct examples of IPsoft client references that all unanimously supported productivity benefits of a much higher magnitude (consistently over 50%) than any other managed services offerings in the industry. It's rare to find a unanimous endorsement of this type. One client example had 56% of its client incidents resolved without human intervention and a 60% reduction in the mean time to resolution for its IT service desk.**

This means that certain sites will need to pay Comcast or your mobile carrier a structured fee, otherwise they will not be allowed to stream content to your client device.

Recently I've been going through the paperwork of trying to start a startup with a friend of mine. However, this change in policy is going to start impacting cloud services **HARD.** The purpose of this policy is to funnel revenue from the hands of content creators or internet retailers into the hands of the ISPs. Within a year, it's going to accelerate the death cycle on startups, and make the market for new ones essentially impossible (without sponsorship/approval by big players.)

Have you heard of ""internet of things"" which is often talked about in this sub? Where people have wearables and all your devices are synced to the net and then usable to analyze everything from health to climate? This new FCC policy will likely push this reality off by another decade or so.

This new policy might also shutdown a vast array of distributed technologies. Distributed systems have no central authority by which to pay off ISP data usage rates. This will kill (or significantly hurt) the following:

* High bandwidth usage connected devices
* Cyptocurrency &amp; DACs
* VPNs and Onion networks
* Torrents and any P2P
* Small services with WebRTC
* Scientific projects using BOINC
* Startups hosting on AWS, Azure, Heroku will see massive rate hikes
* Sites which significantly rely on aggregating services through an API (iftt.com, etc)

**My prediction:** By Q4 2015, we will experience a larger recession than the one in 2008, triggered first by another DotCom bust. This will have a long term destructive impact on the future of the US and will have global repercussions.

At this stage, the hostile political climate of lobbyist-&gt;committee-chair is putting progress into reverse for the US economy. **Comcast has lobbied to destroy the American Future, and they won.** 

This new policy is not fight-able in a kangaroo court. We do have 120 days to protest this policy, but nothing short of an internet ""Freedom March"" or widescale domestic disturbance will change the minds of the FCC panel.

I think it's time for entrepreneurial types and scientists to abandon the United States and emigrate to better conditions. Which countries have the most favorable internet conditions and are most open to immigration?

What are your predictions for the impact from this new policy?

**Edit:** Would anybody be interested in starting a petition that would show congress how much business would get lost if this legislation passes? It would state your occupation, onlline assets, and how this would affect you. 

(Example: I own a business/website and this law would cause me to emigrate or to close my business in the US) 

On the plus side, anybody who expedites American emigration to foreign countries could do very well for themselves in these circumstances. I'd move to Europe, Iceland or New Zealand in a heartbeat if it were easy.

Is there any action that the people can take? Not much, but you can [follow the step here.](https://www.dearfcc.org/)",117,305

Interview Text
-------------------------------------------------------------------
**Why this book now?**

We have learned more about the brain in the last 10 years than in the entire history of mankind. Now there is telepathy, can move objects with his mind, simple register and download memories, dreams or photograph. Thanks to physics, we can see how blood moves into the brain, primarily oxygen, and see the neuronal activity, thoughts. We can also connect the brain to a computer and then the internet. Ultimately, the Internet will become a network of the brain ( brain- net). We may share thoughts and emotions on the network. Young people will love. Not only may put on Facebook what they are doing, but the memory of course prom or first date. We will have two albums in the future, genome, all the genes in our body, and the connectome, the map of neural connections with memories, feelings and personality. Everything will be on two discs. Obama and the EU invest in short term this because we understand mental illness. In the long term, we can live forever. Even after death, our genome and our mental map survive. We can resurrect sensations and memories. In a sense, we become immortal.

**When will it be accessible to any brain-computer connection?**

The Pentagon is spending tens of millions of dollars in prosthetic legs, arms and robotic skeletons because there are thousands of war wounded from Iraq and Afghanistan. In the World Cup in Brazil a person who is partially paralyzed will launch the kick off thanks to an exoskeleton. Now we can connect the mind of a person with a spinal injury to a computer to do the same to anyone. My colleague Stephen Hawking is completely paralyzed , only flashes. But the right lens of his glasses have a chip with an antenna connected to a notebook that allows you to communicate and mentally. In the next decade , people with paralysis can move and communicate. The first to be connected will be the victims of sports injuries , strokes or car accidents. Later, we can create people with superpowers. We have already downloaded memories in animals. Last year , it was in North Carolina: I grab a mouse, you connect your hippocampus you record two electrons and the messages that travel through the hippocampus when learning a task. Then forget it. But if you insert the memory in the animal, the mouse does good job on the first try.

**Which is closer?**

The short-term goal is to build a pacemaker for the brain of Alzheimer's patients, for the millions who do not know where they live or who they are. In the future, you will have a button shall squeeze and remember who you are, where you live and where you need to go. In this decade we animal studies , recording and downloading memories, and the next we will do with humans. In the 2030s, we can download complex tasks, such as for workers who have to learn new skills because their jobs have become obsolete or youth skipped a course at the University.

**What has surprised you most?**

The longer we can photograph a thought. In Berkeley, put patients on a brain scan and convert 30,000 points in mind. These points represent the brain flows. A computer analyzes and creates a picture of the thoughts. The pictures are blurry because we are in the initial phase.

**Who are we if our consciousness can be downloaded?**

How would the former president Bill Clinton, it depends on how you define who you are. When you die, there may be a soul. Or maybe there is nothing left, but if I have the genome and the information in your brain, I can recreate. The question is, are you? If there is a map of your brain connections, a part of you survives. As with a recording. That part of you survives. This can raise your personality and your desires because it is connected to the genome and that's what you are. Who are we? The extreme view is that we are information.

**A robot with a human mind is downloaded ?**

If you speak like a human and has a personality like a human, maybe we can call it that. In the future , we can have a library of souls like today can read biographies or movies of people who have died. You can talk to them. If you were a politician, would not you want to talk to Winston Churchill? Your grandchildren will have access to the library where they can have a conversation with you, even if not perfect.

**What are the most urgent ethical boundaries ?**

The drug to forget traumatic experiences, which has been rejected by the bioethics committee of the President, and is generating debate. There will be much discussion also with the brain pacemaker. What if memories are downloaded wrong? What if the memory of a crime you did not commit is downloaded to your mind? Have a memory of you killed someone, but you did not. We have laws to regulate or false memories are downloaded without permission.

I'm new to futurology and not good at being put on the spot, so I didn't have answers for him. 

I suppose one argument would be that companies with mostly human workers wouldn't be able to compete with largely automated ones. I'm sort of stumped on the other points he raised. What do you guys think?",22,24

After pretty positive feedback, we have decided to implement this system.

This tag is now up and running and ready for use. **To activate this system simply put [in-depth] in your topic title**. This works for links and self posts.

What does this do?

* a minumum of 100 characters is enforced for all comments
* moderators will be more strict in removing jokes, puns, etc. that do not contribute to a deeper level to the conversation
* we will be stricter on maintaining a civil conversation.

I would like to point out that we will continue to enforce the current rules on non in-depth posts. *This does not mean that non in-depth discussions are a freeforall*.

We eventually hope to expand the moderator staff to help with keeping these discussions clean. In the meantime feel free to report junk and to modmail us if you see any problems.

Most recreational drugs we have today are the result of medical research producing drugs that turned out to have recreational value. Targeted research to develop recreational drugs is not being done because institutions like the FDA only allow drugs that have medical value.

My hope is one day in the not too far future people will see the folly of this recreational drugs prohibition era, and give people back their liberty of making their own decisions with regard to what they consume. 

Drugs will be regulated, produced purely, and sold like medicine in recreational pharmacies. The drugs will be sold with scientifically based warnings, and recommended dosages for responsible use.

Once this market is in place pharmaceutical companies could be allowed to produce better drugs. So think of drugs that have less chance of overdose, lower addictive potential, and target more specific receptors. These drugs can be used quite responsibly and people can choose to have a good time without fear of government.

A side benefit is that many recreational drugs might turn out to have medical benefits in psychiatry for example. Like recent research has suggested profound benefits of drugs like LSD, MDMA, psilocybin, Ketamine, in treating conditions such as PTSD, anxiety, treatment resistant depression.",31,15

Each time it follows a similar pattern: a new discovery opens a new frontier of technological development, then there's a gold rush as people and companies try to take advantage of this new wild west, then eventually development slows down and becomes more orderly as what can and can't be done becomes well established -- the frontier has been colonized.

We've had a long sequence of consecutive wild wests, where one new frontier opens up as another closes. The steam engine enabled revolutionary new ways of working and traveling, ushering the industrial revolution. As the potential for steam became well understood, electricity and the many new inventions it enabled came on the forefront. When we started running out of new inventions using just electricity, electronics was developed and changed everything. Then computers opened up a new world of possibilities. When the killer apps started becoming sparser, the internet became mainstream and changed everything yet again.

Now, I feel like the internet is getting pretty well colonized. There's still new development, of course, but it feels much more orderly and corporate than the gold rush of 1999. I don't feel like there's been a ""big new thing"" online since Facebook exploded in popularity in 2007. That was 7 years ago -- an eternity in online time. Smartphones, while important, are basically portable computers and not a brand new frontier.

I feel like the world is ready for the next technological wild west, but I'm not sure what it could be. Nanotechnology? Lots of hype but few results so far. Artificial Intelligence? It's been 20 years away for the last 50 years. What do you see as the new frontier that will change everything?",97,49

It takes me almost 3 and a half hours to travel via car from Pittsburgh to Buffalo (roughly 215 miles). How long, and what will the means of transportation be, to do this trip in say an hour (less ?) I understand I can take a plane and get there faster, but what I mean is what will the next tech be that expedites the travel time? Mag trains? Something else?

Basically what I'm asking is; **How far away are we from the next fastest way to travel between states/distances that dont require flight?**

Would be interested to see what the future of travel is like !

With this, a computer can read whole paragraphs -- not just sentences -- and understand the sentiment and semantics, even if the sentences are malformed, and even if they use informal language. (It's not really ""reading"" in the way that humans read; and it's not able to really understand... and it's fairly shallow... but it's still impressive!)

The method improves upon a whole host of previous algorithms for sentiment analysis and information retrieval -- in some cases, the improvements are stunning.

Imagine using this to read through your emails to locate topics you feel strongly about; or perhaps to give you the ability to locate emails based on a very rough, vague description  of the contents, not just using keywords or synonym substitutions.  

And just think of where this kind of tech will be in 5 years, following a few more generations of improvement.  Google may appear to understand people so well that they do a double-take, and wonder if it is sentient.  (Sentient AI is still a long ways away, but machine reading is nearly here.)

Over the past few decades, it has become the dominant operating system globally. Logically, most reasonable people recognize that infinite growth can't exist on a finite planet forever. Due to capitalism spreading around the world, too many people today are consuming and polluting unsustainably while debt has grown out of control. Resources are becoming increasingly scarce and biological ecosystems polluted.  Human programming must address these new realities or the consequences will be destructive. Fortunately, new technology can sustainably create a better life for everyone by transforming the current narrative. The urgent question facing us all is how will civilization evolve from the control of labor based industrial capitalism to the freedom of technology driven automation?

I think that the change from 1950-80 was bigger than the change from 1980-2010 for example. We had this huge computer revolution that changed lot, but if you exclude computers, I think not much change has happened. Think about things like space travel, medicine etc and I think that we are actually getting diminishing returns because we are facing exponentially more complex problems. 

Only thinks that have been subject to Moore's law have been really progressing, like reading genetic code. But things like gene therapy have been hyped from 80s but not much of real progress have been made.

- How can we improve our planet without causing mass poverty?
- How can we prepare for the FUTURE if we are held back by finances?
- Should we be willing to let a few million die for the sake of the future?

I welcome any and all critism on this subject. 

Humans will definitely become cyborgs/androids as technology progresses. Our current line will incorporate technology into ourselves and create a technologically enhanced version of a humanoid being. We will have superior prosthetic limbs compared to our biological counter part and that will set a shift in our society like we have never seen before. But we will also start seeing humans manipulate the human genetic code so that we can create ''pure breds''. Void of all genetic defects and alterations. These pure breds will be superior to our current biological counter parts. I'm foreseeing a time where pure breds will not want to breed with androids because of their inferior genetic code. Yes you have upgraded eyes, arms, legs, and a Internet connected chip in your brain but your underlying genetic code isn't as good as mine. The theory of evolution proclaims that for a species to proliferate only the most adapted genetic code will be passed on in the offspring so why would a pure bred breed with a genetically inferior Android? This will cause a social divide in our future. A new form of racism. Androids will have it hard in the beginning since they will be the first form of neo-humanoids to walk the earth. Current humans will create an outlash against them. Once more people '' upgrade'' to this the resistance will fade. But pure breds will have been born perfect. And androids will always have traces of inferiority in their genetic code from the days of their earlier stage of evolution. 

Now which branch of humanoids will outlast the other? Androids have the significant advantage in this since they use materials that don't undergo the effects of aging. Albeit pure breds will be able to leave for 120+ years or more they won't be able to compete with materials that aren't affected by cosmic rays/radiation. Pure breds will start to incorporate Android peripherals and then we will start seeing a mass acceptance of complete Android humanoids. These new beings will still be considered human based solely on their origins and not their current genetic makeup. 

Throwing this out there to see what people think about this concept.",7,0

Personally, I feel this idea is terrible, but it does bring to light something that is being wasted as a resource, the road medians.  This is the section between highways that usually has grass on it, see Google maps image below.

So here is my relatively simple idea.  Take solar panels configured in a raised rack system.  Place these raised racks on either side of the road (perhaps 2 deep in some big areas of the medians).  This would now allow you to have intermittent energy generation in the medians.

Now here comes the really fun part.  In the middle of the median, plant a lot of hybrid grass.  This grass can be cut and made into pellets to feed into a biomass system.  They can also be easily stored in a warehouse when they are not being burned.  With that in mind, you now have a way to generate base load power.  This means that you have the intermittent energy from solar, but you don't need to store it because you can burn the grass pellets to generate base load power.

When looking at New Jersey Route 55 alone (a 40 mile tract of road), you could generate as much as 40 MWs of electricity from solar and likely a similar amount of energy from the hybrid grass.

What do you all think?

An oncoming vehicle is coming in the other direction and you have a cliff or severe embankment on your right. If the self-driving car detects the oncoming vehicle and the moose will it be programmed to avoid the moose (possibly hitting the oncoming car and injuring other people), hit the moose (causing massive damage to the car and its occupants), or will it just jam on the breaks and hope for the best?

Another scenario that I was thinking of is if there is an intersection where the self-driving vehicle detects that an accident is imminent. The only way to avoid this accident is to hit a motorcyclist with a helmet or hit one without a helmet. Assuming we want to avoid the chance of injury as much as possible, it stands to reason that the vehicle would choose to hit the one with the helmet (even though they chose to be safer than the one without protection).

Are these scenarios being addressed (or discussed) at this point?

Note - I know that self-driving cars will be much safer, but they cannot prevent all accidents - especially during early adoption when there will still be human drivers on the road.

Living in the wild going where the food is going where you need to go too. From what ive read 10,000 years ago we as a species started settling down. Some of ceased our nomadic lifestyle and replaced it with a static structure and farm lands. This 'civilized' culture spread and now the majority of the world is like this. Through this shift in our living habits we have good things and bad, our technological leaps and bounds have been staggering especially in the last 200 years. 

I would like to think that one day humans could return to this nomadic lifestyle, living in harmony with the environment. But alas our planet is probably too crowded for us all to become nomadic again, i would imagine many would not want to. After all we have been like this for thousands of years now.

My thoughts turned to the stars, with more advanced methods of storing power (carbon batteries / sugar batteries) being developed coupled with better solar panels and of course fusion reactors on the cusp we have our power needs almost taken care off. Plasma propulsion systems being tested and theoretical warp drives we have our locomotion. 

My question is, could/should man return to our nomadic ways? 
what technologies would we need? and what would it be like?

Somewhat anecdotal:


I believe I have noticed a radical change in my own lifetime. I've always been engaged with technology and I admit that it has shaped me. I was born in the mid-80s and spent a lot of time in front of a computer growing up. Back then, though, it wasn't common and I got a lot of flak for it from my parents, teachers, friends and so on. Now the average child of today spends significantly more time engaging with a wide variety of technologies than I did growing up (and back in the 90s my case was seen as excessive). 


Whereas I had balance and my parents pushed me to be outside as much as possible playing in the old fashioned way, a lot of kids these days don't have that balance at all and spend most of their time on Facebook, playing games, browsing the internet and so on. They're living the lives I could only fantacize about 20 years ago. 


Now that I'm almost 30 I can see a growing difference between my peers and what I imagine the previous generation was like at our age. For starters: I think that the previous generation(s) was better at tolerating different kinds of people because *they had to*. They had to be friends with the people around them or else they'd have no friends. There was nothing to keep them connected to far away people. 


We have the option of basically leveraging technology to carve out our own clique even if that means we don't spend as much time around people (due to time and distance). We construct our own ideal image of ourselves online, cultivate a network with people we'd ideally like to be around at the centre of it (often regardless of their physical proximity to us) and spend a great deal of time refining this image and maintaining these connections (as superficial as they may actually be). 


I also think that the information age has caused people to start forming factions/allegiances based on their stance on things with factors like geography and nationality becoming less and less significant with regards to how they choose to align themselves. People cultivate their own and each other's ""likes"" (interests) and inadvertantly cause rifts between themselves and people who could once be close to them. 


My parents grew up with such a limited amount of things available for them to consume at any given time and as I grew up this began to intensify. Now there are no limits. As a result, people spend more and more time leveraging the internet to widdle their peer groups down to people who are more and more identical to them at which point they begin to use this ""community"" as a place through which to filter, share and communicate things of interest, thereby establishing themselves as a community regardless of formerly limiting factors like age, location, gender, etc. 


Now it seems like people on the internet are beginning to align themselves with ""camps"" (I think I'm writing to one, heh). People in X camp have XYZ opinions on XYZ topics and identical political views, while listening to similar music, etc. It's like the internet feeds our compulsion to keep defining ourselves to the point where it reshapes our identity and our social landscape. 

I will concede that my peer group =/= my generation however I think more and more people will become like this as the majority of people live out more and more of their lives online. 


**TL;DR** In short, my personal experience of the technologies that defined the last two decades is that they've changed the way my generation and the following generation interact with one another. I don't know if it's good or bad; maybe it's the beginning of a ""Type 1"" civilization like Michio Kaku said wherein all people see themselves as part of a global, interconnected consiousness or something. Maybe the internet is a force that will change the social fabric of the world and it might already be signalling the end of our antiquated political process and the way in which people establish their unique identity and place within society (self, family, community, nation etc). 


All this being said, what changes have you noticed in your lifetime with regard to how people establish their identity and relate to one another as a consequence of new technologies? 


How do you suspect it will change into the future?

He (?) also links to [Focus Fusion](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/focus-fusion-empowertheworld--3/x/7181173), an IndieGoGo crowdfunded start-up exploring [Dense Plasma Focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_plasma_focus) as a fusion energy technology.

/u/blueboxpolice offers Wikpedia's  [List of Nuclear Power Accidents by Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_power_accidents_by_country) with specific attention to France.

/u/bensully offers the _99% Invisible_ article ""[Episode 114: Ten Thousand Years](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/ten-thousand-years/)"", on the challenges of building out waste disposal.

Several pointers to Kirk Sorenson, of course, see his site at:  http://energyfromthorium.com/  Of particular interest from /u/Petrocrat, the [ORNL Document Repository](http://energyfromthorium.com/ornl-document-repository/#ResourceCenter) with documents related to liquid-halide (fluoride and chloride) reactor research and development.

/u/billdietrich1 provides a link to his blog, ""[Why nuclear energy is bad](http://www.billdietrich.me/Reason/ReasonConsumption.html#nuclear)"" citing waste management, a preference for decentralized power systems, the safety profile (with particular emphasis on Japan), and Wall Street's shunning of nuclear investments.  Carbon balance (largely from plant construction), mining energy costs, decomissioning costs, disaster cleanup ($100 billion+ from Fukushima), Union of Concerned Scientists statements of reactor operator financial responsibility.  LFTR is addressed, with concerns on cost and regulation.

/u/networkingguru offers the documentary _[Pandora's Promise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_Promise)_:  ""a 2013 documentary film about the nuclear power debate, directed by Robert Stone. Its central argument is that nuclear power, which still faces historical opposition from environmentalists, is a relatively safe and clean energy source which can help mitigate the serious problem of anthropogenic global warming.""

/u/LAngeDuFoyeur offers nuclear advocate James Conca _Forbes_ essay ""[How Deadly Is Your Kilowatt? We Rank The Killer Energy Sources](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/)

While it doesn't principally address nuclear power, the IPCC's ""[IPCC, 2011: IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation. Prepared by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/)"" gives a very broad overview of energy alternatives, and includes a fatality risks (per GWe-yr) for numerous energy technologies which I've included as a comment given the many assertions of safety concerning nuclear power.

A number of comments referred to risks and trust generally -- I'm familiar with several excellent works on this subject, notably [Charles Perrow](http://www.powells.com/s3?author=perrow%2C+charles).  I see this as an area in which arguments could stand to be strengthened on both sides.  See /u/blueboxpolice, /u/ultio, /u/Kydra, /u/Gnolaum.

**Thought Process**

*Cops (like everyone) use money for basic needs

*Basic needs like food, water &amp; housing (mainly among other things)


Then I thought to myself, there's an overarching problem here:
Most people work because they have a passion and also need money to pay for basic amenities, so what if basic amenities were automated could they be made free?

    Also people can do jobs for free because they love the job but not to get food to live another day. (Two birds one stone).


Its a broad concept that I'm struggling to flesh out (and its kind of utopian) but:


**Electricity**

I initially started with food but I realize it boils down to power.
Where I am energy is produced hydroelectrically so the only dependent factor is how much water is there in the lake. The process can operate without people. Algorithms can fluctuate pipes openings to alter water flow depending on the lakes levels and distributing the produced electricity. This isn't so applicable in all areas. Expense? The electricity the software would need to power itself and maintenance of equipment.

**Water**

This like electricity production is a process that can be automated.
From the chemistry I've done the chemicals (Magnesium, chlourine)  for the only expense I see. Software can hand the purification process. No need for paying salaries.

**Food**

From the limited agriculture I've done, you need fertilizer, *water* and sunlight are the main necessities for farming. Not all crops can be farmed automatically but most can. With current imaging software and pH testing can a machine tell is a tomato is ripe and good to go? They get plucked by robots arms and into packaging. The process would need water (free), fertilizer (can be made free or paid for by government*), electricity (free). Sprinklers come on at a certain time harvest is automated and the process continues.


**So?**

Why isn't as much money going to such a basic need like water food and electricity but on cars. If they can trust cars to drive autonomously why not invest in robots that grow our food or produce water autonomously.


**Critic of my system**

Now before people get snarky and say ""what about people undervaluing these services and abusing them?"" Quotas can be made to regulate the maximum food or water per capita.

    **I know this concept sounds communist and will be of putting for some but I just want to know what people think about science investing in the automation of food and water production.**

*Government get their money from taxes but I'm sure there is a way around this.


**||TLDR||**

*Should we automate food and water production, eliminate work force and make it a free service?*",13,10

There are many such 'unmonopolisable therapies' including second uses for off-patent drugs, supplements, diets and lifestyle interventions. The ability to enforce a monopoly price has no relevance to clinical efficacy.

Governments bailing out the financial system by forcing massive debts and obligations upon future generations simply engineered financial slavery for many in this generation and beyond.

Unless society evolves beyond the current narrative, inequality, fear, and anger will only increase as enviroments and ecosystems deteriorate for everyone around the world.

In the mean time, since money has become the debts, obligations, and resources of future generations, people must ask whether we have become financial slaves or financial pedophiles?

DNA is at the same time the most complex programing language ever devised and the simplest. 4 letters that can be arranged into 3 letter words only, these words how ever can be used to create sentences of any length; be it 1000 letters long or 300 billion. If one could learn the language of DNA one could dream of limitless possibilities. The structures you could make from the labors of DNA, the materials you could coax into existence simply by gradually creating a need for them to exist in a colony of bacteria. Want a material that is incredibly heat resistance. Slowly turn the temperature up in a controlled environment filled with resources, gradual enough change will allow the bacteria to survive the ever increasing temperature. You could do the same with any situation you can think of. You need not even know how it works and that is the beauty of it, even without knowing the language you could solve any problem given time, knowing the language would only cut the time out of the equation. 

Technology can not do these things. It can not self sustain, it cannot solve any problem given time, it requires constant coaxing, nothing will be created from it if left by itself. Nor does it have the adaptability of biology. So many futurists are willing to abandon biology for technology, to throw away the gifts of a laboratory that has functioned by itself for 4 billion years. To abandon it for a laboratory of our own design that has existed for a few thousand. Why start from stratch in an inferior lab when the place of the experimenter is left open in the far more ancient and far more profitable lab. Without any guide biology created us, the possibilities if it was give a guide are endless.

This way, metabolism still falls to a crawl, but the body is not forced to rely on anaerobic respiration (the reason why current suspended animation technology could only keep pigs alive for a few hours after traumatic injury).

These more advanced civilizations could send out self replicating probes. To report back when a civilization reaches type 1 status. The transition to type 1 status is the most dangerous of all transitions. 

The idea of the probes would be enabling peace coexistence between civilizations in the galaxy by determining how much of a threat the civilization is. The probes would be useful because there may be way to many civilizations to keep track of, but most of them may not survive to reach type 1.


My first thought was similar to the movie 2001 space odyssey. With a device on the moon. But we could potentially discover it on the moon before we reach type 1 status. Which is why I have come to a different conclusion. 

The probe would likely only listen in. And not report back to its civilization until it decides to contact us or is requesting permission to contact us. It would also red a hiding place that's not too close and not too far away. I was thinking that disguising itself as an asteroid in the asteroid belt would be simple enough to hide from us until it wants to make contact. 

As for the self replicating part. I doubt they would want to start replicating in a solar system that could potentially have an advanced civilization. They would probably want to replicate in a lifeless solar system nearby ones that have a high chance of developing an advanced civilization.

For clarification, I am loosely using the Kardashev scale when taking about what type a civilization is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale",49,26

Just as the tractor/cotton gin made agricultural slavery an obsolete control system in the 1800s, technology makes the need to force people to labor, or become indebted, for money obsolete. As technology reduces the need for people to labor in jobs, it is becoming harder for people to access financial assets/money. Without financial assets, people are treated like slaves in the current financially based culture. Government bailing out those holding control in the financial system, without bailing out the rest of its citizens, engineered the biggest inequality of wealth in human history. This injustice was perpetrated by imposing fraudulent public obligations and debts on society to support the private wealth of a few. Those backing this immoral action are direct participants in a rigged game that's bankrupting our future. Unless society evolves beyond the current narrative, inequality, fear, and anger will only increase as conditions deteriorate for everyone around the world.",94,65

We are seeking a Chief Web Developer, and since we are looking for someone passionate about futures studies, we thought this subreddit would be the best place to look.

The Millennium Project was founded in 1996 after a three-year feasibility study with the United Nations University, Smithsonian Institute, Futures Group International, and the American Council for the UNU. It is now an independent non-profit global participatory futures research think tank of futurists, scholars, business planners, and policy makers who work for international organizations, governments, corporations, NGOs, and universities. The Millennium Project manages a coherent and cumulative process that collects and assesses judgments from over 4,5000 people since the beginning of the project selected by its 50 Nodes around the world. It is focused on improving the future prospects for all of mankind, not for an individual region, government, industry, special interest, or ideology.

This Chief Web Developer position is provisional. It will exist for at least the next three months, and will continue on after that for as long as it remains financially viable. It is possible that you could perform amazingly, but that the position will need to be cut in a few months anyways, for purely financial reasons. We work on a very tight budget, and income is somewhat unpredictable. 

The position pays $50k per year, and can be done 100% remotely through telecommuting, or if you prefer, you can work locally at our office in Washington DC. You would have a lot of influence over the executive decisions regarding the direction that the organization takes with respect to web development.

A successful candidate should have experience with Full Stack development, with a heavy focus on Javascript and Node.JS. The main project currently in the works is the Global Futures System at https://themp.org.  The system is running on Amazon EC2 servers, with Ubuntu, Node.JS and MongoDB. It uses a modified Backbone.JS framework. The more familiar you are with these technologies, the better.

Another big project currently in the works is a national integrated information system for a developing country. It is meant to serve as a national system to help the people to collaboratively and productively work through the future of their country, and will hopefully lead to less unproductive turmoil than they would have otherwise. It is an unprecedented investment by a government in a publicly open system for shaping the future of a country.

The Chief Executive Officer Jerome Glenn, and myself, will be traveling to the developing country sometime in the next few months in order to meet with the heads of all the government ministries to do training and receive feedback on the system. We are also planning the Millennium Project yearly meeting a couple months from now in the Dominican Republic. Last year the meeting was held during the Baku Futures Forum in Baku, Azerbaijan. The year prior, it was held in Toronto, Canada.

If you join the team, it is possible/likely that you would be invited on similar trips in the future.

We are looking to choose a candidate ASAP so we can get the training process started. If you are interested in the position, please email a resume and cover letter to Wes.Boyer@millennium-project.org. If you have any questions about the position, feel free to ask in the comments, message me through reddit, or email the questions to the email address above. ",4,23

The Federation has been watching our progress closely and has aided us in our advancement.They're even lowered excess energy in the Sun to stabilize it as shown below:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR7NIwY5y1A

Aliens aren't evil,they just know we aren't advanced enough yet and this solar system isn't safe/profitable enough.

Our Sun isn't big enough to open a plasma mine without destroying nearby life.Do not be mistaken though,there are hostile races in our universe.We are just protected as the Federation laws state they must protect races who haven't reached at least type II civilization tech.Once we get classified as type II we'll be contacted and offered a minor seat at the federation.If we deny it,we're on our own and will receive no further contact from the federation.

However, we will get coordinates to the galaxy's most hostile/friendly populated areas and to the federation's base if we ever reach type III civilization space tech which will allow us to colonize.Very few races have achieved this alone without killing themselves into extinction,but the ones who have quickly become the most advanced civilization catagory:type IIII.

Usually those who achieve type 4 don't really need any help from the federation and are usually watched very closely by them as possible enemies as they're the most intelligent races in the universe and are very rare.

One day we will meet them.If we reach type 4 we will be eligible for a grand federation seat.

It's known that newly created companies generally have much larger revenue per employee than those in the past. I think with automation this trend will continue and even get stronger.

But let's start with current numbers: apple does $2million/employee,facebook does $1million,and google does $500k.

Let's take the average $1.16 million/employee. 

Today the u.s. gdp is 16 trillion. Let's assume it will be $20 trillion. 

Divide 20 trillion by 1.16 million , and you get 17 million employees in the whole economy, down from today's 155 million. That's almost 90% unemployment without accounting for population growth. 

So , what do you think?

So presently if I make a song or movie or book and sell it to PersonA for $5 (after costs), I get paid for my work.  It took me a long time to make that content, so I expect to be paid for it.  In fact, I may be relying on that money.  The idea would be that every person that bought my content would net me $5, and should pay for my current lifestyle and allow me to create new content in the future.  
However, with piracy, that one copy of content I sold to PersonA is being given to PersonB, C and D without netting me any money.  As piracy grows as a trend, people like me may not be able to support myself on my creative endeavours alone.  
People have suggested other avenues for reimbursement.  ""Pay what you can"" schemes, live concerts, merchandise, etc.  However, in an increasingly digital technology, ""being there"" will be less important.  3D printing will lead to physical piracy.  So on and so forth.  All of the avenues for payment will probably dry up as the technology moves forward.  
   
The creative industry (movies, books, music, etc) isn't the only facet facing a looming financial threat.  With automation ripping forward, we're going to see self-driving vehicles, automated restaurants, automated surgeons and anesthesiologists.  So on and so forth.  There's been a lot of talk in /r/futurology on how we, as a society, will have to adjust to a fully automatic workforce.  How will we pay for things?  Where will our revenue come from?  
  
The common solution to the Automation Issue has been to establish a Basic Income.  Whether that will come to pass or not has yet to be seen.  But that seems to be the majority opinion on this sub.  
  
I wonder if that is also the solution for piracy.  If content creators receive a BI, then the concerns about piracy are largely academic.  The artist in question will continue to be able to produce content.  The distribution becomes far faster and easier if piracy isn't illegal, but is actually expected and required (and no longer 'piracy').  
  

Perhaps I missed the thread where everyone already reached this conclusion, but if not... thoughts?  Any massive flaws I'm missing?  Of course, artistic content isn't the only content being pirated.  What happens to content-producing companies?  Is there a company-BI that should be implemented?  What about big-budget movies and TV shows?  The actors may get a BI, but who pays for all the stuff required to make the shows?

As [seen in the video](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/just-press-go-designing-self-driving.html) they are different than the [Velodyne LiDAR](http://velodynelidar.com/lidar/lidar.aspx)

Specs from the [New Yorker article](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/11/25/131125fa_fact_bilger?currentPage=all)
&gt; At the tech meeting I attended, Levandowski showed the team a video of Googles newest laser, slated to be installed within the year. It had more than twice the range of previous modelseleven hundred feet instead of two hundred and sixtyand thirty times the resolution. At three hundred feet, it could spot a metal plate less than two inches thick. The laser would be about the size of a coffee mug, he told me, and cost around ten thousand dollarsseventy thousand less than the current model.

From a [Re/Code article](http://recode.net/2014/05/27/googles-new-self-driving-car-ditches-the-steering-wheel/)
&gt; It also has newer and better sensors that give it the ability to see whats going on up to a distance of two football fields. For example, on the most current version of the retrofitted self-driving Lexus, a mounted laser has about a 12-degree field of view that it uses to essentially zoom in on details of points of interest. **On the prototype car, the lasers have full 360-degree views. Its going from looking just in front, like a flashlight, to a lantern all around the car, said self-driving car project director Chris Urmson.**

Books like Dune have the Bene Gesserit, and Ancillary Justice (the recent Nebula winner) has the Radch empire; What do we have?

I understand there is some organization on paper called the United Nations, but I'm looking for something along the lines of a whole person/society doctrine.  It seems we could do more to combine our individual achievements, bring them into a firm educational program, and research what doesn't work. An example would be the teaching of a mandatory unified martial art system that also expounds nutrition, human biology, and medicine.

I can't expect any government not to be unbiased and logical with a project like this, but I'd like to see more effort from our technical specialists.

I'd also like to non-verbally pass on paragraphs of meaning with the raise of an eyebrow or the twitch of a finger.

It made me wonder, what other aspects of our technological society can be tied backwards to the musings of philosophers and story tellers of the past? 

Do our spaceships and interplanetary robots somehow tie back to ancient mythologies of the human consciousness leaving earth? 

Does our nano-technology, 3-d printing, and medicine do the same? 

Recently, on a trip to Las Vegas, the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility got my buddies and I thinking, and we realized that we have slowly begun to harness the sun as a source of energy, much like our planetary friends, the green plants! They're WAY ahead because they've got MILLIONS of years of evolution on us as species, but hey, we are making progress! 

Anyway, I guess this is an inquiry to find some interesting and thought provoking comparisons and contrasts between technology today, the expected technology of tomorrow, and how it all comes together for us as a species throughout our entire existence.

2048,2014-5-29,2014,5,29,13,26rgrd,"My prediction for the next decade of mobile computing (the near future of smartphones, tablets and AR)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/26rgrd/my_prediction_for_the_next_decade_of_mobile/,[deleted],1401339524,"


Pretty much any mid to high range smartphone (including some low end ones) or tablet to have come out in the past year or so is capable of pretty much everything I could imagine someone wanting to do on a device with such a form factor. Hardware wise, there is enough under the hood on most of these devices to run anything a typical user could possibly want to run without a hitch.


There are still things left to be desired regarding the wireless infrastructure in a lot of regions and battery life is a huge issue with the current generation of smartphones but when considering performance vs. the kinds of software the typical user would run on a smartphone, we're well into the realm of diminishing returns wherein people are beginning to care significantly more about battery life than they are about processor speed, the number of pixels per square inch and so forth. 


I can imagine some neat uses of smartphones that haven't been fully flushed out yet such as more-than-incremental improvements to cameras, high quality Pico projectors, and using smartphones as a stand in for laptops/desktops by enabling them to run through keyboards and monitors; however these kinds of applications won't be enough on their own to necessitate smartphones indefinitely. 


That being said, I don't think it's a stretch to say that 2014/15 are going to be the years where people's preferences in smartphones and tablets shift towards devices with a long battery life and cheap devices that offer comparable performance with high end devices for the average user doing average things.


It might seem like smartphones and tablets are still the ""next generation"" of mobile computing but I would attribute that to ""culture lag"" regarding the public's perception of them. Given the kind of devices they are, from a hardware standpoint, they're starting to hit a wall. That's not to say they're going to be replaced by something else, rather that in order to keep people spending the same amount they had been spending on mobile technology (or more) companies are going to have to start pushing the next paradigm.  


I've always felt that such devices were never meant to be anything more than a transitionary, puberty-like phase of mobile computing, anyway. Touchscreens are awkward and cumbersome at best and even keyboards aren't ideal when it comes to transcribing one's thoughts yet most keyboard users can type in circles around someone clumsily inputing data on a touchscreen. Even the most adept users fumble with touchscreens and make typing mistakes regularly. 


Their popularity persists because there is an inherent appeal to devices with these dimensions and we put up with them because they're the first form of truly mobile computing that is worthwhile for us to use; though in the long term I can't see small rectangles with uniformly flat surfaces as being the ideal way humans will want to interact with technology regardless of what (short sighted) tech pundits say. What we want is mobile technology that we can interact with intuitively with speed and comfort to the same degree we can with our current desktops (or better). Touchscreen-based devices are a step in the right direction but by no means there (nor will they ever be in this form regardless of what powers them or how long their battery lives are). 


Taking this into account, I think (basic) AR devices tethered to smartphones is going to be the next phase of mainstream mobile platforms. ""Smartwatches"" will bridge the gap between smartphones and the first generation of decent AR devices but I can't imagine them as being any more than a peripheral that some people have as they're nothing more than touchscreens that are more convenient. 


Ubiquitous, standalone AR devices are the future but for some time before that, smartphones or maybe even small, screenless, boxes that fit in our pockets/on our wrists with some kind of input scheme are going to provide the processing power and connectivity for the first generation(s) of Bluetooth AR devices to function. Since smartwatches are too small to house an appropriate amount of processing power I think rectangles will still exist for some time, we just won't have the same relationship with them as we do now (they'll be the backbone of AR/VR devices). Maybe some kind of flexible surface that we could attach somewhere to our wrists could exist as both a smartphone and as a way to interact with an AR device. 


The reason I expect AR to take off is due to the same kind of convergence of technologies that enabled smartphones to take off over the past 6 years. ""AI"" like Siri and Cortana are on the verge of being useful, a ton of research is being done into AR (hardware and software developers aplenty solving all the related issues either directly or indirectly by working on VR and experimenting with different HUDs and headtracking as a form of interaction). Some people might not consider these first generation mainstream AR devices to be ""true AR"" though in the same way some don't consider the Oculus Rift to be true VR; the processing power simply isn't there to be anything more than a floating 2D pane with *some* neat attempts that ""true AR"" such as overlaying 3D objects on the real world (in a clumsy way). 


One immediate use of AR that I can envision is a portable bluetooth keyboard/mouse being used to interact with a virtual display suspended in front of you via unintrusive, stereoscopic AR glasses powered by a device in your pocket.  I think something like this will be possible with second generation, mainstream AR devices. 


If I had to make a prediction, I'd say that it'll become obvious during 2015-16 that we are reaching the ""peak smartphone"" era and we'll start to see early adopters of rudimentary AR products. Towards the end of the 2010s, AR devices will begin to become appealing to the average smartphone user and by the end of this decade I expect AR devices to be as ubiquitous as smartphones and tablets are today. Not to say that there is no room for smartphones and tablets; just that their role will shrink significantly (and there will probably be a lot of places where AR devices aren't permitted to be used). 


If anything keeps smartphones and other touchscreen devices around it's going to be cultural lag. I expect that these kinds of technologies along with talk of automation and subsequent job loss will signify the beginnings of the first long term ""luddite"" movement. VR isn't going to help either. All one has to do is explain VR/AR to someone, emphasize how close it is and sit back and listen to their disapproval of it. Most people *will* come around in the long run but I expect *some* to say that something like AR/VR is going too far (as someone who has publicly demoed the Oculus Rift to hundreds of people I've met a number of ""luddites"" in the making). 


**TL;DR** I think that the hardware that powers smartphones (and tablets) is reaching the point of diminishing returns and I think within the next few years there will be nowhere left to go but AR. I think that even crude AR will have a strong appeal and that the first generation to go mainstream will rely on an external device, such as a smartphone, for processing power. The end goal will be to have standalone AR that can process the environment around the device in real time and overlay virtual objects/effects in a seamless way. 


I'm by no means an expert and these are just my personal predictions based on a number of trends I've been paying attention to for the past several years. I'd be eager to know what everyone else thinks will happen. Feel free to disagree with me or add more in the comments!

Lets say 1000 years later.
Men increasingly adopt traditional womens virtues while women increasingly adopt virtues traditionally seen as masculine. Where human
beings will have to possess a combination of
masculine and feminine traits Developments in medical science would enable mutations such that we would be able to change gender as we wish,
and alternate the procreative functions that we
today associate only with one gender or the
other. won't need men (sperm banks) and men
won't need women (artificial wombs) and natural gender roles dissolve leading unisex androgyny OR



 Freedom from repression and dominance as well as
freedom of choice emergence of multiple gender diversities fundamentally challenges the societies we
inherited. Once people become free to express
themselves along the malefemale continuum
depending on internal and external
circumstances leading to multiple gender diversity.",1,0

How will the car know where to go if the location is more precise than a general house/ location?
For example, I take a Park &amp; Ride to my work where I have to park in a specific section of the parking lots so as the rest of the area can still be used for the local shops to park in. How would the car know to park there rather than any free space in the area?

Extra question: Also, sometimes I play football at a local centre that is located off a road which Google Maps regards as a pathway and my SatNav doesn't believe I should be driving in the area. How would people be able to reach places like this?

Would these sort of issues be worked out in future generations of the car, or would these places have to improve parking for people using driverless cars?
Sorry if this sort of thing has been covered before or if there is a video answering these questions. But any feedback would be appreciated, I know it will be mostly guesswork but it would be interesting to hear your ideas.

Thank you

For those who don't know, Gattaca is a science fiction movie, that (skipping the pretty lame plot) is set in a rather Utopian (or dystopian depending on interpretation) future. 

In this future, people are subject to genetic modifications at birth to give them an edge. Based on your genetic attributes, projections of health and intellect are used as basis for discrimination. It's a very scary prospect, but I honestly believe in the near future, companies will stop drug testing, and start **genetic testing** to rule out candidates for their jobs. 

Eventually, this technology could become so pervasive, that it could be used to classify everyone into jobs ranking from ""potential president"" down to ""janitor"" (as featured in the movie).

Many of you have some great points. I think the most compelling arguments for why this **WILL** happen is what happens when people **VOLUNTARILY give up that information?**

Which would also likely mean that Earth life came from extraterrestrial origins. 

The theory goes like this:
Life on planet gets thrown into space somehow, maybe by a meteor? The life then stays in space (which is proven possible). Some of this life ends up in to Oort Cloud. The solar system then passes through clouds of gas and other materials. When this happens, material is exchanged between our solar system and the cloud. After we leave this cloud, other solar systems pass through and exchange material, including material contaminated with life. This life then enters their solar system and takes root on habitable areas. 

We pass through material clouds every few million years. With the theory that a civilization can explore the galaxy with self replicating probes in a a few million years, wouldn't life be able to spread throughout the galaxy the same way via the Oort Cloud transfers with material clouds? 

Then once solar systems are contaminated with life, these solar system could be thrown from the galaxy and end up in other galaxies and repeat the process of spreading like a spores again!

Earth would be spores that grow new life to be spread throughout the entire universe. It takes hold in a habitable area and then some occasionally gets thrown up into space and seeds other places in the solar system. Planets like

A bit of backstory: my grandfather has severe Alzheimer's, he lives in an assisted living home, doesn't remember how to speak or how to use the bathroom - it's very bad. He's probably approaching his 10th year since the family noticed the beginning symptoms.

Anyways, a month ago I went to visit him for the first time in 7 years (my family is very spread out, cross-country, we grew up only seeing family every 10 years or so). It was a complete shock to me, I didn't even recognize my grandfather when we arrived. I was expecting him to be in a similar state to what I remembered in 2007 (asking the same question every 5 minutes), it literally broke my heart to see him how he is.

I know my father has went and see my grandfather (his dad) within the past 2-3 years and, according to my grandmother, he seriously troubled him. My dad and I haven't discussed his visit but, from what I was told, he's worried to death he'll end up like his dad (and myself, like my grandfather).

I thought, for Father's Day, I would order 23andme tests for my dad and I so we could at least get some guidance at a scientific level (of course, I planned on asking my father if he was okay with this before purchasing). Unfortunately, 23andme has turned into Ancestry.com with some science behind it.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to similar companies/procedures (I'd rather avoid the medical/doctor realm, that makes a difficult gift, and stay with private companies). Finally, as a 30yr old how can I contribute to the study of this disease (beyond financial contributions)?

I'm resolved in the knowledge I very likely will end up in my grandfather's condition and the likelihood of a cure or decent treatment in my lifetime is virtually null. How can I (and potentially my father, 52yr of age) contribute lessen the chances my sons will experience the same? My grandfather, when he was first diagnosed and relatively coherent, filed the correct paperwork to donate his brain to research (I think UCLA specifically but I may be wrong).


Edit: Someone on Twitter pointed me towards [Promethease](https://promethease.com/ondemandlicense). Apparently, 23andme does not provide the medical feedback but they do provide a raw data dump of your mapping; which you can then import into a number of open-source applications and/or services and receive what I would refer to as ""consumable"" information/feedback.

I'll be checking in with my dad tomorrow to make sure he's okay with this idea and buying kits (or kit, if oddly enough he just doesn't want to know but I doubt that) tomorrow!",9,20

Should we not forgo this new escalation/arms race and give this future force the job of peacekeeping.

I suggest a unilateral mandate that bans all countries of the world from building robotic armies unless they are for the UN's peacekeeping force.

Think of the conflicts that could be prevented if we could airdrop or even deliver a battalion of UN robotic peacekeepers via pimped ICBM's to any conflict zone on the planet with minutes. Armoured and  armed with non/semi-lethal weapons to stop that prevent further conflict and begin the peace talks.

IMHO a robotic peacekeeping force would be the ideal tool in a world moving into a more complex and chaotic era.

Such a force would also be ideal for dropping into zones effected by climate disasters.",38,9
