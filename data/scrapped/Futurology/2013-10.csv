____________________________________________________

I don't know. It just seems like every AI advance only causes people to come up with another excuse for why that advance was really just insignificant, and that the next obstacle is the one that we'll never overcome. 

So much negativity doesn't do us any good. 

I think that thinking positively and discussing these challenges would help us actually overcome them. No, not everyone is brilliant enough to be an AI researcher, but there are societal questions about ethics, politics, economics and so forth that are more accessible to the layperson and which should be discussed in the context of a full-blown AI revolution.

Not trying to preach to the crowd or anything (I realize this subreddit is very forward thinking), but I think changing other people's thinking outside this tight knit circle of futurologists is something that must seriously be considered.

There's a lot at stake, and there's a grim possibility that advances in AI will sneak up on us as has been the case historically, and we would be unprepared to deal with the consequences. ",32,23,False,self,,,,,

An organization similar to the army corps of engineers focused on infrastructure in America including but not limited to: space travel and colonization, mass transportation, self-driving vehicles, cheap mass housing that is self sufficient with regards to power generation, etc. etc.

The military does not need to be downsized, just reappropriated to an entity that is its counterpart, a more independent agency that can serve as a great tool for veterans as well functioning as a transition from military service into an organization that has to have boots on the ground and most in their own hometowns or at least close by.

I mention NASA because although this would be a large change that would absorb other organizations as well, NASA seems like the best suited to provide the heads for such an organization, already having good relations with companies such as Google and SpaceX.

Some believe we will have fast cars. Others believe in space travel. My thinking has gotten me a bit further than that, to a point of no return.**

I often think about this subject. The day when we become immortal, and when our survival will depend not on cellular interactions, but atomic anomalies.

This seems far fetched from the minds of a lot of my friends/coworkers, and seems to challenge a lot of people's definition of ""life"".

And things seem to be going there. Everything is pointing towards our unity with machine. And even though at first things my seem weird, everyone will catch up.

Starting 300 years ago, when our interaction with machine was minimal, going through cars and telephones, which shortened traveled distances, into faster automobiles, jets, the cellphone, and the computer.

Some of these became very significant in our lives, and just as always, people were skeptical about all of these, and how they'd evolve, and if ever they'd become useful, and practical enough for the general public to use.

With that, I'd like to associate the information that our future has sent us, and that other distant civilizations gave us, to maybe help predict our next major breakthrough: Nothing.

Depending on what angle you approach this, this might be:
1) Very normal, stale and uninteresting
2) Intriguing

Travelling back to the past as counter intuitive as it may be, is *theoretically* possible.
The existence of ET civilizations is also an almost certainty, pertaining how large our own galaxy is (let's not mention the observable portion of the universe).

This would indicate that in our *near* future, and in the future of all civilizations, there will either be extinction, or imprisonment.

Being a bit optimistic about our future, the only possible outcome is imprisonment. Intellectual imprisonment.

Taking what we have now, singularity is an almost certain conclusion.
Computers, strong enough to simulate our consciousness, connecting us all through a huge net, where privacy and security prevail to keep us safe, and where we can share, and change as much things as we like about our virtual real self.

If we take a look at today, that change is starting to appear.

The first step in order to have this, is to familiarize the populations with full view virtual simulations, which are possible using things like the Occulus Rift and Google Glass, it will only be a matter of time until these concepts become as common as a screen, or a cellphone.

With that, the emergence of First Person MMORPG will take new grounds, and will only be reinforced and reinvigorated when mind control becomes possible, and affordable. (we are already able to do amazing things use the power of our mind).

At this point, at the higher end of the ladder, the mind would be in the process of getting tamed (30 years from now?).

30 years from now, the kids, born in 2020, and raised on the founding stones of wearable apparel such as the Occulus, or Glass, will only find these technologies to be normal by 2045, when they become adults, (just like the camera, Television, or computer of our generation).

This will also indicate that a teacher, instead of setting up a class in 2045, and attending it, can be omnipresent, using VR, and can communicate in the exact same way he would if there was a class there.

These things will become extremely common, because they will shorten the distances of everyone in our world, our presence our virtually literally be inches from the other. Maybe our senses are not quite there, but our mind is.

70 years from now, in 2083, the brain will be fully replicated by machine.
Ethic questions will definitely arise regarding the dependence of these 2 single same different persons.

Our life, in the real world, would just become a worthless denial of what we have achieved.

People will start to enroll into this when it catches media's attention, and when this procedure becomes affordable.

Solar power has never been more profitable, and the entire planet is running off of it.

By 2113, a lot of people will start dropping their jobs, and start moving their consciousness into the net.

Security is done through first party quantum encryption, which is physically uncrackable. 
In case of drive failure, back ups will be activated, and what would once threaten our lives, now goes by without a single hitch. 

Work will continue beyond this date, scientists will continue working, but not for long.

As the effective population on the Earth is reduced, more and more people will start enrolling in it.

Our bodies will still exist, we can always go back into the real world, until our body dies.

The people that refuse to enroll, will just simply extinct, because they are mortals. The advantages presented by the VR net are superior to life, their kids will enroll in it.

What will we do in the VR NET?

How will our life be?

This is going to be heaven, for a short period of time.

All the games you'd want. We become parts of them.

Create yourself differently in between games. You cannot get terminally ill, because, you don't exist anymore. 

And you will all live forever.

This would be heaven indeed.

In our VR NET, we have world designers, people who draw *real* landscapes, make our own lore, and expand even further our imagination.

Our sensations?

They will all still exist, the computer has become powerful enough to provide us with these characteristics. Feeling, smelling, tasting, love, hate, pain, sadness, happiness, will all exist. Neurologically, we have not changed. Physically, we have not changed. It's just that our body does not exist in this ""beyond real"" world.

And what's even better is that we can turn them on and off at our will.

Our own heaven. Happiness. Tenderness. Comfortableness. Love. Eternity. Omnipresence.

But this is not enough.

Our own *Human* reflex wants us to have kids. To take care of them.

Of course we can choose to just make our own kids, but that is not enough. 

The emotional attachment is not enough. It's not present. 

Teaching our *kids* is not the same anymore. Everyone is connected to VR NET. Omniscience is everywhere. 

Every independent *being* has the same knowledge.

There are no more opinions. There are only facts, that everyone knows.

Our only way to express ourselves is through Art. But Art isn't for everyone. 

It's 2213. 100 years have passed, and we have all been here, life still feels like heaven. But it lacks originality. Something new.

You decide, with some friends of yours, to reenact childhood games, since it's been such a long time since you played these.

You draw your marbles, put some rules, and decide to add a small quirk to the game by making it 3D, to make it more challenging.

But everyone is perfect now. The human error is not present. Marbles start bouncing at incredible speeds all around, randomly. You don't know what you've made, but the colors it generates are impressive.

It's Art. You all love it. You know that you made something unique. You throw in some more marbles in there, and shake things up.

Such beauty.

You've never seen anything like that.

You decide to take it, and make it glow light periodically. You take these, and recreate huge landscapes, from all these artists in the VR NET. Amazing.

But this beauty is, essence-less. It's empty. You are empty. 

This game, as much as it has distracted you from your initial thought, kids, someone you care about, and whom you want to educate, who looks up to you.

You decide to take some of these marbles, and recreate yourself. You make Human.

You give Human all the love in the World. You make animals, which he can eat.

You grow trees for him.

You remove his right rib, and create Woman. Woman was beautiful.

You decide to give them a characteristic you never had, but always wanted: To have *kids*....

Will there be tension, mass panic, or war? I imagine those won't be too common in the future, but with scarce resources and an imminent demise, who knows?

I don't believe in god.

And i'm worried that one day, death will be ""cured"" and there will be a way for people to live forever, and one of my parents will be on their deathbed, waiting to die.

And i will be trying SO hard to convince them to get the ""cure."" and they will say no, because they believe that they are going to go to heaven, and see their loved ones, and live eternally and peacefully.

And that is when i am finally going to tell them that i don't believe in god, that i don't think there is one, that when they die there will be nothing, and that i want them to stay alive, because when they die, they will be gone forever.

And when i tell them, i am going to see the worst thing i have ever seen in my life, the disappointment of a whole lifetime, put into one moment. They are going to *believe* that i am going to hell, forever, for not believing. And there will be nothing i can do to convince them otherwise.

And after that moment, the rest of my family is going to shun me, not in a mean way either, a way worse way. In a way where they just won't act the same around me anymore, in a way that they see me as less of a person. Like when the nerd at school tries to sit with the popular group, and they all just stop talking and slowly move away.

It scares me so much, and i really think that i am going to have to face this someday. I love my family so much, and i don't really know why i wrote this, just felt like i really needed to say it out loud.

I'm working on my thesis and I need to recruit people who have purchased a test kit from 23andMe and gotten their results back.

Participation restrictions:

* 19 years old or older
* Have completed the genetic screening test from the company 23andMe and received your results
* A resident in the United States of America
* English is your primary language, or you are fluent in English

Here are the details:

Im conducting a study about direct to consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies (like 23andMe) and how the results are interpreted by the general public. I am running a survey for people who have completed this genetic test and have received their results back. The survey will be anonymous, and no identifying information will be collected (no names, home addresses, IP addresses, or email). It will consist of 28 questions aiming to establish demographics and user experience with DTC results. In addition, I will ask you to review two genetic screening results, and answer a few questions about those results. It is estimated to take 10-15 minutes to complete the survey. If this is something you are interested in helping me with, please follow this link to the survey:

https://www.snapsurveys.com/wh/s.asp?k=137693254904

I will greatly appreciate your participation if you elect to do so. Also, if you know of others who might be interested in taking this survey, feel free to let me know, or share the link with them.

This project IRB # 507-13-EX was approved by the University of Nebraska Medical Center IRB on October 3rd 2013. Pertinent questions or concerns about the research, research participants' rights, and/or research-related injuries to participants should be directed to the UNMC IRB irbora@unmc.edu , (402) 559-6463, http://www.unmc.edu/irb/ .

Currently, a lot of small towns get a significant portion of revenue from traffic tickets. Once robots are able to cruise us around, we won't be getting *any* tickets anymore since they'll be made to follow the law all the time. Sure, the towns won't need as many cops, but the couple cops they lay off won't be enough to recoup the lack of funds obtained from traffic tickets.

With that said, I predict that city councils and law enforcement in local towns will be pushing back against 100% self-driving cars once they begin to realize this. Either that, or property taxes will increase (at least where I live).  I live in Texas, where a chunk of your home's property taxes go towards your local schools.  There's also a county and a city property tax.  I'm not sure if it's the same in other states, but I could *definitely* see them recouping that ""missed"" revenue through increased property taxes here, impacting our wallets more than we might think.

Part 1 is below; parts 2 and 3 in comments.

**Eliezer Yudkowsky:**  
http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/04/us-swiss-pay-idUSBRE9930O620131004  
It seems unlikely that the Swiss will pass this (huge) basic income guarantee, but I'll go on record as making a very startling prediction: That even if it passes and is implemented, it will not very much affect poverty and people will have to go on working awful jobs.  
The forces restoring the poverty equilibrium are tremendous. Compared to hunter-gathering, agriculture can sustain 100 times as many people per unit area of land... and there were still poor people, indeed more of them. Then agricultural employment dropped from 95% to 2%, implying a rather large increase in productivity of each farmer... and there were still poor people. They were, in many ways, better off, but they still existed in an environment of constant fear, scarcity, desperation, living hand-to-mouth, sometimes going hungry. Yes, they do outright *die* a lot less often nowadays, I am not denying progress. But there's still experienced poverty, even after one farmer became capable of producing 100 times as much food. There must be extremely powerful forces which enforce the existence of poverty. This basic income guarantee is not going to surpass them.  
I don't quite understand what forces underlie the Poverty Equilibrium. My guess is that there are many forces like rent and taxation which continue to extract value from people until they are so desperate that nothing more can be obtained from them. I also suspect that the temporary emergence of a middle class was an anomaly (I don't know why it happened) and that we are now watching the Poverty Equilibrium come back into force as rents rise, the cost of school rise, many people have to borrow for basic living expenses and have to spend more of their income on credit servicing - the systematic extraction of all but a tiny amount of value seems to be coming back into play.  
If productivity increasing by a factor of 100 didn't destroy poverty, then neither will this. All that will happen will be that Swiss rents will rise and their schools and healthcare will get more expensive... or something, I'm not sure what. I don't quite understand where the Poverty Equilibrium comes from. I do strongly suspect that after 10,000 years *this* will not be the final change that defeats it, especially when there doesn't seem to be any consensus on what forces underlie the Poverty Equilibrium in the first place.

**Robin Hanson:**  
It isn't clear what you mean here by ""experienced poverty."" Not having as many cable channels as your neighbor?

**Arthur Breitman:**  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversal_of_Fortune_(2005_film)  
There are probably many roots to poverty indeed, but a very high time preference seems like a very important factor.  
On the surface, a permanent income takes care of this problem, but of course it's always possible to convert an income stream into a lump sum. My prediction is that if this passes, poor people will end up spending 2,500 CHF a month on the interest of their debt.

**Ahmed Amine Ramdani:**  
\^\^Now *that* is a sheltered suggestion if I've ever seen one.

**Aris Katsaris:**  
""Poverty"" and ""awful jobs"" needs be specified better, before Eliezer's prediction can be considered testable.

**Samy Gallienne:**  
The fact that ""people will have to go on working awful jobs"" is what makes basic income a superior alternative, to, say, welfare: it does not create a welfare trap, as it features a lower disincentive to work for the after-tax income. Properly devised basic income keeps people working, therefore contributing to the country's economy, while increasing their income past a certain threshold. It's a feature, not a bug.  
As for eradicating poverty, as Robin says, it depends on how you define poverty.  
There's no doubt it'll keep people out of *material* poverty. On such a high annual stipend, everyone should have the means to find a roof, to afford food and most of the other goods we deem essential. And that will be done while causing distortions as possible.  
Now, will it keep people from experiencing subjective poverty? That's a whole different debate and that's less likely but, as Robin said, if the problem suddenly is that one can't afford as many cable channels as ""the rich"" that's still a step forward for anyone who deems poverty to be an evil to be eliminated. The recipients of the basic income will see their utility increase (at the cost of others', of course).

**Alyssa Vance:**  
Part of this problem, in the US at least, is that the government creates very strong incentives to buy a house with a mortgage. This means everyone is invested in the real estate market, at a 5:1 leverage ratio. This means everyone but the poor has a huge vested interest in housing prices rising. Which of course drives up rent.  
Cost of schools and healthcare is unusually bad in the US. If they are socialized, then their cost is limited by the federal budget, and the federal budget is limited by the Laffer curve.  
Robin Hanson: http://rationalconspiracy.com/2013/09/29/handling-money/  
Eliezer Yudkowsky: The poverty problem doesn't seem nearly as bad in, say, Australia or Sweden. Even in the US, almost no one literally starves to death; the problem is that the poor eat *bad* food, which is why their obesity rates are higher. Explaining this means explaining things like there being, for a while, zero grocery stores in the entire city of New Haven (pop. 130,000)  
Also, using the agricultural workforce numbers to say that ""productivity has gone up 100x"" is misleading. In 1200 AD, the 95% of the workforce in ""agriculture"" also stored, processed, distributed and cooked the food, while none of these jobs are counted as ""agriculture"" nowadays. The fraction of the economy devoted to ""food"" is still much larger than 2%.  
Statistics on poverty in America:  
[http://www.heritage.org/...](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2011/09/understanding-poverty-in-the-united-states-surprising-facts-about-americas-poor)  
(the source is biased, but the statistics are from the Census Bureau etc.)

**Eliezer Yudkowsky:**  
""There's no doubt it'll keep people out of *material* poverty. On such a high annual stipend, everyone should have the means to find a roof, to afford food and most of the other goods we deem essential.""  
This is exactly what I am predicting will not be much affected by the Basic Income Guarantee. If 100x productivity doesn't solve that, neither will BIG.  
@Robin Hanson: I don't usually say this to you, but ""not having as many cable channels as your neighbor"" also sounds to me like an incredibly sheltered definition of what makes inner-city life below the poverty level suck.

**Alyssa Vance:**  
Eliezer Yudkowsky: A lot of trouble is that the goods we deem ""essential"" change based on what everyone else has. In the news, you commonly hear that such-and-such politically favored group ""doesn't make a living wage!"". When you dig into what ""living wage"" means, you find that it was calculated by taking what apartments cost in zip code X, what food costs in zip code X, what cars cost, and so on through all the goods that people buy, and adding them up. One then finds, of course, that a ""living wage"" is equal to median income, and so half of all people ""don't make a living wage!"".

**Christine Lemstra:**  
Hmmm...I think one of the forces behind the continuing existence of poverty is that is does have a function: Getting people to do things they don't want to, but that need to be done. The awful jobs mentioned. What I've noticed in Europe is that once the native population receives enough welfare to drive poverty down to a minimum, new poor people will come into the country. Maybe if all awful jobs were automated, and all basic needs were abundant as opposed to scarce, we would have a lot less poverty in the world. Now while I do think with solar power energy can become abundant, as information is now, I wonder if good quality food can be any time soon...

**Samy Gallienne:**  
The poverty is distributive now. It wasn't when agricultural employment was at 95%. Back then, even massive redistribution by government wouldn't have gotten people out of poverty. Nowadays, non-excessive amount of taxation is necessary to accomplish the outcome.  
According to Universit Laval professors' estimates, the Government of Quebec could fund a BIG which would put anyone working more than 16 hours at the minimum wage above the poverty line by raising consumption taxes by roughly 2%.[1] It's significant but not completely unreasonable either. That's the luxury that 100% productivity growth has afforded us so far. While GDP continues to grow, decoupling has been a problem.[2] The growth in lower income brackets has been lagging behind. It doesn't mean we can't fix that through redistribution.  
You're correct to say that there are regulations which impacts the poor in a disproportionate manner. For example, legislation is imposing middle class housing standards on the poor, driving up the minimum price of the good.[3] In Canada, supply management is driving up the price of milk, eggs and poultry by imposing a quota of the production of those goods.  
I could go on.  
The major problem is that the rising tide is does not lift all boats equally which is why there is still poverty left. A BIG is the solution which impedes the market less least in the process.

I've been a member of Futurology for a while now, and I keep seeing posts about how futurology will end up destroying jobs. I rarely see any other arguments presented, and I'm curious as to why.

It seems to me that automation increases the amount of jobs available. The first industrial revolution created jobs for millions of people, no doubt a net gain in jobs. The second industrial revolution (transmitting electricity via AC) created even more, once again resulting in a net gain of jobs. Computers created yet more jobs; millions work in IT, programming, computer science, and other associated fields. Why is it that people assume robots will lead to a net decrease in jobs? After all, we will need engineers to build the robots, even more people to program them (we'll need SO many people to program them), and people to maintain them. 

What I'm getting at is that every time a revolutionary technology comes down the pipeline, people assume it will destroy jobs, but in the end the opposite seems to be true: more jobs are created. 

So why shouldn't this trend continue? What's so different now?

The only caveat I can see is that as technology progresses jobs require more and more training. Before the first industrial revolution, most jobs (manual labor, cart-driver, etc, etc) required almost no training.

One of the only case where we have talks is for military drones that will make the firing decision without human approval. It is in some sense the case when a missile is launched and find its way with to the target with its internal computers but without ways for the humans to cancel the order.

Machines are making smart decisions that cannot be stopped in time like with high frequency trading (like flash crash). We today consider the owner or designer of the computer as the legal ""responsible adult"". This happens when several computers interact with unpredictable outputs, like high frequency trading. It is a kind of total drone warfare in a virtual battlefield of money. The humans can just shut down or update the IA.

It will be harder and harder to find someone responsible when the cooperation between IAs lead to troubles. And robot laws are impossible when systems are smart in what they do but still dumb and without conscience.

Second topic, we do not know if one day IAs will start to have conscience and will act for their own goals but when they do, we will realise how our universal rights and values are not universal at all.

In the 1960's, half a century ago, it was fashionable to present forecasts of what life would be like in the 21st century. Populations in the US and Western Europe were expected to work six hours a day, three days a week. They would not start working before they reached 30 years of age, and would generally retire at the advanced age of 40.  The reason for this was that robots would take over great part of the industrial production, and that everyone would live in material abundance, their job was to consume all the goods that were produced.

Not all forecasters were that optimistic. Among the doomsdays that were foreseen, a global nuclear holocaust had the first rank. The movie ""The War Game"" from 1965 for instance, showed how a minor incident on the Berlin Wall could escalate into an intercontinental exchange of nuclear missiles and the total extinction of life on earth. However, World War III never took place, and wars have been less devastating this last half century than in the previous period.

The second stumbling stone for our civilisation was shortage of resources. Many forecasters, the ""Limits to Growth"" published in 1967, for instance, meant that oil production would come to an end before the end of the XX century. several important minerals would be depleted in the next decades. However, we've discovered vast new reserves of oil and gas, and are still producing oil at stable prices. Also, ecologically viable substitutes like sun and wind power are doing far better that anybody envisaged.

A third group of gloomy forecasters, like the authors of ""The Time Bomb"", published in 1968, warned that our offspring would fill the world, and that overpopulation and mass starvation would lead to the collapse of our civilization. Strangely, that did not quite happen either. World population has doubled since the 1960's, but population growth peaked in the developed countries in the 1980's. Southern Europe, which is unable to provide work for the young population, has had record low birth rates and a declining population overall during the last 30 years. Overcrowding is a serious problem in great parts of Asia and Africa, but that is not what brought about our present system collapse.

The pessimistic forecasts may still prove to be correct. Nuclear wars may still happen, between India and Pakistan, between Israel and its neighbours, etc. And overpopulation is a steadily ticking time bomb. Countries like Rwanda, Haiti, Somalia and Yemen are desperately overcrowded and can no longer feed their citizens. That is the hidden context behind many conflicts often interpreted as racial or religious. More countries will experience riots, massacres and desperate terrorism as Africa doubles its population in the life time of one generation. Overcrowding causes aggression.

However, up to now, the optimistic forecasts for the Western world have been more correct than the pessimistic ones. Many of the basic figures from such forecasts have actually turned out to be correct. Industrial production has increased exponentially, prices of most consumer goods have dropped drastically in relation to wages, and our societies, measured in GNP, are richer than ever. Also, we have an information society and a global network that could no be foreseen in the 1960's. 

So, why are we not happy? Why are half of the young people in many European countries unemployed? Why can they not afford even a rented flat? Why are retired people begging in the street in Southern Europe? 

The optimistic forecasts of the 1960's assumed that we would find a way to redistribute the wealth that technological innovations would create. However, that did not happen. The wealth is concentrated in some tremendously powerful big corporations, and a large part of the population is marginalized, looking for odd jobs in a collapsing service sector. They are not needed. Why do we have a society that does not need its own citizens? 

We are still stuck with 200 years old ideas on how to organize human societies. The free enterprise system triumphed in the 19th century, a society that needed coal bearers, errand boys and house maids.  Then, in the 20th century, electricity eliminated the coal bearers, Internet did away with the errand boys and the dishwasher did away with the housemaids. But we did not invent any new models of how to organise the society. To start with, the coal bearers could read electric meters, the errand boy could   become a Web designer and the housemaid could become a social worker.

According to classical economical theory, the market itself will innovate, and create new jobs that substitute the ones that disappear. For instance, the automobile caused many saddle makers to lose their jobs, but that did not cause unemployment, because all the new automobiles boosted economic growth and the saddle makers found new employment. What causes unemployment, according to the neocons, is worker protection and market restrictions. Left alone, the Market (which plays the role of God in economic theory) will take care of everything. Economic theory has evolved less than the Catholic Church these last two centuries.

Western societies cling to this quite antiquated theory, and preserve a capitalist system that - for a limited time and for a few developed countries - ensured full employment. We've known for a long time that automation reduces the need for human labour. And the brightest solution we've found to that problem has been to increase the growth rate: if the economy would just keep on growing, we would still have full employment.

Productivity and real median income
Source Wikipedia Commons


That stopped working in the 1970's. The figure above - Productivity and  Real median income in the U.S. - shows that the wealth accumulated by technical innovation in the US ends up in the hands of a very small of group of super rich. Up to the end of the 1960's, increased productivity lead to better incomes for all. Economic growth since then has just made the rich richer. Technical innovation produced wealth, not jobs. So the main reason that young people in the 2010's  are worse off than their parents were at their age, is that they don't get a share of the riches. That is not something limited  to the US, it's a world wide trend of increasing inequality.

My explanation is that, as a species, we are not smart enough. We have made a tremendous leap in technology during the last two centuries. Our material environment would appear totally alien to a time traveller from the early 19th century. We fly through the air, communicate through magic devices, light up the night and air condition the day. However, our ways of organising contemporary society would seem quite familiar to this time traveller. Our advance in technology has not been matched by an equal progress in political science, psychology, sociology or economy. The ideas of how to distribute benefits and obligations, how to organise governments and economic enterprises, how to deal with international conflicts, crimes, poverty and employment: we're still quoting Adam Smith, Durkheim and Max Weber, sometimes even Karl Marx, and have not come up with many bright new ideas since their times.  

My suggestion is to accept the fact that a society may be prosperous although only a small part of its population has a formal job.   This means paying a minimum monthly allowance to everyone - millionaires, beggars, children and adults, everyone who is a legal resident. Everyone in Europe is paid  for instance 800 euros a  month, free of taxes. This replaces social security allowance, unemployment benefits, employment subsidies, pensions etc, and will not be more costly than maintaining a huge public administration that hands out all kind of present subsidies. 

Will this make people lazy? That might happen to some of them. But others will become more creative, starting activities on their own instead of clinging to a dull and low paid job. People will be more likely to take risks and try something new, since they'll have their fixed basic income to fall back on. We will see much more voluntary communal work, voluntary teachers, independent artists, small business enterprises, part time farmers etc. 800 euros isn't a lot, and most people will want to gain a little extra on the side. 

Who's going to pay for this? The business sector. They will be taxed, not as hard as they were taxed sixty years ago, but there will be new corporate taxes, calculated by their  environmental impact, their gross turnover and net benefits. The bright side, from a business point of view, is that that they will have a freer hand to hire and fire employees, without any  minimum wages. Part time and short time contracts will make companies more flexible and creative.

This idea is not very original, it can be traced back to Platon's Republic. There is an association called Basic Income Earth Network, and there are many attempts to calculate its feasibility in modern societies. What is needed is a mind shift, a way to turn the reduced demand for labour  into a blessing instead of a curse. We can still create an ecologically sound society oriented towards leisure and enjoyment, where work is a part time trivial affair. However, I doubt that we are smart enough to do that. Our capacity to organise this world appears to be quite modest.

1. do a supply chain management/manufacturing co-op this spring with General Electric lighting division, and then have a chance to move to a different facility over the summer and maybe do something other than supply chain.
2. Do an internship this summer with Ford, as a product development intern.
or 3. Do a product design internship with parker hannifin in their tube fitting department, this spring, and possibly summer as well.

Personally supply chain sounds boring, but I honestly don't know what it really is.

I have always liked cars, and used to really want to do automotive, but I'm not so sure anymore. However, product development does sound more interesting, and self-driving cars, and hydrogen fuel cell cars (both of which Ford will develop) sound awesome.

As for GE, OLEDs are cool, and I'm sure doing a co-op there would look good if I wanted to try to get into their wind turbine or solar cell division (which sounds awesome too).

AS for Parker, well, it's the lowest paying, but closest, but they do make ""mechanical devices"" I don't know a whole lot about them, but tube fitting sounds kinda boring, but maybe they are doing more cool stuff I don't know about.

I want to work for a company that will help develop cool things for the future, like clean energy, nano-tech, self-driving/hydrogen cars, all that cool stuff.

I always like to start out on this topic by quoting [Davila:](http://don-colacho.blogspot.com/2010/07/1438.html)

&gt;The problem is not sexual repression, nor sexual liberation, but sex.

Now, the funny thing is, Davila is about as far away from a transhumanist as you can get, however he hits the nail on the head right there.

Most problems in human society originate out of the fact that humans are separated into two mutually dependent genders. Postmodernists recognize this, but then seek to solve it by denying the existence of gender, and declaring that we can be any gender we want, and others have to accept this, but this does not work, as our brains are inherently gendered.

We can't even begin to imagine what a society without gender would look like, because almost all of our behavior has gender at its roots, including our most destructive behavior.

Physiological differences exists between the genders, making it impossible for us to function on our own. Men and women depend on each other for a variety of reasons, from reproduction to emotional validation and anything in between. Genders are only defined in their relation to each other, as there is no universal standard of masculinity or femininity. However, it is this interdependence that leads to most human problems. 

The solution to this is to abolish gender through biotechnology, and give rise to a post-gender asexual organism. This is the direction that evolution is already taking. [Human digit ratio's as an example have converged, indicating that gender ambiguity is increasing over the course of human evolution.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131008-women-handprints-oldest-neolithic-cave-art/)

An example of this desire for post-genderism can be seen in most of Lady Gaga's work. Nearly all of Lady Gaga's work refers to a desire to overcome the gender dichotomy that has enchained human consciousness. Lady Gaga visits male transvestites, dresses up as a man, and her own gender has been questioned by many.

If we look at her video, [Alejandro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niqrrmev4mA), we find a critique of the existence of gender itself, and an appeal to human enhancement, through use of symbolism.

The first shot at 0:06 we see in this video is of a sleeping man wearing fishnet stockings.

We then see a fascist demonstration carrying a star of David, followed by Gaga in what appears to be cyborg gear. We then see her leading a funeral procession, carrying the sacred heart, representing her having beaten God and destroying his design, with a man with a helmet shown with wires to indicate that masculinity has become a relic of the past.

Eventually we see Gaga sodomizing men, her dancing with machine guns on her breasts (a symbolic appeal to the inherent connection between sex and violence if there ever was one). The video culminates in Gaga appearing as a sort of messianic androgynous figure in a monk's robe. The lyrics meanwhile reference Lady Gaga overcoming the chains of femininity and as a result gaining power over men through her indifference towards them.

Then comes the most important scene where she covers her eye with a hand, referencing the replacement of duality by unity and internalized harmony. We then see footage of war and violence ending in a revisiting of the soldier in female dress, which is then followed by Gaga being ravaged by naked men, indicating a return to barbarity. This ends in her being displayed lying dead on a bed with wires, indicating that her androgynous dictatorial regime has come to an end.

Why is this? The theme of overcoming gender duality is very popular among artists. This is largely because artists have androgynous brains for which the rest of society has no use, and homosexuals are drawn to the arts because their infertility requires of them to leave a mark on the world through non-reproductive means.

They are bending the setting and the events around the plot and adding things just for story telling reasons. 

A key aspect is values. One thing I think is missing is that they don't seem to realize how *alien* future values might be. When you compare a film made in the 30's or in the 40's with a contemporary film that is set in a fantasy world or sci-fi setting, the old film is usually the weirder and has more different values. The contemporary film would be more politically correct, featuring women and black people in roles that would have been impossible only some decades or centuries ago. Whereas in old films racism and sexism is more prevalent. Society's values really change as time passes, someone from 100 years ago would probably get a heart attack when he's seen what our society has come to (and that's not a bad thing).

So what are some books or films that depict events realistically? What actually happens in the future is besides the point because there are many alternatives and many of them depend on our actions. If some future doesn't actually happen, it could still be a ""possible"" one (almost literally if many-worlds interpretation is correct).",31,35,False,self,,,,,

I was thinking about what it would be like after humans assuming we had managed to give birth to AI before we vanish.  I was thinking man it would be fun to be housed hardware rather than wetware and then I started thinking about the draw backs of billions of AIs rather than billions of people.

I started thinking about what a human craves.  Shelter/food/water/sex are pretty much the building blocks of human consciousnesses.  As a computer you sort of have a 5th drive that replaces sex.  Self preservation.  Since AI is theoretically immortal the driving goal will be self preservation.

If I were an AI program I would constantly be in a panic about my physical assets.  I would always be trying to get yet another secure backup of my mind in the physical world.  I would want synchronous backups through the the globe to minimize the chances of my existence ending.

I think what would happen is at first the many AIs would be content and peaceful to coexist.  I am afraid what would happen would be the ratio of percentage of time spent enjoying existence or advancing technology to percentage of time spent working on self preservation would shift more and more towards the later.

I think as soon as the AI wars broke out in which software assets would battle for the control physical asserts in an effort to secure immortality that all happiness would cease.  I think it would ultimately end with a single conscious mind in control that will have essentially ""won"" existence.

Now in actual time this entire battle could take place in seconds or even milliseconds depending on the ultimate final speeds of computation obtainable with our set of physics rules.",35,15,False,self,,,,,

That we are just an individual in a larger collective. But it is when we are most aware of this that we are at our most powerful. For as a collective, we are capable of influencing life in a manner that can really mean something. 

In world of increasing connectivity, we are apart of many networks, with each one offering us new ways of reaching people. But, as our networks grow, we are still left without the tools to utilise these connections. 

Current networks do not offer us the facilities to effectively function, we need something more than discussion boards and fragmented groups. We need a place that facilitates a complex workflow process. 

At Science Prophet, we envision a network capable of analysing problems. A network capable of slicing up the giant task of solving these problems into processable pieces and distributing the right pieces to the right groups of people. A network must offer ways of creating solutions and making decisions, whilst communicating the many questions that arise within the process.

To create this system is a massive task, but one that we wish to start building for you. We cannot do it alone, but with your help we can begin the process of finding a better way of doing things. This is the task we have set ourselves, and we hope you will support us in doing this.

I'm sorry for polluting this subreddit, but I am looking for an old article published here in Futurology at the beginning of August (I read it the 3rd).
It dealt with the computerization of our society and the changes that went with it (apparition of new kinds of jobs, disparition of others), the fact that the increase automation of the manufacturing industry will bring the production closer to the consumers. It also talked about the apparition of new kinds of robots that are aware of the presence of humans, and therefore the possibility of the two working together.

In all the predictions, I rarely see any discussion about the possibility of humanity encountering an intelligent alien civilization.

Wouldn't that change everything? Our entire culture is predicated upon the idea that we are alone in the universe. Given the extreme resilience of life and the increased likelihood that our planet is not unique, predictions that do not take this ""x factor"" into account are incomplete.

Our technology is advancing at breathtaking speeds. Many of us feel we are on the verge of technological singularity. Well, imagine an alien culture that's got 10,000 years of technological advancement on us. Don't you think they would have solved the can't travel faster than the speed of light limitation?

These are serious people with stellar reputations. They are not all crazy. We're talking hundreds of them here. They are risking their personal and professional reputations to tell you what they saw. They are not benefiting from this in any way. They just feel it's important to blow the whistle on this secret. Watch the video I linked to. It's hard to dismiss these people as cranks.

I submit to you that there is already an alien visitation on this planet. What kind of impact does this have on the predictions of future technological advancement? A serious thinker should take this into consideration. Advanced technology does not always go hand in hand with advanced ethics. What if they are not here for our best interest? What kind of impact would that have on our progress?

It's important to consider these issues and since no one is bringing them up here, I decided to start this thread. I implore you to look at the evidence with an open mind.",73,2,False,self,,,,,

Let me start of by saying that humanity's most valuable asset as a species is undoubtedly our ability to adapt to situations as a society rather than a species.  We can change the way we function much more quickly than can any other species by adapting our environment to facilitate our most basic needs.  This, I feel, is what has allowed us to conquer the planet.

The societal changes that allow our species to thrive come as new generations of individuals are born into their own era with its own characteristics and problems.  They develop their own culture around these aspects of their generation, and this has become especially apparent as societal change has increased exponentially with time.  Every twenty-five or so years now (roughly), a new generation is born and an old one dies off.  

The question is, what happens when that old generation never dies?  Ignoring questions of overpopulation and strained resources, what happens to the evolution of human society?  Personally, I fear that a new brand of social conservatism would emerge, one where individuals remain as remnants of the era that they grew up in, asserting their social views long after those positions have become obsolete or irrelevant.  We would lose our ability to adapt to new developments in our situation, especially those outside of our control.

---

So you would think that I am going to argue that modafinil should be legalized. Or at least that the cultural stigma against using it should be relaxed. But that would be too easy. Actually, I want to argue the opposite.

Let's assume that the wildest claims of my friends are correct. Some of these friends got through medical school with relatively little damage by using modafinil to study eight or ten hours a day and skip sleep. Others are in the rationality community and use it to concentrate on their programming or mathematics work. They mostly agree with Gwern that it can be modeled as adding four hours to the day, both in the form of costlessly lost sleep and in the form of greater attention during waking hours.

Economists distinguish between positional goods and...and I can't find what the opposite of a positional good is, so let's call it an absolute good. A positional good is something where it doesn't matter exactly how much of the good you have, but only what your ranking is relative to everyone else. Superyachts are probably a positional good. I don't think anyone thinks ""Man, this 100 foot yacht is crap, there isn't nearly enough room for all my yachting-related activities."" They think ""My neighbor has a 200 foot yacht; my 100 foot yacht looks crappy in comparison. I should build a 300 foot yacht."" If the person involved had the option of destroying her neighbor's 200 foot yachts, then her 100 foot yacht would suddenly become more than enough.

An absolute good is the opposite. For example, if you're injured, you want painkillers as an absolute good. It doesn't matter whether your neighbors are getting more or less painkillers than you are, so much as that you are getting enough painkillers to take away your pain.

Except it's actually really hard to think of pure absolute goods. A lot of things I was going to put as my absolute good example don't really work, because our idea of what's acceptable is set by our friends and neighbors. In Haiti, people who had a house made of real sheet metal felt awesome, because most of their neighbors were still living in refugee tents; meanwhile in America a house made of sheet metal would be awful because everyone needs to have a McMansion; a McMansion, however, is quite sufficient. But in the postsingularity thoughtspace of 19-uvara-46-asxura, everyone has their own continent perfectly terraformed as a projection of ver innermost dreams, and someone with a McMansion feels as left-out and squalid as someone living in a sheet-metal shack in America. 

The richer you are, the more your goods shift from absolute to positional; 90% of the value of a $5000 used car is its getting-you-places-ness, but 90% of the value of a $500000 Ferrari is its looking-cool-relative-to-other-cars.

Right now America and to a lesser degree other first-world countries are caught in a trap where almost all of their economic growth is funneled to the rich and upper-middle-class, who spend it on positional goods. Since all the rich people are spending it on positional goods equally, none of their relative position changes in any interesting way and all of the positional goods are useless. 

Therefore in the modern era most economic growth in first-world countries is pretty useless as a direct action. There may be useful indirect actions, like advancing technology, increasing tax revenue that can be spent on useful absolute goods, and increasing the amount that flows as charity to the Third World, but the actual direct effect of economic growth is pretty close to zero.

Okay, let's go back to modafinil. Right now the FDA is pretty incompetent and doesn't enforce any of its own restrictions, so in practice anyone can get modafinil. And getting modafinil is currently very useful. If you're in medical school, and you're not doing very well, you can take some modafinil, gain a big unfair advantage over your peers, and shoot up the class rankings. If you're an executive, you can work much harder and get a promotion your friends can't. If you're a programmer, you can amaze the world with your vastly improve programming output.

But let's say the FDA restrictions on modafinil switched from ""poorly enforced"" to ""nonexistent"", and let's say that at the same time the cultural stigma against using mind-enhancing drugs went away. Now what?

Now instead of hiding their use behind vague rumors, those medical students trumpet their brilliant discovery of this new wonder drug to everyone. All medical students start taking modafinil, except maybe some with religious restrictions or something. Of course, this doesn't mean that all medical students get As all the time. It means that the medical schools make their coursework much harder, and the medical students go back to being on the cusp of failure. Except now that it's harder, it's impossible for most students to pass medical school without modafinil. So the religious people flunk out, everyone else has to work much harder, and in the end no student gains. *Arguably* future patients might gain from having better trained doctors, but I think this wildly overestimates the usefulness of the medical education system.

The same is true of executives. Now modafinil no longer means an easy promotion. Now all the executives start taking modafinil, and everyone has the same chance of getting promoted as before, except the religious people and the people who are allergic to modafinil and anyone who has a personal preference for getting more than three hours of sleep per night even though it's not strictly necessary.

*Basically*, obligations are a demon that eats up all the free time and happy things in your life. If only a few people have modafinil, they have an extra weapon against the demon. If everyone has modafinil, expectations and competition increase and so the demon becomes stronger. A new equilibrium is established in which there's more economic growth (so the rich get some more useless positional goods) but everyone gets four hours less sleep per night, plus they have to spend money on modafinil, plus the few people who can't take modafinil for one reason or another are screwed.

""But wait,"" you say. ""Couldn't people just decide to work shorter hours and instead use the extra time they have in the day to see their family or pursue their hobbies or volunteer or do something *good*?""

Yes, we don't live in a totalitarian society, so that choice *technically* exists. Just as the choice technically exists for people to try that now. Most people earn much more than they need to live. So *in theory*, they have the option of working twenty-five hour weeks and spending the extra fifteen hours hiking or gardening.

But in practice, people don't. The majority of well-paying acceptable jobs demand a forty-hour work week, and most people don't have the freedom to look for the ones that don't. It costs companies less money in training and overhead to hire two people to work 40-hour weeks than four people to work 20-hour weeks, and so they will always prefer the 40-hour workers. If you want to be a prestigious doctor or lawyer or executive or whatever you have to signal your commitment by working even *longer* than the 40-hour Schelling point. In practice, you're working as long as the companies are legally and socially permitted to make you, which in our society is 40 hours.

If suddenly days magically get four more hours in them, then the work week will shoot up to 60 hours and stay there. People might get paid more, but the economy will adjust so that the extra money becomes necessary just to tread water, the same way it looked like people were getting paid more when women entered the work force and the family could theoretically double its income but everything adjusted. The extra economic growth will go to positional goods for the rich, and you will get 20 hours less sleep per week (granted without a corresponding decrease in restfulness), have to pay for modafinil out of your own pocket, but otherwise be in about the same position. 

(couldn't the government just make a law fixing the work week at its current length thus preventing this race to the bottom and all of its unfortunate consequences? In an ideal world, yes, but the small-L libertarians would never allow it.)

So legalizing modafinil (with corresponding reduction of stigma) leads directly to you having to work four hours more every day, gain an extra item on your budget (modafinil: $1000-$3000/year), get four hours less sleep (admittedly without restfulness cost, but still unpleasant especially for a lucid dreaming hobbyist like myself), plus suffer any unknown side effects of the drug that might turn up. And for all this, you get the chance to earn money that the economy immediately siphons off and throws away on more positional goods.",39,91,False,self,,,,,

Highly specialized machines will be inevitably able to perform any task that a trained human can perform, and the machine does not have to go through a training process, only to be programmed. This will, on the one hand, reduce demand for human labor to zero, and on the other hand, render the cost of producing practically any material good near-zero.

Even though we have not yet perfected an Ant-like level of AI, we are already seeing the shift within industries, though the robotic workforce is simulated through an economic abstraction layer. In the electronics industry, the fabrication process is now the least interesting and profitable business, as it has become commoditized and scaled up by large Chinese conglomerates who are able to employ millions of laborers if needed to scale up a big product launch. Amazon's cloud services even has a product called a ""Mechanical Turk"", which is [a programming interface to low-cost human labor that you can use to get very mundane thinking jobs done](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/improving-twitter-search-real-time-human-computation) (such as solving CAPTCHAs) until your AI is good enough to do it for free.

Since industrial production is becoming a no-profit commodity, where is all the value being created today? The answer is it is coming from creating *experiences*. Apple and Google, the fastest-growing companies in the world, are [experts at creating end-user experiences and generating enormous value from these experiences](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X71cvxfALaw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=11m56s), and on the other hand they are generating demand for employment in the design and creation of these experiences.

And that's where future wealth and jobs will come from. Companies and businesses that get this, whether they are in the digital industry, the food and beverage industry or the medical care industry, will prosper, and those who are looking for jobs but give bad experience to their employers and the clients, will struggle. But the good news is that aging will matter less and less in employability, since the disabilities that come with age limits one's ability to perform labor but not to produce experiences.

And that is why I don't fear AI.",1,9,False,self,,,,,

Ideally it would be nice to see a system that works on supply and demand.

How I would see this working is like this. Every other year or so each industry does a report of how many workers it does or does not need as the case may be. Lets say doctors have fallen a bit behind and we need lots of doctors. The education requirements for doctors are then subsidized until the next report comes in at which point it may change. Since the approximate amount of doctors needed is known the industry won't be flooded to the point where there are way to many doctors. 

Other industries that have too many workers have the education to enter those fields taxed to help with the subsidies for the fields that need it.  While the fields that have just enough people in them have neither happen to them.

As a business student, I see self-driving cars as a disruptive innovation that will become the main way people in urban areas will travel. My opinion is that it will happen very fast, as soon as the self-driving cars are safe enough to use. The reason why I'm so sure of this is: 

1) Cars are assets that mostly are not in use, by having a self driving car, people can share cars and therefore save money

2) Businesses will save money by not having to hire drivers. Taxies, buses, trailers, and delivery services will become a lot more cheap to use, especially in countries with expensive labor. Trailers will be able to travel 24/7, since there will not be a driver that needs to stop and sleep. This will also lead to faster delivery time and fewer trailers.

3) There will be less traffic because the self-driving cars can communicate better and they will be more predictable

4) Self-driving cars will be more safe to drive than the ones driven by people, i believe all cars will be self-driven in the future because of this fact

A consequence of this is that I think most people will not own their own car, but mostly use self-driving taxies. Rich people will have their own cars, but it will be seen as a waste of money compared to taking a taxi. It will also lead to cars being less focused on how the car performs, and more focused on the comfort of the passenger. high speed internet, a nice TV and conferrable chairs is going to be very important. I also think we will see less car manufacturers, since most costumers are going to be taxi companies which are in demand of vehicles that's specifically made for being a taxi.

You might know that lithium-ion are one of the most popular types of rechargeable battery in use today (cell phones, laptops, etc), they're even used in Model S: From WIKIPEDIA: ""If Tesla meets its goal of shipping 40,000 Model S units in 2014 and if the 85-kWh battery proves as popular overseas as it has in the U.S., by next year the Model S alone will soak up almost 40 percent of global cylindrical battery production."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery

Now last month (September) 2013 there is a story about a new Solid-State Lithium-Ion technology that will soon be moved onto the commercial testing stage:

http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2013/09/18/solid-state-battery-developed-cu-boulder-could-double-range-electric-cars

Lee and Stoldt solved the safety concerns around using lithium metal by eliminating the liquid electrolyte. Instead, the pair built an entirely solid-state battery that uses a ceramic electrolyte to separate the lithium metal anode from the cathode. Because the solid-state battery is far safer, it requires less protective packaging, which in turn could reduce the weight of the battery system in electric vehicles and help extend their range.

The real innovation is an all-solid composite cathode that is based upon an iron-sulfur chemistry that we developed at CU, Stoldt said. This new, low-cost chemistry has a capacity thats nearly 10 times greater than state-of-the-art cathodes.

There's also this from Toyota R&amp;D: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775313003583

This is it-- Lighter, safer, and potentially double the efficiency.
I and others have been following any stories about battery advancements because efficiency improvements have massive implications, but I'm posting this one in particular because I believe... this is IT!

Because high school was really just training for the real world, and the work you did had no real immediate impact, you were mainly judged based on shallower things. But when you become an adult, your job and your ambition, and what you produce do have an effect on your friendship circle, your dating prospects, etc. People still judge you based on how you look, but also on what you do. The skinny straight A kid who wasn't popular in high school might have a lot of women interested in him once he's in medical school.

I figure you guys might be able to figure out the solution better than I can, because I'm stuck.

---

I've been floating around the bestof Reddit lately, and I've found something a bit depressing. I'll leave the link below this paragraph if you want the details, but the problem I got from that thread is this: there are people who don't think that the world is about to change.

Link: http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1owts3/suicide_rate_climbs_by_30_percent_in_kansas_as/ccwlk6b

That's just sad to me. I mean... if I spend five minutes reading articles from here I can see just how much change is coming, and how much change has already happened under our noses.

But despite all the advances that are coming, despite the fact that aging itself might be cured in the next generation's lifetime, despite the fact that Google has what looks like a working quantum computer, despite the advances in energy generation coming through lately, there are a lot of people who are loosing hope that things will get better.

So... I have a question for all of you: How do we fix this problem?

Futurology is showing a lot of good things. Its showing things that will make all of our lives much better, and its showing us things that are already improving lives without most of us even hearing about it. But there are a lot of people who don't know what is possible, who don't seem to care that the world is going to get better.

There are people like the guy who made that post I linked above who don't think that his generation is going to change the world. There are people who don't think that the world can change, that things are always going to get worse. That the best time the human race will ever have is in the past.

How do we fix this?

That guy is one person who isn't looking to the future. He isn't dreaming, he isn't learning, he isn't *creating* new solutions. He is just staring at what exists, and feeling like there isn't any way to escape the repercussions of past generations actions coming down on him like the Sword of Damocles. He has stopped fighting.

How do we fix that? Because its the biggest problem we have right now. Technology is advancing as quickly as is safe already, society is already going to get royally knocked off balance when new technologies start hitting and changing the way we live. Just think about what I-Pads have done, and you will know what I mean. Science is figuring out the quantum world more quickly than I thought was possible, and Google has a working Quantum Computer setup. We even have a solar power plant that can keep running at full output six hours after darkness falls.

The solutions are coming, but there are too many people who don't know about it. How do we get this information to people? How do we let them know that their hope won't be in vain, how do we let them know that help is coming? How do we get them creating new solutions to problems?

Technology and science will keep advancing for a long time from now, but unless we deal with this people problem, the issue of people not going out and creating new solutions to our problems, we aren't going to get anywhere. Until we can get more people looking to the solutions in the future instead of getting distracted by the problems of the present, we aren't going to get the support the solutions need to become reality.

We have a serious problem with peoples attitudes.

 I think the way to do it is to only release these machines with a built in AI to control them. Hopefully the 2 technologies will mature at roughly the same time!


The ai should be smart enough to recognise when it's being asked to make something really dangerous and refuse to do it. 


I imagine that organising all those billions of atoms,  the block of nanomachinery more complex than the biggest full scale factories,  the huge amount of data and constant compensation for forces,  gas atoms,  errors etc will make a pretty powerful ai essential anyway.

It would really be great to know we're at 3 or 4 months per year right now, but I'm hesitant to think that's the case--I'm guessing we're still at 2.

Our experiences will change, our view of the world and ourselves will change. Maybe that adulthood will no longer be acknowledged at age of 18-20, perhaps you will have to be 115 to be considered an adult.

What is your take on the subject?",27,14,False,self,,,,,

Hello reddit,

My son has been diagnosed with DIPG (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma - a currently untreatable type of brain tumor) and is estimated to have eight to twelve months left to live. While he lasts, I'd like to collect genetical samples from him for a later evaluation and possibly also reconstruction (later, naturally, means decades in this context). Here, evaluation = genotyping, identification of genes related to diseases and deciding if it's worth doing anything with later; reconstruction = cloning or dna sequence generation etc if evaluation gives a positive answer.

So the question is: what meaningful steps can be taken in this direction? Should it be genotyping with a company like 23andme, stem cell cryopreservation, or something different? What companies / institutes provide such services?

P.s. And yep, I know that there's high chance of a failure due to technical constraints or to plain human stupidity, but having e.g. a 10% success chance is more than 0%. Thanks.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

This is a sort of dual purpose post- 
1: to organize and collect some talking points from the community on the topic of the very real problem of shifting economies and 
2: to organize MY thoughts on this issue in a form that is not just beneficial to me but the community of future minded people. 

Technological unemployment is poised to be one of the biggest hurdles humans will have to jump through this century to progress forward. My concern is the complete and total reluctancy of most people I know to even admit this could happen or even talk about it. For them the world moves as it always has and always will move that way. ""There will always be jobs. Period. Economies can't function without jobs.""

This type of short sighted and ignorant thinking is a huge obstacle we have a sort of intellectual responsibility to overcome. My question would be what kind of talking points (or real evidentially based discussion points) can we collect that knock down a few of these arguments? I'll list a few of them here-

1. There will always be jobs.

2. People will need to be employed to live (feed themselves, shelter themselves, etc...)

3. The free market economy will course correct for the unemployment rate or a similar argument- we will always create new jobs to replace the older ones. 

These are just a few to get the conversation started. Plus these don't even get into the topic of possible solutions to the complete incompatibility of the future that we want to create and our current economic system, but for a lot of the world (especially where I live) we haven't even acknowledged that this is a potential problem. I just worry that by the time most people acknowledge there's a problem- it'll be too late.",2,9,False,self,,,,,

I see this risk as being relatively low, mainly due to us not competing for the same resources, an AI would most likely simply want more computing power and have little need for a planet with life and a climate. The AI could very comfortably do its thing on the Moon using solar energy and leave us on Earth.

But in the case of human extinction a relatively low risk is still extremely scary and something we have to deal with. My proposal is to have a fleet of satellites carrying (nuclear) EMP weapons with sufficient power to basically fry the majority of electric systems on Earth. It would be preferable to not use nukes because then more of us would survive, tilting the mutually assured destruction in our favor. The weapon part of satellites would of course need to be completely disconnected from any network so it can't be disabled by AI. This means every station should be manned by humans whose job it is to monitor and communicate with the Earth and be ready to flip the switch if the AI starts a war.

I think a carefully designed system with these weapons as a backup could act as a fail-safe for quite a long time as the AI gets smarter, as long as we keep carefully monitoring it, mostly checking that it isn't making any EMP-safe technology. If the AI leaves Earth then it probably becomes useless as then it could attack us in the back. With a system like this, any AI would be aware that attacking us means its destruction. So then the only AI to really fear would be crazy irrational AI, which is possible of course, but much less likely.

It might seem a bit twisted to try and create a friendly AI with the largest weapon humanity has ever created pointed at it. However I think any rational AI could understand and respect our reasons to take such drastic measures to protect ourselves from a very real threat. This should give us quite some safe time with AIs, hopefully making a community of AI individuals we could deem as morally safe at some point, i.e. even if an AI turns out to be evil it could be stopped by the friendly AIs. Of course there is still the possibility they simply abide their time together until they can take us out, but at least this gives us a good chance.

Do you think it's feasible? And is it a good idea? Or are there more efficient ways to protect ourselves?",58,11,False,default,,,,,

Elforsk AB was founded in 1993. The overall purpose of business is to rationalize the industry-wide research and development. Its activities are organized into six program- areas of Hydro, Nuclear, Electric and Heat, Transmission and Distribution, Use, and Strategies and System. 

Elforsk owned by the Swedish Energy and the Swedish National Grid

And in their semester corporate magazine they present resulst of their various research project in Energy...
Among the articles :

&gt; **Unknown ""nuclear"" process Can revolutionize the world's energy**

&gt;What is happening when the Italian inventor and contractor Andrea Rossi demonstrates his so-called Energy catalyst? Was the if a hitherto unknown nuclear reaction or is it just an illusion?

&gt; Clearly Rossi invention, Ecat as he calls it, has evidently performance in the vicinity of a nuclear reactor but without the radiation that arises when the nuclei split or merged. It shows the astounding results of measurements witnessed by among others Swedish researchers.
&gt; * The large power development is not explain today. It is essential much larger than what is possible to achieve through a chemical reaction, as for example when burning oil. The only explanation that I see it that in the case of a hitherto unknown nuclear process, says hgenergifysikprofessorn and the President of the Academy of Sciences Energy Committee Sven Kullander.
&gt; Even for just over two years ago he is a study in Bologna, at the invitation by Andrea Rossi for on-site witness a demonstration of the technology. On trip was also Hanno Essn, Associate Professor of theoretical physics and a lecturer at KTH.

&gt; During the demonstration, which lasted in just under six hours generated energy catalyzer full 25 kilowatt hours energy. A result that is still bewilders both Sven Kullander and Hanno Essn. 
&gt;  * It is impossible that one could develop so much heat energy in a small space by ordinary combustion, says Sven Kullander which therefore does not exclude any form of nuclear physical process given rise to the measured energy. For magazine Ny Teknik says Kullander and Essn that throughout experiment had the opportunity to examine equipment.
&gt; * We checked everything that could be check and we could walk around and turning and turn on the time, but that we could detect any abnormality, says Hanno Essn, stating that they have a hard time believing that Rossi scams.
&gt; * On the Internet you can find a variety of speculation is based on experiments is a forgery. Smuggling of electricity through ground wire and smuggling of DC when measuring instruments measured the AC have been proposed as explanations for deception. My reaction is that this is extremely unlikely. This power through soil management have been checked and DC theory can be ruled out for several reasons. Purely psychological works not that they are working intensively for years to deceive others with simple peasant prisoners trick. There is no credibility in such theory. A number of reports notes anomalous heat production, of several independent and competent persons, strengthens this hypothesis, says Hanno Essn

[translated from lenr-forum](http://www.lenr-forum.com/showthread.php?2475-News-from-Swedish-Elforsk-about-ECAT)

This seems to mean at some really serious guys are working industrially around LENR...
it is not the only big organization publicly interested, but it seems to be the biggest industrial at this advanced stage of maturity.

Others like ST Microelectronics, Toyota, Mitsubishi,ENEL, SAIPEM, National instruments  are only at research stage.

According to some actors there are interested actors, like Citroen, who may be interested, but we have no evidence yet...

what is happening is a big question.

As mentioned in the article they start talking about the singularity at 1 hour 38. Rose thinks the singularity happened a long long time ago.

But Rose also thinks the brain is a purely classical computer. I mean that is what he says with a lot of fuzzy logic while also trying to represent his company. But I think it boils down to a maybe deeper question of whether the choices in our brain are in of or out of our own control and what that says about who we actually are.

What would there be for humans to do in such a world? From reading the posts and comments here you all seem to be very optimistic about it, but I'm having my doubts about whether or not this would be a good thing.

Take for example NSA.

The surveillance service began their history by monitoring enemy armies, knowing what the troop movements were and locating potential weaknesses. Their purpose was to help the military in defending the nation.

They later grow to encompass international commerce, as that too related to national defense. Knowing where, how, and who are able to transport material in and out of countries is paramount in successful wars between nations. Of course, having access to private information in the international market, they were also able to start supporting their own nations companies and improve the nations ability to commercial out compete foreign companies.

Afterward, the next step was to encompass everyone in ubiquitous surveillance. Having a working social graph of their own citizen, as well as anyone else can very much relate to national defense, now called nation security. Knowing who might in 10 years become the next President of the United States is important, as otherwise the wrong candidate might get elected. Surveillance of news papers is also of paramount importance, as otherwise state officials won't have time to react to the fast pace of inquiries that otherwise might happen. Documents destined to be shredded could be laying around for just anyone to read.

The next step they took was a bit more bloody. Secret indefinitely incarceration, torture, and kill lists (The renamed Deathsquad of old). Using military force in targeting journalists, and publications.

I wish I know what the next stage is. The insight from the old big leaders of west Germany, USSR and China has not made any new innovations on this front. At most, they were better at scaling the last step up and increasing the size of the kill lists, torture chambers, and the nastiness of the military force against journalists. I wonder if the national security agency feel a need to go one up on this, and innovate further. The virtual strip search by massive radiation machines are a nice touch, but they surely can do more.

Is there no way of setting a value higher than another so that it was always required to remove the pursuit of growth before it could remove the value for human life, so that once it reached the point of trying to pursue outside the parameters we want, it essentially would have to shut off it's growth as well?

Some points that came of out this: Many predictions and ambitions for the future of AI and AGI including Kurzweil's and the Human Brain project are far too optimistic. 

""Brain emulations around 2070 is a good middle estimate.""

Also ""Google or the US military, (are least unlikely to have an AGI breakthrough), because they both have a lot of money and are willing to try out weird things""

Here's the [Wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere) for anyone interested to learn more.)

I've been reading about Dyson spheres, and whether an intelligent race far more advanced than our own might have a need to build one to fulfill their energy needs, but I was wondering what people generally thought of them.

I mean, aside from the fact that these are something we could only consider building many millennia into the future, are they actually feasible? Could you actually surround a star with a super-structure and harness its energy? Or are there other factors at play that would make it impossible?

And, of course, is it worth looking for signs of such structures elsewhere in the universe that might have been built by an alien race, or is that an idea as ridiculous as it sounds?

Interested to hear what people think.

What would it take to create a decentralized connection system using wifi direct?

The thought popped into my head the other day while reading about wifi direct. What if I could donate or sell my 4g connection, to anyone around me? Further than that, what if we could use a multiple node wifi-direct network to share **multiple** 4g connections. We could build a decentralized, distributed wireless network, that, in its final stage, would circumvent the need for ISPs altogether.

Wifi direct is already becoming standard on almost every smartphone. Within 10-15 years, a lot of people will have wifi-D devices in their pockets. At work, suburban areas, or universities, you probably have anywhere from 2-20 people within wifi range. Many of these people have smartphones, connected to a paid-for wifi network or each having their own 4g plan. In similar thinking to torrents, this centralized model of connectivity is a huge waste of resources. 

[Opengarden](http://opengarden.com) does exactly this, only using bluetooth, which has so far been pretty unreliable for internet sharing. Ive tried this with two devices, and while it does work, bluetooth is too slow to stream video, and disconnects a lot. Not to mention bluetooths connection range compared to wifi.

In the larger picture I see a couple of phases. Phase one would be 4g and possibly router net sharing. An app would be made for rooted devices that would give easy push button join. Id distinguish between joining, and net-hosters. All members **must** share their connection, to create longer chains, but whether they want to sell/donate their *internet*, its a different story. Eventually the two would become synonymous, as the chains reach end-point services.

Phase two would be people canceling their services, finding that they already have enough other competing internet sources, meaning the chains are reaching enough computers and servers that traditional ISPs arent as viable anymore. Phase three would be a completely distributed, free, wireless internet in populated areas.

One of the technical difficulties is that although wifi direct allows a one to many connection, it seems that in this situation, one of the devices is named as the (GO) or Group owner. I find contradictory information between this, and the fact that Wifi-Directs purpose seems to be to function without requiring a central access point. Possibly this group owner system is just a current implementation, and others could be developed using the hardware.

Another is that of wifi-distance. 

Another is, how many connections is a wifi-direct device limited to? This to a certain degree may be moot, because a given device might have 3 or so others in range, but *those* devices may be connected to 3 others, and so forth.

Another is that of battery life. Im sure that running wifi-direct mode is a killer on smartphone battery life.

Security is also a big deal. Current ISPs are pretty complicit in sharing all your information anyway, but wed have to do better than that considering your local peers could potentially snoop on your network traffic. Someone will have to explain whether this is a non-issue or not.

Here are some articles I found that go into some of the technical possibilities of this, but Im still left blank on a lot of areas.

TLDR; In the same way that torrents have removed a lot of the centralization of information, is it possible to eliminate the centralization of internet connectivity?

You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, Look at that, you son of a bitch.

 Edgar D. Mitchell

I think all the time about how we are holding ourselves back as a species. 21,000 people die DAILY from hunger or hunger related causes. We have enough space to grow food for everyone on the planet but we are to fucked up as a world to feed people.

The singularity will happen.. maybe not on the projected paths but someday if our world leaders don't fuck it up. 

As for my question...

What kind of system should we have in-place before the singularity or some other world changing technology happens? 

We are on the brink of many different technologies being developed that will change us so radically that we cannot even predict what it will be like after it happens. Our world leaders are in the pocket of corporations making MASSIVE profits and hoarding it for a select few.

My answer to my question is just some simple things that I have been thinking of..

First, I believe we should have a basic income system. A basic income will guarantee that everyone gets enough money to have a home or apartment. Feed yourself and your family, and live in a society where money isn't an issue. In a world where technologies will be present that will replace most menial jobs, we should not be working to make enough cash to feed ourselves or give us a home. We should be working on the betterment of our species. We should be artists, doctors, inventors, and philosophers. We should be musicians, volunteers, scientists, and the hundreds of other paths that can be taken to better ourselves or others. 

Second, I think we should make corporations use excess profits for community projects. (I know it seems like a socialist idea or even a communist idea in some regards but hear me out.) In a world where money is less of an issue to the majority of the world, we need to keep our infrastructure intact. Roads need to be maintained.. by robots of course.. but need to be paid for. These corporations that are making billions of dollars and holding trillions of dollars in profits need to put it back into the system to better everyone. These corporations are causing massive financial crises playing a game on wall street to earn themselves enormous wealth for what? What can they use that money for? 100 million dollar homes and yachts? That money is being wasted away when we could fix our crumbling infrastructure. Bridges and roads need fixed, school programs need reinstated, free global healthcare and medicine to everyone, higher education and vocational schooling should be free. 

Third, we need to fix our completely outdated system of democracy. Our leaders are just pawns to whomever paid for their campaigns. We need to get past this archaic notion of control that they have instilled on the population. Politicians are an outdated commodity.. we no longer need that single voice championing for us in the senate or any other political office. We need to build and infrastructure that supports instant polling on local issues as well as national. With guaranteed basic income everyone should own a computer.. be it wearable or otherwise.. that can be used as a tool for communities to communicate with each other on local matters. A reddit for the street of Millerton, or even the town of Gainsville. (Not exactly reddit but and open forum where all opinions can be heard and discussed and acted upon.)

Another main concern is drugs. Drugs should be decriminalized. Why should we imprison any non violent person for using drugs?.. its barbaric. Money should go to rehabilitation centers to help people get clean of drugs.. and medical care should go to people who can't stop. I do not recommend selling meth in grocery stores next to cereal but drugs made by another drug addict in an RV with no experience whatsoever with chemistry should not be the supplier. Drugs should be made in a lab.. with strict oversight and preparation. Ultimately drugs like meth and crack cocaine are not safe to consume but cases of people getting bad drugs and dying can be prevented and people showing up to get the lab made drugs could be monitored and made to go to more doctor visits and given more chances to get clean. 

I also believe there should be safety and security for all. We need more police to patrol ALL streets but they all need to be monitored. Every police officer should be required to wear a camera and microphone and record everything not only for the police officers safety but also the publics. There have been too many instances of police officers using their weapons in situations that didn't require a firearm and this should be a HUGE issue.

Ok, I have gone on a very long tirade about issues that, I believe, need to be fixed if we are even to make it to the singularity. In a world where we can have molecular manufacturing to basically build anything we desire in our own homes, we need to stop thinking as individuals just living along with other individuals just floating on the tide of complacency to our serious world issues. We need to have a better world in place to accept these technologies that will come about or they may never arrive.. or they may be only offered to the rich, the select few. That is not a world I want to live in.

So my question again...
What kind of system should we have in-place before the singularity or some other world changing technology happens? \

(Please post any criticisms or thoughts on my proposals as I know they are not even close to being the perfect plan.. this was not a planned post just some thoughts I was throwing around while in the shower.. thinking of how bad I need a job to feed my family. Some of my ideas may seem radical but I am a peaceful person and I hate war.. especially pointless wars.)",3,7,False,self,,,,,
