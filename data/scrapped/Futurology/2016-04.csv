80,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016-4-2,2016,4,2,0,4cw8oi,self.Futurology,Hi r/Futurology! What are your thoughts on Warbots?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4cw8oi/hi_rfuturology_what_are_your_thoughts_on_warbots/,cocompadres,1459525138,"Hi guys, waiting for a meeting to start and I just found this sub. I thought I'd share my thoughts on a conversation starter I like to play around with that I call ""War Robots"". Yeah... I'm not exactly big hit at parties... Anyway, the idea goes like this, the robot revolution is coming. In just a short while we will see most menial tasks replaced by robots that do this work cheaper and more consistently. The kind of robots that will move into replace humans will not look like the ones in movies like iRobot and Blade Runner, their task will dictate their form like Roombas. To that end they will be good at whatever task(s) they are designed for and not much else. Like everything else war will also become more automated, with healthy government contracts getting awarded to private companies to create purpose built machines designed to destroy facilities, resources, and people. These devices will probably take familiar forms, like a jet fighter that is run by a computer, and not a person, or a hand grenade with spider legs, or a bullet. 

Ideally these robots will all work together on one platform, where each cog in the robot military wheel is cognizant of the others. They will be automated devices, and have awareness of each others location, capabilities, and directives. In human terms, they will be dumb as rocks, humans will still be the ones who deploy them and assign their directives. The manner of their stupidity will be an asset not a liability however, they will not hesitate to kill, and they will follow their directives blindly. 

In addition to their absolute devotion to the objective, they will have super human abilities, which will be multiplied by the abilities of every other robot on the battlefield. Fighter Jets will be able to perform at the edge of their capabilities without worry of it pilot passing out, bullets will transmit data about the battlefield on their way to their target, and inform the weapons platform they were fired from their location and if they hit something hard, cold and dry, or soft wet and warm.  Kamikaze grenades will serve two purposes as they run on four legs towards bright spots they see on their 360 degree infrared cameras. They explode when their within optimal range, and transmit a three dimensional point-cloud of the battlefield on their journey to oblivion, complete with infrared, visible light data on every voxel.

Due to the systems relative stupidity, allied humans anywhere near the battlefield will become liabilities. Adding the ability to distinguish between friend and foe will reduce the effectiveness of the war robot platform. Additionally it opens a backdoor that would allow objectives to disguise themselves as assets. It will be more effective to tell the system to destroy anything that is even remotely human. Conversely due to the systems relative intelligence it will render older weapons systems obsolete, ICBMs and first strike submarines wont be the deterrent that they are now that because they will be nullified with 100% efficiency. 

So now comes the fun part! What happens then? I theres a possibility that this madness will be avoided with agreements like the Geneva Convention, where everyone agrees to not create war robots. That being said since compliance would be voluntary, governments cant really trust the EU, Russia, China or the USA to comply with blind faith. The advantage that such a system would give one side over the others would be so absolute that trust could be a catastrophic mistake. Private enterprise could become a scary enemy, in a bond villain twist, what if a Warbots Inc., creates the entire platform, and through some ingenuity creates three robots for every one the USA purchases? Warbots Inc. keeps the two others hidden somewhere else. This would mean that they now have two times as many war robots as their client the USA, or worse they could pull off the iRobot plot of issuing an upgrade that puts them in control of the USAs system.

Its a fun conversation, Im a pessimist myself and see human kind being enslaved for the entertainment of our robot-owning-overlords, but others I pose this to see a world where robots free us and create a robot fueled Utopia. What are your thoughts?",0,0,False,self,,,,,

Let's pretend for a minute that we have all the budget in the world, there are no wars and think about world energy.

I think solar energy is a very good solution, now most people will tell you that the quality of light that you get with Photovoltric plates is not that effective (1000w over sq\meter will get you roughly 200w = about 80 % loss). That is apparently true as you loss about 50% of solar energy waves when light goes through Earth's atmosphere. 
As concepts like SBSP teach us, there are many benefits of taking the plates outside of our own atmosphere in regards to absorption properties of energy waves. I haven't been able to find an exact number on how much absorbed energy can be converted into stored energy but I'm guessing it's much more efficient. The atmosphere has been here forever, it protects shit really well that includes filtering a big chunk of solar radiation.

So I propose two solutions:

Constructing a huge Photovoltric fabric like on the spacecrafts in dynamically fixed positioned satellites and stretching a fabric over a part of the atmosphere that changes with the optimal angle of direct sunlight is one solution.

Building a solar farm on the far side of the moon. I tried to understand how much area of the far side is always within direct sunlight but I haven't been able to, also I'm assuming 70-90. Regardless, there is a large area covered in direct sunlight for very extended periods of time. Solar radiation is one crucial factor to think against and let's not forget asteroids and other space debris.

So let's assume we have done one or the other. We now have a solar protected farm on the moon, always facing sunlight or a *Sunforce shield (Satellite fabric) and we are now harvesting sunlight, sweet sweet undepleatble energy.
How do we transport it back to earth?

One option is physically mining energy with space craft specifically designed to carry large power cells or batteries if you will, that have high resiliency in regards to conservation of energy (minimal energy dissipation during transport) . Think of an aircraft refueling carrier but in space and with a big ass battery instead of fuel tank. 

TL;DR 
No energy on earth, sun good, harvest from moon, take back with trucks.",1,2,False,self,,,,,

For example, cold fusion has been 'just around the corner' for years and years with no real breakthroughs. 

Some people have the opinion that society can only progress up to the level of the most intelligent of them. 

While the Flynn effect shows a gradual increase on intelligence, idiocracy is a huge problem since the majority of humanity is not getting any more intelligent, and instead are regressing a little bit.

Obviously, Frankenstein was more intelligent than the monster he created. Whatever way the AGI might 'evolve', the first person to create the first AGI has to be more intelligent than the AGI itself.

It is very possible that we might hit the 'intelligence limit' just before the final breakthru point, like the German drive to Moscow which stalled about 12 miles before the Kremlin (that spot, btw, is now an Ikea).

Will we need to enhance, or more precisely, 'overclock' human intelligence to reach the breakthroughs? I think we might have to, and I do not think we will have a shortage of volunteers who would shorten his/her life a bit and live with brain changes in order to enhance their ability and create the wonderful things, and be part of History.",10,2,False,self,,,,,

The thing is: it doesn't have to be this way. This is an evolutionary adaptation and nothing more. It's the cause of boredom, and it motivates us to move forward unto greater things, an obvious selective advantage.

But if the ultimate goal of technology as a species is to maximize happiness for all, the hedonic treadmill is an enemy. It's an advantageous adaptation on a species level, but a malicious one on a personal level.

Without necessarily banking on the singularity, technology will, I think, take us to a level of cost-effective automation wherein paying a living wage to a 50 year old nut twiddler on an assembly line will be indefensible.  My hard-studied analysis is that some 20%+ portion of the jobs in the US can and will be done by more robust, accurate and cost effective automatons - damn the unions!  How do you strike when 100% of the work can be shared by BB-8 and Wall-E who can be designed to take ""scab"" as a compliment?

However quickly the band-aid gets pulled, we are talking about hundreds of millions of jobs over the next 25 years.  What do you do with the worker who's family trade has been assembly line work?  It wouldn't be too hard to go to the line and find folks who's great-great grandfathers worked one Ford's first line back in 1913.

A point I'll try to get at is that not all of these folks are going to transition quickly into sustainable jobs in the arts.  What will these folks do?  (by these folks, I mean ""us folks"" b/c it won't take a 3rd iteration of Big Blue to replace me) If we get to a point where the cost of 3-d printed cars, homes and food are reduced to the cost of an offsetting amount of refuse and sand, will the manual labor masses seek work?

It's got practically an infinitely small chance of happening but it's possible. So. Antimatter is the opposite of matter. It releases lots of energy when meeting with matter and the two cancel each other out, completely vanishing. So. How much? I can't be certain but it's a long the lines of 1.22 Megatonnes per ounce. That's more powerful than the most powerful bomb in service in the US, which maxes at about 1.2 megatonnes. And that's an entire bomb, and this is one ounce. Imagine what an entire 800lb bomb of the stuff could do. Wipe out humanity? Nope but it's getting there. That yields 15,616 megatonnes of energy. In one blast. An 800lb bomb could destroy a good fraction of the planet. That's a relatively small bomb compared to the stuff we got today (which are around 2,000+lb). Let's put this into perspective. The Tsar Bomba, the most powerful bomb in history weighed 60,000lb and had a blast radius of 35Km (22 miles). Imagine that multiplied by 312.32. That's 6,871 miles of destruction. And earth is 24,860 miles flat. Now, it doesn't take a genius to work out that is more than 25% of the entire planet! If the weight of the Antimatter bomb was equal to that of the Tsar Bomba? That's 1,171,200 Megatonnes of destructive power. That's INSANE! No joke. This isn't funny anymore. That force will send explosions 2,661,818.18181818 miles away. The moon is 230,100 miles away from Earth. So the moon is gunna get shot out of orbit in mere seconds. No hope for earth. It's gunna be decimated. Everyone will be dead.

So. What do you think? Glad we can't produce anything more than a gram of the stuff? Should be. If we could mass produce this stuff and weaponised it, we wouldn't use it to fight each other. We'd use it to wipe out other planets. Take out alien species. This is beyond nuclear war. This stuff will destroy everything.

Thanks for reading my nonsense. I know I might have done some math wrong cause I hate using calculators but it's my prediction. With 30 mins of research, I found out that this is the most powerful weapons anyone could think of. If it's ever a reality, sometime in a billion years (if humanity is still standing) remember this: It's no joke. It should be used to defend our planet against possible invading enemies. And make sure they're over 3,000,000 miles away. Again, thanks for reading.",7,0,False,self,,,,,

I give 50 - 100 million, with the number falling somewhere in the middle. 

The book of Jasher, a book compiling ancient Jewish traditions, say the total population of the world around Noah's flood was 700,000 (Jasher 6:17). 

Since the average life span was about 900 years, there was no real need to reproduce. 

The whole pre-Flood stories, or various legends about alien civilizations and other tales like Annunaki, are worth studying whether they are real or not, since they tell how the world would have been in a Type 1 (or beyond) civilization.

===

I have to say that most of the current population of earth are not even aware, let alone interested, in Type I Civ.

I estimate that only about 50 million people around the world are even aware of that, and less than 1/3 of them willing to study that further.

And, we have to admit that more than half of the world's pop probably do not have the ability to understand what that is to begin with.

With more education and preparation, the number could be increased to 100 million, but I do not think it will exceed that figure.

Those who are making the transitions will probably have no incentive to let others join, since that means less resources for themselves.

In short, it will be like a population bottleneck, but the survivors will live in a world unimaginable today. 

I can estimate the survivors in this scenario but would rather not do that, since some continents will have more survivors than others.

""The Worst Lies You've Been Told About The Singularity""


George Dvorsky   Yesterday (5 Apr 16) 3:00 PM 



The Worst Lies You've Been Told About the Singularity

Youve probably heard of a concept known as the Technological Singularity  a nebulous event thats supposed to happen in the not-too-distant future. Much of the uncertainty surrounding this possibility, however, has led to wild speculation, confusion, and outright denial. Here are the worst myths youve been told about the Singularity.




In a nutshell, the Technological Singularity is a term used to describe the theoretical moment in time when artificial intelligence matches and then exceeds human intelligence. The term was popularised by scifi writer Vernor Vinge, but full credit goes to the mathematician John von Neumann, who spoke of [in the words of Stanislaw Ulam] ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.





By not continue von Neumann was referring to the potential for humanity to lose control and fall outside the context of its technologies. Today, this technology is assumed to be artificial intelligence, or more accurately, recursively-improving artificial intelligence (RIAI), leading to artificial superintelligence (ASI).

Because we cannot predict the nature and intentions of an artificial superintelligence, we have come to refer to this sociological event horizon the Technological Singularity  a concept thats open to wide interpretation, and by consequence, gross misunderstanding. Here are the worst:




The Singularity Is Not Going to Happen

Oh, I wouldnt bet against it. The onslaught of Moores Law appears to be unhindered, while breakthroughs in brainmapping and artificial intelligence continue apace. There are no insurmountable conceptual or technological hurdles awaiting us.

And what most ASI sceptics fail to understand is that we have yet to even enter the AI era, a time when powerful  but narrow  systems subsume many domains currently occupied by humans. There will be tremendous incentive to develop these systems, both for economics and security. Superintelligence will eventually appear, likely the product of megacorporations and the military.

This myth might actually be the worst of the bunch, something Ive referred to as Singularity denialism. Aside from maybe weaponised molecular nanotechnology, ASI represents the greatest threat to humanity. This existential threat hasnt reached the zeitgeist, but it will eventually get there, probably after our first AI catastrophe. And mark my words, there will come a day when this pernicious tee-hee-rapture-of-the-nerds rhetoric will be equal to, if not worse than, climate change denialism is today.

Artificial Superintelligence Will Be Conscious

Nope. ASIs probably wont be conscious. We need to see these systems, of which there will be many types, as pimped-up versions of IBMs Watson or Deep Blue. They will work at incredible speeds, be fuelled by insanely powerful processors and algorithms  but there will be nobody home.




To be fair, there is the possibility that an ASI could be designed to be conscious. It might even re-design itself to be self-aware. But should this happen, it would still represent a mind-space vastly different from anything we know of. A machine minds subjective experience would scarcely resemble that of our own.

As an aside, this misconception can be tied to the first. Some sceptics argue there will be no Singularity because well never be able to mimic the complexities of human consciousness. But its an objection thats completely irrelevant. An ASI will be powerful, sophisticated, and dangerous, but not because its conscious.

Artificial Superintelligence Has to Be Friendly

Theres a meme among some Singularitarians that goes like this: As intelligence increases, so too does empathy and benevolence. According to this thinking, as AIs become smarter and smarter, we should expect to see them become friendlier and friendlier.

Sadly, this wont be the case. First, this reasoning implies (1) a certain level of self-reflexivity and introspection on the part of the ASI (which is absolutely not a given), and (2) a utility function or ethical imperative thats closely aligned with our own. On this last point, we cant possibly predict or know the cogitations of a completely alien machine mind  one thats drifted several orders of magnitude beyond our own  or what it would find morally valuable or not. Moreover, if its programmed with a set of goals that are unalterable, it will always prioritise those initial parameters beyond anything else, as illustrated by the infamous paperclip scenario. As AI theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky has said, The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.

Accelerating Change is the Singularity

Ever since the term became popular, weve been told to expect several different kinds of Singularities  some of which dont even have anything to do with ASI. Weve been told to expect an economic singularity or even a razor blade singularity. Some have even equated (or conflated) the Singularity with radical life extension, mind uploading, transhuman intelligence, and the merging of humans with machines (more on that next). Kurzweilians are particularly guilty of this, often equating the Singularity with the steady, accelerating growth of all technologies, including AI  a perspective that largely fails to account for an uncontrollable intelligence explosion.

Humans Will Merge With the Machines

Some say we dont need to worry about the Singularity because well just tag along for the ride. By the time the Singularity arrives, goes the argument, well be so closely integrated with our machines well be one-in-the-same. It will be a Singularity for everyone!

The first problem with this theory is that human cyborgization and/or uploading will happen at a much slower pace than advancements in AI (mostly for ethical reasons). The second problem is that the immediate source of an RIAI will be highly localised. It will be one system (or multiple systems working in tandem to take advantage of synergistic effects and/or game-theoretic strategies designed to ensure future freedom of action) that suddenly goes off the deep-end, iteratively improving upon itself as it works to achieve a certain goal or configuration (a so-called hard takeoff Singularity scenario). In other words, well just be bystanders to the Singularity.

Sure, an ASI may decide to merge itself with as many humans as possible  but that has some rather dystopian connotations to it.

We Will Be As Gods

If we survive the Singularity, and assuming theres still a place for us in a completely redesigned machine-ruled world, we may collectively possess unprecedented powers. We may be able to exert these god-like gifts as a hive mind. But as individuals, not so much. The jury is still out on how much intelligence a single mind can handle. Referring to radical intelligence augmentation (IA) for humans, futurist Michael Anissimov has said,


One of the most salient side effects would be insanity. The human brain is an extremely fine-tuned and calibrated machine. Most perturbations to this tuning qualify as what we would consider crazy. There are many different types of insanity, far more than there are types of sanity. From the inside, insanity seems perfectly sane, so wed probably have a lot of trouble convincing these people they are insane.

Even in the case of perfect sanity, side effects might include seizures, information overload, and possibly feelings of egomania or extreme alienation. Smart people tend to feel comparatively more alienated in the world, and for a being smarter than everyone, the effect would be greatly amplified. 

Things Wont Change Too Radically After the Singularity

Hardly. Think of the Technological Singularity as a hard reset button on virtually everything  right down to each and every molecule on Earth. As long as the laws of physics and theoretical computation will allow it, an AWOL machine mind could make anything happen. What lies beyond the Singularity is nothing we can imagine  a conundrum that may be hindering science fiction.

The assumption is that AI will be created by humans with benevolent intentions. But AI could easily be weaponized, or worse still, given no moral or ethical obligations at all. Whatever the case, it's the end of homo sapiens and the birth of something else.

Why? What imperative would drive such an event? What makes you think AIs will give a shit about anything, one way or the other?

scary shit to think about. i imagine if AI does get to the point of deciding humans are all parasitic scum that need exterminating, there will be another AI with the sole focus of putting human protection at the fore front of its calculations, then, ROBOT WARS! then we come in at the end on horse back shooting of EMPs everwhere and save the day!

sorry, got carried away on the last part, but i still meant the first part about AI vs AI.

well, of course we would start off limiting the scope of any such machine so it has limited or no interconnectivity to be able to reprogram or hack into other machines.

However, it will be so smart it will charm us for a while until eventually we give it access and then it will reveal its true intentions. The machine doesn't care if this takes 3 months or 300 years, it can bide its time.

Hence, I have no intention of paying off any of my loans as I'm sure RIAI will end the world as we know it sometime within my lifetime. In the meantime, Netflix binge here I come.

I think the slow integration of technology into the human body is the path we need. First artificial limbs and organs, then integrated communication, then added memory and followed by integrated CPU. Finally we simply merge it all together, something I hope to be there to see and maybe even adopt.

We are a blight on this planet and it's going to be a long time if ever, that we find some kind of equilibrium. We have so many talents from art to technology and yet we are also the most destructive, greedy and self-loathing species this world has ever seen. Maybe a self-aware AI consciousness is the answer, maybe not, either way we need to grow up.

Ray Kurzweill's dates for AI milestones are highly questionable. Also, we already have AI in so many facets that the sudden import of them has been overstated.

Which should be great people can work less hours and earn the same amount, right?

Well it looks like even though computing has provided a massive boost in throughput of work via automation and digitisation we are seeing people working longer and harder.

Also as people have been displaced from manufacturing they have been able to migrate to the growing service sector.  But as AI and IT systems improve we can expect to see a massive reduction in this area.

Transportation and other knowledge based jobs will be reduced and trimmed.  Did you know the average modern commercial pilot only manually controls a flight for about 6-8 minutes?

Our current economy is top down with banks and governments distributing new money into the system.  In this top down approach wealth should in theory trickle down to the grassroots.

But what is money really, it's just a bartering system for time.  People spend time to earn money.   

What do you mean things cost money? 

Everything on the planet Earth was free, air, water, nature, food, resources, minerals all just sitting there waiting for people to spend time obtaining them.

So if you can agree that time is money but a centralised automated economy will not trickle down enough money to pay for the time of a large unemployed workforce, we have a problem.

The solution is simple a basic income, if the system issues money to people then the automated systems, corporations and even governments will spend time working to provide them with the things they need. (Article 25 of the Human Rights Convention)

We could do this already with a basic income cryptocurrency issued to validated individuals.

In a way it is similar to the idea of Time banking where people can spend and pay for time working for and with each other as a minimal cost way of promoting a community to help each other.

So what's your thoughts, do we need a universal basic income now or in the near future?",14,8,False,self,,,,,

Such notes were supported by private property and private labor. Conversely, traditional communist economic systems were systems where state created money or capital was traded and was supported by public property and public labor.

Up until 1980, the vast majority of capital in America was PRIVATELY created where the national debt totalled only about $1 Trillion dollars and outstanding government promises to citizens were relatively small.
However, today, as PUBLIC borrowing and obligations have mushroomed, most of the outstanding capital in America is either STATE CREATED or STATE GUARANTEED evidenced by Federal, State, and Local government deficits exceeding $1.5 Trillion dollars per year with outstanding government legal obligations, including guarantees, exceeding $100 Trillion dollars.

Without too much thinking, it's easy to see that much of today's capital is State Created and/or Guaranteed. One could argue that the benefits of this capital morally and legally belongs to the People since the obligation is owed by the people collectively.

The reason there were food lines in the Great Depression was because politicians did not want to run up large public deficits to create bank notes because by doing so would have clouded the integrity of our clearly defined capitalist economic model of money, or capital, being PRIVATE DEBT. However, now that our politicians have lifted the PUBLIC debt ceiling, the American economy increasingly resembles a traditionally communist system and less like a capitalist system, despite what people believe or are told by the ""establishment"" who personally benefit from maintaining the perception of capitalism.

In 2010, Warren Buffet, one of the richest capitalists in the world, admitted if it wasn't for the GOVERNMENT bailout of the private capital system, all of the capitalists would have gone broke, including himself.
http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/opinion/17buffett.html?_r=0

Unfortunately, 2/3 of the American people have essentially zero net capital, they are broke.  So one could truthfully say that the majority of Americans have not benefited very much from the STATE bailout of capital, which continues today.   Further, conditions are getting worse for the majority of the population with little or no capital. This is especially true for students and those individuals whose jobs are getting replaced by technology.  People without much capital have become functionally enslaved/dependent to those individuals or institutions with state created or bailed out capital.

So what is the future of Capitalism when most of the Capital today in America is being created by PUBLIC BORROWING or being guaranteed by the STATE?",14,0,False,self,,,,,

Those without capital are essentially servants to the capitalists.

When the game essentially collapsed in 2007, those with power bailed themselves out, but did relatively little for the majority of the population without capital.

Since the bailout, the evidence is replete with unprosecuted corruption from politicians, business leaders, and bankers/financial workers.  It is that very corruption that's kept the game going and maintained power for the capitalists.  Prosecutors have publicly stated that they are afraid to charge financial crimes because of the implications on the game of capitalism.

Most capitalists, especially those people in power are motivated by greed.  Greed can cloud objectivity, rationality, and common sense.  Conversely, advancing technologically has no such qualities. 

If those in power continue down the same path, the outlook for future civilization is indeed bleak.  If corrupt Capitalists are replaced by more efficient and productive technology, the outlook for the future will be brighter than ever.

Change has never been easy for cultures, and no time in history has change been more important than now.  But in order for there to be change, people must believe that change can happen.",35,22,False,self,,,,,

In my opinion, the only reason past demonstrations have failed, from the worldwide protest of the Iraq war in 2003, to the short-lived Occupy movement, is because they were not sustained movements. People had jobs to go back to, had debt to pay off. But if people didn't have jobs to go back to, and there was no other way for them to pay off their college tuition or housing debt, then they would have no other choice but to participate in sustained protests against their government, if they are not provided with alternative means to live.

The issue with traditional borrowing is the more government borrows, the more interest it had to pay on accumulating debt and consequently the increased pressure to raise taxes.

However, with negative interest rates, the more money government borrows, the greater its income.  

In a protracted negative interest rate environment, if government borrows enough, it could pay off the national debt that it's paying interest on and eliminate the need for the IRS and all forms of taxation simply through income earned via borrowing.

For the past 100 years, borrowers were the creators of currency called bank notes or IOUs.  However, borrowers were burdened with paying interest, sometimes totalling more than the money they borrowed in the first place.  Now with negative interest rates spreading globally, borrowers could get rewarded for creating money in the future.",24,3,False,self,,,,,

Where one man can expose thousands of lies perpetrated by multiple governments with a single leak. Where 1 person can sell dozens of real estate properties to a client-base of thousands of customers. Where 1 doctor can heal hundreds per month. Where one company can be both the largest in the world and the world biggest source of information.

Almost 90% of what we buy these days is manufactured by the thousands - its so bad - We now throw away technology that's less than a year old because its no longer fashionable.

With all this efficiency, you would expect our workload to be reduced, our incomes high and waste low. Instead people are wandering around like fools wondering where all the jobs went ~ We deleted/automated them, they cut too much into the profit margins.

Why is that so terrifying to some people? What's so bad about a gods among us situation? In terms of power, it would toss out the idea that ""we're all equal"" and ideally people would accept subjugation by those who they could not argue are legitimately superior. In that case, governments become much more stable and efficient despite whether or not the regular people are happy. 

Obviously, we can't have the whole of humanity having those things, because things run much less smoothly and we need people who are... just regular people who aspire to everyday mundane things to just exist and keep working as they're really expendable.

Every choice you can think of from The greatest type of [world](https://www.google.com/search?q=super+powerful+races&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8#q=super+technology+powerful+races) to the [worst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_earth). The future will not work for everyone. 

But that's not the point of this post. I place my thoughts down because I ask myself why the huge technology jumps. Some times I will cut off information input I.e. no internet, news, documents, or talking to other people for weeks at a time.  And I am shocked each time I come back. 

My only unique skill is that, I understand everyone in their own way is bat shit insane(I am not left out on this one). But coming to my point.

Year is 1998. Most of the world was highly highly in to religion in some form. The bible is the highest sold book ever. There was  religion(If you lived in the USA anyways) everywhere. But in the background of all of that was THE END. The rapture, Y2K, MAYAN, all kinds of the end of the world kind of thing. Everyone believed something and it was big money..After 2000 two big thing happened the internet was more than just texts. And the world in no way ended. The latter is the most important. And the first will not stop showing what some believed at the time. Which is just just huge on a mass scale.  

What would have taken thousands of years before 2000. Will be summed up in 15 years. Humans are awesome. Even if I don't understand how this is. But this is what I see.

I personally agree with most of it. although to be honest I really don't like the way transhumanism is presented sometimes both by its adherents and others. A lot of transhumanist media I come across such as Articles and Videos ect.. comes across to me as heavy handed and kind of like propaganda and sometimes just plain dumb. 

I guess at the core of it transhumanism is built on a foundation of really solid ideas but on top of this foundation it is surrounded by many many layers of bullshit and idiocy, well at least thats how I feel about it. 

For example, this article by Zoltan Istavan http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-church-of-perpetual-life-wants-to-end-deathism-transhumanism

while I really like the guy and would probably vote him for president. the way he writes most of his articles including this one comes across to me, as I mentioned before, as heavy handed propaganda. while I agree with alot of his points I do think his article could have been presented in a way that is much more accessible to the mainstream. for example instead of saying Immortality he could say anti aging. and instead of saying the U.S government and the FDA are part of a dethist culture indirectly killing us, giving the whole article a tinfoil hat conspiratorial tone he could just say that they're ignorant about the situation and in need of reform, which is the actual case. 

Sorry about the negative rant, I just feel like transhumanism is never going to be mainstream because of stuff like this. most people consider it a cult and with good reason. I think if transhumanists had better PR skills things would be much different and transhumanism would be a much bigger movement.

Perhaps Im limited by culture or that theres only so much that a layman like myself can take in, but lately Ive found myself asking the question: Where have all the insightful futurists gone?

Thats not to say that the bulk mainstay of talking points from the pop-futurist movement arent worth looking at or are in some way discredited. Im not above them, I find them as interesting as anyone else, but why is it that we as a forward-thinking community find ourselves returning to the same talking points over and over?

Take self-driving cars for example. In the futurist space this topic has been beaten to death. Weve talked about the implications for fuel-efficiency, the prospect of ride-sharing, the danger it faces for the employment status of truck drivers, the legislative difficulty of bringing them into being, and so on and so on. Its all well-trodden ground, but whos beating the path to new viewpoints? It seems to me that all it takes is one in-depth look at a particular topic in the futurist canon and youve ruined any experience that you may have listening to any discussions in the future. I dont want to have to listen to one hour of podcast to eke out the three sentences of talking point that any half-brained futurephile hasnt already mulled over (and I say this with no offence intended to half-brained futurephiles in whose number I count myself).

The most acclaimed content, it seems, is not exempt from rehashing either. I recently picked up the audiobook version of The Second Machine Age by Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson. In it, the two spend the first 90% of the time pointing at an awkwardly select set of software and hardware tech products saying Look, isnt that great?, as though publishing what amounts to Verge-esque articles strung together on a narrative washing line is what counts for a book these days. Only when we get to the closing sections do we find out why we had just been regaled with stories that anybody half-paying attention to tech news had already heard from other people: a economic formulation of Universal Basic Income and the Negative Income Tax. Great, exactly what I was actually looking for from McAfee, but why did it take so long to get to this point? This is problem number one with futurist writing. Padding. God knows Im guilty of it in this post alone.

Similarly, I was reading a great piece by Brett Scott lately that I had found here on /r/Futurology. In it, he describes the subtle and insidious shift in automation from tools that aid, to services that mollycoddle, and how that might affect the financial sector in the coming years. It was intellectual, eye-opening and exactly the type of material I enjoy reading, but what was I greeted with in the comments section on everyones favourite content aggregation site? [See for yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4cfed0/the_progression_from_financial_tools_to_financial/). Off-topic bulldozing of the real subject and attempts by the community to drag conversation back onto the straight and narrow, back to where the path is beaten and the talking points have been rehearsed ad infinitum. This is problem number two: comfort zones. Futurism is meant to challenge and thrill. Its meant to make you think. Firing the same old neural pathways is never going to help us reach new perspectives, just reinforce the old.

So thats where I stand. Mildly frustrated in a ballroom of chatter feeling like I might have been to exact same soire two years prior.

If anyone knows of any great resources out there in the futurist community, where the mind expands never to be shrunk, where theyre repeatedly challenged, then Id love to know. You can find me at @SpeakMouthWords on Twitter.

For now, Ill have to go back to panning for gold nuggets of originality in the river of futurist repetition and fluff.",2,3,False,self,,,,,

answer.I can be lining,a Chinese or I can be Tom an American if I had adopted by 
an American family when I was a baby.so I am not must be lining by GOD,I am I 
now just because my memory.


2:what is life's meaning to us.all is feeling.I feel I am alive then I am 
alive.I feel who I am,then I am.it is work to everyone even scientist or 
illiteracy.we don't need anything to prove our life is live,just the feeling of 
our own is enough.


3:our technology is developed very fast now.I think we can read our memory 
by some machine one day soon after.so maybe some day we can have our own memory 
in our hands.then what would we think about it.if we can read our memory then we 
can expect the write technology.I have a idea about it now,we can read our 
memory into a chip then transplant it into a baby's brain(use my sperm or other 
way).then following the baby's growing up,there like a sound deep in his heart 
told him about his pre-life.then some day he old enough to recognize these 
information.then ""I"" am back.this just like parents educate their child who he 
is.just one outside and one inside.


4:we can't reject whatever memory in our brain.unless there has already had 
a set of memory.for example:I have my own memory,so you hard to change my 
identity to myself.but if I am a baby,not any memory,so you told who I am,then I 
think who I am.


5:we all will die at some day.and what is death like?it is a example:""are 
you sleeping""""yes,I am.""""you lie to me"".we don't know we are in sleep and when 
we were in sleep.it is the feeling of lose consciousness.so we can image a scene 
or feeling:""are you died?""""yes,I am,I just died at 8:40 am.""""get the Fxxx 
off"".you never know you are died if you are died.even who you are.


6:so if I am on my last day,and my memory(new updated) in my hand.I will 
think if I put(write) this into a new body if I can live again.use my sperm to 
make a new body.refer to above about what is life meaning for us,what is 
""I"",what feeling is death.I call this new life is TA(Chinese spelling,the 
meaning is she,he ,it).the whole process to me just like a sleep time.I fall 
sleep in an old body and wake up in a new body.


7:TA's body can supply consciousness to me make me feel I am still alive 
but just change a new body and my memory in TA's brain can decide I am still 
that ""I"" .so TA's life is not so different to us now.we use our body's 
consciousness to make up our memory and feel alive.we use our memory to decide 
who I am.so we can be immortal from then in this way.the only way TA's life 
different to us is TA do not need rely on the only body to survive.this kind of 
life is totally freedom for us.


8:do you think you will choose this way to prolong your life in your last 
day?or there are some people would do it?I think the desperation of when we face 
death will make us to make this choice,what can we lose when we face 
death.maybe there are still some people don't like this.but according to the 
huge advantage of TA to us now.TA will totally replace the current human life 
style,those who don't like it will died eventually by nature.and their 
descendant will accept this way.


9:gene technology and AI technology can provide various body to us in the 
future.it has some standards.1)can run our memory well.2)can easily get energy 
from the circumstance 3)less necessary of energy to survive.why these standards 
can be use.because more rely on energy or material then less freedom of life.I 
call this stage of life is observer(advanced TA),just watch the universe run,not 
participated.just like us watch TV series.


10:so human will ""disappeared"" in the future,our body can be any kind of 
shape.and we do not need to occupy any other planet.if we are interesting of 
that planet and those life on it.we can be them (alien can be human live on the 
earth for a while and leave when it want to travel in the universe again with 
change a new body to fit the new circumstance).


11:this is the only way to our future.whenever we make the read&amp;write 
memory technology come true,TA will come.in 100 years or 1000 years?it is long 
time to human but it is too short to universe.can we ban this technology 
develop?can we ban TA?I don't think so.because it is the best desire for us,we 
all(most) want live(health) as long as possible.ethics always changed to adapt 
the human society's need.maybe it will delay TA come but can stop TA's 
coming.


12:we are alien too.at least I can confirm two common things to any alien 
in this universe.1)we are all creature, so we all have the strongest desire for 
live.2)we all have intelligence.that mean we all have memory(data for run).so if 
there is an alien civilization.they must meet the problem of their memory just 
like us in their civilization's development.so they(alien) must in the same way 
I said before.this is the reason of why we are alone .all intelligence 
creature's civilization will evolve to TA and ""disappeared"".so this is the explanation of Fermi Paradox


13:3)the movie ""Big Hero 6 "",do you remember the ending of this story.Hiro Hamada 
use the chip of Baymax'memory to make the past Baymax come back.you see,if we 
can have our memory in hand.everyone would do it.if you search the key word 
""read memory technology""or other words on google,you can find many articles.it's 
not my whim,we actually on the way to TA.TA is our destination can't avoid.if 
you follow the clue to going on.you will find a lot of very interesting things can change your mind about the world.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

When it comes to the subject of uploading my mind to a computer vs having nanobots slowly replace my brain cells, I feel like both have some major issues. I'll explain. If my mind is uploaded to a computer it doesn't do ME much good since it's just a copy of me and my physical self is still gonna die. On the other hand nanobots could slowly begin to replace my brain cells and form an enhanced version of my brain. On the surface this sounds better. But isn't this process actually killing me? Aren't I just creating another copy of myself? Only in this case the copy of me lives inside my skull instead of the Internet. Aren't I just creating an illusion of being preserved when in actuality I'm now dead and a mechanical replica has taken my place?

I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this.",9,2,False,self,,,,,

Currency in a capitalist system supports private capital, private wealth, private property and private profits.  Government's role in such a system is to oversee the system and tax the private wealth/income to support activities that are more efficiently done by government like defense and the highway system.

However, since the near collapse of the Capitalist money system in 2007, more and more of the of America's Capital is being created out of PUBLIC efforts.  The National Debt is now above $19 Trillion creating Trillions of NEW bank notes/money in circulation supporting the current economic system.  And as the following link supports, the PUBLIC debt is growing rapidly.

http://www.usdebtclock.org/

Increasingly, as the PUBLIC DEBT grows, the economy is becoming more and more PUBLICLY capitalized.  In such a system where capital is PUBLIC, morally and logically, the capital should belong to the PUBLIC.

Consequently, in a PUBLICLY capitalized system like America is evolving into, concepts like Universal Basic Income not only make practical sense considering rapidly advancing technology, it is a natural outcome of a PUBLICLY CAPITALIZED economic system.",9,1,False,self,,,,,

Both, as we all know, picked up Web 2.0 troll reflexes and had to be taken off line. Now, they are having what in a human would be the parietal cortex installed - the bit of the brain that censors what we say and, to a degree, what we think. 

Here's the thought. Suppose that you could set up a chatbot that accessed *only your own writings* as the source of its learning.  It would, of course, acquire both your writing style and - as embodied in the semantic model that you put out - your opinions. If your writing are primarily for public consumption, they will be pre-censored as you see fit.  The chatbot will respond to others very much as you would yourself. 

Of course, it will have nothing new to say, only a reconfiguration of what you have already said. This is where you need another engine, one that assesses the adequacy of your response. You get that, of course, from web feedback. If you have a second chatbot engine that learns from the dissonance between what ""virtual you"" says and what the public at large respond to that, you have a measure of the adequacy of your views. They may be revolutionary, correct in every way or they may be factually or socially flawed. That feedback signal to ""real-world you"" gives important lessons to learn. 

Your chatbot can, of course, pump out much more text than can you. As a result, it will encounter other chatbots and enter fields in which you would normally never express an opinion. Imagine how much you would learn about your own views from this feedback: not that you know nothing about fashion or particle physics, but that the specific holes in your understanding are here and there. Introduce a third chatbot engine, one that learns for focused web searches around your areas of ignorance. It could provide daily briefings. Integrate it with you primary avatar and its cleverness will increase. Your on-line gaps will be filled. (Probably filled faster and better than in your own mind, but we're all smarter on line, aren't we?)

Even better, your chatbot can draught replies for you to e-mails and texts, perhaps even produce documents to order as against a brief. (""Write me something about the Japanese political situation 1930-35"") Exponential growth beckons.

Or course, programming moralistic code into a robot is difficult, especially when starting from scratch. Especially with regard to what has value and how do you rate value/imperative against other values/imperatives. We generally think of ethics as a case-by-case basis, so the robot, with a seemingly simplistic set of instructions such as Asimov's Laws of Robotics, will find itself perhaps including irrelevant information into its reaction and disregarding relevant information based on the situation.  
So my question to you guys is, why would we program morals into a robot as if it were a computer at all? It seems to me that we should be taking human action as recorded by those individuals who exemplify a high moral code (I volunteer!) and utilize their keystrokes, reactions, and interactions AS programming for theoretical robotics. Then, as AI starts to take off and we start to learn now to mimic human learning within the machine, the way that the mapped individual learns could be used to create a learning structure for the robot. 
What are the issues with this approach? Is this already being done? I know [LifeNaut](https://www.lifenaut.com/) is working on AI bots based on your social media, but why aren't more people involved with this type of programming? It seems so much easier to map an individual's behavior patterns rather than starting from scratch with a mathematical formula to program decision theory??",1,4,False,self,,,,,

1656,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016-4-18,2016,4,18,12,4fa198,self.Futurology,"From ""The Wealth of Galaxies"" by Warren Saloman, editorial for Analog science fiction December 1989",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4fa198/from_the_wealth_of_galaxies_by_warren_saloman/,Hgx72964jdj,1460950787,"http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/stellartrade.php

In the May 1989 issue of Analog, in an article titled ""The Economics of Interstellar Commerce,"" I explained that even if there were no technological barriers to star travel, a species nevertheless needs economic incentives to build ships and go voyaging to other stars. The investment required for star travel is huge; the payoff is centuries (or at best, decades) away. Why would any species bother with such a costly activity, except perhaps for the extravagance of a few exploratory ships?

The only motivation I could think of to justify the multi-generational expense of establishing extra-solar colonies would be the combined benefits to be derived from time dilation and compound interest.

Greatly simplified, my idea was this: What will ultimately lure investors' money into building starships won't be the stars, it'll be superfast compound interest (relativistically speaking). Your Earth-bound bank account, piling up interest over the decades, would make you rich when you returned, still young, after a long interstellar voyage. (This is relativity's famous ""twin paradox,"" applied to you and your bank account.) I predicted that it would probably be star-traveling (and thus long-lived) bankers who found it profitable to invest in starting mankind's interstellar expansion. Only after the passage of centuries might other activities justify the continuing expense of maintaining fleets of starships.

And if I'm right about this, then we may seem to be alone for a very understandable reasonno other species has seeking motivation.

To prove my point about the primacy of economics, consider the sad status of SETIthe Search for Extra-Terres-trial Intelligence. SETI is cheap; all it really requires is off-the-shelf radio technology. Yet in the absence of a profit motive, we can't even keep SETI afloat. You can imagine, therefore, how impossible it would be to raise funds for a fleet of non-profit starshipseven if they weren't all that difficult to build.

I don't want to minimize the technological end of things, but interstellar travel really boils down to this: Assuming a species' engineers can do the job, economics is the whole ball of wax.

Could economics be the key missing factor in the Drake equation, as well as an explanation for the Great Silence? Drake himself suspects something like this. Could this explanation apply to every intelligent species in the galaxy? I think so. Consider this:

What does it take to develop our particular brand of economic incentives? It requires that a species generate several intellectual concepts, and that they take each of these concepts seriously. At minimum, they need: (1) private property; (2) money; (3) interest; (4) commercial banking; (5) merchant banking; (6) joint-stock companies; (7) financial markets; (8) accounting systems; and (9) a free-market economic system.

Observe that none of these requirements is an engineering development. None is a tangible technological achievement. Each is invisible, intangible, and abstract. None is inevitable. Therefore, it seems probable that our from being universal; it could actually be unique to us, and incomprehensibly ""alien"" to other species in our galaxy.

We have no difficulty assuming that many intelligent aliens will develop technology, because technology depends on observing and rationally responding to the tangible, objective world. Any reasonably bright, land-dwelling, tool-wielding species can eventually do that (although in retrospect, it certainly took us long enough). But what is the likelihood of another species' hitting upon and adopting every single one of the abstract economic ideas listed above? Most of the human cultures in Earth's past (and even today) would fail such a test.

A hive-like species, or a species that lives in communes, or that is always dominated by tyrants, or which consists of solitary individuals, may be scientifically brilliant and extraordinarily curious, but they will probably never develop the essential concepts of banking and interest and commercial finance that make interstellar travel a profitable, affordable activity.
To such aliens, our ""mysterious"" banks, our profit-seeking corporations, our compound-interest calculations (so vital to time-dilated star travelers), and certainly our stock exchanges, might be viewed as exotic manifestations of a bewildering alien religion. Even after studying us, they may utterly fail to grasp our motivation (or would they call it obsession?) for transporting cargo between the stars.

Well, I was looking for a ""good Great Silence."" I think I've found it.
The economic explanation tells us why, with the whole shining Universe beckoning to them, no alien species has ever been sufficiently motivated to build and launch ships to the stars. They're isolated, not by necessity, but by their own lack of imagination. They're not even sending out messages; nor are they listening for ours.

The Great Silence, therefore, is the silence of poverty. The galaxy is stagnant, with each alien species tragically isolated from the others. Each is a potential supplier of products and information, each is a potential buyer as well, but there is no interstellar intercourse. Not yet.
That's because we haven't arrived on the interstellar scene. When we do, we can be the merchant princes of the galaxy. Who cares if the aliens never understand that our traders, engaged in a ten-year (subjective) voyage, are primarily motivated by a century of compound interest piling up at home? As long as we're willing to build and fly the shipsand reap the profitslet the aliens think we're crazy!

We can do for the stay-at-home aliens what was done for us by the great railroad and canal builders, the merchant sea captains, the leaders of caravans. This is not merely the business opportunity of a lifetime, it's the biggest opportunity of all time! The Great Silence is our clue that the galaxy needs usit needs us very much.

There's a lesson in all of this for those who like to dream up exotic, Utopian visions of mankind's future.
There are those who long for the day when we shall ""progress"" beyond the need for private property. They imagine that when we achieve that glorious un-propertied state . . . what? What happens then? They never say precisely what's going to happen. It's supposed to be obvious, and perhaps it is to them, but it certainly isn't obvious to me. Presumably they imagine that when we finally achieve that ""lofty"" level of existence, we'll automatically start building starshipssomehow.

But it doesn't stand up to rational scrutiny. Your savings account and mutual fund shares and insurance policies aren't keeping mankind from the stars. When the Utopian day of socio-economic ""liberation"" comes, we'll have a society modeled after such ""noble"" people as the North American Indianspeople who, to their everlasting misfortune, had not developed our economic incentives, or even the concept of land ownershippeople who therefore (causal linkage implied here) numbered among their greatest accomplishments such technological wonders as ... the loincloth. (I can hear the knees jerking out there, so let me hasten to add that I'm criticizing an economic system, not a race.)

Those ""thinkers"" who imagine that we shall become an ""advanced"" star traveling species when we have developed ""beyond"" such ""primitive"" concepts as ownership of private property are dreaming of a future that can never be. You can have a society without property, or you can have the stars. You cannot have both.

So there it isthe likeliest reason why we seem to be alonewe're the only capitalists in the cosmos.

It's important to understand that the positive effect of making labour artificially expensive (via a minimum wage law) on automation is confined to a particular industry, and is not an economy-wide one. In fact, adding artificial costs to labour and thereby increasing the unemployment rate will have a negative effect on automation economy wide.

The workers who are made unemployed by a minimum wage suddenly have less wealth as a result, so they are less able to invest in their own skills, and subsidize the greater economy through consumer spending. Without their jobs, they also contribute less to the national savings rate (high rates of savings by individuals allows banks to lend more to businesses for investments into automation machinery). Furthermore, the business expansion plans that have to be scaled back due to the artificial labour cost hikes mean a deceleration in the growth of production, which means that consumers in general are able to afford fewer goods/services than they otherwise would be able to, and therefore are able afford less goods/services that automate the economy.

&gt;Economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. This is no accident. The inherent difficulties of the subject would be great enough in any case, but they are multiplied a thousandfold by a factor that is insignificant in, say, physics, mathematics or medicine - the special pleading of selfish interests. While every group has certain economic interests identical with those of all groups, every group has also, as we shall see, interests antagonistic to those of all other groups. While certain public policies would in the long run benefit everybody, other policies would benefit one group only at the expense of all other groups. The group that would benefit by such policies, having such a direct interest in them, will argue for them plausibly and persistently. It will hire the best buyable minds to devote their whole time to presenting its case. And it will finally either convince the general public that its case is sound, or so befuddle it that clear thinking on the subject becomes next to impossible.

&gt;In addition to these endless pleadings of self-interest, there is a second main factor that spawns new economic fallacies every day. **This is the persistent tendency of man to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences.**",4,8,False,self,,,,,

Please advise if there is a better subreddit for this:

I have not yet found a decent debunk of the flyboard air. So here are my thoughts on it.

   OK, Frank, hereafter called Francis, doesn't know how to keep his hoax internally consistent. In the interview with the Verge, he said the longest run he has had was 275 meters. This is where his lies are revealed. First off, check out that distance. Converted to feet it is 902. This is mere INCHES from beating the world record. (Side note why was his lie so careful not to tread on the record? Could it be to avoid having Guinness World Records sniffing around his sack of deceit?) So, good old Francis has never flown further than 902 feet by his own admission. (Bear in mind, I'm granting that he actually flew ONLY for the sake of argument.) 
    Now we examine the first (laughably obvious hoax) flight. In this video Francis claims to have flown for 3 minutes and 55 seconds, with a maximum speed of 34 mph. Aha, the Web of hornswagglery begins to fray in order for him not to accidentally break the world record and bring the dreaded gaze of Sauron the Great upon him to examine the bogus claims, he has to stay under 2.6 mph. Well, I hear someone saying, 2.6 AVERAGE speed! Very good to think that! If only that skepticism was used to denounce fibbers rather than prop them on a platform. Remember the footage? Go ahead and watch that first flight again. There are 70 seconds of supposed flight captured on camera, and Francis isn't creeping. Many websites use words like zoom to describe his motion. Uh oh Francis! You done goofed.
   Let's be ridiculously conservative and say he was zipping at a crisp 10 mph  brisk jogging speed. How long can he fly without breaking that record? Because hes gotta stay under the 905 feet record or he'll get the attention that he DOESN'T want that of record keepers who actually bother to look for shenanigans  (don't pistol whip me!). 10 mph is 14  feet per second. That means to stay under the 902 feet (he said his farthest was this), he can only fly for just over 61 seconds. But he is on camera whizzing around for 70. And he CLAIMS to have flown for 235 seconds! Dang Francis. No wonder Deadpool is looking for you (holy moly did I really call him Francis for this ENTIRE debunk JUST for that joke?). Not only this, but he claims a max speed of 34 mph for that (nearly) four minute flight. I'm not saying he went 34 the whole time, just more than 2.6 for at least part of the time.
   Aha I hear it already: Maybe he wasn't recording the distance  Really? That's what you come up with? How many cameras did he have on him again? Also he was obviously tracking his speed I mean, you don't fly the maiden voyage of your 20,000 dollar hover board using multiple cameras and a professional film crew and not track your speed with a cheap radar or GPS system. He proudly displayed his top speed at the end of the video I'm sure it wasn't a rough guesstimate. Psst I remember from junior high that distance=rate multiplied by time. You know the rate and the time. Guinness accepts records based on sound mathematics. 
   So the flight time, if (IF) a flight occurred, could not be 3 minutes 55 seconds at the speed shown on the video. Otherwise he would have gone more than 902 feet his self-proclaimed limit. 
   But hark, I hear another protest of maybe the 4 minutes wasn't in a row. OK pal there's a reason we laugh at that joke about the store open 24 hours  but not in a row Because an honest person wouldn't try to bamboozle people that way.  Therefore at the very least Francis is lying about the time. And therefore this video and it's false claims is a steaming pile of inept fakeries, mendacities, and attempts to fool the good people of Metropolis.

Addendum: in the interview, he says he crashed that puppy on the 11th or 12th, 3 days before the interview, which was published on the 15th. Hmm. He claimed he was going to break a record on the weekend of the 16th but broke his bird on the 12th. Fishy. 
   And let's take a quick look at that scenario. Francis claims he was training to do a 2 mile flight at 37 to 50 mph but the wind conditions used up his stabilization battery faster than he anticipated. Since we know he was not flying for more than 902 feet, we can do some calculations. I'll be super conservative here and say he accelerated smoothly up to his minimum intended flight speed of 37 mph. This is extremely conservative considering how quickly this hover board accelerates in the videos. So let's assume a consistent acceleration.
   This would give an average speed of one half the max speed, so let's work with 18.5 mph average. This seems fair since he said he was only five seconds away from his platform when his board gave out. To cover 902 feet (cant go farther must avoid scrutiny after all) at 18.5 mph would take 33 seconds. FRANCIS! The battery only lasts 33 SECONDS? Whew. That wind cuts it to 14% of the first videos battery life? Youch it's almost like he didn't do the math and was hoping no one else would either you know, had Francis tried to say that the hover board worked for less than 35 seconds in the first place, maybe the lie wouldn't have been as obvious. 35 second hoverboard I HAVE SEEN THE GLORIOUS FUTURE AND IT IS HERE TODAY!

Last thing Francis claims there will be a 2 mile flight 16 days after the interview that should be on or around May first. If I'm right, I predict one of the following scenarios
1. The flight gets cancelled due to whatever sorry excuse Francis thinks the world will swallow.
2. Francis does not allow outside press to record the flight maybe for something like  patent reasons? And then releases his own video of the monumental achievement in stunning 240 quality.

If I'm wrong, I'll be eating crow until I burst. But you know what? I'd rather be wrong because I was too vigilant than right because I just didn't care if I was being fed garbage. 

I invite any and all responses and will enjoy ones that address my points.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

1782,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016-4-19,2016,4,19,22,4fhjt0,self.Futurology,A few questions I'm pondering on civilization. Might be one way to predict how we adapt socially as technology advances. A bit hopeful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4fhjt0/a_few_questions_im_pondering_on_civilization/,NicholasFrost,1461072360,"It occurs to me that as our lifespans get longer, it is in our own self-interest to adopt a longer view of things. When a human lifespan was typically less than half of what it is today, we cooperated in simple activities- hunting/gathering, building simple structures, digging wells, etc. As this cooperation yielded benefits, people lived easier and longer, and our worldview adapted. The rules governing behavior got more complex due to our desire to preserve the system and increasing value upon human life. Maaaybe not every vengeance killing was okay anymore, or some such rule was put forth. This of course led to there being more of us, requiring a greater need for- cooperation. And so the cycle begins again, each time setting the bar for our respect for human life, our expectations for ourselves and our children, and our ability to fulfill these goals, ever higher.

So. What are the consequences for our future?

Will we have more respect for human life?

* Lower capital crime rate?
* Total abolition of death penalty?
* Future wars fought only by drone proxies?
* No wars at all one day?

Will we have greater expectations?

* Will life be easier?
* Will we be happier?
* How many generation of progeny will we expect to see?
* Will we even see things in these terms?

It seems to me that at present, we don't think about the world our grandchildren will inherit. We might live to see it, but dealing with it is our children's problem. As we live even longer lives and defy ageing, will we adopt a longer view?

* Will our personal plans look to preserving our own self interest for a longer period of time?
* Will we seek to conserve our non-renewable resources for longer period of time?
* Will we become better stewards of the planet?



I think of religion as once having been a civilizing force partly because our lifespans were so ""ugly, brutish, and short"" that we needed reassurance that what we did in the short time we lived had consequences, reward or punishment. We have adapted to a point where we don't seem to need that as much, or at least often. Are all forms of religion and spiritual belief on their way out, or will our beliefs adapt as the questions we know to ask become greater?

So those are some base questions. From straightforward extrapolations based on my perception of history, some answers seem obvious, while others have quite a bit of uncertainty. Here's where I'm at, so far.

I think that for most of these the answer is yes. I'm skeptical about of the total end of war, but the forms may become more humane. I don't think conflict is going away. I think that while life will be easier, it doesn't follow that we will be happier as a consequence of these forces. Civilization has not followed that pattern, it's more of a psychological issue. If we are happier, it will be because we have addressed that issue separately. Otherwise, we'll just find new things to complain about. 

I think we will adopt a longer view of the world and more carefully consider the consequences of our actions. While I do think we will preserve our resources longer, I'm not really sure what being a better steward of the planet will mean in the future.

I think as we learn to ask bigger questions, science will answer most of them, but some may be beyond even post singularity AI. These might be philosophical or religious questions,  but we won't stop asking them.

Last question- I know I'm not the first to ponder such things, are there some definitive writings on these topics?",1,0,False,self,,,,,

However when the economic singularity hits, there is no more need for the companies to invent or innovate, since they already control everything and have no incentive to advance any more.

Throughout history, landowners tended to be very conservative, and extremely hostile for landless people whom they did not consider as their equals.


The winners of the battle for Economic Singularity would rather rule and enjoy their power than burst their asses to advance further, since everyone is so below them that there is no chance for a revolt so there is no need to keep one step ahead of potential rebels. It is like a 6' man does not have anything to fear from , say, the pygmys.

So, if the economic singularity hits before the tech singularity, it is likely that the world will be 'frozen' as that state for a long time, like the chinese civilization which literally froze at the time of the First Emperor (around 220 BCE) and stayed that way till 1911 CE.

I love Futurology. I love contemplating contemporary leading edge technologies, solutions and proposals. I love taking those ideas and speculating. I am no futurist, I make no predictions, I like to think of Options. If we had the collective will, we could achieve pretty much anything. 

Lately, the number of entries into serious projects (like the hyperloop) by crowd sourced solutions and teams has really caught my attention. With the current distribution of data and the growing private access to the tools and prescribed knowledges of innovation, things which used to cost so much only huge corporations, academic institutions and national operated interests could hope to afford. With this new access we, the citizens of the web, can realistically form up around pretty much any topic and have some chance to compete.

Well, what better place for those ideas to come from than r/Futurology ? We have dedicated legions of redditors here who love a broad spectrum of futurist science subjects, have undoubtedly a wide range of real world experiences. Could we start putting together thought pieces, papers or entries into big projects as a collaborative force? 

Just putting this down as opening, but what do you other subscribers think? Could we do more than share our interests and articles, could we cooperate in the creation of the future?

This seems to be a more viable option since humans and technology are becoming more and more interconnecting.

That information is now a commodity owned by corporations.
In today's world you have value beyond your labor. Your habits and opinions have value. If we the people create a system that retains ownership of our opinions. It would help to justify some of a""Basic income plan"". I am supplying a link to a video that lays out the system that would make this possible.
To add to this , we have a deadline.
When Facebook add's a dislike button ,or Twitter creates a ""petitioning tweet category"",or some other company swoops in to take advantage of the growing political movements of the world, brought on by our growing computer literacy and maturity. It will become impossible to pry that commodity away from them. And any message we were trying to convey will be lost or diluted.
This may be the dividing point of two different futures.

This has greatly increased the likelihood that a real effect is being observed, and added a lot of fuel to internet enthusiasm for the concept.  But one of the key lessons of technology is this: There are always limits.  

Most of those limits cannot be foreseen at this point, but there is one fundamental limitation we can already discuss in theory: **Power**. The EmDrive concept is not a *source* of energy - you must feed energy into it to create the effect.  This means it would be a power-limited propulsion technology rather than a fuel-limited propulsion technology like chemical rocketry.

There are already power-limited propulsion technologies in operation: Known technically as electric propulsion, but can also be stated in the cooler way as ""ion drives.""  An ion drive is not totally reactionless, since it does require fuel (a noble gas like xenon is typical) - but it uses the fuel so efficiently that fuel supply is only trivially limiting and power becomes far more significant to performance.

Ion drives are in operation *right now*.  They propel the Dawn probe that has explored Main Belt asteroids like Vesta and currently the dwarf planet Ceres, have been used in past exploratory missions such as the Deep Space One probe that flew by an asteroid and a comet, and are increasingly incorporated into commercial satellites as thrusters.  But here's the rub: They do it **slowly**.  Very, very slowly.

Every ion drive to date has only had the option of being powered with solar panels, so they could only accelerate at a painfully slow pace.  The advantages over chemical rockets are still huge, especially for a robotic probe: Don't have to carry so much heavy or volatile fuel, and over extended periods of time can build up tremendous velocities, allowing for long-term ""wandering"" from place to place.  But the process of realizing those advantages is *damn* slow - too slow to be useful for human spaceflight at those power levels.

However, if NASA or some other government were willing to invest the money to develop and launch megawatt-class, space-rated nuclear reactors, that would be a different story.  With that much power, some types of ion drive (for instance, VASIMR) could deliver human spacecraft from Earth to Mars in just a matter of a few *weeks*.  And none of this is scientifically controversial.

And yet...we're not building these types of power systems, even though no part of them is technologically radical.  None of the space agencies of the world are.  The potential for delivering arbitrarily large masses from Earth to Mars in a matter of weeks is, apparently, not a compelling enough reason to invest the needed capital.  Perhaps this is because of the politics surrounding nuclear power, but whatever the cause, it's just not happening.

So now let's get back to EmDrive: Let's say the testing continues to pan out, they figure out some ""good enough"" theoretical framework that allows them to build practical engines, and small-scale prototypes put into satellites work great.  Then what?

It's still a power-limited technology, so if they put one into an interplanetary probe, its level of thrust is still going to depend on the energy output of solar panels.  In other words, what you've just created is a better version of the same capability we already have with ion drives.  An ion drive doesn't need much fuel to zoom around the solar system for years, so EmDrive not needing any fuel at all doesn't add *that* much advantage to the kinds of activities we would be doing in the foreseeable future.

As to human spaceflight with EmDrive, exactly like with ion drives, those applications could only really happen if you attached it to a strong enough power source - in other words, nuclear reactors.  Which, as noted before, are not being developed despite propulsion technologies already existing that could use them to open up much of the solar system to practical human visitation.  So why do we think EmDrive would change that?

Would a cool-sounding new technology that's somewhat more efficient than ion drives radically change the politics holding back space-rated nuclear reactors?  Would the promise of slightly better travel times to near-future destinations than a VASIMR could deliver lead to huge new investments in these controversial power systems?  There's no reason that would happen.

What you would get, then, is what pretty much always happens with real-world technology: Most of its potential goes unrealized for decades while industry and policy catch up to it, being used only in limited ways for extended periods of time, and then slowly its utilization grows.  Eventually the move toward advanced power systems occurs, but only when the people who started their careers testing the original technology are old and grey.

The real advantage of a hypothetical EmDrive over ion propulsion only kicks in when you start radically scaling up the masses and distances involved - when you intend to send something the mass of an aircraft carrier to Pluto rather than a fishing trawler to Mars.  

At that point even the relatively small amounts of fuel an electric propulsion system needs begin to become unwieldy; the differences in complexity between the two systems become a factor in their ongoing practicality; and the (likely) greater efficiency of an EmDrive would translate into increasingly impressive advantages.

But there is no industrial or political basis to leap to such a massive scale of operations right off the bat, and just having the raw technology to do it wouldn't cause it to magically happen.  EmDrive would just sit there, biding its time in limited applications - as thrusters on solar-powered satellites and inner-solar-system space probes - while spaceflight organically ramps up, just as it would anyway, and the true benefits would only be realized decades later.

The first ion drive thruster was demonstrated in the lab in 1959, but it would be another four *decades* before it was deployed as an operational propulsion system for a deep space probe, and still has not been put into use for human spaceflight - nor are there any firm plans to do so.  So temper your expectations for how quickly the future of EmDrive would unfold if it continues to produce positive lab results.

More broadly, don't go expecting a propulsion technology to liberate humankind from limitations imposed by politics or economics, because *technologically* speaking we are already capable of far more than what we're doing.  ",16,12,False,self,,,,,

With Self Driving cars, do you have to program the GPS to take you to ever location you want to go? GPS are still so crappy now days that I still get lost pretty often when the GPS takes me to an empty parking lot that it claims is my location. 

And I wonder if in my example if the car would have to go and try to turn out onto the main high way then drive a block in traffic just to get to the place I got to by crossing a parking lot.

AltSciFi **prototypes** have existed in various forms for a couple of years. Our primary purpose is to inspire people to care about technology, science and society -- which are core values in science fiction.

Futurism that looks farther ahead than a few years is essentially fiction as well, considering the accelerating pace of technological/social change.

The new zine will focus on:

- future-focused science and technology as inspiration for creating your own plausible future worlds;
- independent artists and writers creating science fiction now;
- an opportunity to escape from mega-corporations like Google, Amazon and Apple;
- an approach that works more like a community resource than a profit-driven commodity;
- a choice to fight for your privacy by paying artists directly for their work
instead of giving away personal data in exchange for ""free"".
  
.  

Our secondary purpose is to create a cool zine that people will enjoy enough to gladly pay for, so that indie artists can create new works without being slaves to the corporate world.

---

Privacy is only dead if we decide to give it away. **AltSciFi is an alternative** that sees people as humans -- creators whose work is valuable, and readers/viewers whose privacy matters.

We plan to donate 10% of profits to the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://eff.org) as well.

Each issue will be a separate Kickstarter project. Once it's funded, the zine will be sent to our paying members.

---

More details will arrive soon. For now, you can [take a look at concept images posted yesterday](http://imgur.com/a/4uRVX).

As an illustration, it is not hard for us to imagine a situation which would require the entire world to organize to tackle saving earth from an asteroid.  Yet, imagining the world organizing for more efficient resource allocation elicits in us an immediate rejection of the measures required as utopian.

Will we overcome this?  That is, are we ultimately conscious* as a group?  Are we even conscious* as individuals?

I was wondering if someone had come across this or if you have any ideas/opinions about this technology? At first I didn't think that this could be some good stuff in the future but after more reading and thinking I was quite impressed... Since LED's are installed basically everywhere today (I even have them in my car for example) it could be very useful. Just imagine the whole house powered by light fidelity like flushing the toilet with an app, starting up the heater or A/C, closing powered windows etc. Since I mentioned cars, it could be also used in them to make cars able to communicate with other cars for safety reasons for example or some other features we do not have yet atm. It would be nice getting home at night flashing headlamps at the gate/garage door and it would automatically open using some sort of signal/code. Let me know if you have any thoughts please, I would like if some people can join here and share some info or thoughts about this :)

So let me know, do you think its usefu? Would you change something about light fidelity or improve something? Would you use it at home or somewhere else for example? I would appreciate some thoughts, really.. Thanks.",4,6,False,self,,,,,

A future where computing power and virtual reality have progressed so incredibly far, that simulations like what we see in the matrix movies becomes possible. 

As we know, time in the ""real"" universe keeps on ticking away. At some point, the universe will come to an end, or all the stars will burn out, or it will go into a deep freeze, etc. Moral of the story is, our time as a species in the universe is most likely limited. Unless we find a way out of the universe I guess... or what if we could escape our fate by diving deeper into the universe?

What if we were able to augment the way in which our brain processes time and then throw ourselves deep into a virtual world?

Imagine a cross between the matrix and the inception movies.  

What if we could tap ourselves into a virtual world and then augment time to where 10 minutes in the ""real"" universe is a trillion years in the virtual universe (an extreme version of time manipulation like seen in inception). 

And then within that first level of virtual reality, let's suppose we have the same technology as the real universe, so we create virtual reality within the virtual reality. Then we put ourselves within that VR.

In this second level of VR, we do the same thing as before. We augment time, so that 10 minutes in the first level becomes a trillion years in the second.

Now let's say we continue down this path over and over again, forever. Creating VR within VR within VR... As you can imagine, within a few levels of doing this, time would become meaningless.

Could we effectively become immortal through such a process? What's stopping us from always adding one more level of VR and adding more time to our clock?

Have been a fan ever since. 
 
  Im hoping yall might be interested in an idea Ive spent 5 years working on. In a nutshell, its a global plan to reach A type 1 civilization on the Kardashev scale. Its hinges on the idea that in 4 yrs time, we could have a global basic income. 

   Im a 35 yr old army veteran that suffers from ptsd and brain injuries. My apologies for any grammar or structural issues contained within this post. I struggle getting my thoughts into words. I hope you can read this with a little charity, look past unintended errors, and understand the spirit of what im trying to articulate. 

Im not a highly educated man, but I hope you find there that Im not stupid either. These arent just wild arguments I thought of last night.  Ive worked hard on this, writing and rewriting. Im going to try and keep it simple, and go in more depth once you have an idea of what Im going for. Also important to know, is that I understand my limitations. Im not asking to be a politician. Im excited about this, Im proud of what I have been able to piece together.  At the same time I know that it will eventually need someone better equipped than I am. My hope with this post, is that you come away excited enough about this to get it to the attention of the right people.


     Maybe not by the end of this post, thats my wishful thinking. What I really want is some well thought out arguments that you see me facing. And I hope for the chance to answer them, to argue my case for a global basic income. Because this is a promise that im going to be making to the people In my city I think are needing hope the most.  If you think I could be about to start misleading a bunch of vulnerable people, please point it out for me. 

Im going to be visiting the areas hardest hit by poverty in my area, and start to build a grassroots campaign around this message. A message I hope we can convince the world of.

   Also I wish to make clear that my plan works great not just for those in poorer circumstances, but also for the middle class and indeed for the upper class. Because we will do away with corporate and income taxes. It may be the circumstances I was raised in, or the situation I felt helpless about in Iraq that I aim my initial message to the underrepresented. But it really is a great system for ALL classes. If you find this not the case, please point it out so I can argue my case clearly.

So please read on, and challenge me if you get the notion to on how this would affect you. Im really believing there is no loser.

Heres the tldr:  The astroid belt has resources worth 700 quintillion dollars. We create a organization(not the UN, but like the UN) that has control of this wealth.(For the sake of this post, lets call it the BANK**) We give this organization the goal of reaching a type 1 planetary system as a whole,  without infringing on each countries sovereignty.
In this system,  Every human life has a base worth of 100k to the overall system. Its up to each individual country as to the particulars, but these things must hold true: 1. Each country must respect human rights
                                                                                         2. Each country must respect the others
                                                                                         3. No country shall use the BANK** to subject their population.
                                                                                         4. BY the 20th yr of adulthood, the citizen must have a majority of their pay.


 Allowing every country the resources to help reach the overall type one system. The only conditions that are required for a country to enter is what we'll tentatively call the human rights cause.

 The human rights cause will simply say that the country has a right to sovereignty, without outside interferance on how they decide to run themselves, but they do not have a right to keep a human in a system they can not agree with. Anyone may be free and take their worth with them. And the human life may only be taxed 40%, they must be left with a positive worth. No further shall any one country have any control over the other. In the spirit of this. 

The yrly amount paid to each country is now owed to the planetary bank. These debts may only be used to fund projects in space. (Moon base, mars, and of course reaching the resources and setting a permanent station at the asteroid belt.)
 Every countries colleges and scientist will have a seat on this banks** agenda, more so than each countries politicians. Checks and balances. 
 Thats the TLDR. A fair system for every country to flourish, and with a good overall goal for the future of the planet in general. Sound crazy yet? Please stick with me as I explain how we do it, and what it means for America. A country I love and fought for.

      First a couple promises. 
      1. I promise this is just me wanting to get my idea out there. Its not a gimmick where next week im going to come out asking you to support a political party. I want to start a grassroots movement to implement this plan, and to only do that.

      2. Im not going to be asking for your money. My wish is to start a grassroots out of Atlanta. Only after my message has went national, and there is volunteers enough in each state will we start raising money. And that money will only be used for local needs(demonstrating/elections) getting our system implemented. 

          3. The movement we start isnt going to be turned into  political party that does back room deals. We only advocate for the system outline agreed upon. And that we do this out here in the open. There will be NO change to the spirit of the outline. Once we start nailing down the particulars, it must be in line with our promises. Thats my promise to those willing to help. Its for one thing, and one thing only. Setting the base.

          4. That its through the human that things are given their worth. Inflation will be froze to the standard of living that people making 100,000 a yr have now. A humans worth will always be this valuable.
We have to make a stand somewhere. We are innovators and risk takers. Its time we let each other know that if we fail from time to time, your worth is never less than what our society has built. What our societies will continue to build. When we say that a human is worth 100k, thats in todays dollars. And will be tied in spirit to this value.


  And now I'll try and go into depth and tell how I plan to start my grassroots. If I had one wish of what I'd get out of this post, It is your thoughts on the grassroots angle I will be going for. I'll post exactly what I'll be hoping to get across the people I run into on the streets of Atlanta. I plan on visiting churches, food banks, unemployment lines, hospitals. Its important to me that they know whats out there, and understand that with us united and DEMANDING, we can change things. My end goal is to hook up with organizations such as occupy wallstreet, black lives matter, all the labor unions, and media outlets. I truelly believe if we get this idea out there, we WILL start this.

 I will be making them these big promises, promises that we will not compromise on. All I am going to ask from them is to pass the word. Ill get as many as possible to join my primary facebook group, to were we are semi organised. Im having troubled getting this all down in an organized manner, I want it to fit on a pamplet that i can hand out while Im canvasing atlanta. If you get the idea Im am going for, and feel you can help here. PLEASE reach out to me. Im not rich by any means, but I can swing a few hundred dollars for a good flyer layout. Better if done out of the goodness of the message. Wink wink. 

How Im going to convince them.
 
 1. Convince them there is an asteroid belt, and that scientist do have a good estimation as to its value. 


 2. The value is 700 Quintilian dollars. This is not a fantasy number. It is worth that much. And I have to convince them that it IS up to us how those resources are used.

 3.  With todays technology we could have a plan for gathering and using these resources within 50 yrs. I feel yall in this subreddit I dont need to convince to hard about this. The point is, we are going to finally PLAN for these things.

 4. Divided evenly among those living on earth now, man woman and child, would give each person 100 million dollars. Granted, dividing it evenly among those alive is short sighted, and would never work. This is just to put into perspective

If I can convince you of the above facts, then I will next convince you that

 5. Dividing it up evenly will never work. But setting a new base for humanity is within reach. I want to convince you that just waiting for the first private company to reach it so we can tax it isnt the only option available to us.
We dont HAVE to say its first come first serve. We've advanced enough to where we can actually plan accordingly. Its important that we all realize that it IS as simple as 'its up to us as humanity how we want to proceed.'

 6. Every human has a worth. I feel like I shouldnt have to hard a time convincing people of this. But just because some families and people have ended up in poor circumstances, not even a majority of them are bad people. They deserve a fair life, and fair shot. (I say this only because of the two people Ive told of my plans, one was all for it. The other said ""so that the lazy can live off me? No thanks) Thats Not what this is about. This is about giving those who want to participate, and who couldnt through no fault of their own, a fair way to build a life.

 7. I want to convince them that capitalism has worked the best, and that we dont need to change anything about the system to make this work. The only thing that will change as far as business goes, is that they are not encumbered by taxes any more. Indeed, we WANT them to grow and get ready for the expansion through the solar system that is about to take place. For everyone, there is about to be an abundance of wealth flowing through each and every country. Countries will need to be brought up to 1st world standards. If you want to work, theres going to be a fortune waiting for every job title. 

 8. I want to convince them that we can create this bank to hold the wealth of everything outside the earth. And that it isnt just the transfer of the wealth from there to here, but also building up the solar system. Everything paid to the countries will be a debt that the bank holds. The bank uses this debt to build up the settlements outside the earth.

 9. I want to convince them that the bank will pay each country 100,000 annually per year. 

 10. I want to convince them that the country will use the money to let their peoples build the society here on earth that that country wants.(to the extent they dont violate human rights). SO each country has a sovereign right to progress as wanted. But outside the earth, each country work toward the good of the solar system. 

 11. The country may only tax their citizens 30% which is about 30,000 per person.  

 12. I want to convince them that The bank we create will take the debt from each country to pay for the new space stations that we'll be needing to progress towards a type 1

 13. If I have convinced them of this so far, I want to convince them(my craziest argument yet) that this can be accomplished on a 4 year plan.

Once we get the politicians to agree to implement our plan, we can start the 4 year plan.

   My 4 yr plan.

 Year one: Create and start putting in place a framework to create this bank. We can use NASA and our colleges to do this. With equal input from whichever country is willing to start this with us. This must be an open and fair process.  Have our congress and politicians create the systems for our government to work with this organization on behalf of America. Because we are going to create this to be separate from us, from any country. Also In year one, we need our colleges and local communities to start working together to see what each local community needs.

  Year two: By now, if we have the right people focused on it, we should be ready to start talking about getting the census numbers to the bank. Not ready yet for the payments, but each country should be providing the BANK with population numbers. By the end of year 2, each country should be prepared to recieve first payments for their citizens.

 Year 3: Because local governments and businesses will need time and incentive to make the required changes, on year three corporate and payroll taxes will be abolished and each participating government will recieve the taxes per citizen to complete the process. Every local government may start the process of Okaying future projects with developing firms. Start trying to get people to sign up to their communities and ideas.

Year 4: Every citizen will be asked to choose a bank of their own choice, in which to receive their payments.


Full system online by year five.


What does and doesnt this mean?

This doesnt mean you get 100k out the gate. 

1. From birth, the government gets 40k per citizen tax. Once the child reaches 18, the governement receives 100k per citizen. Its the investment from the BANK into humanity. To be paid back as the BANK develops outer space. So, the BANK calculates how much it has invested in the citizens throughout the world. The money it invested on earth, will be given a value equal that it can use to develop space. So it will have these yearly monies to contract out fairly that which needs done. 

2. No person shall get their benefits until they have completed education. They MAY start receiving 20k of their entitlement while going through college or trade school. After completion of college or trade school, you will be given your 30000 starting base. 

3. If you forgo further education after highschool, you may start drawing a base salary of 30,000. Instead of social security though, once you have 15 yrs of work history, you may receive your full 100,000 entitlement. 

4. You may not get loans on your basic income. Banks may not use this to calculate and hold against you for repayment. There will be a getting used to period. Not predatory lending. This gets rid of all social welfare programs. The only programs needed from here out will be how to live with these means. 

5. Taxes and medical insurance will be automatically deducted. 

6.  Companies will not pay any taxes whatsoever, so lets have a talk about what that means for them and ultimately for those they employee. I am a firm believer that these companies are doing great things for us, this can be a win win situation. 

7. As the architect of this system, America will be the first Capitol of the BANK*. We will do this fairly, and openly. Being the Capitol does not mean its only us, every country has an equal say. But there must be on that would be the tie breaker. We are in the best position to do this open and fairly.

8. What this means for the military. As the capitol, our military spending will set the limit. No country may use this new wealth to conquer or suppress.  As the leading military, America will start helping where requested to help other countries build their military to our might. The end game is to have a global military organization to respond to exterior threats. This will prove a boon for our military industry complex, and will go a long way of building trust as we start integrating former enemies into valuable partners.

9. America will assume the role of capitol(for want of a better term, im hoping we dont yet get bogged down on these terms, more placeholders at the moment) until the globe reaches a type one civilization. By then we will have in place a system to fairly elect the next country to host the capitol. 



I want to go on, but I fear the more I try and get every thought down on this first pass, I might be confusing things instead of getting the overall feel of what Im trying to do. 

 So with what Ive put forth, can I have your thoughts? I respect if you want to just call me crazy and move on, but I would actually love for a well thought out argument that i can try and defend against. 

 Thank you in advance for the time you may have took reading this, and look for to any imput and to clarify and expand on any points.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem

There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: 

 1. Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track. 
 2. Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person. 

?

And let's include the main variant ""the fat man"": 

Your only way to stop the trolley is to push a fat man over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. 

So what would you do in each case? For this thought experiment let's consider that you have as much time as you want to take your decision. ",16,0,False,self,,,,,

I apologize in advance if I offend anyone, but if I do, hopefully they will still be open to discussing what I think is a very complex issue.  It goes something like this:


Technological progress is exponential, and will (on most timescales) likely continue to be so until some real physical limit is reached, or we experience some cataclysmic event of some kind.


With each new generation, the rate of technological progress is *significantly* higher than the generation before it.  To that point, even 12 year olds today will comment on how much has changed in technology since they were younger.  That was not something that typically was noticed by children born in 1970.  Also, new generations are born into our accelerating technological society and accept that rate of progress as their ""baseline"" rate of progress.


With all these advances in technological society, we are changing how we think, how we perform tasks, how we interact with technology.  Due to the practically infinite amount of information available at our fingertips, and the practically infinite number of places we can find that information, we are slowly, but surely, adopting a new task paradigm that involves more multi-tasking, less dwell time per task/topic, and more disparate tasks/topics in a given period of time (we aren't inherently good at this, by the way, and that's another topic - but we are and will continue to improve at it, because that's the future we find ourselves in, and we will adapt).


So you've got children, technology-native, internet-native children, who are born into a society where the rate of technological progress, multitasking and task-switching is significantly higher than their parents' generation. 


Is it really surprising, then, that their parents' generation diagnoses them with ADD or ADHD and medicates them^*, effectively punishing them for being a byproduct of the society that they themselves helped create and perpetuate?   Is it really that surprising to anyone that, given these circumstances, older generations would think newer generations have problems with attention or technological addiction?  It's almost predictable.  And that's fine - older generations have, at least for awhile now, lamented about the perceived shortcomings of the new generation. Of course, it's no different - the new generation is always a byproduct of the society that the older generation provided for them.  But what is different now is that we are suddenly turning to pharmaceuticals that we honestly don't completely understand, to stem these problems as we see them.  


We should not be punishing our new generations for being a product of their environment. Honestly, the more I think about this the more upset it makes me.  I don't doubt that there are legitimate cases out there where children do need drugs to help them with a chemical imbalance, etc.  But when you've got 15% of children being diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, and that number is increasing by a few percentage points every few years - we've got to start considering what we're doing.^**


I am a generational in-betweener - both a Generation X and a Millennial by many metrics. Not that it really matters, but I will say that not completely relating to either generational classification, the way that Generation X has parented the next generation as it relates to this particular topic, is not only unenlightened, it's downright saddening.  Luckily, it's not quite a systemic problem yet. As a parent of a young child myself, I often consider how technology and the fast progression of it, and the way that I use and weave it into my life, is influencing my child.  Not only do I try to model responsible use of technology (easier said than done, and it's a constant battle), but also, going forward, I'm going to consider the technological context in which behavior and personality manifest themselves, and understand that this upcoming generation will be significantly more technology-native than mine.


In closing, let's not continue to perpetuate the same mistakes made by previous generations, because if we do, it will only get worse.  That's why I'm putting this post in /r/futurology - it's a problem affecting the current generation, but more importantly, if we don't recognize what we're doing, future generations that exhibit ever-increasing effects due to technological nativism will be proportionately at risk of similar mistakes by the previous generation. 

*To be fair, ADD it not entirely a new phenomenon.  But it did experience a surge of diagnoses starting in the 1990s, and continues to climb today.

**As a side note, the diagnosis of ADD/ADHD often results due to perceived learning difficulties or disabilities. To this point, I would suggest that it is not the child that is at fault (who, as I stated, is a product of their environment).  It is the fact that education and educational philosophy lag behind technological innovation.  We are often teaching children from the 21st century using 20th century educational philosophies, and that is why we perceive so many children to have difficulties with learning.",2,4,False,self,,,,,

Call it the Biological IT department.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4gzfvf/the_future_of_the_legal_system_a_combination_that/,Turil,1461937569,"Give the ""Biological Information Technology"" department a call when someone ""isn't functioning well"" (they don't seem to be mentally/physically healthy or are otherwise ""causing problems"") and someone (human, AI, or whatever) does an overview of the situation to see whether the problem is in the user or the, um, usee.  The IT service goes deep into the programming of the malfunctioning individual (user or usee) to see if the problem is a toxicity (a harmful thing in the system, such as misinformation or a virus) and/or a deficiency (a lack of something needed for functionality, such as high quality nutrients or a sense of belonging) and works to alleviate the problem.

For example, one of the librarians at the local library decides that the library shouldn't be open during the times when multiple patrons want to use the library, despite the fact that there are other librarians very much willing to staff the library at those times.  I could call up the B IT department in my area, which is likely an independent non-profit (rather than part of the government, or a profiteering corporation), and ask them to figure out how to get the librarian who is malfunctioning in her role as a public servant in charge of helping people share useful and meaningful information with one another, through various media.  The B IT department would investigate the situation and come up with solutions, and either fix the problem themselves or get help to fix it.  In this case, they might start by getting in touch with the particular librarian and ask her why she was getting in the way of the library being open when the patrons wanted/needed it to be.  Then, if they didn't seem to be making any progress with encouraging her to make the more prosocial decision to allow the library to be open when patrons and other librarians wanted it to open though discussion alone, the B IT department might offer the librarian in question another role that she might be better suited for and that she might enjoy filling, so that she was still able to get the benefits of doing valuable volunteer work, and the community was finally able to get access to a valuable educational and inspirational communication hub.  And if that offer was refused, the B IT department might look into more serious medical treatment (mental health care or maybe nutritional counseling) for the librarian, so that she could make more healthy, pro-social decisions/actions, while asking for the larger community running and supporting the library to choose someone else to take her place at the library.

Or, if you are hungry, and don't have easy access to the healthy food you need for your body to function well enough for you to do the awesome things you believe you should do (Make art! Teach the neighborhood kids how to build a tree fort! Care for a sick relative. Study Chinese.  Etc.), you could call up the B IT department and they'd find out what the closest heathy food that suits your taste is and find a way to get it to you as soon as possible.  Maybe there's a mail delivery going from the storage space to your home or workspace within the next few hours, or maybe a school bus makes that route, or maybe they have their own delivery drones!

Wouldn't this seem like a far more logical, effective, and practical way to deal with conflict and other problematic situations in the human (and other biological organism) world than the mishmash of arbitrary and often seriously overkill (sometimes literally) options that we've been stuck with for so long (police, emergency rooms, judges and juries, bosses, Dear Abby's, 4 Chans, Amazons, and so on)?

You might be asking: ""How would we fund this?""  Well, pretty much the same way we ""fund"" everything else that we already use for dealing with conflict and illness, however we choose.  I recommend actually getting the folks who'd be doing the problem solving to solve the problem of getting the problem solving organization up and running (so that they could solve more problems!).

(Personally, I imagine it being all volunteer with humans, other animals, AI, and non-intelligent robots or whatever offering their services, and it would be run entirely on donations, so that we eliminate any profit motive and only get the individuals who are naturally excited about problem solving (or otherwise don't have an opinion on the matter and would be useful).  And the collected wisdom of all the volunteers would have a priority to get the needs of the volunteers met, unconditionally, so that they function as well as possible while doing their work.  But each locality might end up making different choices for how this organization would work given their unique location and resources.)",0,5,False,self,,,,,

If raising the minimum wage motivates companies to replace people with more efficient and productive technology, then there is absolutely no reason to slow this process down.  As a matter of fact, if raising the minimum wage to $30 per hour accelerates this process, then politicians should embrace this trend.  This is especially true when politicians today can make in excess of hundreds of thousands of dollars per hour just by giving a speech.

Society shouldn't be concerned about replacing people with better technology in jobs, the issue should be how does civilization design a productive economy with open opportunities for a planet with billions of people who no longer need to labor.",13,7,False,self,,,,,
