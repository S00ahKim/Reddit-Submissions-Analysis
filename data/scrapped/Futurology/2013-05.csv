Measures of connectivity

	anatomical - physical connections
		connections are possible but not always there
	functional - correlated activity
		activity in one area relates to activity in another 
		(correlations can be positive or negative)
		correlation does not mean causality (we all know that fomr the internets :) )
	effective - cause and effect
		a graph that shows directed arrows, very difficult to show
		use temporal precedence to show cause and effect
		
The problem is - 
	(analogy) to figure how chess works you can only watch chess being played
		where is it possible for pieces to move (anatomical)
		what is effective (effective connectivity)
		
	figuring out the brain is worse than that
		can't really watch the whole brain, only see indirect measurements using electric imaging or blood flow
			electric imaging is faster
			
	figuring out the brain is like watching chess, but you can't really see the board very well
	
	origin of signals that are measured
		trans-membrane ionic currents of neurons generate electric and magnetic fields that are measured
		
MVAR network model
	linear model (time index -n)
		missed the math here (argh)
	
	What is measured at the scalp is measured into an array (massive amount of data)
	100s of millions cpu hours to crunch the data

	that array used to build network models
	
	Look at specific cases (spina bifida) to help verify that created network models are correct
	imagination vs perception
		watch movie
		recall movie
		
		form mental pictures in both cases
		but information flow is reversed
		also used to verify network model

I keep thinking of awesome applications for them and was just thinking about how they could benefit the trucking industry.

It seems likely that trucking will be one of the first sectors that will start using driverless vehicles on a large scale. The main reason being driverless trucks can save the companies a ton of money as they can drive nearly 24/7 and don't demand wages.

Ideally electric trucks would be used as these would use much less fuel and cause nearly no (direct) pollution. The problem of course are the charging times as you want to the least amount of down time and quickest deliveries. I don't see battery tech improving quick enough to be feasible for long-haul trucking once driverless trucks become an option. However it occurred to me that with a driverless truck fleet it would be possible to have the best of both worlds. First you don't need a cab to support the driver, so you only need the powertrain, saving space and weight. You could have the trucks drive themselves to charging stations along major roads and switch with a fully charged tractor which is waiting at a charge point.

In this scenario you do have the drawbacks that the trucks need to stop and that the engines are idle when charging. You could solve this by keeping the engine in the truck (or [wheel hubs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_hub_motor)) and design self driving batteries which go to the truck instead of the other way around. The batteries would only need relatively small engines to be able to intercept the trucks and could slide under and fit between the wheels of the truck while it's driving. With two battery spaces the truck could pick up a new battery once it's nearly empty and then drop out the other battery which then drives itself to a charging point.",5,9,False,default,,,,,

I've submitted this idea elsewhere but to dismissive ears. I'm hoping I've found the right audience.

It revolves around [The Drake Equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation). And here we must assume that life is a natural process.

There's fun little calculators you can play with involving this 'equation'. You couldn't call it accurate by any stretch, but it gives a solid impression of what we're talking about.

When you consider the shear number of galaxies in the observable universe, and the incomprehensible amount of stars located within those galaxies, we don't even need to consider what's beyond the reach of our eyes for this to prove my point.

Let's say there are 100 billion galaxies (this is a conservative number).
Let's say that each of these galaxies average 100 billion stars. That is 10^18 stars we're working with.

As of now, we have discovered planets orbiting pretty much every star we've looked at for planets; so it's pretty common. 

And this is where we make up numbers:

Let's say that there is a 0.01% chance that any given planet is within its star's ""habitable zone"". And let's say that 0.001% of those planets are capable of sustaining life. And let's say that 0.0001% of those planets already host life.

This amounts to 1 billion life supporting planets. And we're not even using the *actual* scale of the observable universe! 

Of course we cannot discount the fact that we're not yet capable of knowing what these actual probabilities are. But the thing is, with the scale of the universe, as low as these probabilities could be, unless we're entering a ""0"" into any of the fields, we'll still be coming up with innumerable life supporting planets.

The problem with that is: we know at *at least* 1. Earth.

I *know* that there is life elsewhere in the Universe, no matter how sparse. I simply cannot find a reason to doubt the fact that life is a natural process and, given enough time, anything that is possible is bound to occur.",11,0,False,self,,,,,

They are afraid of all of us being alone.  Disregarding the paradoxical nature of that statement, if we are truly the only intelligent creatures in the universe then I am not sad, unhappy, or anything like that.  I am in fact quite happy about that possibility.  

It means we are the only things in the entire universe that give the stars meaning.  We are what make the stars significant, make them more than uncontrolled fusion reactions.    
It means that out of all of the near infinite amount of worlds, solar systems, and galaxies in this universe *we* will be the ones who colonize it all.  
And most of all, it means we will be the ones to eventually conquer Death itself and eventually learn &amp; control the laws of the universe to become ***gods***.  

So I ask you this, if we eventually find out that we are indeed the only sentient, intelligent beings in the universe to give it purpose other than being just random bits of physics, how can such a possibility be bad?

If we were not the only intelligent beings then I feel that we would be worse off for we would not be what gives everything purpose nor could we as easily rise to what we would currently consider something that equates to godhood.

It's pretty inchoate. But if solar-powered driverless RVs could roam around public streets day and night, whether the occupants are asleep or awake, wouldn't this eliminate the need to rent or purchase real estate, not even overnight at an RV park?

You would still need a dump station unless and until a consumer-grade system exists to convert trash and waste to useful energy and clean water. And congestion could be a problem if people prefer to circulate within certain areas. Also, this doesn't seem too radically different from just using an RV now and camping for free at Walmarts or truck stops, which already allow free overnight RV stays because they want you to buy your daily needs from them.

So why hasn't RV living become more common already? Is it just the high upfront cost of purchasing an RV, and the fact that few people want to ""live at"" a Walmart or truck stop parking lot?

I guess my questions for people smarter than I would be:

1. How in hell do we deal with anyone being able to print any product that can be made out of plastic, anytime they like in the future (I'm assuming much like piracy now) without cost and anonymously?

2. Do you think internet anonymity is here to stay?

3. Do you think policing of the internet will grow to an analog of what it is in the public sphere today?

4. How will laws deal with the malfunctioning of a design? If I 3-D print a gun that someone designed, and I shoot it, and it blows up in my face, is that my fault?, the fault of the designer?, do you think I will be able to sue them in the future?

What I would really like to see is some numbers and data about this; I've been curious about the subject for a long time, and want to know what people think.

To get the discussion stated, here is one number to keep an eye on: the productivity per worker as measured by the US Department of Labor, especially in manufacturing.   That's generally a pretty good proxy for how much human labor is being replaced by machinery and automation.

For the first quarter of 2013:
&gt;""Manufacturing sector productivity increased 3.8 percent in the first quarter of 2013, as output grew 5.6 percent and hours rose 1.7 percent.""

That's faster then last year, and is a pretty significant increase in productivity per worker.   ",11,25,False,self,,,,,

You could find a way to realisticly extend the roman empire to another 1000 years ...and find out we're still not past the industrial age at our current time..for example.

Or you could use it to study how civilization are formed with a random start point and add a cyborg early in the development, see what happens. Is the cyborg a world emperor few centuries later?

It would be a good idea to remain ethical. The emulated beings are very real.

&gt;1. Physical and psychological disturbance caused by a person's inability to cope with very rapid social and technological change. 


***
**My own case of Future Shock**

If you're an avid science fiction reader then you must have had one point when you come across an idea, or set of ideas, that make you stop and question you're ability to handle living in a technological advanced world. Whether, this is ""[Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)"" problems or ethical questions caused by a societies using technologies in ways that would be unable to live in, for example ""[Big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)"" and the loss of free will by [min/maxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-maxing) your life.

Personally, my first major experience of future shock was reading [Accelerando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando_%28novel%29) by [Charles Stross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross), available for free [here](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/) and learning about the ""Vile Offspring"":

&gt;**Vile Offspring:** Derogatory term for the posthuman ""weakly godlike intelligences"" that inhabit the inner solar system by the novel's end.

I came to the realization that modification of humans to be smarter and the pursuit of intelligence for it's own sake may be a destructive path to take. Underneath this is the [existential nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism#Existential_nihilism) that building intelligent systems beyond our own capabilities may be worthless and that instead technology should be used to build an [hedonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism) existence for humanity, as it is now.

***

**Possible cause of Future Shock on a Societal Level**

The fundamental thing that we take for granted in our daily life, something that is so obvious and intuitively true, is the idea of an ""[self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self)"" . However, something that seems so obviously true is in fact a mirage created by our brains and the idea of a self is so embedded in our language that it's next to impossible to remove it and write coherent sentences that *others* can understand.

Even in this subreddit people still have trouble giving up a sense of self. Questions arise about whether the [Star Trek transporter is actually killing people and then reassembling a copy](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/13437/in-star-trek-does-the-original-die-in-teleportation), otherwise known as the ""[Swampman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swampman)"" and this brings additional problems such as the ""[Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)"".

How are people going to handle technology that begins to encroach on their sense of self. When *your* memories are available to everyone, when a significant part of *your* thinking is done in a location *somewhere else* and the feeling of emptiness *you* get when *your* connections to the internet are severed. How are people of today going to handle that? People, that write this stuff for a living have trouble with this, so how would the general populace handle this. Not well.

The internet has brought an unparalleled method of media distribution and co-operative organization across distances that were insurmountable before. However, this technology is doing the same stuff that we have been doing for thousands of years. The interface is different but the motions you go through aren't. Communicate with others, solve problems, listen to stories, watch videos.

I think two things will happen as a result of the diminishing importance of the self in society. A shift to extreme [individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism) in order to retain the idea of the self, coupled with [ludditism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Luddism), and a shift to [collectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism) with secular, atheistic Buddhist philosophies becoming more important.

While, I don't think that the idea of a ""self"" will be totally diminished, at least without extensive brain augmentation, people will become more aware of how interconnected our lives are and try to balance this with individual thought and collective thought. However, I don't think the peace between individualism and collectivism will be easy. Western society, as of today, is highly individualized and this won't be an easy shift.

I'm Daniel Yount (co-host of our community's podcast show). We're planning an special show completely devoted to talking about technological unemployment, the effects of automation and all of these huge technological advances we're making at breakneck speeds it seems. 

I contacted Andrew McAfee (Author of ""Race Against the Machines"") a little while ago to invite him on the show for an interview and he graciously accepted. I'll be conducting the interview with him relatively soon and I have some of my own questions to ask him, but I wanted to reach out to all the people in this community for specific questions that they would like to see him address. 

Please keep the topic strictly focused on technological unemployment, post scarcity, automation, and any applicable technologies related to these ""fields"" etc...

This is a really cool opportunity that we have to interview someone who is leading the charge towards the future that most of these posts submitted here are pointing towards. 

Check out Andrew McAfee's book here: http://www.amazon.com/Race-Against-The-Machine-ebook/dp/B005WTR4ZI

I've also included some videos of him that I find very enlightening:

In my opinion, the Japanese film *Ghost in the Shell* captured a vision of the future that Hollywood filmmakers seemed to be afraid to touch, yet one which seems more in line with what Vernor Vinge, Neal Stephenson and people who put stock in the theory of a technological Singularity might be comfortable with. I first watched the film back when I was reading Ray Kurzweil's *Age of Spiritual Machines* and kind of felt like it was a dystopian vision of Kurzweil's predictions. I'm no expert though.

I see a lot of assuming that we can only transfer the brain's hard coded essence and not our actual identity along with it. A lot of assuming we can't transfer our identity onto another system or even another brain. While looking at these posts I'm seeing a lot of the same notions which looking at the mechanics of how most people see computers makes sense. Most people are seeing the brain as purely a hard drive to be transferred over and then having to be restarted while on the new system, a pure file transfer.

But there is another way which is actually how most computers function now with duo-cores and quad-cores which is multi-threading, the act of sharing a single program with more than one core. Now imagine that your identity is a program encompassing your entire brain that you see as a hard drive. Instead of doing a blind transfer and rebooting yourself on the new system you simply start up the program, which seeing as you're currently alive has already been started, and allow some method to transfer the operations and memories from your brain onto the computer or secondary brain. By the power of multi-threading which is already working in your computer to provide more processors to provide faster operating speeds you can transfer programs from one core to another without ending the program, that program being your identity.

I hope this helps people to further understand how this process could take shape and allow for them to see that it is possible to transfer you, not a copy of you, onto a computer and back again.",1,2,False,self,,,,,

(Mods, If I'm violating the posting rules, please delete this post and accept my apology)

I'm friends with a physics professor/CEO of a software company who's going to be part of a time capsule burial later this year.  He's doing it with a couple dozen other business people in the high tech industry.  The goal of the time capsule is to place the most valuable item/object/substance possible in it to be priced 100 years from now.

There are a few rules that need to be followed:  * Nothing currently illegal to own.  * Can't be destructive, corrosive, explosive, radioactive, etc.  * Limit of $25,000.  * Must be able to fit in the capsule (I don't know what this exactly means but I'm assuming less than a few square feet.  Definitely nothing car sized).  

I don't know exactly how the future price will be determined but I'm assuming market or auction pricing will be used.

So what would you place in it?  A rare earth metal like iridium, ruthenium or rhodium? Shares of Google or Blackberry? Something currently legal but almost certainly going to be illegal in the future?",13,0,False,self,,,,,

457,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013-5-17,2013,5,17,13,1ei1ez,self.Futurology,5 Reasons I am Opposed to Transhumanism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1ei1ez/5_reasons_i_am_opposed_to_transhumanism/,frohlich,1368766794,"*1.) Being Human is special. Transhumanism will take that away.*
Most people dismiss this argument as some sort of religious nonsense, however I do not think this is fair. Humans have the perfect level of physical and mental capabilities where they are largely self-sufficient as an individual on the short term, but require help from other people in order to propagate the species. An interesting caveat is that they also have the mental capabilities to reason and understand the importance of their actions. Much of what we value in other people is not who they are, but how they choose to react to what they are given. In a transhumanist world peoples actions will be totally irrelevant, as any personality flaws can simply be corrected by altering your neurochemistry. The need to cooperate with other people for survival (this is what I think separates humans from animals and transhumans) will also be irrelevant. What is the point of cooperating with other people when you can just create robots to do it for you? What is the point in conversing with others for advice when your supremely intelligent mind can create an answer to any hypothetical problem?

*2.) The potential for torture will be astronomical.*
People like to discuss how happy transhumans can potentially be, however they always fail to mention how unhappy they can be as well. Currently there is a limit to how unhappy humans can be. One of the greatest levels of unhappiness occurs by torturing people. Torture, however, has its limits to what it can do to a person. You may even say that death is a blessing in disguise for humans as there is only so much physical and/or mental anguish a person can take before dying. If that does not kill a person, people still age and eventually die due to old age, releasing them from any potential suffering they may be experiencing. In a posthuman world (perhaps in as little as several decades) this may not be the case. It will be possible to keep people alive against their will as unspeakable horrors are inflicted upon them. If this does not scare you, then imagine yourself, a friend or a family member being held in this kind of state indefinitely. Also keep in mind that the level of anguish being inflicted on this person in question is unlike anything a person has ever experienced before.

*3.) Transhumanism is guided by greed and arrogance, not scientific enlightenment.*
Supreme levels of intelligence will be made possible in our lifetimes. These intelligences, whether they be strictly limited to computers, or a combination of man and machine, will be able to give insight into great scientific and philosophical questions that have stumped humanity ever since antiquity. Where did the universe originate? Do people have free will? What is the fate of the universe? Is there a meaning to life? If so, what is it? Is there life after death? Where does consciousness originate? Can it be objectively proven what is the correct set of moral values? Will the debate between science and religion be settled once and for all? Is it even advisable for humanity to step into posthumanity?

Unfortunately, transhumanists *never* mention that we may have the capabilities to answer these questions in our lifetimes. They seem to be more concerned with their own selfish desires (being bigger, faster, stronger, more intelligent, happier, etc). Pursuing these selfish desires with reckless disregard for any negative implications they may hold for everyone else is the pinnacle of greed and arrogance.

*4.) The first three laws of thermodynamics cannot be overcome.*
The three laws of the thermodynamics are the source of all scarcity. There is currently no evidence that they can be overcome, no matter what level of technology is available. Transhumanists arrogantly state that they will live forever. If they are so scientifically informed, then arent they aware that we already know the fate of the universe will be a cold landscape devoid of any usable energy? Those that seek immortality have failed before they even started. Death can be delayed, but there is no evidence that it can be avoided entirely. There is no such thing as a post-scarcity world. Like death, the compelling urge to compete with others for scarce energy/resources *may* subside for a time (then again, it may not), however it will not be eliminated forever.

*5.) Humanity is not prepared for transhumanism.*
Even if it were that a transition into a posthuman world was prudent, the question remains: how exactly it should occur? Most humans are totally unaware how close we actually are to living in a posthuman world. Is it really fair to take such a bold leap when most people are not even aware that it is occurring? Not to mention that society will be totally at the mercy of those that acquire the necessary technology first. Also problematic is the inevitable economic chaos that will occur when technology starts increasing at an uncontrollable rate. If you think that transhumanism is something that should be pursued, fine. But do not fool yourself into thinking that it will be a smooth transition. It may very well end up being the most painful trial humanity has ever had to face. There is a good chance that many people reading this will die during the potential chaos and not live to become transhuman.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

As much as I love my phone, I also hate it. I hate bending down to look at it, I hate feeling cut off from the world around me, and most of all, I hate texting people. 

I have a lot of friends who can just text all day. I understand the social aspect of it, however it's such an ugly way to communicate. Tapping away on a touchscreen is as inconvenient as it is uncomfortable, and having something constantly vibrating in your pocket because it needs your attention must be what raising a small child feels like. 

Anyway, smartphones are not the end. They're a stopgap between mobile phones and AR technology. I really think that Google Glass is onto something, even if it takes several generations for them to fully flush it out. 

I use my smartphone because it's better than nothing. It does everything I want it to do and well. However, I think we'll look back at them in ten years or so in the same way we look back on CD Walkmans and Zach Morris phones.

We don't see it as a threat today in most countries.1


From Plutocracy to Democracy: The Millennial Challenge



I. Detroitism

	Detroit was once known as the Paris of the Midwest. It was once known as the Arsenal of Democracy. In 1925, Ramsay Muir observed that Detroit is the home of mass production, very high wages and colossal profits, of reckless installment buying and shifting labour surplus. It regards itself as the temple of a new gospel of progress to which I will venture to give the name Detroitism.2 The opening of the Ford plant in 1899 ushered in an era of awesome growth economically and demographically. Within just twenty-five years of the plant's opening, the population of Detroit surged from 300,000 to 1.3 million.3 Henry Ford adopted policies which allowed this growth to translate into material benefit for the plant's incoming workers. By paying a living wage to his employees (the then-hefty $5 a day, which, adjusted for inflation, is more than present-day autoworkers earn), Ford was able to build a middle class that could afford his products. He did not believe it was a good idea for Americans to buy consumer goods like automobiles on credit. He opted for the layaway plan, allowing a buyer to pay a little each month until he had the car paid for in its entirety.4 
	Ford's dominance was eventually supplanted buy General Motors, which in 1919 developed the General Motors Acceptance Corporation to finance automobile purchases on credit. Nearly a century after its founding, GM had more than $1 trillion loaned to car buyers and had expanded into other businesses like home mortgages.5
	But the power and influence afforded these companies through their ostensibly public-benefiting growth was quickly deployed in service of their own interests and against those of the public at large. GM's destruction of electric transit systems across the country left millions of urban residents without an attractive alternative to automotive travel. Pollution-free rail networks...were vastly superior in terms of speed and comfort to smoke-belching, rattle-bang GM buses which bogged down with cars and trucks in traffic. Likewise, electric buses were faster, quieter, cheaper and more durable than gas or diesel units. No one knew this better than General Motors.6 Detroit was home to one of the first city-run streetcar systems; the last streetcar ran in 1956.7 Today, many urban residents of Detroit have neither effective public transportation nor the means to afford their own vehicle. In 2011, the unemployment rate was 49.1%.8
	The looting of Detroit was not effected by the corporate bloc alone. The political elites responsible for the management of Detroit are guilty of widespread corruption. According to the report issued by the recently-appointed Emergency Manager, [t]he City's operations have become dysfunctional and wasteful after years of budgetary restrictions, mismanagement, crippling operational practices and, in some cases, indifference or corruption.9 The attorney representing Detroit in the prosecution of former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick observed that he didn't lead the city. He looted the city. While [he] enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, he watched the quality of life erode for the people of Detroit.10
	It is possible to conceive of Detroit as an anomaly. It was unique in its rapid population growth, and likewise unique in its rapid depopulationover the last decade, it has shrunk more than 25% to 714,000 people.11 The explosive development of the American car was unique. The shamelessness of its politicians' corruption is unique. Unfortunately, what really sets Detroit apart is its historical position with regard to the rest of the country:  Detroit was and is the future. Charlie LeDuff, who was raised in Detroit before becoming a national reporter for the New York Times, writes that,
Detroit can no longer be ignored, because what happened here is happening out there. Neighborhoods from Phoenix to Los Angeles to Miami are blighted with empty houses and people with idle hands. Americans are swimming in debt, and the prospects of servicing the debt grow slimmer by the day as good-paying jobs continue to evaporate or relocate to foreign lands. Economists talk about the inevitable turnaround. But standing here in Michigan, it seems to me that the fundamentals are no loner there to make a good life. Go ahead and laugh at Detroit. Because you are laughing at yourself.12

Detroit is not an anomaly, but, instead, the most severe symptom of a national crisis of management.

II. Synecdoche
	Since January of 2010, over thirty municipalities have declared bankruptcy, including San Bernardino, California, Central Falls, Rhode Island, and Jefferson County, Alabama.13 Nationally, one in nine bridges are structurally deficient.14 The American Society of Civil Engineers writes that since [the New Deal], federal leadership has decreased, and the condition of the nations infrastructure has suffered. Currently, most infrastructure investment decisions are made without the benefit of a national vision. That strong national vision must originate with strong leadership at all levels of government and the private sector. Without embracing a strong national vision, the infrastructure will continue to deteriorate.15 
	Our judiciary system is likewise in disrepair, with eighty-five Article III positions sitting empty.16 In a recent law review article, it was noted that [u]nless members of Congress (and some judges) were to change their attitudes toward the creation of additional federal judgeships, without a 
large corps of judges in senior status, the federal judiciary would collapse under the weight of its caseload.17 The growing desperateness of the situation and the inattention from our lawmakers has led at least one federal judge to call for a mass exodus of senior district judges. [T]here may be no other way to truly get he attention of Congress, he laments.18
	On the other hand, attention from Congress may not be desirable. When they govern, they tend to govern poorly and from flawed ideology. The recent austerity measures that have been pursued by Congress are based on disproven economic philosophy. The fact that the underlying economic philosophy is know to be false has no effect on policy. Florida Senator Marco Rubio recently claimed that [e]very dollar our government borrows is money that isn't being invested to created jobs.19 House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's 2013 budget proposal relied for support on a study which systematically manipulated data to support austerity policies. By selectively excluding data from countries like Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, the paper claimed that once the debt-to-GDP ratio in a country surpassed 90%, the economy would shrink by an average of 0.1 percent; once other researchers were allowed access to the underlying data and able to include these countries, the conclusion was revised to reflect that even countries with this kind of ratio grew by an average of 2.2 percent per year.20 Commenting on this scandal, the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research wrote that [i]f facts mattered in economic policy debates, this should be the cause for a major reassessment of the deficit reduction policies being pursued in the United States and elsewhere.21  Instead, the Obama Administration has accepted the debt-hysteria of the Republicans, seeking to cut expenditures for Medicare and Medicaid, and to reduce Social Security benefits through a reformulation of how inflation is calculated.22 The House of Representatives seeks to cut $2.5 billion dollars per year from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Iowa Representative Steve King argued on the floor of the House that such cuts are not something that is going to be noticeable.23 Researchers from Oxford and Stanford have already reported that more than 10,000 suicides and up to a million cases of depression have been diagnosed during what they call the Great Recession and its accompanying austerity across Europe and North America.24
	The facts do not matter. Representative King is not wrong when he says that the cuts will not be noticeable, if he means that it will not be noticed by politicians or their patrons. The average wealth of an American Senator is $13.9 million; the average wealth of an American Representative is just $6.5 million.25 It is also unlikely to be noticed by the electorate. Only 57.5% of voting eligible Americans turned out in the most recent election.26 Those that do turn out to vote are in general not voting based on facts. A 2010 national poll conducted by Bloomberg found that, by a large margin, voters were mistaken about the results of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, whether taxes had increased or decreased, and whether the economy had grown or shrunk.27 A 2004 Cato Institute report found that close to one-third of Americans can be categorized as 'know-nothings' almost completely ignorant of relevant political information.28 Four out of ten Americans are unaware that the Affordable Care Act is still law.29 More fundamentally, the average American is ignorant or confused about the structure of the American government, misunderstanding which political branches are responsible for, for example, setting tax rates or declaring wars. A forthcoming paper from George Mason University has found that [p]olitical scientists and the public systematically disagree on 15 out of 16 questions. Their belief gaps are usually large in magnitude and highly statistically significant. Even after adding controls for self-serving bias, ideological bias, and education to the list of control variables, over 90% of the raw belief gap between political scientists and the public remains. 30
	Facing a voting public which does not vote, does not know about the present economic or political conditions, and which does not understand which politicians are responsible for what, the American political class has no incentive to pursue the best interests or, even less, the preferences of the electorate. This dismantling of political accountability explains why a 91% approval rating for some proposed legislation is irrelevant to its success.31 It explains why legislative leaders from both parties can conspire to transfer $500 million from Medicare to Amgen, Inc. with no consequences besides a swiftly forgotten article in the Times.32 
	This misalignment of political incentives is coupled with a disturbing degree of partisanship and intransigence which poses grave risks to the American system. As Judge Richard Posner observed last year, [we] have An education, a justice system, a health care system, a legal system, and so on. And a lot of these systems seem to be in trouble all at once which is surprising and it's disturbing. Because there don't seem to be any real solutions on offer and the political parties seem incapable of working with each other to deal with problems which are so large  and contentious that you really need a consensus of the political interest to do anything about them.33
	Even if a political consensus is formed to deal with the long-term, structural crises in the American social and political system, such a consensus will likely be formed around the interests of the aging Baby Boomers. Already, this cohort has been able to manipulate the political process to serve their interests, creating a society where, according to the International Monetary Fund, [t]hose aged 65 in 2010 may receive $333 billion more in benefits than they pay in taxes  an obligation 17 times larger than that likely to be left by those aged 25.34 The tax policies pursued by this group have left less revenue for the generous benefits Boomers have continued to vote themselves.35 Government deficit spending in a down economy is a wise move, so long as that spending is directed towards investment that the private sector has failed to pursue. Correcting for the market's under-provision of public goods and offsetting the decline in confidence engendered by the recession can lay the groundwork for future growth while mitigating the immediate consequences of an economic downturn. This view of the role of government is no longer operationalizable in the United States.  The present-day failure of the political class to take action has set the stage for continuing, serious crises in the future.36

So one of the key issues that a lot of people seem to have with google glass is the recording of other people either in public or work without their consent.

A possible solution might be to have lawmakers pass a law that forces all recording devices, including smartphone cameras and google glass to have a tiny red light at the camera source to signal everyone around that there is a camera recording. This would be required by Law and unable to be changed in the device.

Another solution that is built upon the one above was to have face-recognition software running while recording and automatically blur people's faces like you see on google maps. Thus any recording would render all people anonymous. This would be very useful if you want to record your family Disneyland trip without running into problems and complaints about using recording devices in public.

So the following could be implemented and required by Law:

* A red light at the camera lenses signalling the camera is active and recording.
 
* A yellow light signalling the camera is active and recording and blurring people's faces automatically. Everyone's anonymity is kept.
 
* A blinking white light signalling the camera is active and taking a photo or exposure.
 
* A green light signalling the camera is active but not recording anything. You are safe while this is on. This is used when using software that needs a camera such as bar-code scanning or augmented reality apps.
 
* A blue light signalling the camera is blocked and not in use. This could be done by having wi-fi/GPS around a location that bans any use of photography such as museums, children's parks or near police. Saying ""Ok google, block the camera for 10 minutes"" would lock the camera into blue-light mode and the police would know the camera wasn't recording (to keep the user from trouble).

All i'm trying to explore here are possible solutions for this, not a topic for or against public recording. The term ""legalising"" simply means creating a legal unified framework for all recording devices so everyone is informed on what is happening. I do not want to go into security/surveillance cameras in this post, just personal recording devices. Anyone else got any ideas?",7,4,False,self,,,,,

All of the responses appear to be people who want to ask questions about their personal lives.  There are basically two kinds of questions: Requests for lotto numbers and stock picks, and questions about their personal life and relationship status.  I guess I should expect this, but really? No one wants to know what technology we are going to be using in the future? How the economy will change? How the global political structure changes? Do we have self driving cars? Can we cure cancer? How bad is global warming? Have we achieved strong AI? Did we encounter motherfucking aliens? 

If I could get one question answered about the future, I certainly wouldn't waste it asking about myself.  But apparently just about everyone else would.  I think this is a huge problem, because it means that most people aren't really thinking about the future in terms of our constantly-changing society, so a lot of real problems we are going to face aren't currently being considered.  If you ask people what has changed in the last 25 years, they'll say the internet and cell phones and smart phones and GPS, and they understand these are pretty big changes.  But when you ask them to imagine the next 25 years they just want to know if they'll be happy or not.  

Right now we should be looking ahead and asking ourselves questions like ""How can we fight unemployment when an increasing number of jobs will be done by software instead of humans?"" and ""What might a terrorist be able to do with powerful AI, or advanced nanotechnology?""  These are things that get bounced around in this sub sometimes, but in the ""outside world"" I'm quite worried that no one even believes these things are possible.

Although this does sound really sweet (imagine Skyrim in VR), what potential drawbacks or problems do you think this would cause? Would people completely detach from reality and want to escape to worlds that are much more vivid and exciting? Would there be some new form of psychological disorder caused by this technology?

In addition, let's speculate on whether violent video games would be regulated or even allowed. Imagine being in a VR grand theft auto setting with the same amount of violence that the game currently has, but only much much more realistic. It is an unpopular opinion on Reddit to say that video game violence causes real life violence, but how do you think this would change if VR went mainstream? Would there be a stronger ethical argument to reduce video game violence?

I'm an avid reader of this subreddit, a mod on /r/existential risk, and general fan of high technology. I recently started thinking about late-twentieth-century science fiction, specifically about how many of the prognostications of the cyberpunks are (or are becoming) true. Decentralized cryptocurrency? Check. Rouge finance AIs of indeterminate origin destabilizing the stock market? Check. Virtual reality? Check. Mind-bending levels of wealth inequality? Check. A growing fear of technological unemployment? Check, etc. We see examples of this every day on this subreddit.  *Why not*, I thought, *write a novel that addresses technologies. After all, you couldn't possibly do worse than Zoltan Istvan*.  So I stared writing a web serial. Three chapters are up.

FIVE ASSUMPTIONS.


    The universe is made of events and the laws that govern them.
    Enough traces in the present exist to describe the past.
    There is no qualitative difference between a dead being and any other historical data.
    Archaeology is increasing.
    Microrobots for physical assemblies are already prototyping.    


Quantum Archaeology  is the science of resurrecting the dead including their memories. It anticipates coming process technologies that accelerate science and technology. It assumes the universe is made of events and the laws that govern them, and seeks to make maps of brain/body states at the instant of death for every being in history. Then give them back their bodies, healthier and better. Living beings are seen as data sets that can be recorded and worked out by statistics and mathematics. The result must be resurrection.


The quantum archaeology grid aims to set out all known events, calculating the others in vast cross-referencing interaction lines -  (the laws of physics). The result will be a megamatrix good enough to describe then simulate the past. It awaits coming systems like quantum computers and super-recursive algorithms. Large grids already exist waiting to be merged, including cosmic ones with trillions of moving points. Early quantum computers are already built and expected to achieve required efficiencies by 2022, and super-recursive algorithms are already being explored.


Facial reconstructions from scavenged DNA in public places have been presented at the Smithsonian, and functional parts of life-forms extinct for hundreds of millions of years have been resurrected in evolutionary biology. De-extinction projects to resurrect generic groups like Neanderthals, mammoths, frogs and other passed species are past the planning stage. Resurrection of particular individuals with their original conscious minds and memories looks a next step, raising archaeology to importance in the course of human civilisation as it abolishes death in the past.

The recent XBox One reveal got me thinking about it again.  The Smart TV with Kinekt stuff really resembled what I wrote here:

&gt;* The coming ""death"" of television. When Future Marty comes home and talks to Marty, Jr. for the first time, he's surprised to find him lounging on a couch watching several channels, he says ""Watching some TV for a change."" Television audiences has actually been losing younger generations to other forms of entertainment, notably video games and the internet. Several younger people watch television programs on the internet as they are far more convenient. We also have several 100 channels on some cable networks, each devoted to specific and odd niches... and the internet allows for a near infinite amount of niche information.

&gt;* Multiple Televisions that double as windows. While we aren't using projection screens, flatscreen technology and other smartglass-like technologies have created screens that are literally windows, sometimes windows to other parts of the world. There are - in fact - channels dedicated to ""broacasting beautiful views from all over the world.""

&gt;* ""You have to use your hands? That's like a Baby's toy."" While we still have to use our ""hands"", waggle and camera-centered controllers are out and selling well. Further, brainwave controllers[1] aren't too far off. At one point, there will be a commercial controller that allows us to think at the screen.

And here we have a fully integrated camera / TV that can monitor several windows at once (the several channels Marty Jr. watches), as well as handle the rest. What's more, it's integrated with cellphones via Smartglass.  Later on there's a scene in which Marty and his sister are watching ""video glasses"" at the Dinner table (echoing the dinner seen in Back to the future 1 where everyone's watching TV instead of dinner), which also tell them when they got a call.  MS Windows phone is meant to integrate with a sort of ""smart"" household of networked PCs and peripherals, and that isn't far off from doing the same with Google Glasses (which clearly had a HUD).  

Also, the camera is used for Skype style video chat as well as Marty's boss listening in on a camera that's ON (and recording) ALL THE TIME.  While that was a nod to cyberpunk literature of overzealous (particularly Japanese corporations) in the film, it wasn't too long ago that the CEO of HP wiretapped her board members, or the press hacked smart phones.  How far off is that to monitoring Skype calls (which MS's TOS say they record all the time and can do with the data what they wish)?

Sure, they use fax machines.  But these days we can send checks by TAKING A PICTURE.  We can get peripherals for iPads and iPhones that can swipe credit cards.

All that said, I'm not personally planning on getting an XBox One unless it works really well with other systems in the house.  As it is someone should develop a smart TV app for the OUYA to rival the ""snap"" TV concept that XBox One is touting.  The OUYA's a $100 device, so smart TV might actually be an app worth making for Android (android phones do have voice operation and idle modes).  Of course the XBox One has it integrated into their OS so it's likely faster.  Apple TV could have this going RIGHT NOW, but I don't see them advertising the heck out of it.  HTPCs can also get this going, or whatever Valve is working on and the rest.  Even if they run Windows 8.  

Could it be this late 80's vision of the future wasn't that far off?

(they did talk to a lot of companies at the time and take there concepts.  The smart house is an old concept from as far back as the World of Tomorrow World's Fairs.  We'll just have to see what vision wins out.  I always thought the Mac Mini was an attempt at an under the radar Smart TV as it had HDMI outputs, but it was never advertised that way and is now prohbitively expensive when compared to HTPCs)",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Hi /r/Futurology.

I have been looking for a youtube video I saw that was presented by a gentleman who described himself as a futurist (as far as I can recall), and was hoping maybe one of you might be familiar with the video or the individual who made it as a starting place for the help finding it.

I made a post over at /r/tipofmytongue and gave it a couple days but had no luck with the replies.  Here is a copy of the post below:

&gt;**[TOMT] [Video] Youtube video where a futurist explains a theory for advanced extra terrestrial life shrinking down to nothing.**

&gt;Saw the video on reddit several months back as a comment to a post I forget.

&gt;From what I remember it was a youtube video by what appeared to be fairly young guy (20s-30s) and he was standing outside possibly in a park talking directly to the camera explaining one theory about extraterrestrial life.

&gt;The VERY basic idea of the theory is that due to shrinking technology (physically speaking), it is possible that an extremely advanced civilization would continue to ""shrink"" down until they were just microscopic beings inside of a computer and would continue to shrink until they transcended the universe and just disappeared all together... or something equally as outlandish as that.

&gt;I checked out the guy's youtube channel and googled his name at the time and saw that he identified himself as a ""futurist"" on twitter and I think he may have had some published articles and other videos, although I don't know how popular he is.

[Link to post](http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1enusd/tomt_video_youtube_video_where_a_futurist/)

Keep in mind I am going off of memory so the details are likely a bit butchered.  If anyone knows the video or can point me in the right direction I would appreciate it.

How would we ,in the future, be able to cut this down to gaining Phd knowledge level in weeks,months, or perhaps 2 years? Increasing intelligence through biological means or technical?Or living in simulated realities where you can 'study' years while only seconds in the real world pass by?

The tiresome response (and one I used to believe before I knew better!) was that humans will become a single race with pretty much a single associated appearance.

This is of course nonsense, because after 200-300 years (barring technological collapse of course), technology will have advanced to a point where people have almost complete morphological freedom, to assume nearly any age, sex or race they choose to, either via routine technological treatments or innate abilities.

I'm no gay rights activist, but the caution many people show towards homosexuality seems to follow the same pattern, if you extrapolated a behaviour now and applied it to everyone, then you end up worrying about 'problems' (family, reproduction, education, culture, religion) that will be so radically different in the future to render current day objections meaningless.

Our future generations will not be like the past, barring a few 'Amish' like groups and increasingly numerous groups that will explicitly spin off from the mainstream of humanities to seek their own destinies.

It's art. It's meant to be controversial and funny. I have nothing against the author because, hey, artists do that stuff, they go out of their way to be controversial, and it's important to ensure that there will still be good art in the future that we give artists great latitude.

But what the hell do we do about the people who actually think that there's any wisdom in that comic? I'll pretend I'm talking to someone who would actually say all that that comic said in earnest, and count some of the ways they're wrong:

""who thinks computers will overtake mankind in thirty years, changing humanity in ways incomprehensible to us now"" - Our lives have already changed in many barely comprehensible ways, but sure, so far so good. I'm not so confident about the timeline, but that's not really important.

""Ignoring the third of the world without electricity"" - This is one of the most ironic criticisms. Yes, if you're rich and white and living in a rich nation, it's hard to see mankind's progress - because *most of it is happening elsewhere*. [IEA statistics](http://www.ruralelec.org/9.0.html) say the world population without electricity has shrunk by 161 million between 2002-2008, and that was a span during which we added more than half a billion to the total population. Oh, and not to mention leapfrogging technology that allows you to make gains that previously required far more infrastructure - the continuing story of [cell phones in Africa](http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/katine-chronicles-blog/2010/jan/14/mobile-phones-africa) is the archetypal one here.

The singularitarian story of the future, the one based on actually extrapolating current trends and technological progress, has this catch-up growth only become ever faster. Doing more stuff with less = doing more stuff in places that have less. People have different opinions about what caused the [Great Divergence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_divergence) in the first place - but whatever it was, it was never going to go on forever.

""being rich and white will be even more awesome"" - Again, the irony. Have you looked at GDP growth statistics recently? You know, the ones where Europe is contracting if anything, USA is poddling along at barely its population growth rate, and Africa and Asia are zooming up at over 6%? The world is rapidly becoming more awesome for almost everyone *except* the rich and white people, for whom it's already just pretty good and probably going to stay that way. Yes, if your measure of ""awesome"" is iPhone and Google Glass, then sure, you're right in that sense - but around you the world is becoming a wealthier, safer, more peaceful, more long-living place, no matter how much you want to pooh-pooh it.

""Surely we're the ones who will get to live in the future"" - Who even *says* this? Seriously, where do you find even one sane singularitarian who says ""oh, the future will be awesome but only to the true believers""? This makes less sense than that picture of Darth Vader standing in the ocean pouring water into a bottle. It's like criticising people who buy a car for thinking that they can get to places but not because the technology acts in predictable ways but because they have spiritual faith in cars. If someone can find the source of this meme, I'd be ever thankful.

""spiritual significance to technology"" - Oh, give me a fucking break. 

""developed primarily for entertainment or warfare"" - Okay, this one is kind of infuriating even when it's just in the comic. If you think that the purpose technology was developed for somehow [magically](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy) infects its use ever after, well, you should probably stop eating food farmed with synthetic fertilizer - the same people who invented the nitrogen-fixing process that feeds most of the world these days also used it to make a hell of a lot of explosives in WWI. I fear that the only way to enlighten people who actually use this as an argument in serious discussion is a two-by-four applied directly to the forehead.



I'll be honest, while I'm posting about this subject now, I don't actually worry about it much. So a few people on the internet think that I'm selfish and religious for being optimistic about mankind's future - no big deal. But every now and then they do annoy me, so I'm wondering - what would be the best resources to change people's minds?",19,25,False,self,,,,,

I'm still a student in college and with little money at the moment.  However I am so passionate about transhumanism I put everything I have in attending the 2045 conference in New York this summer.  

I was inspired to finally take the plunge after watching 2045ru's YouTube channel and being absolutely inspired by their videos.  

I am an entrepreneur and a visionary by heart.  I'm young, tenacious, and absolutely unstoppable.  It is my sincerest desire to turn my passion for entrepreneurship into a vehicle to make singularity by 2045 nothing less than objective reality.  I have decided this evening that this is my destiny and the reason I exist.  To give everything and anything to all those who desire it. 

Thankfully I have enough airlines miles saved up from travelling a few years ago that getting a plane ticket will be free.  Also I am fortunate enough to have visited New York before and know how to navigate their subway system with ease.  

I'm here to answer any questions from anyone who is interested in going but *something* is holding them back.  Also I am sort of here because I am looking for guidance on cheap lodgings in New York for the 2-3 days I will be there.  (That is still a piece of the puzzle I am thinking about).

LENR could, by itself, COMPLETELY Revolutionize Space access and utilization. Although there is a quite long history of anomalous observations including transmutations the recent consideration of Low Energy Nuclear Reactions begins with the Pons/ Fleishman late 80s observations and assertions regarding what they termed Cold Fusion. Subsequent difficulties with experimental replication and an utter lack of convincing theoretical explication forced research in this arena underground with minimal financial support. The current situation is that we now have over two decades of hundreds of experiments indicating heat and transmutations with minimal radiation and low energy input. By any rational measure this evidence indicates something real is occurring. So, is LENR Real? Evidently, from the now long standing and diverse experimental evidence  yes - With effects occurring using diverse materials, methods of energy addition etc. This is FAR from a Narrow Band/episodic set of physical phenomena.

Now let me tell you a bit about why I did this so you can better understand my motives.  I believe that at an infinitesimally small level, everything is the same.  You and me are made of the same stuff.  My existence doesn't end where my body ends, it doesn't end at all.  The atoms are to our cells as our cells are to our bodies as our bodies are to our planet as our planet is the...You get the point.

If I could help others, the whole body wins...I mean, I'm just a cell on the body of this planet after all.

Now I'll tell you what I'm working on and what I need your help to build.  It's called JOATU, an acronym standing for **J**ack **o**f **a**ll **t**rade **u**nit.  It works in two parts which [you can read about here](http://joatu.com) or right below:


&gt;Fill out a profile with the skills that you can offer as services (e.g. agricultural, physical, social, etc) and all of the products (e.g. power tools, tomato plants, server space, etc) that you would like to lend or trade.
 
&gt;When someone finds your offer enticing, you will be notified and its up to the two of you to make an exchange work!
 
&gt;Part two is the tricky part.
 
&gt;For any community to thrive, people need to invest their time into it. 
JOATU exists as a means of exchange for just that reason. When someone decides to invest their time into the community, they make a community offer (e.g. Offering a public service such as a public lesson, cleaning up a neighborhood, planting a local garden, distributing food to the homeless, etc).  
 
&gt;When someone decides to make a community offer, you will receive a notification that allows you to decide if this community offer is worthwhile and how much it contributes to your community.  The person offering the service/product to the community is then compensated for their offering with Jack of all Trade Units (JOATU).  
 
&gt;The community are then welcomed to benefit from the community offering at a cost of 0 JOATU!
A community service open to the public and to the benefit of all!

**It would be my pleasure to answer all of your questions and concerns to the best of my ability.**  Know that I have just decided to launch publicly today and that this is the first subreddit I am approaching.  I have formulated this idea over the last eight months and will be dedicating all of the time necessary to bringing the project to fruition.  I'll leave you with this for now to let your own imaginations run wild with the possibilities.  Trust me when I say that I have loved thinking and talking about this for months and there will be discussions to be had for years to come.

**Edit 1**: I perceive JOATU as a transitional economy.  This is not meant to necessarily be 'the last economy' by any means but as a way to open up the discussion on values by redistributing them according to our personal beliefs.  Are some jobs overvalued and others undervalued?  Absolutely.  This system would allow for corrections to take place.",4,4,False,self,,,,,
