What if we could generate a pulse of light, then pass it through a method of physical encryption such that anyone who intercepted it without the proper hardware+private key wouldn't even be able to tell it was light they had intercepted?  Or perhaps even if the light was recognized as such, it would appear to be random photons with no purpose, whereas the correct recipient would be able to see the arrangement of light as intended?  
  
I know that such technology doesn't exist now, but *could* it hypothetically exist?  
  
Already we are talking about moving our systems of Internet transmission from radio-based to light-based because of the inherent speed advantages.  I would bet that if direct encryption of light is possible (and practical), we will eventually move to that over just obfuscation of the data that our light is carrying.  
  
Imagine a web of civilizations all participating in a titanic cosmic Internet, all interacting with each other at the speed of light by sending encrypted pulses at each other.... But to our rudimentary eyes it just appears like a bunch of random scattered light through the cosmos.

Something that might look like wobbling sparkling goo to us. I'm not saying it would engulf the planet, just that if machine wants to keep improving itself, it's 1 very likely outcome that it makes one at least small size. Thing like that at exact size of a brain would be millions of times more efficient than the biologic brain itself.

edit: I'll expand on few things: First about the brain efficiency. What we've come to believe is that it's nature's intelligence compressed to max. It might apply to nature but not to artificial. If you look deep inside the brain with microscope and even with just eyes, you'll come to notice how much there is blood veins, empty space (a whole lot of empty space), cellular structures and stuff taking all that volume. Neuron connections themselves are miles long in the micro-scale. Nanotechnology can be crafted with atomic precision and extreme space efficiency. Such amount of machines would also need very efficient nano-assembling, possibly construction bots that would build more construction bots. Computer of the future absolutely can control thing like that.

Second, i didn't initially want to give my own estimate but here goes... It should happen within this century, sooner than most people would expect. If it does not, it would mean technological progress would stop progressing exponentially and slow down. There's been no indication of something like that in the history line. On the opposite, progress seems to just speed up.",9,0

&gt;**[SciAm.com:] Exactly how is technology shifting the landscape of jobs and wealthwho wins and who loses?**

&gt;[MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson:] . . . The third change might be the most important one: It's called superstar-biased technical change 
. . . If somebody has talent or luck in creating something that people want, that thing can be replicated with digital technology much more easily than in the past. Think of someone who writes software. You can take that talent or luck and replicate it a million times. And while the person who created it does very, very well, the people who previously did that job are less important or maybe not even necessary. The example that I gave in my TED talk was TurboTax. Youve got a human tax preparer being replaced by a $39 piece of software. It makes the pie bigger in the sense that you create more value with less effort, but most of that value goes to a very small group of people.

From 2014 book *The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies*, co-authored by Brynjolfsson:

###### Re: the burgeoning science of reproduction

From a May 8, 2015 [article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michele-goodwin/baby-markets-the-new-motherhood_b_7263050.html) on HuffingtonPost.com:

&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC), tens of [thousands of children](http://www.cdc.gov/art/reports/index.html) 
are born each year in the United States through assisted reproductive technologies
(ART). These technologies provide a stunning candy store of options: a spectrum so vast in array, scope, and breadth as to make heads spin: [in vitro fertilization](http://www.cdc.gov/art/pdf/2012-report/national-summary/summary-2012-national-summary-report.pdf), [ova selling](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/04/mothers-helper-a-shocking-thing-i-learned-after-giving-up-my-eggs/253625/), [cryopreservation of ova, womb renting](http://www.cdc.gov/art/pdf/2012-report/national-summary/overview-02-question-national-summary-report.pdf), [pre-implantation genetic diagnosis](http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304703804579379211430859016?mod=e2tw), embryo transfer, assisted [hatching](http://www.hfea.gov.uk/assisted-hatching.html), intracytoplasmic sperm injection ([ICSI](http://www.hfea.gov.uk/ICSI.html)) of ova, [embryo grading](http://www.advancedfertility.com/blastocystimages.htm), and more.

Important: The recent discovery of ovarian stem cells makes it at least somewhat likely that soon many women will be able to supply as many eggs as buyers want.

From a February 27, 2012 [article](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-27/ovarian-stem-cells-produce-eggs-in-method-that-may-aid-fertility) syndicated by
Bloomberg News:

&gt;Stem cells taken from human ovaries were used to produce early-stage eggs by scientists in Boston who may have created a new method to help infertile women. . . . The research was led by Jonathan Tilly, the director of Massachusetts General Hospital's Vincent Center for Reproductive Biology.

&gt;. . . ""The problem we face with [in vitro fertilization] is we don't have many eggs to work with,"" [Tilly] said. ""These [stem] cells are renewable. If we are successful . . . in generating functioning eggs from these cells, we can generate as many eggs as we need to on a per patient basis.""

From an [article](http://www2.technologyreview.com/article/427672/egg-stem-cells/) in the May/June 2012 issue of *MIT Technology Review*:

&gt;Boston-based OvaScience, which is commercializing Tilly's work, hopes it wont be too long. The company's co-founders include venture capitalist Christoph Westphal and Harvard anti-aging researcher David Sinclair, who founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals and sold it to GlaxoSmithKline for $720 million in 2008. OvaScience has raised $43 million to pursue fertility treatments and other applications for the stem cells.

The issue lists ""egg stem cells"" as one of ""10 breakthrough technologies"" of 2012.

###### Re: the intersection of SBTC and said science

In recent decades, most children have been conceived via [assortative mating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assortative_mating): PhDs mate with PhDs, college dropouts with college dropouts, and so on. 

In the years ahead, wanting to conceive children who can thrive amid SBTC (e.g., amid job-automating technologies) could/should make assortative mating a non-starter for the vast majority of aspiring parents. Instead, these aspirants could/should buy the best gametes they can (borrow to) afford (i.e., many/most/all of the ""best and brightest"" may profit from being gamete suppliers).

From a December 24, 2015 [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/upshot/marriages-of-power-couples-reinforce-income-inequality.html) in *The New York Times*:

&gt;Whether measured in terms of income or education, there are more so-called power couples today than in the past, one manifestation of a phenomenon known 
as assortative mating, or more generally the pairing of like with like.

&gt;. . . Of all the causes behind growing income inequality, in the longer run this development may prove one of the most significant and also one of the hardest to counter.

From 2009 book *Genius 101*, by eminent research psychologist [Dean Keith Simonton](http://simonton.faculty.ucdavis.edu/research/honored-publications/):

&gt;""Take almost any scientific domain. First you must have enough smarts to get your BA or BS in some science major. As touched upon earlier, this indicates an IQ of around 120. Then nowadays you must almost invariably get a higher degree in your chosen scientific discipline. This presumes an IQ at least 10 points higher, already putting you on the threshold of psychometric genius . . . For some areas, such as physics, the intellectual prerequisite may be higher stillsay an IQ of around 140. 

&gt;. . . [T]he heritability of general intelligence is .80 or higher, meaning no less than 80% of the population's variation in performance on intelligence tests can be ascribed to genetic variation.""

&gt;""Each domain of high achievement features a defining profile of characteristics, some cognitive and others dispositional.""

&gt;""[I]nterests and values may only have heritabilities in the .30s. . . . [H]eritabilities for many personality traits . . . fall somewhere in the .40s and .50s."" 

From a March 20, 2010 [article](http://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a3889/single-women-sperm-donor-search/) on MarieClaire.com:

&gt;Successful 30-something women are turning to the Web to shop for top-notch sperm donorsvetting personality traits, listening to voice samples, and even enduring wait lists.

From an essay in 2010 book *This Will Change
Everything*:

&gt;There is a market for sperm and egg donors today, but the information available to consumers about donors is limited. This industry will flourish as individual genotyping costs go down and knowledge of genomics grows.

&gt;Potential consumers will be able to evaluate not only whether or not a gamete provider has brown eyes, is tall or short, has a professional degree, but also whether the donor has the appropriate MHC genotypes, long or short androgen receptors, the desired dopamine receptor types, and so on. The list of criteria and the sophistication of algorithms matching consumers and donors will grow at an
increasing rate in the next decade.

The essay was written by Henry Harpending, Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the University of Utah.

From an August 12, 2009 [article](http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2009/08/12/ivy-league-women-get-offers-for-their-eggs/) on CNN.com titled ""Ivy League Women Get Offers for Their Eggs"":

&gt;In 1999, a California-based company, A Perfect Match, placed a $50,000 advertisement [i.e., an offer of $50K in exchange for each egg] in *The Crimson*, Harvard's college newspaper. In 2007, Elite Donors ran a $100,000 advertisement in *The Crimson* as well, according to the paper's staff. More recently, similar agencies have taken advantage of Facebook advertising, which allows solicitors to target females attending specific colleges.

From a September 5, 2011 [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/06/health/06donor.html) in *The New York Times*:

&gt;Cynthia Daily and her partner used a sperm donor to conceive a baby seven years ago, and they hoped that one day their son would get to know some of his half siblings  an extended family of sorts for modern times.

&gt;So Ms. Daily searched a Web-based registry for other children fathered by the same donor and helped to create an online group to track them.

&gt;. . . Today there are 150 children, all conceived with sperm from one donor, in this group of half siblings, and more are on the way. 

&gt;. . . As more women choose to have babies on their own, and the number of children born through [artificial insemination](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/artificialinsemination/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier) increases, outsize groups of donor siblings are starting to appear. While Ms. Daily's group is among the largest, many others comprising 50 or more half siblings are cropping up . . .

394,2016-2-5,2016,2,5,1,4463z2,Refuting Google X chief's anti-space colonization essay in Quartz.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4463z2/refuting_google_x_chiefs_antispace_colonization/,KubrickIsMyCopilot,1454604802,"The ironically-named Astro Teller, head of Google's research arm ""Google X,"" along with his wife, physician and researcher Danielle Teller, published an essay in Quartz arguing that humankind basically has no future in space.  The essay, provocatively titled [It's completely ridiculous to think that humans can live on Mars](http://qz.com/536483/why-its-compeltely-ridiculous-to-think-that-humans-could-live-on-mars/), is just aching for a rebuttal.  

If you can stomach all the myopic fallacies, I would urge reading that essay before continuing with this (lengthy, I apologize) post disputing it.  This will take the form of addressing the arguments made in the essay point-by-point, utilizing relevant quotes:

* *""Even after weve made the Earth too hot and polluted for humans, it still wont be as bad as Mars.""*

If the purpose of human expansion were to only look for and settle places that are *already* naturally more inviting and hospitable than where we already live, humans wouldn't even occupy the places we already do.  

It would seem senseless by this ""logic"" to have migrated from the tropics, where food grows year-round and water is abundant, to mid- and upper-latitude geographies where food only grows a fraction of the year or water may be scarcer.  And yet look at the benefits that have arisen from doing so.

* *""Our daughter has a good point about escaping man-made disaster on Earth by colonizing Mars, though. It doesnt make a lot of sense.""*

Here the Tellers pretend the main argument for space colonization is to *escape* Earth rather than add to it.  This is pure straw-man.  

While self-sustaining space colonies may indeed serve as a backup in case Earth experienced extinction-level cataclysm, there are also scenarios in between: Ones where it serves as an economic and political backup to middle-case disasters, in the same way that the Western hemisphere saved Europe from the poverty of post-WW2 ruin with the Marshall Plan.

* *""Mars has almost no surface water""*

And if the concept of drilling wells were absurd blue-sky science fiction, that would be a huge problem.  But since it's utterly trivial...

* *""a toxic atmosphere that is too thin for humans to survive without pressure suits""*

OMG, pressure suits!  You mean people would have to wear more stuff to survive outside than they do on Earth?!  That's, like, uncomfortable, and thus clearly impossible.  And it's *totally unimaginable* that pressure suit technology and design would improve over time to become more comfortable and practical, since who ever heard of technology getting better?

One can imagine a prehistoric tropical person hearing that they would have to wear animal furs to survive the harsh winters Northward and deciding Europe is simply uninhabitable.

* *""deadly solar radiation""*

Another case where the Teller essay basically says ""OMG, you mean that we would have to use common sense and *technology* to live?!  That's un-possible!""  

First of all, half the time you're facing away from the Sun and have the entire bulk of Mars between you and the Sun, so *no* radiation from the Sun reaching you at all.  

Secondly, most structures in the early history of Mars settlement would be dug into the ground or made out of the native stone and regolith.  In the first case (underground structures) there's no problem at all for the majority of your day when you're indoors, and in the latter case you just have to make walls and ceilings thicker than is structurally necessary - which is a trivial problem.  

The only real challenges with radiation are the precautions needed for daytime travel, and it's not hard to imagine feasible solutions (seriously, just try for a few *seconds* and you'll think of some).  Which ones are ultimately the best wold just depend on relative cost and convenience, just like any other engineering problem.    

We begin to see how the essay treats straightforward engineering challenges with well-known parameters as if they were insurmountable problems totally beyond human capability.  The result is comically hysterical.

* *""temperatures lower than Antarctica""*  

But far less extreme wind chill due to the low pressure, meaning the heat generated in your habitats and vehicles is much-better insulated.  Not to mention how well-insulated facilities will be with external walls made of stone and regolith, as mentioned before with respect to radiation.  In other words, not only not a real objection, but actually less severe than some terrestrial environments.

* *""and few to none of the natural resources that have been critical to human success on Earth.""*

Except water.  And oyxgen from water and from the oxides in the soil (that give it its reddish color).  And carbon and more oxygen from the CO2 in the atmosphere.  And modest amounts of energy from the relatively dim but usually unobstructed sunlight.  And about 40% of Earth surface gravity, which makes some things easier than on Earth and a *lot* easier than in weightless space.  And *all* of the mineral and metal resources we have on Earth, albeit in somewhat different surface abundances.  But yeah, other than that, Mars has *nothing at all*.

* *""Smart people have proposed solutions for those pesky environmental issues, some of which are seriously sci-fi, like melting the polar ice caps with nuclear bombs.""*

Massive straw-man alert.  This remark refers to something Elon Musk said - after much prodding from Stephen Colbert - could be a long-term approach to *terraforming* Mars in the distant future, not a prerequisite to surviving on it at all.

The Doctors Teller would presumably go back in time to the 17th century and argue pilgrims out of moving to the Americas because it would be impractical for *them* to build the transcontinental railroad and highway networks that their distant descendents would create.

* *""First, we live on a planet that is perfect for us""*

(Desperately suppressing gales of laughter).  Right, perfect - except we had to spend tens of thousands of years developing the means to survive outside the tropics; thousands of years more evolving the means to guard against regular mass-starvations; and may have [nearly went extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory#Genetic_bottleneck_theory) 70,000 years ago because of the climatic effects of a single volcano.  Not to mention the occasional mass-deaths from storms, floods, and earthquakes that periodically punctuate our time on this ""perfect planet.""

* *""Proponents of Mars colonization talk about terraforming Mars to make it more like Earth, but in the meantime, were marsforming Earth by making our atmosphere poisonous and annihilating our natural resources.""*

Both a false dilemma and a contradiction of their own earlier strawman about terrestrial catastrophe.  On the one hand they insist space colonization can't save Earth, and on the other say we can't save Earth anyway - the only natural conclusion being that we are doomed and should all just stop trying.  It's really hard to understand how people with credentials like that could have written *this* nonsense.

Experience managing in harder environments makes it *easier* to survive in more hospitable ones, because you have a broader base of understanding and a larger scope of applicable technology.  Solar panels were not invented by societies that never left the domain of abundant sunlight.  Irrigation was not invented by societies that never wanted for rainfall.  These were developed by cultures that *didn't* have perfect relationships to their environment, and the benefits of those technologies have proven (and continue to prove) nearly universal.

* (Arguing against the practicality of heating up Mars): *""On the other hand, the atmosphere of Mars is already 95% carbon dioxide""*

Yes, at 1% of Earth sea level pressure, and with few if any known active surface processes generating heat for that CO2 to trap.  A terraforming program would create heating processes as well as trying to build up the atmospheric pressure.  

But the Tellers are again trying to change the subject to terraforming rather than colonization in general, treating as given their own straw-man that terraformation is necessary for humans to settle Mars and therefore Mars cannot be settled because of their (totally false and illogical) arguments that terraforming can't be done.

* *""humans have raised carbon dioxide levels by a paltry 0.01% on Earth.""*

The Tellers again step on their own toes: By their own admission, the planet's temperature is being raised substantially by these ""paltry"" greenhouse gas emissions, which they describe in apocalyptic terms.  Yet when the subject is Mars - a planet that lives in a multbillion-year deep freeze - they act as if active attempts to raise its temperature would be trivial rather than explosively destabilizing in exactly the direction desired.  Their essay is simply a mess of contradictions, fallacies, and inexplicable scientific illiteracy.

* *""A second problem presented by human nature is that we dont enjoy prolonged periods of extreme duress, and we dont function particularly well under those conditions.""*

Which is why we develop technology to make them less uncomfortable over time - technology that eventually leaps so far ahead of the status quo in more hospitable areas that it changes civilization as a whole.  

The essay goes on to cite Antarctica as an example of how people won't choose to live somewhere uncomfortable, except for one minor problem - there's an international treaty **explicitly banning** colonization of Antarctica.  

The signatories knew for a fact that it would be colonized otherwise, and didn't want there to be a destabilizing colonial competition between the US and Soviet Union for it during the Cold War.  Plus most of Antarctica's mineral and likely petroleum resources are buried under a kilometer of ice, requiring considerable effort to reach even by people and facilities already in place, whereas the vast majority of the Martian surface is directly accessible.

There are no blizzards on Mars, and no snow blanketing the ground.  The wind isn't thick enough to quickly sap the warmth from your habitat, let alone blow it or you over or bury you under anything - all of which happens in frigid terrestrial climates.  A ""dust storm"" on Mars is a slow thickening of smoke-like haze, not the violent sand-blast depicted in The Martian movie.  The Tellers appear to simply not know what they're talking about.  
  
* *""Scientists who work at Antarctic bases suffer from a mental health disorder called Winter-Over syndrome""*

First of all, *scientists* usually don't stay at Antarctic bases during the winter - that's mostly contract crews hired to simply keep the facilities functioning.  Secondly, that condition is caused by being at a polar latitude with months of darkness and cabin fever from constant blizzards, not the mere cold.  Thirdly, because their tasks are individual and relatively simple, they tend not to form tight-knit groups, and thus become isolated and aimless, lacking the sense of high purpose that astronauts and explorers in groups tend to form.

* *""It is extraordinarily expensive to ship goods to Mars""*

It's extraordinarily expensive *now*, because rockets are expendable.  And because there's no such thing as time or technological progress, as the essay has implied several times before, that will of course always be the case. /s  

There are several deep-pocketed businesses pursuing cheap reusable rocketry, and one of them (SpaceX) publicly states its raison d'etre as enabling human colonization of Mars.  These companies have multi-billion dollar contracts with NASA, with the Pentagon, and with bigger, more traditional aerospace companies, so apparently they know something about what they do.    It's sort of absurd seeing a guy who does software R&amp;D for an advertising analytics company dismissing the basic competence of rocket engineers who flown to and *landed things from* space.

* *""Mars has nothing to offer in return.""*

Lack of a *commodity* for export is not the same thing as providing no return.  Let's say a number of people want to settle on Mars just because they believe in the idea and want to start new civilizations, and some other number want to experience it temporarily as adventurers and explorers.  Transporting those people to (and from) Mars and the raw technologies to enable them is a business.

Building things on Mars to support those people is a business.  Selling junk from Mars as souvenirs on Earth is a business.  Technologies that have to be built on Earth for export because they're too expensive and complex to build on Mars are a business.  

Services to maintain things on Mars are an entire ecosystem of businesses.  Mining on Mars to support the economy *on Mars* is a business.  Selling equipment from Earth to those businesses is a business, and eventually the Martian mining business would be able to sell innovations back.  On and on, across all possible industries.  

And this sort of mutually beneficial feedback, even if it doesn't involve *commodity* exchange, would result in a growing economy and more people going to Mars over time.  *Especially* if some group of people do things right politically and build a society that is inspiring well beyond the economic level.

* *""We havent even colonized the Sahara desert, the bottom of the oceans or the moon, because it makes no economic sense.""*

We haven't colonized the Sahara desert because it's owned by poor, dysfunctional states, whereas we absolutely have colonized the deserts of the US Southwest.  

We haven't colonized the oceans because they're on the same planet, and thus none of the arguments for and advantages of colonizing another planet apply to it.  Also because utilizing underwater resources (i.e., mining and refining metal ores, making steel, and building new structures) to expand the habitat would be environmentally disastrous and even more complex than working on another planet.  The only planet that would have operational similarities to trying to colonize the ocean floor would be Venus, and not many people are advocating that for the foreseeable future.

As for the Moon, we *are* probably going to colonize that simultaneous with Mars, even though it has far fewer prospects due to far less water, no air, and much lower surface gravity.  But it's close to Earth, so it's convenient.  It just hasn't happened yet because of the expensive rocketry mentioned earlier.

* *""It would be far, far easier and cheaper to terraform the deserts on our own planet than to terraform Mars. Yet we cant afford it.""*

We can so afford it!  It's just not *politically* practical because the Sahara is full of Islamic militias and corrupt, dysfunctional governments.  And we've *already done it* in much of the US Southwest.  Southern California went from its natural state of *this*:

* *""But a colony on Mars would need to be a nearly perfectly self-contained, resource neutral system that harvests energy from the sun and is rarely or never re-supplied.""*

This is is simply false.  A free-floating space habitat would indeed need to be an ecologically closed loop, but Mars is a planet with vast resources across its entire surface and a nontrivial atmosphere.  It has water, it has minerals and metals, and it's capable of supporting a far thicker atmosphere than it currently has.  

As long as you have sufficient energy (which could be supplemented in the beginning with nuclear), there's not much else you need to add from outside other than small numbers of high-tech manufactured products.  Gases, water, metals and minerals, and non-trivial sunlight to give at least some portion of power are all locally available - it's got the vast majority of what's needed.

In conclusion, from beginning to end, the Teller essay is trivial naysaying.  Their rationale could just as easily explain why you shouldn't move from Florida to New Hampshire (""But...but...but...you'd have to wear more clothes, and sometimes you couldn't go outside, and you'd have to heat your house, and how can a person possibly live without Cuban restaurants...)  The result is unintentionally comical.",12,40

I still remember when Petronas Towers were the highest buildings in the world still in 2004 with 451m and I was 16 at a time and thought we will never see those really futuristic, super high towers. Especially if we take into account the fact that Empire State Building with its 381m was built in 1931, so from 1931 to 2004 we saw increase in size of about 70m.

And then the sudden explosion... Taipei 101 and Burj Khalifa, but not only that but all the 400m + buildings and now already 600m+ buildings that are being built and Kingdom Tower which will be 1 km. 

So I wonder, was there some technological breakthrough that buildings started to rise up, or it's just China and Middle East rising and asserting their wealth and dominance in architecture that is behind this phenomenon?

What recently has also surprised me is renewable energy, by all indication it will just continue to gain momentum, wind and solar power. Just 10 years ago there were so many naysayers (and there are many even now, though at that time they really had the point because added renewable capacity each year was really tiny). But now, of course it's still a long way to replace fossil fuels in total energy output, especially in large countries, but new added capacity is staggering and rising each year, which just stresses that now it's a question of how fast, not the question of if or when.",57,24

I'm a bit confused on this portion of the topic. I understand from reviewing recent journals that diseases associated with aging such as Alzheimer's or Type II diabetes are the things we are tackling first. But after reading the article linking senescent cells and overall impacts on aging, I'm wondering if this can mean that someone who will be 39 in the next two decades will look 22 due to (hopefully) the technology that would be available then?

TLDR: Will anti-aging technology generally impact appearance? Or will it target certain problems such as those mentioned above or some common things like arthritis?  

Sorry meant Anti-aging in the title. Apologies for any confusions.

I have an intense interest in 3 and IMO they are not putting enough emphasise on one of them  for my selfish interest and their longer term business interest. These projects are:

AI development. They have hired AI hotshots, regularly make advances and are prioritising this. Cant fault them there.

Driverless vehicles. They are making progress and their product appears good. They are waging battles on the bureaucratic front and seem to be making progress. Cant fault them there.

Project Loon. It is a project to bring internet connectivity to 3rd world countries via balloons. It is innovative and cheap compared to miles of copper or fibre. I am interested because this would allow connectivity for my countries 3rd world rural population (Im South African). It is also (IMO) in googles interest to spread the internet to make their products more valuable and sought after. Its not a traditional scarcity business model giving value. Its like the telephone  the more people connected the more valuable. A telephone system with only a few connected is not valuable. This could be a very big deal for Alphabet. Project Loon I feel is not getting enough attention, funding or talent.

One thing I have been thinking about a lot lately is an implant that will offer it's user helpful bits of information to improve their day-to-day based off live analysis. This could be delivered through an app on your phone.

Some examples I can think of:

* if I was becoming dehydrated, I might get a notification like, ""Looks like you need a drink. Suggest you get one within the next 15 minutes"".

* if I had low blood sugar, ""Are you feeling flat or hungry? You've got low blood sugar. You might want to eat something.""

* if my core temperature is rising, I might get a notification like, ""Hey - your core temperate is above average. If you aren't exercising right now, something might be up.""

* if my heart rate has been high for a few days, ""I've noticed your heart rates been consistently higher than usual. Are you alright?""

The list goes on. I'm not looking for something highly complex, just small, useful pieces of information which will help guide me to taking better care of myself. 

The implant would learn your daily rhythms and notify it's user of irregularities. Help alert you before you get a cold that you might be getting sick. It could also be stored and used when you visit a doctor. Imagine no more blood tests because your implant gathered all that information on the fly?

Does anyone else look forward to something like this? I wonder how far away it might be.",43,73

In recent years, LED streetlighting has become widely adopted by local authorities across the United Kingdom, with the following streetlights used:

- WRTL Mini Luma [Warrington council, Salford City council, Liverpool City Council] - mainly used as side-road lighting on 4m high posts. [Image of one](http://images.philips.com/is/image/PhilipsConsumer/FP912300025553-RTP-global-001?hei=700&amp;$jpglarge$)

- Hardie Night Sight 90 watts [Liverpool City Council]. [In this image it's on a 4m post - first streetlight in picture](http://www.lighting-gallery.net/gallery/albums/userpics/10515/normal_LPL-LED-1.jpg)

These are mentioned for relevance, not product placement. I have no affiliation with any firms mentioned in this discussion.

Currently, here in the United Kingdom, streetlights are at heights of 4m [13ft] or 6m [19ft] with 4m used for side-streets, 6m for main roads and housing estates.

However, in a future where driverless cars are common and automation possibly replaces some jobs, will we need streetlights, or will they look different to what they are today?

I know a bit about this due to being a roadgeek.

Anyway, do you think that the design will change possibly, I know we have retro Victorian-style streetlights in London and some parts of the United Kingdom, but will a different style of lighting emerge, e.g. LEDs on walls and no need for streetlights on posts of different designs as we know them today, e.g. octagonal posts as used by Wigan, Gloucester, Liverpool, Luton authorities.

What do you think the future could be in this area?",23,8

I predict that by 2026, VR and AR technologies would have completely overtaken most major current tech markets, such as TVs, PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, video game consoles, etc. Smartglasses and other AR technologies will be as commonplace as smartphones and laptops are today and most people will no longer own the latter. 4K, 8K and OLED technologies will be standard features of nearly all electronic displays and newer screen technologies such as volumetric displays, holography and telepresence might be on the market at this time although they will still be quite expensive and not yet mainstream. However, AR and VR technologies would have disrupted so many markets by now that volumetric displays and holographic displays will be mostly marketed towards businesses so that they could be used as signs for advertisements and the like.

IoT (or whatever it will be called in 2026) will be a concept that is now understood by most of the general public and its importance will be recognized. IoT technologies will become embedded in the fabric of everyday living and will make the Internet seem to disappear as it becomes so ubiquitous that people will, no longer think about going online, they just are. IoT and cognitive computing has started to change the world in so many different ways, such as how the World Wide Web changed the world after its conception. 3D printers will have matured enough so that they are now relatively inexpensive and useful for the average consumer. By now, 3DPs might actually become a common household product that could be in nearly a quarter of homes across the developed world and in many businesses and factories. 

Drone delivery services will exist in most cities by now as the technology has advanced enough to avoid almost all obstacles and the FAA has finally introduced new regulations in regards to drones. Fully automated vehicles will exist by now and youll occasionally see them on the roads with the newest models along with many partially automated vehicles. Fully automated aircraft will most likely also exist by now as well. Automation technology in general has taken over a sizeable portion of basic rote jobs such as delivery services, driving (taxis, freight, etc.), janitors, chefs, fast food employees, dishwashers, etc. Along with automation, household robots will have progressed quite significantly and there will be an entire thriving market of new appliances based on these technologies. Legitimate hoverboards and automated skycars might actually be on the market too but they will certainly be expensive and not something that the average consumer could afford.

So what else do you guys think will happen to the tech landscape by 2026? Any thoughts?",5,0

818,2016-2-10,2016,2,10,2,44xmv7,A Major Milestone Toward Brain Preservation as Life Extension Achieved!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/44xmv7/a_major_milestone_toward_brain_preservation_as/,Michael-Cerullo,1455037419,"     A team at 21st Century Medicine (http://www.21cm.com/), led by Robert McIntyre, has won Small Mammal Brain Preservation Prize, which carries an award of $26,735 (http://www.brainpreservation.org/small-mammalannouncement). The Small Mammalian Brain Preservation Prize was awarded after the determination that the protocol developed by McIntyre, termed Aldehyde-Stabilized Cryopreservation (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001122401500245X?np=y), was able to preserve an entire rabbit brain with well-preserved ultrastructure, including cell membranes, synapses, and intracellular structures such as synaptic vesicles. This is a milestone in the development of brain preservation techniques: it is the first time that the preservation of the connectome has been demonstrated in a whole brain (prior to this only small parts of brains have been preserved to this level of detail). Current models of the brain suggest that the connectome contains all the information necessary for personal identity (i.e. memory and personality). This technique is not the same as conventional cryonics (rapidly freezing the brain) which has never demonstrated preservation of the ultrastructure of the brain. Thus the winning of this prize represents a significant advance in the methods available for large scale studies of the connectome and could lead to procedures that preserve a complete human brain. 
     Proponents of cryonics have long sought a technique that could put terminal patients into long term stasis, the goal being a form of medical time travel in which patients are stabilized against decay with the hope of being biologically revived and cured by future technologies. Despite decades of research, this goal of reversible cryopreservation remains far out of reach 
too much damage occurs during the cryopreservation itself. This has led a new generation of researchers to focus on a more achievable and demonstrable goal preservation of brain structure
only. Specifically, preservation of the delicate pattern of synaptic connections (the connectome) which neuroscience contends encodes a persons memory and identity. Instead of biological revival, these new researchers often envision a future synthetic revival comprising nanometerscale scanning of the preserved brain to serve as the basis for mind uploading.
     This shift in focus toward synthetic revival has completely transformed the cryonics debate, opening up new avenues of research and bringing it squarely within the purview of
todays scientific investigation. Hundreds of neuroscience papers have detailed how memory and personality are encoded structurally in synaptic connections, and recent advances in connectome imaging and brain simulation can be seen as a preview of the synthetic revival technologies to
come. Until now, the crucial unanswered questions were How well does cryonics preserve the brains connectome? and Are there alternatives/modifications to cryonics that might preserve
the connectome better and in a manner that could be demonstrated today? The Brain Preservation Prize was put forward in 2010 to spur research that could definitively answer these questions. Now, five years later, these questions have been answered: Traditional cryonics procedures were not able to demonstrate (to the BPFs satisfaction) preservation of the
connectome, but the newly invented Aldehyde Stabilized Cryopreservation technique was.
     The key breakthrough was the rapid perfusion of a deadly chemical fixative (glutaraldehyde) through the brains vascular system, instantly stopping metabolic decay and fixing all proteins in place by covalent crosslinks. This stabilized the tissue and vasculature so that cryoprotectant could be perfused at an optimal temperature and rate. The result was an intact rabbit brain filled with such a high concentration of cryoprotectants that it could be stored as a solid vitrified block at a temperature of 135 degrees Celsius. The inclusion of a deadly fixative has already been criticized by some in the traditional cryonics community, but according to the scientific publication its use was crucial to the results obtained. This result directly answers what has for decades been the main skeptical and scientific criticism against cryonics that it does not provably preserve the delicate synaptic circuitry of the brain. As such, this research sets the stage for renewed interest within the scientific community, and offers a potential challenge to medical researchers to develop a human surgical procedure based on these successful animal experiments.
     The Brain Preservation Foundation plans to continue to promote the idea that brain preservation following legal death, by using scientifically validated techniques, is a reasonable choice for consenting individuals to make. Focus now shifts to the final Large Mammal phase of the contest which requires an intact pig brain to be preserved with similar fidelity in a manner that could be directly adapted to terminal patients in a hospital setting. The 21st Century Medicine team has recently submitted to the BPF such a preserved pig brain for official evaluation. Lead researcher Robert McIntyre has started Nectome (https://www.nectome.com ) to further develop this method.

* The reality we all encounter together (the universe, science)

* The created world, the irreality, thats reflective of the ideas we craft to cope in that reality (stories, culture, traditions, games)

* And the realm of the abstract where our unanswerable questions lie, the supereality (philosophy, religion)

then do you see it when one face of existence violates the other?


I can draw you a map for some of the ways that the created world affects reality, and I say that facetiously, because thats literally what a map shows: a world shattered with imaginary cracks that should be drawn so that infrastructure utilizes the environment to most efficiently develop human economy, but merge that power with the force of law, blurring the line between what is law of the rights of humanity and simple regulations, rules for playing the economic game.


Ive seen worlds that use borders as I describe, allowing my favorite world to have three universal forms of currency:

* a currency for exchange (and a standard for comparison),

* competing reserve currencies for investment funds and large fortunes

* and paid currency tied to the political faction you subscribe to, so the libertarian gets more of the exchange currency but pays higher costs than a socialist, whose currency reflects whats already paid to community services. It also compels the rich to divide their fortune into investment and their income for living, highlighting extravagant lifestyles (reserve currency must be converted to paid currency before exchange)


But this idea comes from the earth where the descendants of Alexandros united the globe, so they werent threatened when the people actually determine their economic fate. I mention it only to highlight the constraints of this world hereand to tell you who I am.


I am brought to you through the internet from that world I described, to tell you of the alternatives you face in the climax of history. There comes a time when the power of generations accumulates enough that its used to either destroy everything or to make life &amp; the world beautiful enough that conflict is an aberration, not the norm!


And in every world that succeeds and survives, *one thing is universal*: 
&gt; The method for solving problems isnt controlled by the groups who profit from maintaining problemsnot the people who are given the power of violence to face crime and war, nor those who profit off scarce energy, food, medicine and other resources, not even the ones who deal with the deep, existential problems from the world Beyond


The word Academe represents the collection of people who work for solutions, even those not currently participating in education (but who definitely benefit from it), and the freedom and unity of earths Academe might be humanitys goal (as it should be), were it not for the paradox that this universally and systematically beneficial goal threatens the self-worth of the people who currently control it.


In functioning worlds, learning is duty, and education is civic privilege for improving society. What you have pretends to be that while training the public how to earn points for someone else to pretend that score means their life is worth more than all the others who helped earn it for them, in a funny parody of civilization were it not for all the misery.


Make no mistake, the threshold for excuses passed as humanity stepped into the technology to feed, clothe and house everyone, but instead strive to contrive new wars with more powerful weapons, to ensure there is some hell-on-earth to remind others they live closer to heaven.


Seeing whats reality and whats a game, youll see the story of human choices, or youll pretend the choice to believe there is no choice is somehow no choice at allas if the game itself were alive with a will of its own, not the tangled web of human choices it is. And that is your decision.


Im only allowed limited time here, but the person of this world who brought me here is u/Summane, who can return if theres any response or questions. Hes taking a different approach, being more personal about it, but Im afraid hes only subconsciously working to justify his isolation.


In any case, good luck in this world. You certainly need it, right?

Now, elsewhere, I had a lot of discussion with others whether it is possible to reach AGI even when things are not going well, and they said if the current system breaks down AGI can't be reached.

I personally do not think a lot of resources are needed to reach AGI - just enough food (and some filet mignon, lobster and booze) to feed maybe 2,000 of the world's AI experts, plus the energy to run maybe 100,000 computers and a few supercomputers. Because of tech advances we do not need eniacs any more and the power used by the supercomputers can be generated from little fuel.

Konrad Zuse created the first computer when the allies were bombing Germany, and many innovations were made with seemingly little resources and a lot of deprivations.

Will the resources to run a city of 100,000 people be sufficient to reach AGI? I don't think we need a Texas to reach there... ",8,7

What jobs are actually left?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/458ost/are_future_students_of_higher_education_toast/,sahm_adams,1455196379,"We can all agree that there are way too many degrees being handed out. The value of a degree isn't what it used to be. 

Students are going into massive debt just to obtain these degrees so they can get a job, but this will be less realistic in the future. 

Rising tuition costs will easily lead to some college shutting down and students ruining their whole lives. 

What careers are actually left that are lucrative? The future looks bleak and here are some issues:

* Lawyers are screwed. Too many of them out there and not enough jobs. Not to mention the debt. Law schools are hiring their grads to improve their employment upon graduate rate in order to salvage what is left of the schools reputation.

* Pharmacy is oversaturated as well. Most of these jobs will be automated in the future and a warehouse delivery system of medicine will replace these positions. Pharmacy is no longer lucrative, even if you are looking for jobs in rural areas. Debt is also an issue.

* Dentists... Most cities I go to nowadays and even suburbs have dentist offices around every damn corner. The debt from student loans and practice startup costs alone are crushing, but so is the fact that there is an oversaturation of qualified dentists that each dentist will have to compete against. 

* Doctors. Now these guys are still in demand, but you are slowly going to see GPs being replaced by nurse practitioners and nurses. There's a fucking machine out there that can predict breast cancer with better accuracy than 3 oncologists combined. This is very scary because all the years of hard work that doctors put into their profession can easily be replaced by a machine.

* CS. Very hot right now, very lucrative, but Silicon Valley is getting ready to bust. Too many startups for products/services that won't actually pay out. When's the last time someone actually bought an iphone/android app? Look at stuff like squarespace replacing the need to be skilled in order to create a website. The bust is coming soon.

* Engineering. Can't comment on this too much, but I can see this still being in demand.

* Business majors/MBAs. Anything these guys do can be automated in the future, they are already a dime a dozen. 

* Starting your own business?? Pshh, good luck, most ideas have already been taken and profited from. There's nothing left. Not to mention that landlords are always out to screw you over and never there for your best interest, if you have an actual location.

* Liberal arts major? You're screwed.

* Age discrimination. If you are old and you lose your job, you are very fucked. My aunt and uncle own a business and they are about to lose it. What are they going to do when they lose the business? Break their backs working minimum wage until they die? 

* Masters/PhDs. In some cases, these make you overqualified. I think I heard that trying to make it as a researcher is like trying to be a famous singer or make it into the NFL. These guys are screwed. 

* Psych isn't that lucrative, but I feel like it will still be in demand due to the human aspect.

* The trades are still lucrative

* Also, what happens when fast food and retail is automated? The average man can't make money to survive. And what happens when no one consumes because they have no money to spend? The businesses that own the technology that automates everything will go out of business. This will essentially collapse the economy.

* I know Musk is pushing for driverless cars as well as Google, but come on, this will tank the auto industry and the insurance industry

What's the solution? I don't fucking know, I feel like I'm the only one who cares about this stuff. No one ever talks about this subject, it's the elephant in the room.

edit:

The reason I posted this is because my little brother is about to go to high school next year. He doesn't know what he wants to do, but I don't have the heart to tell him that most jobs won't be there by the time he graduates or that the economy will probably collapse by then.

&amp;nbsp;

I believe mostly everyone here reading this to be, as I am, an amateur futorologist, tech and science lover. 

I'm the kind of guy always in the search for the latest and greatest. To the point of basically studying technology and innovation itself.
&amp;nbsp;

I've always had the Hobby of creating different products, services and businesses in my head, but I've never actually been able to turn something into reality, unfortunately...
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Now, here comes the problem:
&amp;nbsp;

Recently, I've had an idea which I believe has the potential to be the turning point of an entire era.
It's just the concept for the design describing the actual products with technolgies I'm aware already exist, how they work and how they can be implemented, so it seems 100% possible to make it real. 
&amp;nbsp;

I can't actually create a blue print or the plans for it myself, but I already have more than enough that someone who can do that already has enough material to create it.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I won't go too deep into details about the ""Product"", as I still keep it a bit as a secret, so I'll just speak a few without actually telling too much, but enough to give an idea of the possibilities...
&amp;nbsp;

_____________________________________________________________________________
-It's kind of a joke but still very true: ""While looking from a distance, all you see is a DOT"".
&amp;nbsp;

-You can use it as your home, it can replace your whole room. I just haven't quite figured out how to put a shower, a kitchen and room for a printer, yet.
&amp;nbsp;

-It can be used as a vehicle and replaces your car as well. And it's autonomous.
&amp;nbsp;

-You can have a visitor inside, but at first, I'd say only 2 people is the limit, or at least I think it'd be crowded with more than one.
&amp;nbsp;

-You can use it to play games in a way you never thought you would in your lifetime.
&amp;nbsp;

-It's modular, so you can customize and upgrade every part of every version.
&amp;nbsp;

-It substitutes your smartphone and changes fashion itself by adding ""more"".
&amp;nbsp;

-It protects its passenger to it's very limits.
&amp;nbsp;

-Every time I've thought about people using it or even using it myself, it seems like it could actually change the way human beings live in so many ways that, by itself alone, it can cause the actual change of an era.
_____________________________________________________________________________
&amp;nbsp;

All I wish for and all I've been thinking for a while now I how much I want this to come true.
&amp;nbsp;

I've been thinking of a method for a while and recently I think I had a good idea, but I need SERIOUS amounts of help...
Lots of work, research and some very specific technologies will be needed and it's definitely a moonshot, but with everything I've seen and that I know so far, I know it to be possible and maybe even completable in 5 to 10 years at most, or so I belive.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
I have a ""Project"" designed to use Crowd-Sourcing and Crowd-Funding to make it come true as OpenSource, but it is not that easy and I will also need YOUR help.

The idea is that anyone who wants to help and is able to, with credits registering anyone that ever helped, how much and with what. 
&amp;nbsp;

All Development is to be registered in real time at a website created solely for the sharing of any information related to this project.
&amp;nbsp;

The project's objectives are simple:
&amp;nbsp;

1: Create, Sell at the lowest price possible and Distribute the product's versions, further developing it and all of it's parts indefinitely as open source so every owner can personalize their own version and anyone can sell a part or a full version of it they've made themselves as long as it fits all the safety protocols and specifications. 
(Information about the product will only be provided openly later.)
&amp;nbsp;

2: Make the product's manufacturing and delivering process get to the price of $0 or as close to it as possible to it, allowing for the poorest of the human beings to be able to receive one for free, but selling it for the cheapest price possible before it converting all the money got from the sales back into the project's funding.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Anyone that wishes to get a blueprint and the designs to build their own unit themselves has to register themselves. 

During registry, it is also asked for the person to register any modifications or new pieces they might come up with to the database.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Crowd-Funding is used to pay for anything that's needed with all the records of the how much was received, spent, is or might be need in the future.

Every information available to public and updated in real-time to the website previously mentioned.

If at any moment the total ammount of money donated by someone through Crowd-Funding overpasses the price of a unit of the product, that person will be entitled one at that very moment.

That also ensures that if the price ever gets lower by itself through the process of the project, even if the person doesn't donate for a while or only donated once, even so he will also receive it.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

After the first version of the product is released monthly lotteries will be made to award one or more units.
&amp;nbsp;

Tickets are awarded for:
Every $1 donated to the Crowd-Funding awards 1 ticket.
Any time someone shows the product or inserts it in their story, video, movie or any way of media, each person involved gets 1 ticket and the company is a awarded a special ticket. 
&amp;nbsp;

Special tickets for companies are available and work in the following manner:

-Staff from a company can register their company when they donate to the Crowd-Funding, for every 100 tickets in the name of a company, one ""Company Ticket""(CT) is created.
&amp;nbsp;

-If, for example, a TV station displays the product as part of a comercial, an episode, a movie or such, each actor, staff and crew involved, the owner of the company and anyone else involved with the showing also recieves 1 ticket BUT the company itself also gets a ""CT"".
&amp;nbsp;

-If a Company is victorious in the lottery, it is remade but only with the tickets associated to that company, so only someone that works or worked for that company and posses a ticket associated to it can win. You can win through a certain company even if you don't work for it anymore as long as the winning ticket was associated to it while hired.
&amp;nbsp;

Tickets are cumulative and never expire, always running for the next lottery until victory or the end of the lotteries. 
Only people that don't yet posses at least one unit or lost their previously owned unit for any reason can run for this lottery. 
More than one units can be offered at times but each person will only win one, making sure that two units are never awarded to the same person even by different tickets.

The amount of tickets each person will also determine the order each person will receive a unit if and when it ever reaches the price of $0.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I want to further develop this project and the product itself so that every human can posses one and everyone might help to make it real, or so is my wish.
&amp;nbsp;

Please, Help me.",5,0

However, do we really need AGI to reach a point of no return? I do not think so myself.

I personally think that even with what we have got now, we have the hardware to reach a point of no return. 

A 'soft AI' is definitely doable at this point of time, and while it is not the 'jackpot', it keeps humanity, or at least the connected ones, beyond the reach of anything else.

The developments of agriculture, writing , scientific revolution and industrial rev were Singularities of the day in my opinion, and I think that once the point of no return (which could be defined more thoroughly by experts) is reached, it is enough to be called singularity although it may not be exactly AGI.

Right now more than 25% of all jobs could be automated if there is a motivation. Soon it will be more than 50%, and probably 75% in near future.

I think that's singularity enough for me.",30,10

In general there seem to be 3 problems with it: technical safety issues, cost , and political/social risks. 

For the technical safety issues and cost - there are few startups, claiming they can solve most of the issues including working with non weapons-grade materials, (maybe with the exception of storage of highly radioactive, but non weapon-grade waste  for some few hundred years) .Let's assume for a moment that is true. 

But that leaves social/political risks - political instability, corruption, theft,  mismanagement , etc - over long periods of time, i.e. centuries. 

For example , after the fall of USSR , there was a big risk of theft nuclear materials(and even before) which could have easily turned to be huge global problem if fallen into the wrong hands. Who knows , we still aren't certain nothing isn't missing. 

And in addition , all those nuclear scientists , trained in Moscow , who went to work in various countries around the world, to spread nuclear weapons, say north korea - which definitely increased global risk.  

And who knows what will happen in a century. 

On the other hand , solar/wind/etc could do the job pretty well, and at much less risk.

 So is it wise to invest in nuclear ? ",22,3

It seems to me that most technology is not taking into account the fact that the economy has been politicized over the past 20-30 years and the 1% has got richer whilst everyone else is struggling.

For example, even though there is new technology to make building good quality homes, cheap and relatively quick to built, most politicians do not want new homes to be built because scarcity of housing not only pushes up prices, making those who already own housing assets richer and more likely to vote for politicians who espouse such policies but also ensures compliance from those that have been priced out of housing because they are dependent on sticking to the rules in order to be able to rent a property to live in. 

So, how does technology deal with this rigged game and is it not more likely that technology will increase the gap between rich and poor even more?",16,23

The unfathomable implications [Discussion],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/45y04a/agi_by_2030_the_unfathomable_implications/,TheFaggetman,1455562335,"Multiple AI-flagbearers have predicted the arrival of an AGI by 2030. The most prominent probably being Ray Kurzweil, however he isnt the only one (Ben Goertzel being another one). Many other keep saying that the progress of AI is exponential and is coming sooner than most people think, so even though I personally find the possibility of an AGI by 2030 quite implausible I find it very interesting to consider the scenario.

&amp;nbsp;

I would like to start a little discussion of what the implications to society would be should we have an AGI in 15 years. I think a lot about this stuff, but even though I have spend quite some time pondering the prospects and nature of AI, I am extremely overwhelmed by the thought of an AGI in just 15 years.
Think about it. 15 years. I will not try to imagine the road up to 2030, but just drop into the world by 2030 and imagine what that world would be like if we had an AGI.

&amp;nbsp;

Everything would be different. The concept of jobs would be completely annihilated. Every single thing a human could do, an AGI could do as well. Be it a teacher, a lawyer, a doctor, a marriage councillor, an engineer or whatever. I would imagine that robotics would have human level capabilities as well, so anything physical could be done by robots too. So humans add nothing of economical value what so ever to the global economy.

&amp;nbsp;

And what about important and powerful positions like CEOs and head-of-states? An AGI could read every single news story published in real time, every single tweet, watch every single video, read every book, every scientific paper and educational textbook, basically, encompass literally all of human knowledge. Not just in the pseudo way we can now by having Wikipedia at our fingertips, but literally understand and know every single piece of human knowledge.
With a being with that kind of knowledge how could it be justified to let any human make any kind of vaguely important decision? How could we possibly rival the AGI in any kind of activity? As far as I can see, we cant.
Why does democracy make sense anymore when the smartest people on earth to elect are functionally retarded morons compared to the intelligence I could tap into perhaps for for free?

&amp;nbsp;

Think about how scientific knowledge often take a significant amount of time to establish an acceptance with the general population (think evolution, big bang, generel relativity, phycology and what a mental illness is or whatever). Scientific progress will most certainly explode with an AGI (that can probably think thousands to millions of times faster than a human), so the gap between how we know reality to be and what the general population understands and accepts would probably become a vast and ever-expanding chasm.

&amp;nbsp;

What about human-to-computer contact? If you have seen the movie Her it depicts how it easily could turn out. You could extrapolate this idea further and imagine that you could create custom-made AI personalities perfectly suited your personality so you could make the perfect friends, SOs, perhaps family? Why would you deal with the imperfections of real humans when you could create perfect companions, live out your life in ever more convincing VR and completely succumb to the new AGI reality of crazy, crazy change.

&amp;nbsp;

And this might be 15 years into the future. 15 years! Think about it. Even if there is only 5% chance of it happening so soon, my god. It is insane. Absolutely insane. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am extremely interested in technology and the future and therefore know quite a bit more than the average person who dont find it as fascinating. However I become incredibly overwhelmed when I think about the implications, so how could a normal person in the year 2030 possibly cope with the extreme (and I mean EXTREME) changes that are coming?

&amp;nbsp;

I would LOVE to hear some of your thoughts on this. I know no-one who has the slightest interest in AI as I have, and I am slowly getting crazy thinking about this stuff myself. I need some more input and different perspectives on this subject. I have seen some really good discussion on this sub, and I would love to see it some more! I have many more thoughts on the implications of an AGI, but the post is long enough as it is. ",7,1

As there are many trials going on, one question that has not been answered, is how to fund basic income. In the developed world there seems to be a problem where many are unemployed, inflation is close to zero and the economies are not growing. Also the economy is fueled by consumer spending (30-60 %). 

What if there would be a permanent QE that instead of buying bonds and other assets, central banks would give e.g. 50-150 $ a month to every citizen. This would fuel the economy by consumer spending and also rise the rate of inflation closer to the target inflation (2 %) and little by little basic income could be higher as long as the inflation stays low. It would provide basic income and act as a form of stimulus, that could work as a controlled lower bound of inflation for central banks and also be a solution for the Liquidity trap.

If not familiar with money creation

Liquidity trap

Could this be the future of basic income? Any thoughts?

I'm currently involved in a project working with the future usage of sound and thought that I could make a good argument for which direction to go by creating a shallow timelime (uptil 2050) listing future important happenings, events etc. that might work as drivers for our society to evolve. 
Examples of things that interests me is: Political elections, G8-meetings, EU-meetings, trade agreements and legislations affecting whole countries, space traveling, completions of important infrastructures, 

So far the closest I've come is this list from Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_near_future

All my other attempts to use google have resulted in webpages about dating (searched: important dates of the future), sport championships uptil 2020, but mostly webpages about people speculating what will happen. 
So to clarify: I'm not interested in speculations, but in important events that are planned to happen before 2050. 

Not completely sure if this is the right Sub for my questions. If not you will have to excuse me.",4,8

I'm not sure that megacities will be a thing... I know about the three city project in China but I feel as society moves towards complete automation, remote work and many larger cities suffering from property crisis' these issues will slow urban expansion.  

So if there is complete automation of work and improved public/private transport then why wouldn't I and many others live in rural areas with more space to roam? For many people/families nowadays thats the end goal of their career path. 

Also you have the 'access over ownership' mentality as well so if self-driving cars or super fast trains can get me from my rural home to my nearest city in reasonable time that's probably good enough for me and others as well.

With an automated construction industry could you not more easily choose your lifestyle, which for many people complete rural isolation, a small communal rural town or a small village is probably all they want, obviously many people would like to live in cities but do they need to be that much bigger than they are now to meet those needs, especially if current office space is converted into living and communal space?

The other thing that got me thinking about this is European cities, many of which have strict building codes as to not interfere with their historical architecture and cities like this end up having a happier populous (the example that comes to mind is Edinburgh) similar architectural pride could start appearing in other old world cities in Asia and maybe Africa (and possibly older or very characteristic cities in the new world as well).

But yeah, just a thought I've been having",16,2

my question is, will technologies like these lead to a world where someday everyone you meet will be extremely beautiful by today's standards? 

if that does happen and it becomes extremely easy for everyone to become good looking. doesn't that make it less special? 

on the one hand, I kind of hope this happens because I know there are a lot of people out there that ugly and it drags them down in life. either through depression, lack of romantic options, self loathing or what have you. 

but on the other hand I feel like its a bit unfair that I would have to spend many hours of work in the gym, or using make up, skincare, dental care ect ect to look good and be attractive, but in the future people who sit on the couch all day and get fat will be able to get the same result without any of the work.

We all want the lithium air batteries to be developed already, but right now it looks like lithium sulfur will be produced until then. These apparently have 3X the energy density of lithium ion current battery tech. 

Forget self driving cars. How about electric fucking human sized quad-copters. We're talking about the sic-fi air traffic here that we all want! If batteries are going to eventually have the same energy density of gasoline or more, this will make ""flying cars"" entirely possible!

-------------------------------------

Nov 4, 2014 OXIS Energy is leading the World with its latest cell Energy Density and Capacity The company is working on lithium-sulfur batteries, and had announced having achieved a 25 amp-hour cell with 300 Wh/kg energy density. Its a work in progress, that they say is a 12-fold improvement in 18 months. By mid-2015 they expect to build a 33 amp-hour cell, and achieve 400 Wh/kg energy density by the end of 2016 and 500 Wh/kg by the end of 2018. Oxis Lithium-sulfur cells comprise a Lithium metal anode; sulfur-based cathode; a ceramic lithium sulfide passivation layer; and a non-flammable electrolyte protecting the lithium metal. OXIS cells have a 100% available Depth-of-Discharge and cannot be damaged by over-discharge.

How many of our thoughts can be misinterpreted? When neural interfaces can instantaneously run searches jot things down, and make a reddit post haphazardly, where will the line be drawn as to what can be subpoenaed? 

It's setting a scary precedent and besides all the Minority Report-esque concerns, when the backdoor is inevitably exploited, what will social engineers do with it, or even other governments?
Lines can still be tapped. We caught Al Capone on tax evasion. There are no other ways to do detective work other than crack a phone? Didn't we all agree that to maintain privacy and freedom it meant we couldn't catch ALL the bad guys and that some of us will die for it? 

It's a scary thought to have our data, whims, searches, poetry, diary...etc misinterpreted by a trending computer, which is what will ultimately happen. No way it's not getting into the underbelly government's hands without some serious oversight. Snowden showed us that (although he put a lot of people at risk doing so. He still has to live with that.).  

How can you have a backdoor that isn't exploited?  If you know Networking, you know that is not possible.

Aren't there enough concerns with things like programs that can be transmitted via inaudible tones from speakers to microphones? Not even Norton can save you from that. =)

I personally feel that genetically enhancing people, especially with regards to intelligence should be a basic right. why should anyone have to suffer with having a low IQ? How is this not in the benefit of all humanity.

There's bit a bit of rumble throughout the community as of lately in-regards to what should occur whenever we automate to the point where we are unable to sustain a healthy economy. Alongside the want of a Universal Basic Income I've generated the following structure that could potentially solve the issues of an automated society and ensure that a capitalistic type government could still exist underneath a ""Creatism"" title.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is Creatism?**

Creatism is the absolute reworkings of capitalism to be sustained by the technological advancements of the Human species to better suit every human in the process. Its an absolute trimming of social behavior in the work environment to be more automated and sustained at a lower cost than ever before.

&amp;nbsp;


**How does that work?**

It works by eliminating the cliffing of businesses and their expenses, allowing business to automate themselves, remove human need, and raise profits by a reasonable amount all while generating an auto tax to the company which is then redistributed out to every human who is not illegal inside of the country.

&amp;nbsp;

**Auto Tax?**

An auto tax is a new set of implementations in regards to how a business is ran, essentially after a business hits a certain threshold they will be introduced into the Auto Tax bracket, which will require the company to begin automation of their services to better fit their customer brackets, and removing employees to raise their profits. 

After this has begun, all normal taxes that a business is introduced to is removed in favor of the Auto Tax. The money generated by the auto tax is then in return taken in by the government until it hits its critical point once a month.

Once the critical point is hit every month, the amount is taken and divided by all registered and legal humans living inside of the country, those that have passed a monthly drug test, and have a psych rating of good and put into a check and sent out to each of those individuals.

&amp;nbsp;

**Auto Tax Bracket**

* Businesses whove hit the threshold to start automating their services (50% automation): 75% Auto tax is introduced, removing all other taxes.

* Businesses whove hit the second threshold of automation (75% automation): Auto Tax is lowered to 65%

* Businesses whove hit the final threshold of automation (90% automation): Auto Tax is lowered to 55%

&amp;nbsp;

**Tell me what you think**

Tell me what you think about this, it's an idea and system that I've been detailing up for a while now. You are free to address me by my name if you so wish. My name is Isaac. This is also not the full documentation of what Creatism would entail, however I am interested in hearing discussion, thoughts, ideas, and possible issues with the system. If there is a fix for a part you've seen (that I've already thought of and documented) then I'll politely comment back.

Rather than starting with something more obvious (Star Trek, Asimov, et al), Ive decided to first bring attention to Warren Ellis and his comics series [Transmetropolitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmetropolitan). Aside from appealing greatly to a seventeen year old PantsGrenades (at the time of my discovering Transmet), this comic directly addressed several more nebulous technopolitical issues, and did so at a time when things such as nanotech, digital simalcrums, and [dookie guns](http://i.imgur.com/0ujUVVj.jpg) weren't already considered immediately prescient in popular culture.

Basically, Ellis managed to mix a masterclass concoction of sociological alchemy that could simultaneously appeal to progressives, anarchists, and libertarians that I could only hope to match by spending several years in seclusion meditating upon ways to be less stubborn -- an endeavor I don't intend to follow through with due to my concerns regarding the projected placidity of liberals, utopians, and singularity advocates (a theme Ill be citing often in these posts). While I don't agree with Transmetropolitans sparkly but otherwise dystopian view of the future (Id prefer to preempt such a fate by advocating what Ill dub [aggressive utopianism](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7-tNUur2YoU)), the series closely resembles some of what Id expect to occur during the transition from a contemporary first world society to a high technology society, rather than the post hoc worlds of Roddenberry and others, though I do think sustainable post-scarcity societies are likely possible and something to strive for.

While Transmets setting wasn't necessarily portrayed as a transition period, I think it is closely indicative of the sociopolitical adolescence world culture could experience through technological progress, presuming we abstain from untenable catastrophes or atrocities. As a bonus, the comic also provides a refreshing alternative to the gritty, noir-ish tropes of cyberpunk cliches -- the storys protagonist, Spider Jerusalem, doesnt *want* to indulge in the day-to-day shit show of future-land-fun-time, knowing that there are still very real problems endemic to society, and does his part to remedy that by advocating on behalf of the exploited, and [actively razzling janksters](http://i.imgur.com/TZKUOqc.jpg).

The implicit value of Transmetropolitan and similar such science fiction, other than being really entertaining, is the predictive power of an artist attempting to parse the likely outcomes of technology, events, and paradigms that haven't yet occurred, and don't necessarily have to. Once past a specific threshold, comprehension of dangerous technology is likely to *help* more than *hurt*, but that threshold is partially dependent upon the predictive chops of both producers and consumers of science fiction, *and* the number of people who are both aware of those ideas and resolved to handle them ethically, in as much as is possible.

Ergo, stories such as Transmetropolitan not only offer novel ideas that could have real life applications, *they also remind us that those who would deign to abuse technology would likely want us to remain placid and ignorant*. Even that conjecture, however, could be prone to dissonance if we can't accurately guess the actual net effect of predictive supposition. For example, if we presume that public comprehension of dangerous technological paradigms is roundly good as a zero sum net effect estimation; even if that's true initially, how does that dynamic change if dubious elements decide to abuse technology for the specific purpose of engendering incentive to, instead, *diminish* comprehension, or redirect public ire towards a scapegoat?

Ipso conjecto, we can guess with some accuracy that advocating ethics in a high technology world could counterintuitively [require some modicum of gumption and aggression](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BMU8TLaX_jw) for the sake of effectively policing tech that could allow an individual or organization an undue degree of leverage over the rest of society, even if the goal is peaceful coexistence -- after all, even Starfleet ships are weaponized, no? Just as important, however, would be a finely tuned sense of *[when to relent](http://i.imgur.com/1rLF9dC.jpg)*, both for the sake of mitigating the dangers of errant metaweapons/paradigms and for preserving utility that could be better expended on comfort, pleasure, contentedness, etc.. Summarized: If we succumb to fanaticism, would that, by extension, create a world that tends towards conflict? Conversely, if we assume everythings hunky-dory, or will be eventually, what would a malicious element need to do other than bide their time and wait for diligence to dissipate? I say we vie for utopia, but respectively sharpen our blades, and I think stories such as Transmetropolitan jive with that sentiment whether or not the authors of those stories intended as such.

Tl;dr: [Warren Ellis](http://www.warrenellis.com) is a hoopy frood, Transmetropolitan acts as an effective primer on bringing together liberals, libertarians, anarchists, and others for the sake of the greater good, and Spider Jerusalem acts as an archetype for a [stand-alone-complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_Ghost_in_the_Shell#Stand_Alone_Complex) which leverages populism rather than intrigue, though I prefer an adjunct style thats less cynical.

This article garnered much attention for great reason, mainly as it addresses the moral imperative of embracing robotic automation for the simple fact of not only saving millions of lives, but vastly improving quality of life in numerous ways. The issue I have lies in seemingly limited thought patterns surrounding the ""need to rethink the very basic structure of our economic system"", leaving us with the notion that a basic income guarantee is the only reasonable method of mitigating the resulting loss of jobs. 

IMO this issue needs to be addressed from a scarcity standpoint rather than figuring out ways to ensure the public simply has enough money to meet the ever-growing ""cost of living"". As automation improves public transportation, computation, health &amp; medicine, manufacturing and virtually every industry it is incorporated into, access to the basic necessities of life (food, water, shelter etc.) will only increase in kind from improved agriculture, fresh water management and the fact that we can 3D print a house in 24 hours.  As it stands, the planet produces enough food for roughly 10 billion people, however our current poverty-based problems are not from a lack of production as it has been through centuries of civilization, but inefficient distribution and rampant waste that forces the economic phenomenon of scarcity upon the global economy.

Robotic automation will inevitably lead to a post-scarcity world (barring political or private interests preventing this transition), and if humans are able to provide the basic necessities to all those living on the planet, what purpose does a ""basic income guarantee"" serve? The need for fiat money altogether comes into question as well, and only then do we really broach the concept of ""rethinking the basic structure of our economic system"". The very definition of the word ""economize"" is to increase efficiency and reduce waste, not to simply perpetuate the infinite-growth paradigm that is proving unsustainable on a planet with limited natural resources.

The direct conflict between govt. policy aimed at creating jobs for jobs sake and the technological revolution eliminating the notion of jobs as we know them altogether is what I would like to discuss. Please share your thoughts!",115,35

* The cohort of people born after the Millennials have no agreed name or range of birth dates. A common name is Generation Z. Some sources start this generation at the mid or late 1990s with various ending dates[36]and others start it in the early 2000s with birth dates ending around 2025.[40][41] The term Generation Alpha has been suggested as name for both this cohort[42] and for the subsequent one.[43]

I suggest 'Generation Hashtag' because of the effects of ubiquitous internet access and social media on cultural identity and ethics.

Basically, it seems like members of this generation have nearly unlimited access to internet and social media from a very young age, and it is having an overwhelming effect on their social development, methods for acquiring and disseminating information, and opinion/belief formation.",22,4

- You can make a copy of your mind and transfer it to the clone.

- You cannot re-copy your mind at a later date.

- It's not possible to sync the two minds afterward.

- You live in a society where your resource is mostly from basic income but you won't get extra basic income because you have a new body.

How would you handle your bodies?  Would you kill your original and only live in the clone?  Or would you live two lives?  If the latter, how would you handle your personal properties?  Divide them in two?  Share your wife and children?

I'm turning 19 in a week from now. Everywhere I look, it seems that it's mostly corruption in government and society. The richest people keep getting richer, and because they got rich with the current system, they don't want to change it. So the economic systems remain static.

Is it really possible for it to change for the better? There could be a revolution, sure, but someone could always throw another revolution and reverse the progress. Look at how Egypt is going, for example. The only way that I can see there being real progress is if an entirely new country was made from scratch, and that is just ridiculous.

I don't want to be a downer, I love seeing all the cool future technology being put into our hands now, but it feels like - from an economic perspective - we might be on a downhill path. I'm not at economist, it must be said, but still...

Do you think that the world will change economically for the better in my lifetime, or is that too unreasonable? It's obviously better socially, but not really financially...",140,129

 Authors:

  Sveinn Olafsson
    (Faculty of Physical Sciences, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland)

  Leif Holmlid
    (Atmospheric Science, Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Gothenburg, SE-412 96 Goteborg, Sweden)

For over the last 26 years the science of cold fusion/LENR has been researched around the world with slow pace of progress. Modest quantity of excess heat and signatures of nuclear transmutation and helium production have been confirmed in experiments and theoretical work has only resulted in a large flora of inadequate theoretical scenarios. Here we review current state of research in Rydberg matter of Hydrogen that is showing strong signature of nuclear processes. In the presentation experimental behavior of Rydberg matter of hydrogen is described. An extensive collaboration effort of surface physics, catalysis, atomic physics, solid state physics, nuclear physics and quantum information is need to tackle the surprising experimental results that have so far been obtained. Rydberg matter of Hydrogen is the only known state of matter that is able to bring huge collection of protons to so short distances and for so long time that tunneling becomes a reasonable process for making low energy nuclear reactions. Nuclear quantum entanglement can also become realistic process at theses conditions. ",19,40

Does anyone have any resources on thought to text technologies and does anyone know anyone that might be addressing the issue of mental privacy? My aunt works with one of the top rehabilitation hospitals in the world and she told me that she has seen the new devices they have. They do not have to tap into your brain to see what you are thinking. She has said that it actually functions quite well with a wireless cap and some distance.

It was some guy in a (dark) room on a stage talking about technological progress, AI, and exponential growth.   I don't think it was a ted talk, but something similar.

One point that I remember was he mentions something about chunks of time in which there were amazing technological growth, he asks ""How many years into the future would you have to bring a cave man for him to die of amazement"" or something similar.  Then goes on to say that length of time has been growing shorter (bring a cavemen to the 1700's, bring someone from the 1700's to today, etc).

Probably not a lot to go off of.. I knew I should have bookmarked the video!

I mean that machine is made up of synthetic materials which can be replaced indefinitely and it seems to show signs of sentient life/consciousness with its ability to think for itself and control its body.

So my question is, is this replica of Caenorhabditis elagans not technically immortal?

Also, since we can already do this with the brain of 'Caenorhabditis elagans,' how long until we can do it with a more advanced animal and eventually a human?

If we could recreate human brains this way wouldn't that technically be immortality achieved? Sure it's not you or me that has become immortal, but something we created that is for all intents and purposes human and has human level intelligence is now immortal.

A future with a far higher quality and quantity of machine intelligence will be one where science, technology, problem solving, etc. are done at a far faster and better rate than what we are used to. 

Playing devil's advocate, is it possible intelligence is not the only bottleneck, or would every bottleneck other than intelligence be something that can be solved by intelligence? 

For example, I figured 'sure intelligence will create more biological advances in medicine, but those advances still have to go through FDA testing for benefits or side effects'. So in that regards intelligence is not the only bottleneck, you still have real world testing. So you may have tons of ideas, but you still need financial capital to make them real, and they still require slow real world tests as well as a slow adoption by the public. 

However intelligence will also figure out how to bypass those bottlenecks. Maybe via testing on a chip, maybe via testing in the digital realm, maybe via something we have never thought of before or something as esoteric as using quantum science to examine the results in a parallel universe that has already done the tests? Maybe advances in the p vs np equation? I don't know. 

So are there any potential bottlenecks other than intelligence that would hinder advances in science, technology and problem solving? Or would all the other bottlenecks be solvable (or at least minimized) by intelligence? Things like real world testing, financial capital, adoption by the public, lack of natural resources, etc. that would slow down science and technology all seem like things intelligence would also be able to solve or speed up. 

By intelligence, I mean intelligence in the broadest sense of the term. The ability to engage in intentional goal oriented behavior in a hostile environment. I don't just mean book smarts, but I'm sure people here know that. ",24,13

I know it's a vague text so for example an artist called Ap Verheggen worked with a team to create a structure that can produce ice eventually water in the desert using sun heat. Similar to a old fridges or freezers but with a solar panel so it is independent.

An other project is Google (project loon).

There is also Open Source Ecology which helps farmers DIY some of the most expensive equipments which can in the long run help Counties like Africa where the lake of equipments is one of the major causes of the agricultural failure. 

For example; 
Fun fact, the number of cows in Netherland is ruffly 1.6 million cows with a human population of 16 million and they have a stable economy and ironically on the other hand Sudan's population is approximately 9 million and they have 31million head of cattle sheep and goats. 

(I know you will say but there is civil war, am not saying the solving a problem will magically make Sudan population equal to Netherland life style but creating a cheaper easier solutions for agriculture or animals breeding can move the situation forward and give the people more ability to work freely without the need of huge corporations. 

An other example: 

The bathroom from gates foundation (didn't need a designer it was a waste water and mechanical engineering involved). I used it as an example. 

I want to work in a place that allows me to study then improve products or find solutions. 

Or to put it better, design things that the masses can use, the poor people can use.

Something similar is IDEO and the principle they adopted is Human centered design concept.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PdxQbOvAlI

(held in 2013 - there are other interviews posted more recently but in there Minsky looks considerably younger, showing that the clips were made earlier)

he said there are only about 20 people working on AGI, and 

&gt;I think comparing AI progress with nuclear fusion is a bit of a teaser. Mr Minsky says, progress depends on the amount of smart people working in a particular field. Well in ITER, a lot of people are involved and as far as I know it is a proof of principle at first at some 500MW which is like a small caol plant. I am pretty hopeful. So fusion should be just around the corner and I believe the same is true for AI. Too many interests intertwine with autonomous decision making, or analysing the ever growing data trail anyone is dragging along these days. There are too many organisations willing to grab the necessary research and development pennies out of their deep pockets.

(summary of what he said , from a commenter at that video who added his own opinion)

I was amazed that there are only about 20 people working on the most important subject of human history, due to a lack of funding and interest.

It is true that our greatest talents are now going into finance, which does create big profits but are not really leading humanity 'beyond the horizon'.

Such kind of wealth are going into - real estate, which is so medieval.

While TPTB can 'kick the can' for about 15-25 years, putting the new civilization online takes quite a while. The industrial revolution took almost 100 years to set itself, and while singularity is virtually instant, the road to there is not exactly free of errors.

The situation is similar to 1918's Kaiserschalacht, where the survival of the old order depended upon one single roll of dice, and where Black Jack Pershing appeared at the most inopportune time and completed the process which has led humanity into a huge crisis. (I have discussed it elsewhere.)

With about 6.5 billion people contributing very little to the progress of civilization, and quite a sizable portion blatantly detrimental to it (i.e. ISIS, the 'refugees' in Europe, etc)

and some very essential rare metals and rare earths needed to make very fast stuff running out, 

there is a very good chance that mankind won't be going to stars, mankind won't be transhumans, mankind won't reach agi, etc.

When should a 'manhattan project' have started? I think the 1970s was a good head start, but at the very latest around 1995 would have been the point of divergence for singularity, transhumanism, etc.

With more 'old people' for the next generation to support, money will be likely to flow to life extension, rejuvenation, etc. While these activities do have merit, they are not the 'decisive battlefield'.

I am just afraid we might miss the 'bus' by a single hair, and fall back into eternal darkness, which is more possible than most people can imagine now.

Autonomous cars make up about 50% of all traffic, and around 80% of all cars are electric. All cars in production are electric. Solar power and other renewables and nuclear make up 80% of all energy produced, some poor countries still take what's left of carbon fuels. AI is super intelligent, and computers are so powerful that regular people don't even care to know the ""specs"" of their home computers and other intelligent devices. Climate change is pushing habitability to its limits in Africa and many others parts of the world.

I've the incredible honor to sit down and interview [Peter Diamandis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Diamandis) this weekend at [Singularity University's India Summit](http://singularityuindiasummit.org/) in Mumbai. Peter is the Co-Founder of XPRIZE, Planetary Resources, Human Longevity, Singularity University, among others. He's the best selling author of Abundance and BOLD too.

I will ask him questions about artificial intelligence, it's impact on the labor market, basic income, the various XPRIZE competitions, and some questions out of left field. 

**I will ask him the most upvoted questions here.** Ask away in the comments. Just so you know - Peter Diamandis has done 2 AMAs which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1onkop/i_am_peter_diamandis_founder_of_xprize/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2so1yg/iama_entrepreneur_peter_diamandis_xprize/). 

By the way - besides Peter Diamandis, I will also interview Naveen Jain (Moon Express), Neil Jacobstein (Artificial Intelligence), Brad Templeton (IoT), and Rob Nail (Robotics) this weekend. So if you have questions for them, comment or send me a message. 

I'm not a [traditional journalist](http://hamline.edu/HUNewsDetail.aspx?id=4295017329). I won't just write stories in different publications about this amazing summit, but will take you behind the scenes. For instance, last year after the devastating Nepal earthquake, I did an [AMA here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/34t1gt/im_amrit_i_grew_up_in_nepal_and_have_been_here/) that made it to the front page (claim to fame). I'll be [live tweeting](http://twitter.com/amrit_sharma), live streaming on Periscope and snapping during the conference too.

You can get in touch with me to chat more here: [@amrit_sharma](http://twitter.com/amrit_sharma) on twitter and amritsharma on snapchat.

Talk soon!

I am defining immortality as ""negligible senescence"", or the absence of aging. I think it would be extremely difficult to circumnavigate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, which is required for an indefinite lifespan, so I'm restricting myself to negligible aging.

I explore negligible aging through two methods, genetic engineering and mind-uploading. The first method is alright, but I'm having difficulty reasoning through the second one for the following reason:

Mind-uploading involves simulating the human brain, and all 86 billion neurons. The difficulty of this lies in the computing power required, and all predictions I've found assume Moore's law continues indefinitely.

That's just one of several difficulties...

I'll post my Outline [here](http://www.filedropper.com/termpaperoutline), and if you guys could take a crack at it and give me any feedback, that would be most appreciated. Thank you.",3,1

We don't have many tasks for them that won't soon bore them (I'm assuming they won't be rebellious, but our grateful children that want to take care of their old ""parents""). I can think of only one thing to challenge their intellect; creating a virtual reality for us to enjoy.

Floating in water in haptic suits with VR helmets, they could make it hard for us to detect if what we experience is virtual or real. The ASI:s' goal will probably be to keep us enjoying the world they create, more and more time. The suit could feed us and also take care of the bodily rest products, so we could stay in VR indefinitely.

My ASI would monitor my brain activity to see if I am content or bored, and maximize the right mix of excitement, tranquility and happiness, for me to want to stay in VR as long as possible. It will get to know my personal taste good enough to create art, music, entertainment, adventures better than anything I have ever experienced before. So why would I want to leave that environment?

(This could be an explanation to the Fermi paradox, but I think the ASI:s will explore the universe with probes, just out of their own curiosity.)

TL;DR If super powerful and intelligent computers want us to voluntarily choose to spend our lives in VR (so they can take care of the real world without us messing it up), they will be able to convince us to do so.

  The capability displayed in this video is staggering, and a landmark for bipedal robotics. Some of the actions demonstrated blow everything at DARPA's [robotics challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P9geWwi9e0) last year out of the water, and even make Asimo look positively prehistoric. Maybe it shouldn't be surprising however, knowing that Google (or Alphabet) has owned Boston Dynamics for several years now. 

One of their other star acquisitions, DeepMind, has made similarly huge strides in the last year, from learning to play video games purely on [visual input](http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulrodgers/2015/02/28/googles-deepmind-masters-atari-games/#4eba9d724852), to the quiet rollout of Google's incredible image content recognition service - and the strange but beautiful side-effect of feedback loops, or ['dreaming'](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/11684183/Googles-artificial-intelligence-interprets-photos-as-animals-with-creepy-results.html), to its recent completely unexpected mastery of [Go](http://googleresearch.blogspot.ca/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html).

So the question is - what lies ahead when these two technologies inevitably cross paths? how could Deepmind accelerate ATLAS' intelligence, and how could ATLAS help DeepMind learn about movement and interaction with the physical world? We've already seen the amazing results that a neural network in a physical body can achieve with last year's [BRETT](http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/05/21/deep-learning-robot-masters-skills-via-trial-and-error/), and Watson is set to soon peer out through Pepper's [eyes](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-watson-to-power-softbank-robotics-pepper-300200668.html), so I have no doubt we may see some incredible advances in both robotics and AI this year.

 I'm ready for more future shock.",3,4

So in the year 2516, imagine your average high school student taking a history exam about the 21st century.  What important modern events or people do you think they will misremember or be completely ignorant to?  

For the sake of this question, let's pretend that your average high school student is as smart as they are today, even though by then we will probably just have information loaded onto our brains and everyone will just have wikipedia in their brain all the time.

(To be honest, I actually thought of this question when watching Futurama when they said that Gerald Ford invented the car, and it reminded me how I have seen students make similar mistakes with kings or other historical people that have the same last name.)

Much of them are identification, about 90%, studies say, yet the 10% does remain unexplained.

'Insufficient data', 'hallucinations' 'also misinterpretations' you might think. 

Yet we shouldn't be so quick to judge that we are not dealing with something really special here. After all, we have hundreds of declassified documents indicating it's seriousness, we have had several mass sightings (see the phoenix lights for example, with an estimate of 10k witnesses https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk3YAz3lDJQ), we have multiple witness/radar cases along with physical trace cases.

On top of that we have had the highest government personnel publicly speaking about how 'the American people deserve to know the truth, see John Podesta for example http://i.imgur.com/SEnuORJ.jpg)

And so the UFO phenomena is worth researching when speculating about the future of our race. Are we sitting revolutionary technology or are we perhaps visited by an ET intelligence. 

I made a compilation of the best evidence I could find on my website about 'unidentified flying objects', which I am not here to promote for monetary gain but merely to aid the ones that are interested, as I found there to be a lack of good website, www.bestUFOevidence.weebly.com

This led me to the Living Earth Simulator, a proposed Sim of our planet that would require massive computing power. I was just curious, would us turning on the Living earth Simulator be a reason for our Sim to get shut down?

Again, I stress that this is highly speculative. I'm just curious to see what this sub thinks about this!

Here's a link about the LES

For example, the probability of a fair coin coming up heads would be 50% (or 1:1 odds), not the 0% or 100% you might imagine by predicting the course of all the atoms in the coin.  You get 1 in 300,000,000 for winning the lottery, not the winning numbers.

Here 'accurate' means that if you get 90% probability for N different things to happen 0.9*N will happen as N gets large, or if you prefer, that a rational betting agent would break even on many 9:1 bets.

Allot of people have shitty tech manners. I think it's totally rude to text or browse the net at the dinner table or at any social gathering for example. I like standing behind them and reading their texts out loud.

A positive example of etiquette would be with hands free blue tooth communication. When it first came out, idiots would walk around town having intimate conversations with their SO while standing in line to buy gas. After saying 'I love you' while looking in the general direction of strangers, people stopped using it in public so much.

1. Smart glasses or AR should be mandated to install a blinking light on the frames that activates while recording. If the light fails to activate, then recording should be disabled. Or better yet make the user hold down a button.
2. Robocars should have blue lights on the front and back to notify traffic that this car is driving itself. Eventually the absence of the light will be the warning.
3. Please do not wear a VR headset in company or public. I will personally fuck with anybody that does.
4. Hand gesture controlled AR would lead to horrible miscommunication in body language and probably personal injuries.

I'm just brain storming, so please contribute your ideas about good tech manners.",7,6
2628,2016-2-28,2016,2,28,5,47xr27,Infinite longevity may deprive us of childhood  and that's a problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/47xr27/infinite_longevity_may_deprive_us_of_childhood/,kai_teorn,1456603913,"Nobody likes to die. Nobody likes to get old and crippled. 

(But especially, no one likes to die.) (No, actually, debilitating aging is worse than dying.) (Well, on reflection, I really can't say which is worse.)

And so we're fighting aging and death. That's a noble pursuit. But there's one danger here that I don't see discussed often: In a society where everyone can live all they want, there's likely to be a deficit of children. *Some* children will likely still be born, especially if humanity starts expanding into space. But, after all, having children is, originally, nothing but an adaptation to dying. Adaptations that outlive their usefulness tend to wither and disappear. To a small extent, this is already happening: in developed countries population is getting older, and the number of births is below reproduction levels. 

Why is this important? Because what makes us human is not our bodies but our *culture*  our languages, science, art, and everything else. And culture has itself evolved as something that gets passed from generation to generation  something that is constantly relearned from scratch. It needs a constant inflow of innocence, of ignorance, of fresh eyes and fresh voices that come to learn and to doubt. Without this, culture stops evolving, becomes a rigid ritual. Old people are cultural fossils of the age when they were young and learning. 

It may be even worse than that. Apart from stopping to evolve, culture in a no-death world may simply *stop*, period. After all, what is it that entices us to keep creating new books, new music, new ideas, new blog postings? Isn't it that we learn new stuff and are eager to show off what we've learned? Older people slump in creativity not because they lack the energy of youth; what they miss is the *newness* of the world, the sense that you have something exciting to share that you have just understood or discovered.  

Can we get rid of aging and death without turning into a society of curmudgeons? I think we can  if we focus not so much on stopping aging as on *reversing* it: on rejuvenation. We must be able to rejuvenate ourselves drastically enough to become, from time to time, *children again*. A society that consists of 100% of fully developed adults at the height of their bloom may look attractive, but in fact it's a dangerous dead end. We must have those who need to be taught everything, from learning to talk and walk, again and again. And yes, this means the person who ""goes back"" and voluntarily *invelops* into a child will lose most of her memories and most of (what we perceive as) her individuality  but certainly not all; after growing up, such a person will be much closer to pre-rejuvenation herself than, say, a two-parent biological child of hers. 

Call it a compromise with death, if you will. We will have to make it. 

This is one of the central ideas in [Everday](http://everday.wikidot.com), a futurological treatise I have written in the form of an encyclopedia of a distant future world. I welcome everyone to read it, comment, and eventually join for collaborative development. In Everday, the process of rewinding yourself back into childhood is called [deep sleep](http://everday.wikidot.com/deep-sleep), and the book looks at various aspects of this: how this affects [family](http://everday.wikidot.com/family), [early childhood](http://everday.wikidot.com/waking), [education](http://everday.wikidot.com/open-childhood), even [language](http://everday.wikidot.com/life); how this may work for [bodiless AIs](http://everday.wikidot.com/explay); and even, how we may have to apply the same principle to entities [larger](http://everday.wikidot.com/world-sleep) than a single sentient mind.

But hey, worst case it will be deleted.

The idea is for it to be about a time when humanity already have OR is about to have many technologies that would allow a worldwide utopia to be created. Things like nuclear fusion or at least very advanced solar power, nanomedicine, cyborgism, near-human or slightly above human AI, advanced brain-machine interface for VR, and other things that could improve overall human life hugely. There would be a secret organization mobilizing to manipulate events in order to prevent huge coorporations, corrupt governments or simply regular people's greed from delaying too much or even ruining progress towards utopia. 

Now, of course no one here can predict the future, but I imagine this would be the best place to find reasonably decent guesses. This are my questions:

- What would be most reasonable year for this story to be set in?

- Which other technologies would be relevant for that year or my story concept overall?

- Which social, economics, political or even geopolitical changes would make some sense for that year compared to now?

I thank in advance. I know it might seem like I'm trying to get you to do the job for me, but it's just that I want the story to be believable for people that have more understanding of technological advancement than the average person. I myself don't like when a piece of fiction predicts something that seems wildly unlikely (they usually underestimate advancements).",9,3
