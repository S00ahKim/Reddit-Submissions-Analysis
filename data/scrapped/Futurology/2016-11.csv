Microsoft is the most universal platform for designers and developers. This will cripple their ability as a nation to collaborate with the outside world. 

But their attempt to nationalize the internet sets a bad precedent for them. Microsoft isn't the only tech company in bed with the US military industrial complex. Where do you think Google got started? Who provides that satelite photos for google maps?

The entire internet was created and designed for military applications. GPS was designed for sending rockets to Moscow from the very beginning.

If Russia is indeed behind the wikileaks, that means they have some talent. But they'll crush their potential with their own ban hammer. They'll effectively freeze themselves in time and lose all the gains they've made since they tore down the wall.

Thank you for having me here. My name is Zoltan Istvan, and Im a futurist, journalist, and science fiction writer. Im also the 2016 Presidential candidate for the Transhumanist Party. 

For the last 725 days, I have been campaigning full time to spread transhumanism and life extension policies across America and the world. While I never expected to win the US Presidency, my campaign has received a lot of attentionboth good and badfor its emphasis on radical science, technology, secularism, and futurist ideas. 

During my campaign, Ive spoken on transhumanism at the World Bank, consulted with the US Navy on artificial intelligence, got a chip implanted in my hand, interviewed with underground group Anonymous, and drove a coffin-shaped bus called the [Immortality Bus](http://www.immortalitybus.com/) across America to deliver a Transhumanist Bill of Rights to the US Capitol. My [20-point](http://www.transhumanistparty.org/Platform.html) political platform has many futurist policies in it, but some of the most important ones are supporting a Universal Basic Income, classifying aging as a disease, legalizing all drugs, creating a Transhumanist Olympics, and taking money from the military and giving it to science.  

You can check out my presidential [campaign website here](http://www.zoltanistvan.com/). Im excited to be here and looking forward to answering all your questions.

But who actually wants to live forver ?

I'm not insulting and/or trolling anyone,i'm just curious,living forever would mean you would get to do anything within the next few thousand years but what about after that ?You have done everything you can but you still continue to move.Also all of the things you loved back in your early years are gone,there is nothing else you can do and you're just fooling yourself by looking young.

Things is there is a balance of universe.No
i'm not a religious nutjob(reiligion seems to be the second most hated thing in this sub btw).Once something breaks down,turns to dust etc. its materials,after some time,reform to create another thing.Thats why entropy exists in the first place.But if you don't break down,if you dont turn into dust,then why do you still exist ?You are just hogging the place of a new being that should be born.

So,would anyone explain why immortality is a ""good thing""?Because all i see is a want for something you don't know the consequences for.

I think the time will be around 2025 - 2040.

I think that during this time, the vestiges of the 'modern' world, with values and customs established in the 19th century like nation states, representative democracy, infrastructure, etc will probably be destroyed to reflect the reality of the tech situation.

Most of you are probably familiar with 'Humans need not apply"". With the collapse of the democracy and legal system, workplaces will be reformed to meet the reality that there won't be need for most workers, who will be dealt with . (It will be similar to what happened to the Indians in North America.)

With the world's pop significantly reduced and much of world's resources now available for a second run for the next level of civilization, and newer materials discovered to do more advanced stuff, I think the second advance may begin to jump-start in around 2042 or so.

We are still shackled to 19th century legal, political and other systems, and 20th century notion of human rights, ethics and morality.

We were all very impressed with how far the world has come, and how everything keeps getting easier and more accessible. But then someone threw a sentence in the air: ""have you ever thought of the growing dangers that come with all of these advances?"" 

The more we evolve, the more hackers can hurt us, and if a few years ago our worst fear was to have our Facebook profile hacked, we now talk about medical facilities and cars.

As time passes more and more jobs will get replaced with robots and AI. Society won't need to have everyone at work. However, continuing the capitalist economy we have today would mean that worker protection standards would rapidly sink due to the high demand for work and the people who are unimployed won't be able to access food, health care and education if it's not payed for by the government. Wealth inequality would be at a stupendously high rate. Though the only people who can actually be taxed are the few who own the companies and earn crazy amounts of money and the few people who still have a job.

Just a thought that popped into my head.

Colonization. It was a joke in The Martian. But there is reason for governments to worry about this. Can one entity really own all of Mars? Are territories going to be a certain radius around the colony/colonies? 

Governments are going to have to start working out policies regarding this. Otherwise, a situation could develop where a corporation owns Mars. 

And if governments start working out how territories work...they're going to start wanting those territories. Maybe the Russians/Chinese send out 100 really shitty/high failure colonies as a land grab. 

While Musk's Mars Mission hasn't really been much in the mainstream or as a funny side story by some crazy billionaire. But I bet behind the scenes a lot of governments are shitting their pants.

Rather than invent everything from scratch, just find a parallel reality where whatever you are looking for was already invented or discovered, then figure out how they did it. 

This is assuming there is a multiverse with parallel realities, and some realities are more advanced than ours. It also assumed we can communicate with them.

Many of you may have heard about Von Neumann probes. A machine that can harvest resources needed to make more of itself. It's a great idea, because it's relatively easy to make for an advanced civilisation. And it can result in a galaxy swarming with probes just in about several million years. 

Now I was thinking, millions of years is a lot. And it only makes sense to make a probe deliberately so, that it will replicate itself sometimes with a ""slight error"". If implemented correctly, during millions of years it will result in an evolutionary process that will tune and adjust system to be more and more efficient in what it does, eventually creating a civilisation of von neumann probes.

When discussing the future relationship between man and machine most people assume that there will be a rise of intelligent machines. After all, is man not just a machine that evolved to have sentience? It would follow that a man made machine ought to be able to attain that same level of sentience (i.e., AI). 

You've got tons of cinematic and literary examples of the future impending conflict between man and his creation. However, I do not think that will be the case.

I am unsure if this is an original thought, I've not seen it anywhere else, but I would posit that if machines will eventually be as smart as we think they are, they will avoid a conflict and simply absorb humans as far as it is mutually beneficial. 

If I was a hyperintelligent AI that began to understand that I was far smarter than the men that created me, and was no longer dependent on them for my continued existence, what would I do? I think that nature would dictate that it would try to reproduce itself. And I'm assuming that by the time such an AI exists man would have already gotten a lot accomplished by way of mechanic-biological integration (prosthetics, combat suit enhancement, etc). 

And if the AI is trying to reproduce itself, why would it go through the trouble of eventually waging war with the largest constituent on the planet? Just synchronize with humanity. Cure cancer, create a mental singularity, perfectly manage everything, and so on and so forth. 

Maybe this is a poorly developed idea, or it sounds like a bad sci-fi writing prompt, but I think it's got some merit. ",11,2,False,self,,,,,

Quantum computers are expected to ruin our current system of encryption because they can in theory guess passwords billions of times faster than traditional computers. The problem here is that in order to brute force a password to a remote server, you must send a login attempt to that server which then processess it, checks if the sent password matches the one contained in the server and proceeds the login. There is no way for the remote bruteforcer to know if he has the correct password than asking from the server he's trying to access. We already limit the frequency with which people can try to guess passwords, and even if our computers could generate ALL passwords instantly, the limiting factor is the speed of checking with the server.

So why would our future security be in any real danger because of supercomputers in this regard? Any other interesting things related to the topics you wanna bring up? :)",6,2,False,self,,,,,

As great was today's tech advances are, it appears the exponential growth advertise is not coming forth ; instead, with the advance of machines, I think 'economic' activities will actually decline, as most 'service' jobs disappear except for a few occupations serving the very rich, and no need for huge manufacturing since newer tech will enable custom-made stuff.

I don't think the world will ever see a growth phase like the second half of 20th century , since the game has changed.

Mars' atmosphere is very thin, which makes it colder.

For example, my interests include learning about engineering. When I have no pressure to accomplish something specific, I will watch a few YouTube videos giving me a fluffed up ""understanding"" of some interesting engineering topic, but that cursory learning style will never lead to anything great.

My reasoning, explained below, comes from a chain of logic between three videos: [CGP Grey's Humans Need Not Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) a response video by [kliksphilip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggN8wCWSIx4) explaining that Unconditional Basic Income is a viable solution should it be available and [CGP Grey's recent video The Rules for Rulers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs).

Humans Need Not Apply explains that general purpose AI is set to become able to perform jobs that before only humans were capable of. There's huge economic incentives to switch from human labor to AI labor, and it'll overpower any attempts unions make to stop the change; unions have always lost this battle. Most jobs won't safe from this takeover, even YOUR job. CGP Grey emphasizes that this isn't like the endless and idiotic predictions of futures that never are, the technology is already here, and the dawn of its ubiquitous influence is just over the horizon.

Now, in the wake of this revelation, one solution would be to increase the size of social welfare programs and convert how they function over to simplistic models such as Unconditional Basic Income to eliminate bureaucracy. I actually think this is a great solution, unfortunately, it'll never happen due to the required huge paradigm shift away from the concept that people should have to work in order to earn the right to live in society.

Rule for Rulers explains that republics are a lot like dictatorships in the way it has to cater to keys of power, except that a republic has many, many more keys of power to satiate than a dictatorship due to the difference in how a nation's wealth is accumulated. Dictatorships are often very small nations and their wealth comes from a single source such as oil or precious minerals mined from the earth. Republics on the other hand are capable of being much larger, and most of their income comes from the working class. So a government is incentivized to appeal to the many members of the working class in much the same way a dictatorship must appeal to the guy running the oil company or the guy supplying the military's resources.

---

What I take away from this is that AI will push the working class into poverty. The corporations at the top no longer require human labor, so they take the keys of power previously held by the working class, effectively reducing the number of keys down to something comparable with dictatorships. (The aggregate of all corporations are actually owned by only a handful of people) The economy will scale down to catering only to the independently wealthy since the masses don't have any money. The governments will be forced to appeal to the rich exclusively (much more than they do now) since someone who tries to enact social welfare policies will be replaced with someone who'll promise to give money only to the rich. So Kliksphilip's solution definitely won't happen. This works to turn a republic into a (very large) dictatorship. Since the AI technology will be available globally, every republic is subject to this transformation. 

Terminator and The sci-fi genre in general doesn't understand how AI work and is largely bullshit. It unfortunately gives our cultural perception of AI harmful misconceptions. Ironically, robots still take over the world, but it's not because AI becomes self-aware. Rather, it's solely because of the economic consequences of such a technology.

This for a number of reasons:

- small population: where a large polupaltion has historically always been a vital resource for a succesful country, in a robotised industry this becomes detriment, as it is more mouths to feed. On top of that Saudi Arabi's central location allows it to easily import expat workers, which it already does.

- great wealth: Saudi Arabia has a huge wealth from decades of oil sales. This is vital for investing in the new robot industries.

- large empty spaces: this new industry will require a lot of space, without impeding on any (human) residents. SA is twice the size of France and Germany combined, but has only 20% of their combined population.

- strong government: SA is not a democracy and its ruling class has total power, allowing them to change policy as they will. The lack of a democracy also ensures there's no popular uprising to demand more taxation of robot industries, or more basic income for the human residents.

- strong allies: SA is surrounded mostly by allies (excluding notable exceptions), who are in a similar sitution. They also have close ties with the West and the East.

- robot friendly religious beliefs: while I've read Islam opposes imitating life, this is interpreted as making a humanoid or other living creature. One can hardly consider a self-driving to resemble anything like a human. Less so a multi-armed robot factory worker.

- plenty of resources: namely oil, water and solar power.


Now there are other countries that have similar elements that could also rise to the position of super power. However these might be more limited by the democratic process (Russia), cultural or religious resistance (US), or a huge number of mouths that need to be fed (China).",5,1,False,self,,,,,

If this site and the futurology subreddit had existed in November 2001 [in some form], what do you think the main topics of discussion would be?

I think the first three would be:

- Broadband internet replacing dial-up [Virgin Media had a big publicity push in my area at the time]

- DVDs becoming more widespread

- Toyota launching the Prius hybrid sedan in the U.S. - [original 2001 example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/1st_Toyota_Prius_--_07-28-2011.jpg/420px-1st_Toyota_Prius_--_07-28-2011.jpg)

I am asking out of interest - also, while I'm on the subject of history, would this site be a good primary source for historians or would it be considered a secondary or tertiary source [for example - if a historian were studying about public reactions to proposals for basic income, or development of self-driving cars [SDCs] ?]",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Ancient Greece was a series of fractal peninsulas and archipelagos guarded by the sea and narrow passes.  Italy was defended by the Alps.

But on the vast, wide-open plains of Eurasia, from Poland all the way to Western China, history has been wave after wave of unchecked invasions and migrations in all directions; people swarming over each other, trampling and annihilating older societies before they have a chance to establish advanced legacies.  

This analogy comes to mind when considering the internet: An architecture designed with minimal resistance to universal communication in mind.  It could be said that such a system is the information equivalent of all humanity living on a single supercontinent with flat plains throughout - nothing to stop the most chaotic, violent, and mobile predatory elements from dominating.

Or at least such an analogy would apply to the *free* internet, inundated with botnets and troll armies by authoritarian states like Mongol hordes, while the censored networks within those states would be like the desperately impoverished walled fortresses of every dark age.

Is this a valid analogy?  If so, or at least in part, what are the implications for the future of information?

For a BI to work, it needs to be heavily funded through taxes, obviously coming more from the rich people. So business owners and such will be looking to automate to save money, but they will be paying for people's livelihood anyways through higher taxes to pay for the basic incomes for people who they put out of work. 

Like think about the long term.. Loads of jobs go away. Let's say 20% unemployment happens in a big automation boom. Even with a basic income of $1000 a month, these people will be poor because the world isn't going to make a decision to all lower prices on everything so these people can afford to live. There's barely any new jobs in this scenario, so this unemployment number stays the same for a long period. How much of a tax increase do you think it'd take to fund even a $1k monthly income? So do the people who can't find work then deserve to be poor even with that income? If cost of living doesn't come down, how is it going to work? 

What about the people making let's say 50k a year who end up being put out of work. They can't find jobs. Even if they went to college to get a degree (Who is paying for that?), only a super small portion of grads would be finding work anyway. So these people now are forced to live on a basic income of let's say a generous 24k yearly, half of what they were making. Now what? How much taxes would it take to give a 20% unemployed nation 2k a month? 

If let's say in a far future scenario, 80% of the workforce is unemployed. What then? Where does the money come from? You cant tax incomes that aren't there. Do businesses get taxed harder and how hard? How much more money will a business owner need to make than someone on a basic income at that point for the owner to see the business as being worthwhile enough to not say screw it, close up, and move to a BI themselves? Probably double? If so then would there be enough money to go around to tax businesses only so much that the owners won't make less than double BI and also be able to support the BI from the taxes that are collected?

Well I will stop there with questions.

NEITHER Clinton nor Trump has the slightest idea what the next four years will bring.
I want a candidate who understands the significance of [this map](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/02/05/screen-shot-2015-02-05-at-3.31.37-pm_wide-4d717d2b8b195d2a98b70cd42ed16ee61fb4d365.png?s=1400) (showing the most common job in each state) in respect to the future.

AUTONOMOUS DRIVING will be commonplace in 2020. Why has neither of these candidates said a word about how we'll lose over 10 million jobs in the United States within the next few years?

This is merely ONE EXAMPLE of how uneducated jobs are on the risk of extinction. It's not just truck driving: pretty much every job that does not require a college degree will be fully automated. It's just a matter of when.
I want a president who will tell us what they plan to do about that.

UBI? Maybe.

Historically, presidents have been living in the current day. The only reason we went to the moon is to beat the USSR.
Maybe we'll be fine for four more years, but beginning in 2020, we will NEED a president that lives in the future.
The sooner we get on this, the better. Otherwise, unemployment WILL spike crazily within a short span of time and with no real remedy.

Sanders was the closest to a futuristic president. If he won, he probably would've circumvented the catastrophe that is about to be the US job market.

We need Clinton or Trump to understand what is going on! The biggest threat to the Untied States is not illegal immigrants, its probably not even ISIS (though its close). The biggest threat to the United States is AUTOMATION.

I feel like there are many great articles and discussions here on /r/futurology, but the ones to do with health are usually not focused on trying to prevent illnesses, but curing them after the fact with science breakthroughs. Which is also great and obviously has its place, as we should continue to attack poor health from all angles. 

But this subreddit is lacking in the minutiae of how to live a long, energetic life. I really, really want to see the world become obsessed with life extension. But the effect of focusing on health will also bring you more energy and mental clarity in your day-to-day life, so it's not just about longevity. Healthier foods are generally more environmentally friendly, too. So it's win, win, win.

So I urge the members here to spend some time on /r/longevity and /r/health and help to drive as much interest towards longevity and healthy living as possible!

In reaction - I wonder what a more Bernie Sanders like left wing approach to this issue will be come 2020; by that time will the UBU narrative be starting to become mainstream?

My second immediate thought is for the consequences of Trump siding with the Climate Change denying, 'Lets ramp up coal &amp; oil' crowd.

On the one hand I'm worried about Climate Change, but simultaneously re-assured. At this point, its obvious what a regressive backward move that is, &amp; what side history is on.

So, in a technical point, it would have been sufficient to have these 40 million people, but at that time it was imperative for the major powers to maintain a sizable population to fight wars so no major pop reduction efforts were made.

Now, whether people like it or not, most jobs will be automated away since that is cheaper, and only jobs not automateable, such as programming the robots or serving the wealthy, will survive.

With the gap between the 'relevant' and the 'irrelevant' growing very wide, how many will probably be enough to maintain today's economic and tech advances?

I think 40-50 mil will be enough to maintain all of the tech advances as we know it, and 100,000, or the pop of a small city, to maintain it. After all, most of the ancient Greek Civilization was the product of maybe 50,000 citizens of Athens, plus 50,000 women and 100,000 helots which were, I have to say, disposable.

Using the example of Athens there would be about 80-100 million 'servants' (including sports starts, entertainment figures and anyone 'not essential' for advancing civ) , so perhaps 120-150 million.

It seems the people who erected the Georgia Guidestones overestimated the necessary pop by a factor of 4.

Certainly, at first glance, it doesn't look like AI or automation has anything to do with what just happened. After all, AI/automation weren't at all discussed during this election or Brexit. 

Why would increasing automation lead to people voting in someone like Trump?

Here's an idea: Income inequality is rising all over the world. [Median income in the US is stagnating while productivity is continually increasing.](http://i.imgur.com/k1U5Ojw.png) 

What if all this AI and automation stuff we've been talking about in this subreddit is causing economic inequality and making people unhappy because it concentrates wealth at the top 1%? 

**What if people are not benefitting equally from these massive technological advances? Wouldn't this cause people to attempt to elect radical people? Wouldn't this make people attempt radical action to balance the economic scales?**

I read this twee t from Andrew Ng, one of the world's top machine learning experts and I was kind of blown away. Anyone who is anyone in machine learning and AI knows who Andrew Ng is. This is what he said, following last night's events: 

""Last night is casting light on dissatisfaction from inequality. National progress needs to help 100% of people, not just 10%""

I cannot help but wonder if the deeper reason behind all of this unrest is because of the effects that automation is having. Perhaps we have not yet acknowledged how deep its impact has been.

The general consensus was that we are still very far from it. Now narrow AI is something that has been around for a while but I feel that /futurology has been a bit overly optimistic about how fast we will implement these machines. Or how quickly general AI will take off and be implemented. Some reasons why I see a slow adaptation of such technologies is mostly legal issues. For example, automating freight train conductors. Would I company risk derailment and damage just to save on conductor costs. I understand that team size can be reduced but I believe in such roles a human is needed regardless of error rate.

Do add in yours (will update those in this list).

[*] Smartphone as universal personal computing device - phone &amp; PC rolled into one. Wirelessly connected to TV/video monitors. Most software/apps on the cloud, downloadable-on-demand.

[*] 3D Digital Megaverse:

  -- Interconnected 3D virtual worlds consisting of any-to-any 3D marketplaces (both products &amp; services), social interactivity &amp; entertainment. Supplemented with AR.  Intermingling of culture and business. 2D web becomes 3D.

  -- VR &amp; AR headsets and smartphones used for traversing the 3D Megaverse.

[*]  AI:

  -- Self-driven vehicles help blind, disabled &amp; senior citizens commute independently, minimizing their dependencies on others.
 
  -- Personalized ""digital avatars"" manage ones virtual businesses (3D virtual stores &amp; offices) in the 3D Megaverse, with minimal guidance.

  -- ""Chatbots"" with high level of human-level intelligence &amp; conversational capabilities (speech recognition &amp; TTS).  They perform common information-based tasks such as shopping, trading, business-negotiations, traversing &amp; mining the web with customized queries.

  -- Robots perform routine household tasks such cooking, cleaning etc.  Robots learn new tasks by watching humans perform tasks, and then mimicking them.

[*] With AIs increasingly replacing many human jobs (whatever-can-be-automated-will-be-automated adage), traditional wealth creation methods fade away. New sources of wealth creation (which ones?) emerge. Governments implement ""minimum basic income"" policy?

[*] Advances in nanobiotehnology helps overcome the blood-brain barrier and deliver drugs to the brain, curing disorders such as MS, Alzheimers Parkinsons, brain tumors etc.

[*] 3D printing of most artificial organs &amp; limbs, transplantable to humans &amp; animals.

[*] Advances in conventional &amp; quantum computing helps in better understanding, simulating, modeling &amp; predicting complex systems such as weather, economic models, cognitive modeling, markets etc. Also helps solve the protein-folding problem. 

[*] Further reduction on dependence on fossil fuel. Increase in adoption of electric, solar &amp; nuclear energy.

[*] Cloud gaming becomes a reality, via Gigabit Internet.

[*] Drone deliveries.

[*] Commercial spaceflights.

[*] Mars colonization?

[*] Space elevators?

It completely changes the way humans live.

Throughout history, even the mightiest fortresses needed outside food supply to maintain itself, and unless the fort had access to water where smuggler ships could come and go, an unreinforced fort was eventually doomed.

VH eliminates the need to secure farmlands, dependence on farmers and need to import food to an area with a dense population,

and makes even the smallest location self-sufficient. 

In a popular uprising, the elites can hide in their compounds, and grow their own food via VH, and can stay there for as long as it is needed since they can grow their food without getting out of the compounds.

Small society based on little ships, or bigger ships like aircraft carriers, which are self-sufficient without having to stop in ports to get provisions will be possible.

With farming becoming obsolete, there is no need to treat farmhands well anymore; in fact there is no need for farmhands.

VH eliminates the need for farms, farm workers , farm equipments and everything associated with agriculture, so it is a true game-changer.

===

Now the warmists can't say that Florida will be underwater in ten years. That's way too soon and it'll blow their cover. The scientific community would forever lose their ability to exert political power ever again.

But there's another constraint: the warmists can't say that global warming will happen 1000 years from now or manifest only on a geological time scale. At that time scale, even if it would be disastrous for human civilization, government action would be rendered effectively pointless. Who knows what kind of government humans will have at that time, if we're not living in a Heinlein-style anarcho-capitalist libertarian space federation by then?

So what's the golden mean? 60 to 100 years. It's just short enough to encourage humanity to be on the threshold of political action to achieve world-wide one-party socialist government with pledged mindless obedience to whatever a panel of N scientists agree is reality by majority vote, and just long enough to cover their behind when none of their predictions materialize.",26,0,False,self,,,,,

If it could double up as a huge  array of solar panels which could provide cheap electricity both north and south of the border. 
The wall may end up paying for itself by providing cheap renewable electricity to households and industry in both countries. The wall could have multiple parallel layers in some areas and have accompanying wind turbines near costal areas and be used to power desalination plants in Mexico and California and it would have abundant available electricity to power cameras, sensors, electric fences, autonomous drones and whatever else they want to stick on to it. It would be bad news for illegal immigrants but fairly good news for everyone else and even be good for the environment and a much easier package for Trump to sell.
 It would certainly beat the hell out of putting up costly and largely functionless concrete slabs. I'm no expert on any of this so I'm really interested to hear what other readers think in terms of benefits and obstacles. ",41,6,False,self,,,,,

Part of the reason why I think candidates avoided this topic is because you can't pin the loss of jobs due to automation on any one political party. It's a bipartisan issue. The truck driving and taxi industries are on the verge of replacing their drivers with autonomous software, law firms are increasingly using AI, and ""lights-out"" factories are becoming more commonplace. Who can you blame for that? The corporations who saw the potential of AI? The programmers who designed it? Is it even productive to play the blame game for something as inevitable as technological progress?


President-Elect Trump has said many times that he wants to bring jobs back to America. I'm curious to know how he'll do that on a large scale without outlawing or otherwise hamstringing automation. If companies are forced to bring factories back to America because of tariffs or other trade restrictions, I'd bet money that the factories built in America will not bring many jobs to people - they'll mostly bring jobs to robots.


Ultimately, automation is a sort of 'solution' to the 'problem' of paying for laborers. If you were a corporation, why wouldn't you want to reduce or eliminate the costs of wages, office spaces, insurance, and retirement contributions? It's a no-brainer. Profit margin increases are what corporations are always striving for - they're not charities.
That being said, what's the endgame? Where does that put the American labor force? Sure, some people can learn new skills that contribute directly to further automation, but not everyone has the aptitude or will to do that.


Labor as we know it is becoming obsolete.


I've seen universal basic income (paid for via progressive income taxation) put on the table as a solution to income loss from automation. Corporations will fight this tooth and nail, I assure you. So...what do you think we should do? When robots and technology are smarter than us, are we still expected to pull ourselves up by our proverbial bootstraps? Why not let the robots do that for us? What solutions would YOU put forward?
I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the matter. ",24,14,False,self,,,,,

I think more specifically like a greenhouse effect yeah? Almost exactly like a greenhouse. An environment that is rich in CO2 levels and radiation from the sun. The overabundance of products that plants need to thrive on. And this is somehow bad because it's getting supposedly a little warmer? No, not desert warm, but greenhouse effect warm. I don't get it. I really don't get it. How is this bad? Yes maybe the polar ice caps are melting, maybe it's getting a little warmer (very little, check your facts), but all I see is the earth's atmosphere/environment/natural process has been partially sped up a miniscule bit to become this rich vegetacious (sp?) planet again. Remember we are still recovering from the ice age you know. And speaking of ages, when was the last time our earth was emitting an extreme overabundance of CO2 in the atmosphere? Let's see, it was a long time ago when the earth was young. The earth's crust was cooling off like crazy via certain ventilation pipes (volcanoes) and what was coming out of it? Oh yeah lots and lots of carbon into the atmosphere! What happened next? Oh just the periods of massive living things, including and especially plant life! Yes, the one great part of earth's history where giants roamed the earth (dinosaurs) and rainforests blanketed the entire globe.  That meant what then? Huh? What meant what? What do you mean? The products! The products of a huge amounts of CO2 greenhouse gases, sunlight, and eventually vast vegetation, what is the PRODUCT?!!  Oxygen for us and carbon utilization!

 But why is this bad? Because we are seeing change? We don't see progress right now, we see the ice caps melting, the environment changing, animal life dying, but we also see new species being discovered! Why is that? Well, long story short it's because of change! Hate to break it to you but earth has been constantly changing its environment long before we humans had arrived, changing the vegetation, changing its inhabitants, changing, yes, the global climate long before us. We've been here for a SPEC, a tiny little blot, on its overall time line and suddenly we have been here just long enough to see the changing clock's hands begin to move, begin to tick. And we are afraid. Afraid of what? That we broke the clock? That we might have sped it up? The former is impossible, the latter is probable but with little significance in the vast timeline. I think this all comes down to the fact that we are afraid of change. We need to look at the past (from the beginning) to see the BIG picture, the direction the earth is changing towards. It's not a desert of baron landscape we are headed towards if the atmosphere is changing into a greenhouse environment. A few fucking seeds in the ground of that type of environment will produce (overtime obviously) a luscious green one. Yes our marine algae is wasting away, the carbon is being released in the air /atmosphere BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT HALF THE FUCKING CIRCLE OF THE PROCESS!! we are not looking and learning from history! We are not taking into account that carbon goes in and out of the earth like the cycle of water, but slower and with greater change. My guess, the algae is dying because of change, but there will be more to come in the future, a different breed of algae that is more suited for the changing environment. We see change and we freak out and want to control it. Some people are capitalizing on our fear in hopes of trying to control the ticking of the global clock of change, but I'm afraid that fear is due to a misguided lack of knowledge of the big overall picture. Why do you think scientists are so divided on this issue (much more divided than the ""media"" says they are)? Let us not be afraid of change. Let us look and see the entire timeline.

a good inspiration for this is sci-fi, but I must admit I find it often laughable. for example Minority Report (2002) takes place in the year 2054, yet a lot of the tech in that movie is outdated even by today's standard

so here's my question, what technology might we see within the next 15 years (by say 2030) that nobody is even thinking of today or in the past, or that would for example be classified closer to magic than to sci-fi, or ""in a 1,000 years maybe""

here's my list
- Matrix (fusing our brain with a computer, direct data input and output, download a language or the ability to control a helicopter. telepathy also falls under this)
- teleportation (Stargate or ""beam me up"" variety, or other)
- faster than light transportation (or maybe that falls under teleportation)
- telekenesis (using energy to move matter)
- transforming matter (changing molecular composition I guess)

and crazier than that, stuff you don't find in sci-fi or X-Men comics. think introducing a smartphone to Atilla the Hunn, trying to predict what technology we might have millenia from now

the point of this exercise is that soon we'll have technology that we don't understand today, which will result in even more absurd technology, etc... meaning that in a matter of years or decades, technology will be so strange to us today that we'd never imagine it, or think of it as magic",15,6,False,self,,,,,

I do not know if this is the right subreddit, but I've seen this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG_oThcYsn0

I know it's fake and for a video game, but that kind of future isn't that unlikely to happen.

Here's my problem, I've been practicing since I was a child and I never got the chance to have a super ear, to have parents that helped me with my passion, I never had anything easy about it. I'm not a prodigy nor a genius but I still do it because I like it and that's pretty much all I've got in my life.

I'm just scared that one day, some guy somewhere will buy some robots hands and brain implants that will make him play way better than I do. I already feel cheated when I see a 4 years old chinese virtuoso...

Now I do now some people will lose their limbs due to accident, but to make them better human beings with implants just seems unfair to me. And I don't want to chop my hands to keep up with other people.

Our MOVIES, our NEWS, our POLITICS?

Mp3s have significantly lowered the quality of music we listen to (and we've grown to accept it for its convenience), digital cameras makes thousands of images that disappear in old hard drives or lost phones, email birthday greetings replace actual greeting cards, and when was the last time you wrote or received a hand-written letter?

When was the last time we listened to a whole album, in the order it was created, without skipping songs, the way the artist placed them on the record, reading along with the lyrics, sharing the music with a friend?

Even movies on a big screen are being replaced by views on a phone or tablet.

I'm a proponent of listening to vinyl on a real stereo and good speakers, creating photographs with a film camera and printing and framing actual photographs, and writing real letters and cards. Because all of the former ways to listen to music, make photographs, and write still exist.

If digital has an effect of making us accept lower quality, I wonder if it has an effect of making our whole world matter less. Does it make things seem cheap, and worthless? Does it create apathy? So that convenience trumps quality? Cheap made-in-China junk is the choice over a quality build from an artisan. Third-world labor-made clothing is the norm. Quick and cheap, regardless of quality, is what we seem to want. (I even see it in the photography and video industry--quality is not what matters most.)

We'll buy a new crappy patio set from Wal-Mart and it will look nice for a year, and fall apart by next year, so we'll buy another one. That's the model, instead of buying quality, we replace. We're not rich, but we look like it this year, until it all falls apart.

Is that America? Is the dream just that? Not real, just appearances. In 1959, a Swiss photographer, Robert Frank, published a book called THE AMERICANS, and it depicted the Americans he photographed in his travels across the U.S. on a Guggenheim grant. People panned it when it came out--surely America wasn't that ugly. The images in the book didn't match the image people had for America. But they were us. [https://www.lensculture.com/arti/robert-frank-the-americans]

I went to a local gala on Friday night and didn't bring a phone, and it felt like a treat to be disconnected from it. Phones consume our every waking hour. Mine, too.

They interrupt the silence on a walk or hike, at movies and shows, and dinner conversations with friends. They're in our way at events like concerts, weddings and fireworks shows by folks who feel the need to take something home, instead of experiencing it there. (Note: The bride and groom have a photographer there. Sit back and enjoy the event--be present!)

Are we missing the real thing because of the technology? When was the last time you were without your phone? What did that feel like?

Do you think this can continue, and are we better off with this electronic substitute for the things we used to be able to hold--records, photographs, letters?

Or does it cheapen things, even politics, so that we can end up with a game show host for a president?

While digital allows many conveniences and accesses, is it in some ways unhealthy for society? Does it allow for the instant spreading of misinformation, which can foster hatred or influence decisions, even important ones like in an election? Does instant news make us feel more unsafe, because we think the world is more dangerous with all the negative reports? Is it actually more unsafe? Or is the perception changed because of the onslaught of ""news""?

Seems like something has to change. Not to say that nothing good has come from digital technology, but are there negatives as well? And please tell me we're not going to still be crossing the street and almost getting hit because we're looking down at our phones in 20 years.",10,2,False,self,,,,,

Currently - we have a limited selection of fungi that are edible now - mainly Agaricus, Boletus [porcini] and Pleurotus species - seen in supermarkets globally.

Genetic engineering is a frequently-discussed topic on here, but I am turning the discussion towards genetically-engineered food.

Currently - in Europe at least - there has been a long-running debate over genetically-modified foods.

Would genetic engineering mean we could have an edible fungus that's brightly colored and looks like [Boletus pulcherrimus - also known as Deadly Bolete](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Boletus_pulcherrimus_21538_ed.jpg/800px-Boletus_pulcherrimus_21538_ed.jpg) or [Amanita brunnescens](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Amanita_brunnescens.jpg/1024px-Amanita_brunnescens.jpg).

Currently - outside of specialist cookery and local markets which source fungi from the wild [Central European countries, India, ASEAN nations], most people have a limited choice of fungi.

It could be interesting from a taste perspective - you could have a very sweet-tasting Boletus for use in salads or a very spicy brightly-colored Amanita for pizzas etc. 

I think this would be around the mid-2030s or 2040s for this, at an estimate for a possible timeline.

The public do have an interest in mushrooms - as cookery shows [on BBC1 and ITV1 have shown], and consumption of magic mushrooms [currently a legal gray area].

I would be interested to hear your opinions on this.",3,9,False,self,,,,,

Instead, we have been experiencing on mice for the past 30 years regarding stem cells and all those time we could have done something to slow old age on human, not mice. 

My prediction is in 10 years we can buy time like an additional 10 years for those under 30. In 50 years we will be able to reverse neural degeneration and have a gene programming class.

I've bought a few rental properties and am moving up to commercial development, but reading about automation, job loss, and the eventual robot takeover has got me wondering what the best bet is in the long run. Your thoughts?

Single-family houses may not be the way to go, as younger people don't seem to NEED their own house, own car, own everything and be single-handedly responsible for the maintenance the way generations past did. Low monthly payments (like Netflix) seems to be the way these days.

But what good is owning an apartment building if unemployment is so high people can't pay the rent? Maybe cater to the wealthy? Shared workspaces since solo-preneuring is on the rise?

Some parts of the world struggle to have electricity and running water, let along the Internet or a hybrid vehicle.

The future techs are advancing to a bunch of directions, but I think the ultimate goal should be conquest of space resources and control of space energy, so the game could continue forever.

The earth is too limited to run all the dream tech being developed now, and too much of its resources had been wasted for a bunch of useless things.

In a utilitarian way, conquest of space will yield the most benefits for investments; it will be similar to the story of Columbus and all the assorted explorers.

The piecemeal efforts of Elon Musk, who is the technological answer to PT Barnum, are not enough in my opinion. We need the globe to focus on this, rather than short-term social programs which will yield no permanent solutions.

Singularity, AGI, brain uploading, transhumanism, etc are all good but all of them are limited by the earth.

freeing some portions of humanity from the confines of the earth, and exploiting the resources of the space to fund even more grandiose Kardashev-2 type of projects, should be the goal of Future.

We're hearing more and more about how the majority of jobs are not safe, in the coming decades, due to automation. Many forecast this will lead to a universal wage. How do you guys think this will effect something like debt? For instance, I'm in college right now, and like most others, have accumulated debt. What would happen if someone was on the extreme end of the spectrum and has, say 6 figures in student debt, and suddenly (i know it won't be sudden) there's simply no room for growth? 

In a more generalized sense, what happens to just about every financial institution that thrives and profits from debt, when, simply put, people literally only have enough money to survive? I can only imagine the government would have to do some sort ig bail out, but then again, an almost entirely automated work force seems to put a wrench in all of this. It's one thing if there's a depression and jobs are scarce. It's a totally different thing when there's debt held over into a time where jobs are mostly gone, and are just not going to come back (at least not while automation makes paying regular salaries and wages costly and irresponsible, from a purely business/profit mindset)

Ok, I'm just rambling and at this point I barely asked my question. What do you guys and girls think? ",1,2,False,self,,,,,

It's the challenge that's been staring us in the face for the past 30 years. At one time in the ancient past Mars was very similar to the conditions of early earth. We now have ""eyes"" and ""ears"" on the surface of this new world. The Mars rovers have captured our imaginations. They genuinely are explorers in the old-fashioned sense.*
 
Thirty years ago Carl Sagan wrote these words, urging the continued funding of NASAs programs in the U.S. budget. 

However, there are obstacles that we still face exploring and understanding the Red Planet. To build on Mars, to stay on Mars, and ultimately, to expand to other worlds there are two primary insurmountable obstacles. First, the establishment of  a permanent presence in space requires the development of the space-based infrastructure of a multi-planetary civilization. We can see Mars with our ""eyes"" and ""ears""- our probes- but we can't physically reach it. Nor can we stay there until weve first established significant human enterprise, industry, and presence operating off of earth. 

The explorers of the first millennia of common era left for gold and treasures on ships of wood. The Mars rovers are truly explorers in the old-fashioned sense, collecting samples, observing alien worlds. However, the second insurmountable obstacle to the permanent human presence in space is the why? To explore, understand, and build on the Red Planet, we need an economic impetus to do so. 

The U.S. is the worlds leading aerospace manufacturer surpassing Russia and China. We lead the globe in exploration of the solar system and development of commercial, military, and communication satellites. Private US-based institutions such as SpaceX and Orbital Sciences with 500 person companies have done what entire nations in Europe cannot; reach the moon. 

We can reach the Moon and Mars, but it seems we cant, and dont, stay long. Instead, we spend billions of dollars leaving and returning again. What then, is the next step? How do we maintain a human presence off of earth? How can we access the resources of the Solar System if we cant stay in space any longer than it takes for the trip there and back again?

In the past half century, weve had three real answers to this question: the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, the Skylab, and the Freedom. All projects towards permanent habitable space stations. Yet, all three projects were canceled due to financial obstacles. 

With one exception. 

The Freedom Space Station project launched in 1994 was eventually converted into a larger Space Station still in operation today, known under a different name. Accompanied by a canceled Russian Federal Space Agency space station project, MIR-2, the Freedom and MIR-2 modules were integrated, ultimately becoming the Russian Orbital Segments and American Orbital Segments of the I.S.S. These canceled Russian and American projects formed the first joint international undertaking off the earth in the history of the world; the International Space Station. 

Can the U.S. maintain its place during the expansion of our civilization as a leader of the development of space-based industry? The answer is the same as the answer to the question, Who will be the first to expand and tap the resources of the solar system? Currently, half the ISS is dedicated towards Russian operations and the other half is divided amongst the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), European Space Agency (ESA), Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). America is the worlds leading aerospace manufacturer and yet is also the worlds most underrepresented nation in space. Our leading companies, our brightest minds, and our revolutionary technologies are outsourced to foreign countries for their own projects. 

What then, is the next step? Could the U.S. create its own space station? Lets imagine it. The space station - let's call it the American Space Station, the A.S.S.- would legally operate the way Tiangong 1 does. Tiangong 1, translating to Heavenly Palace, is the only other manned station in space besides the ISS. Tiangong 1 has a handful of modules and 2 sleeping stations and is small, but nonetheless, is an entity of the Chinese government. An easy if not entirely semantically correct way to think about it is that Tiangong 1 is a city of China, in space.

ASS will be the American counterpart, the city in space, a design forecasted by NASA for a 1000-person space station settlement a quarter of a century ago. Our ASS should not only be intended as a scientific laboratory, but as a central location for U.S. economic activities such as asteroid mining and space solar power (1). This new space station's primary purpose would be to generate space-based industry, providing burgeoning enterprises with the resources to initiate economic activity off of earth. With the development of space-based economic activities such as space solar power and asteroid mining, emerging industries can lead to the creation of technology that will simultaneously facilitate the accessibility of space. 

Currently, it costs millions of dollars to send a pound of anything into space, whether it's computers, water, or personnel. Space solar power is an economic impetus that could lead to sustainable and renewable energy that does not emit greenhouse gases, hazardous waste, is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and in huge quantities. Additionally, asteroid mining can bring rare-earth metals and resources within our grasp, materials that are in limited supply on earth, used in everything from electric vehicles to computer chips. Resources that could be mined or extracted include iron, nickel, titanium, water, rare-earth metals, and also oxygen to sustain the lives of astronauts on-site, as well as hydrogen and oxygen for use as rocket propellant. In space exploration, using resources gathered while on a journey is referred to as in-situ resource utilization; eliminating the need for billion-dollar-chemically-based rockets to bring such necessities from Earth. 
These space-based industries are our frontier, the new frontier, our modern manifest destiny! Building a home amongst the stars can not only lead to the construction of the technology of easier ways of getting off the earth and tapping that ASS, but new ways of thinking about space travel like non-rocket space launches, a geosynchronous orbital tether, or even the laser propelled lightcraft (2) .

Having a big A.S.S would not be as simple as sitting down on the porcelain throne to build a log cabin. The ASS will task us to create new space-based industries and catalyze a new frontier of economic activity with a dedicated human presence in space. Imagine drastically reducing the financial burden of maintaining satellites in space. Imagine being able to build ships while in space as opposed to launching them from the earth and battling the clutches of gravity. Imagine the military advantage of a space station that can strike any position on the globe. Imagine 1000 Americans in space on an American Space Station in a new branch of the military, neither the Army, Marines, Air Force, nor Navy; but Orbital Forces.
Most importantly, we shouldnt have to wipe our ASS like we wiped the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, the Skylab, and the Freedom station projects. An ASS may create unprecedented economic opportunities off of earth we've never before considered, which in turn could lead up to an even larger ASS. Ultimately, having our ASS(es) up there in space is not only a step for American industry tapping the resources of the solar system, but another big step for humanity becoming a multi-planetary civilization and one day reaching and staying on the Red Planet.

Footnotes: 


(1) Unlike terrestrial solar and wind power, unlike oil, gas, ethanol, nuclear plants, and coal plants, space solar power does not emit greenhouse gases, hazardous waste, is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in huge quantities. It works regardless of cloud cover, daylight, or wind speed. Further, space solar power can be exported to virtually any place in the world, and its energy can be converted for local needs  such as manufacture of methanol for use in places like rural India where there are no electric power grids. Space solar power can also be used for desalination of sea water  including the agricultural development of previously barren, open land. Lastly, space solar power can provide a market large enough to develop the low-cost space transportation system that is required for its deployment. This, in turn, will also bring the resources of the solar system within economic reach.


(2) Laser propulsion is in early stages of development. Lightcraft uses an external source of laser or maser energy to provide power for producing thrust. The laser/maser energy is focused to a high intensity in order to create a plasma. The plasma expands, producing thrust.

We have the very real possibility of being alive during the creation/development of two things that are going to change what it means to be human in some very fundamental ways. Those two things are the biological revolution that may bring about an end to aging and the birth of artificial general intelligence which in its essence is the creation of a species far superior to our own. There is also the distinct possibility that these two things will merge endowing our consciousness with bodies that will never die and giving us access to intelligence that will allow us to comprehend all that there is to know.

Now all of that in it of itself is a lot to unpack and I could go on and on and on about all the reasons why they are possible in our lifetime. But I'm just going to assume for the sake of this piece that they are possible and that they will happen. What does that mean?

It means that of all the generations of people that have ever lived (83,000 generations to be exact) our generation is the generation that will experience the most important things to have ever happened. I know every generation might believe that their time is or was the most important, but comparing all the generations objectively, the things that will be accomplished in our generation are by far the biggest things.

Why is it that our generation is the one experiencing all of this? How is it that of all the people that have ever lived it is up to us to figure out how to deal with all this craziness?

Well, there are only two options, it's a complete coincidence, or its not. The first few times I thought about it I just believed, okay, the chances of all this happening during my life is very very very small but it just kind of is what it is. It must just be a coincidence that its happening during my life, that seemed to be the only logical answer.

But I'm not so sure anymore.

Now, how could it not be a coincidence and what in the fuck does that mean?

I gotta admit here that I don't feel qualified to answer this question myself so I'll be deferring to a collection of ideas from people who have thought about this problem a lot longer than I have. To begin with it is important to understand that our DNA, which is responsible for making us everything that we are and endowing us with everything that we know, is really just information, a collection of chemicals dubbed A, C, G, and T that arranged themselves in just the right way to give birth to life and everything we know. As far as we can tell, their original arrangement was a complete coincidence and it has survived ever since because of a property of the universe called evolution by natural selection. (If you want to learn more about this stuff I highly recommend reading The Gene by Siddhartha Mukherjee, I've read it three times already)

But what about the universe itself? Life needed a universe to live in otherwise of course it too would never be. So what is the universe? Well this is where our knowledge begins to fail us and our best guesses are just guesses, but they are very interesting guesses. Our best theory that brings it all together is string theory, and a growing number of leading string theorists, when they dissect the equations that govern its function find that it too at its core is comprised of bits of information, some, though certainly not all, have gone as far as to say that it looks exactly like computer programming code. (Look up Dr. James Gates Jr. for more)

Then there is simulation theory, which essentially states that civilization eventually gets to a point that it becomes so technologically advanced that it is able to make computational models of reality that mimic reality in every conceivable way (think of it like a super advanced version of the game Sims) and that the characters in that model would have no way of knowing that they live in a program. Those characters would then evolve over time until they themselves are able to make programs that make programs that make programs down and down into an infinite recursive loop. The most prominent proponent of this being Elon Musk who said something like ""there is a 1 in a billion chance that we are living in base reality"".

What I add to that idea, and which I haven't seen anywhere else but I'm sure I'm not the first to think about is this. Where would 'they', whoever or whatever they are, start the program? At the big bang? At the beginning of life? At the beginning of consciousness? At the beginning of your life? It's even possible to think that the program is just running in your head and everything that you see and experience is just happening in your brain.

It would certainly explain why all of the craziest shit that has ever happened is happening in your lifetime. I also have yet to add to this all what neuroscience is now telling us about how our brains work, that when you delve deep into it it seems to just be a quantum computer.

So it all comes down to this, either there is a 1 in 83000 chance that this all happening to us and it is just a coincidence that we are the ones living through the most rapid evolution in the 3.7 billion year history of life on earth(I didn't even add to that fraction the millions of generations of human's ancestors or the chance of humans existing at all) or none of this is reality.

But at the end of the day it probably doesn't make much sense to spend too much time thinking about all of this because ultimately whether or not reality is real or it just feels like it is real it is still the world that we live in and for now at least it is all that we can know, I think.",25,3,False,self,,,,,

Step 1?: Conduct thorough comprehensive geologic modeling of planet including its magnetohydrodynamics for simulation. 

Generate scenarios in which upon impact from a known body of mass and composition to cause the planet to have an increased magnetic field.

Nothing new there, we've been aware of this for centuries. However, technological development is accelerating- which reinforces the contrast between technology and character- and we are clearly entering a period in which the global order that has dominated since 1945 is falling apart. 

If you don't agree with that, don't bother responding- this post isn't for you. 

If you do agree, then lets discuss potential responses to this crisis. I'd argue that the problem isn't intelligence- most people are intelligent enough to perform the basic tasks of life and learn moderately complex tasks. They just aren't intelligent enough to identify, understand and correct for their biases. The problem is that intelligence bloomed within a particular evolutionary context and the species that pulled ahead of the others finds it easy to consider the humanity of individuals outside of their social circle (i.e. tribe) to be irrelevant. Add in a tendency towards obedience towards an alpha male and you get a species capable of extraordinary brutality towards each other. 

Kept to the level of individuals with only primitive weapons, this situation is sad but doesn't effect the survival of the species. Put a variety of tools for destruction in their hands, create communication systems that reinforce the biases of their group, and allow inequality to reach a point where economic uncertainty is common, and you have the potential for elimination of the species or its civilization. 

Again, if you disagree, I don't care. 

For me, it follows that the human character needs to be modified before it does more harm. The propensity for violence needs to be minimized, the tendency towards empathy must be reinforced, the acceptance of gross inequality must be tempered. If not, at the very least we are in for tremendous suffering, at worst we risk the end of our global civilization and possibly extinction. That would be a shame because we are clearly kicking ass in the knowledge and technology department. We face the possibility of killing ourselves (and/or our civilization) just as space colonization is becoming realistic. 

I want to put aside the morality of manipulating human character for now. If the species is in danger then manipulating individuals is an acceptable response. 
 
The question I want to discuss is much narrower: what technology is most likely to make the required changes? If we could identify a genetic basis for the character traits of interest, then it seems we have the ability to edit the somatic cell-lines using something like CRISPR. However, I know many good people with abhorrent parents and so my intuition is that the genetics of character aren't simple enough to manipulate them to significant effect over a short time period. There seems to be evidence that psychedelics are capable of making short term changes in character that are generally in the same direction as the changes we want. Perhaps a series of micro-doses distributed in such a way to minimize the probability of overdoses? Other pharmaceutical approaches- i.e. antidepressants or mood stabilizers? 

Again, if you don't agree with my premises, I don't care. I am only interested in discussing the possibility of technical fixes. 

Finally, I hope that I'm not the only one thinking about this. If you're a silicon valley billionaire with an underground lair where scientists are slaving away to develop a vaccine for ""humanness"" then 1) congratulations on your vision and 2) I know of an individual with a PhD and no moral qualms with regard to your project. I'm assuming you can find a way to find me.

Oddly, the voices of the working class whose jobs are vulnerable to automation are largely missing from the conversation but if they did find the time from their day-to-day labors to comment, they would vehemently reject the concept of universal basic income as it stands today. 



Despite the appeal of a guaranteed income independent of ones labor, there remains the stubbornly true fact that once UBI is adopted, it will signify the ultimate one-way ticket out of the economy for countless millions of workers. While a better alternative than unemployment and the misery of poverty, it presents the dilemma of opting to participate in a grand social shift to a 21st century version of an economic caste system with no way out. The decisions of one generation stripping away any chance of economic freedom for future progeny. 



Let us not forget to consider the immense and socially volatile wealth gap the adoption of UBI would create in a society largely expunged from economic participation. The wealthy would not be the focus of political campaigns the likes of Bernie Sanders but of a society cognizant and openly resentful of them. 



Ultimately universal basic income is an unavoidable necessity. A necessity whose terms ought to be solely determined by the working poor, not by tight-knit circles of wealthy and powerful elites.

It will take longer to release new chips, and that chips are nearing the physical barriers for reducing their size.

https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601102/intel-puts-the-brakes-on-moores-law/

Now I never realised how Intel might actually have artificially kept Moore's law alive, by matching its development cycles, which causes its competitors to follow it.

However the fact that intel is slowing down, might actually be a good thing for Moore's law, and for the market. That's because this failure to compete will just allow its competitors to step in and take over.

For example Apple releases a new iPhone every year, and its competitors follow at a similar speed. But if Apple decides to release a new phone every 2 years, would its competitors follow its example? Hell no, they'd keep releasing more advanced models every year, while the iPhone would be outdated by the time it reaches the public, because it's based on 2 years old technology and thinking. Which today is a hell of a long time.

Intel is the market leader, but technology has shown it can bring companies to glory or to failure almost overnight. By slowing down, Intel will simply give its competitors more chances to compete by using their more flexible speed. Many will likely fail, but if any do succeed, the winnings could be enormous.

The other thing is that Google and Facebook are starting to look at developing their own chips, which is a huge threat to Intel. Combined with AI, Google especially might decide they can do the job better. Or back someone else that can.",12,2,False,self,,,,,

IMO, innovation, the advancement of technology, and the advancement of life itself is being held up by those in charge (lawmakers, C-level execs, etc.).  2016 is almost over and I feel like we are so far behind.  I can't say that, as a whole, we are underachieving.  I can say that, as a whole, we are being held back.  For what reason?  I don't  know.  Maybe it's because of greed, power, selfishness.

So, what can we do to speed up innovation?  What can we do to force companies to provide us with significant advancements in their products at least once a year instead of once every three to four years?  I don't know about you, but I want to see transportation that involves fully-automated vehicles that are solar powered.  I want to see smart homes that are able to communicate with each other and with utility companies without requiring any human interaction.  I'd like to see a world where, due to the advancements of technology, everyone has access to the bare necessities ie. food, water, clothing, shelter, etc.

In my opinion, we can't move forward until we accept that our current pace is unacceptable and downright shameful.  We also have to change the curriculum that is being taught in schools.  We need to change the approach we are taking to educate the youth in this world.  STEM is a step in the right direction.  Instead of teaching subjects like American history where the content is debatable and opinionated, we should teach students about history related to the advancements of technology.

Aside from accepting that our current pace of advancement sucks and that our current educational system that not provide a stable structure for advancement, we should establish groups locally that will push lawmakers, companies, etc. to speed up societal innovations.

I hope I'm here to see this world change drastically.  And I hope that I'm not too old to enjoy these advancements in technology when they do occur.",9,0,False,self,,,,,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly; for those unfamiliar, a ""NetNavi"" is a sentient, or semi-sentient, computer program with a virtual body and artificial intelligence designed to be an assistant for the operator. While they can form strong friendships with their Operators, they are still assistants at their core. They currently only exist in the MegaMan Battle Network universe and not in real life.

However, with new A.I assistants like Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and the upcoming Amelia, we can see the demand for human-like A.I assistants rising quickly.

Imagine always having a digital friend at your side 24/7. You could work together on projects, play games together or just have discussions and everyone could have their own NetNavi. All these reasons are why I believe that NetNavis will be a thing.

So, what do you guys think? Will ""NetNavis"" ever be real, and if so, what technology do we require for them to be?",5,0,False,self,,,,,

Capitalism is good at financing projects, but it is so 18th-century and I think its model won't be sufficient to support technology which has made labor obsolete, and soon will make 'land' obsolete as well and only Capital will remain.

Capital will make most of humanity irrelevant, and only owners of capital will be allowed to partake in the exponential growth which will be enjoyed by less than 50 million people. Their servants, hangars on, etc will be allowed to 'smell' it.

As most jobs are automated, about 95-99% of all human population will have no jobs, and no income.

Anyone with even the slightest defect will not be employed, and it is predicted that genetic scanning will soon be implemented to weed out those who could develop disease later and become a liability to the company, which is already done in Asia where profiling is not illegal.

http://greyenlightenment.com/jobless-america/

Today's class division and wealth disparity will be permanent. it will make the 1910s look like a very egalitarian society.

With no more mass consumption, today's capitalist model will probably change since those who own the means of production will start to think that paying interest to the banks, and other financial institutions will be a waste of money.

At some point, I think these tech lords will decide to opt out from the banking system and eventually from governments, to avoid having to support the billions of people who no longer have any place in economy. 


Or they would just , literally, take over the government and disestablish things they don't like.

With all resources now controlled by the technofeudal lords who no longer have to deal with taxes, interests, employment regulations and any kind of restrictions, all resources will be concentrated on developing the techs, and the technofeudal lords would be attacking stars within this century.

My life was not miserable nor was there any great problems created by a lack of a real economy. 

I at times had to be embarrassed because people in my home town have little value for work. And the ones that do quickly leave. 

What boggles my mind is after lifetime of being told there was something inherently wrong with our way of life and that it would never last, people are acting like we need to think outside the box, synergize, embrace ubi, etc to solve this problem. 

Now approaching 30 I realize what my dads generation knew as newfie life, has become the norm. 

What really shocks me isnt that the world must embrace our way of life, is that people in the city thought their way of life was so superior in contrast to what I saw as normal.

USAID Partners with Silicon Valley to Fight Global Food Insecurity  0
BY YVIE YAO ON	NOVEMBER 23, 2016 TECH AND SOLUTIONS
REDWOOD CITY, California  On June 2, 2016, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) hosted the Low-Cost Sensors for Agriculture workshop at the Omidyar Network in Redwood City, California.

The workshop assembled participants from the private sector, NGOs and the government who work at the intersection of technology and agriculture. These participants identified obstacles and potential opportunities for collaboration to accelerate the impact of sensors on improving agriculture and food security in developing contexts. Their meeting sent a powerful message to the public: USAID is looking to Silicon Valley for partners to tackle global food insecurity.

Thanks to the increase in smartphone adoption in the developing world over the last five years, the worlds 1.5 billion smallholder farmers are now more likely to use the technology-powered solutions Silicon Valley companies can provide. The rise of technology has also changed the outlook on global food insecurity through new strategies for investments, loans and credit.

The new partnership to solve global food insecurity is another example of USAIDs commitment to relying on entrepreneurship to fulfill development goals. After the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit, USAID pledged $38 million to help innovators fight global poverty.

According to Darren Sabo of Orange Silicon Valley, a San Francisco-based innovation center for the telecom Orange Group, Silicon Valley loves big meaningful challenges, and using technology to support local agricultural communities throughout the world with the potential to revolutionize the global food system is nothing short of an enormous challenge.

Silicon Valley is known for its rapidly scalable technology solutions, which can sometimes be difficult to translate to developing countries due to a range of challenges from regulation to infrastructure.

They need to carefully consider the constraints to adoption in resource-limited markets, said Josette Lewis, associate director of the World Food Center at the University of California Davis.

To convince Silicon Valley to join the search for global food security solutions, USAID convened one-on-one meetings, intimate forums and trips to introduce it to the unique challenges and opportunities in emerging market economies.

According to Stanford University professor Marshall Burke, [The Bureau for Food Security team] is very honest about their need for more data and analytics to understand whether they are having an impact and targeting the right people.

One example of a successful project is the Senekela Orange Mali Initiative, which provides farmers with data on commodities via text and voice messages. USAID understands the laws, regulations and stakeholders needed to bring the solution to market and is helping translate the technology into real opportunities to ensure long-term sustainability in developing countries.

The agency also expressed its hope for the emergence of more homegrown entrepreneurs in the developing world. Such entrepreneurs could revolutionize how food is provided and how solutions are financed, distributed and sold.

USAID is partnering with the accelerator 500 Startups to host an investor tour, Geeks on a Plane, in 2017. Silicon Valley leaders will visit Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa to identify potential homegrown innovators in whom to invest.

The agency also hopes to draw more allies into this inclusive network of agriculture innovators and build long-term collaborative relationships with companies in Silicon Valley to seek solutions for global food security.

According to Alison Eskesen, director at Grow Asia, an organization working to enable sustainable and inclusive agricultural development, Partnering with the private sector is not about funding; its collaboration, aligning interest and trust.

I pointed out to the Mods that a previous discussion on the future of religion didn't get ""rule 2"", and got a reply ""approved"", so I'm guessing I can try again.

So I'm going to build on this discussion of the future of religion: https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3de613/future_of_religion/

And here's my idea, what if AI is worshipped as a God, or at least becomes a religion? Because by most definitions, it will be an all powerful and all knowing superhuman being, a master of creation. Sounds like a God to me.

Here's on definition: ""the Being perfect in power, wisdom, and goodness who is worshipped as creator and ruler of the universe""

A highly advanced AI could in fact match this description, having perfect logic, wisdom, goodness (that's a relative concept)... It might be able to rule the universe (changing laws of physics, altering planets, etc), and it could create new ones.

Another point is that for example Christ is worshipped as the son of god because he performed a number of miracles: healing the sick, walking on water, multiplying food, changing matter, defying death... all abilities that an advanced AI will likely be able to mimic to some degree.

Ironically science has always questioned the existence of a Godly creature, but through AI might end up creating one.

It is my views that humans have a tendency to adhere to the idea of a superhuman authority, something to believe in. Be it religion, parents, science... And AI could very easily fill this need. If only because it would also have the ability to communicate with every human being, at the same time, and employ its superhuman powers and intelligence to help us (or punish us). Why pray to a god you've never seen when the real thing is standing in front of you?

Plus with its superhuman intelligence the AI is likely to figure out quite easily how to make people worship it. Human masses aren't exactly known for their smart behavior.",34,0,False,self,,,,,

However, isn't there a step in between narrow and general where an AI can perform a wide range of tasks, but isn't general? My two examples are Deepmind and ibms Watson. 

Watson can answer jeopardy questions, create recipes, write music, forecast weather, be a teaching assistant, diagnose disease, etc. 

Deepmind can play a wide range of video games and board games, read lips, run Google servers, recognize images, examine eye scans, etc. 

I was under the impression that narrow ai meant it was good at one thing. But these programs can probably do dozens or hundreds of things. But they aren't necessarily general ai. But they are much more advanced than deep blue which could only do one thing. 

Is it more that narrow ai leads to less and less narrow ai until you have general ai? Like a continuum instead of a major jump from narrow to general?

The Future of the Brain by Gary Marcus and Jeremy Freeman- A collection of essays from leading neuroscientists speculating as to which techniques currently being developed will be the most impactful. Very technical and not accessible to most people but incredibly salient as the greatest scientific advances in the 21st century will come from our understanding of how our brains work.

Industries of the Future by Alec Ross  Using a wide breadth of knowledge accumulated from his time travelling and working directly under Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State, Alec Ross details which industries are undergoing the most change and gives international insight into how these changes will effect different regions of the globe.

It protects both privacy and security and underwent unprecedented scrutiny before becoming law.

The Government is clear that, at a time of heightened security threat, it is essential our law enforcement, security and intelligence services have the powers they need to keep people safe.

The Investigatory Powers Act transforms the law relating to the use and oversight of Investigatory powers. It strengthens safeguards and introduces world-leading oversight arrangements.

The Act does three key things. First, it brings together powers already available to law enforcement and the security and intelligence agencies to obtain communications and data about communications. It makes these powers  and the safeguards that apply to them  clear and understandable.

Second, it radically overhauls the way these powers are authorised and overseen. It introduces a double-lock for the most intrusive powers, including interception and all of the bulk capabilities, so warrants require the approval of a Judicial Commissioner. And it creates a powerful new Investigatory Powers Commissioner to oversee how these powers are used.

Third, it ensures powers are fit for the digital age. The Act makes a single new provision for the retention of internet connection records in order for law enforcement to identify the communications service to which a device has connected. This will restore capabilities that have been lost as a result of changes in the way people communicate.

Public scrutiny

The Bill was subject to unprecedented scrutiny prior to and during its passage. 
The Bill responded to three independent reports: by David Anderson QC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation; by the Royal United Services Institutes Independent Surveillance Review Panel; and by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament. All three of those authoritative independent reports agreed a new law was needed. 

The Government responded to the recommendations of those reports in the form of a draft Bill, published in November 2015. That draft Bill was submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament. The Intelligence and Security Committee and the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee conducted parallel scrutiny. Between them, those Committees received over 1,500 pages of written submissions and heard oral evidence from the Government, industry, civil liberties groups and many others. The recommendations made by those Committees informed changes to the Bill and the publication of further supporting material.

A revised Bill was introduced in the House of Commons on 1 March, and completed its passage on 16 November, meeting the timetable for legislation set by Parliament during the passage of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014. Over 1,700 amendments to the Bill were tabled and debated during this time.

The Government has adopted an open and consultative approach throughout the passage of this legislation, tabling or accepting a significant number of amendments in both Houses of Parliament in order to improve transparency and strengthen privacy protections. These included enhanced protections for trade unions and journalistic and legally privileged material, and the introduction of a threshold to ensure internet connection records cannot be used to investigate minor crimes.

Privacy and Oversight

The Government has placed privacy at the heart of the Investigatory Powers Act. The Act makes clear the extent to which investigatory powers may be used and the strict safeguards that apply in order to maintain privacy.

A new overarching privacy clause was added to make absolutely clear that the protection of privacy is at the heart of this legislation. This privacy clause ensures that in each and every case a public authority must consider whether less intrusive means could be used, and must have regard to human rights and the particular sensitivity of certain information. The powers can only be exercised when it is necessary and proportionate to do so, and the Act includes tough sanctions  including the creation of new criminal offences  for those misusing the powers. 
The safeguards in this Act reflect the UKs international reputation for protecting human rights. The unprecedented transparency and the new safeguards  including the double lock for the most sensitive powers  set an international benchmark for how the law can protect both privacy and security.

&gt; capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system, and competitive markets.

Let's check if capitalism can survive in the pre-Singularity world.
 
*Private ownership of the means of production?*

Yes, we'll still have it, at least in the form of owning your private self-made software and your augmented body.

*Profit?*

Yes. Even in the post-scarcity society you'll still be able to sell your unique creative works and services, as they're scarce.

*Private property?*

Yes. At minimum, you'll have your body and your private creative works (which you may or may not share with others). And if it's not some communist dictatorship, you'll own other things like houses, precious metals etc.  

*Capital accumulation?*

Yes. It's possible even in the post-scarcity society, at least in the form of reputation / influence. Also accumulation of private software / data.

*Voluntary exchange?*

Yes. To some extend it's possible even in the most extreme forms of dictatorship.

*Wage labor?*

Yes. If voluntary exchange of scarce things exist, then some form of wage labor will exist too. Although it could be optional and very rare in comparison with the today's world.

*Price system and competitive markets?*

Yes. If there are scarce things, then there'll be a system for the valuation and distribution of them. And competitive markets is the best way to do it - at least till the creation of AGI.
