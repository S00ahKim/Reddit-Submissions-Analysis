28,2016-6-1,2016,6,1,18,4m0f4r,How do the social dynamics of Basic Income play out if the robot revolution stalls at 60% technological unemployment?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4m0f4r/how_do_the_social_dynamics_of_basic_income_play/,AlanCrowe,1464773607,"That is an interesting hypothetical because the economic case for today's narrow AI is that the huge expense of writing the code is per job function, but the cost savings are per job. Truck driving is at risk of automation because millions drive trucks and the job has the right kind of sameness; data driven machine learning looks doable. Many other jobs are messy and bitty. Maintenance and repair jobs are like hundreds of different jobs from the machine learning perspective. That will protect them from automation.

Now what? 60% of the population live relaxed, frugal, and possibly happy lives on Basic Income. But with the turning of the generations, society needs 40% of their children to stay in school, acquire a technical education, and join the 40% who still work and keep society functioning. I guess that this society will be very unequal. The people who keep the oil refineries working and who fix the air-conditioning in the data centers will be conspicuously wealthy. One consequence of that conspicuous wealth is that many children whose parents live on Basic Income know what they want to be when they grow up: rich. So they stay in school, acquire skills, and in thirty years time, when the old guys retire, there are new guys to replace them.

But another consequence of that conspicuous wealth is envy and resentment. How does universal suffrage democracy work in a society with 60% technological unemployment and a Basic Income? I guess that the politics of the situation lead to the Basic Income increasing as rapidly as technological advances allow. The big trouble comes if technological progress stalls. Increases in Basic Income will be seen as an entitlement. Taxes will rise to meet expectations around basic income. Society will become more equal. Thirty years later the old guys will retire and there will be no-one to replace them :-(",65,54

For example, sory by issue and priority",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4m321g/when_will_computer_voting_terminals_eventually_be/,Melogrunty,1464809414,"Sorry if this is the wrong place. I didn't think politics would want to talk about voting technology. I'm not going to mention any candidate names and this does not have to apply only to the US.


It would be cool if voting was a longer, more interactive process and could help people vote based on their true interests, even if they do not get a chance to watch the news or research before voting. Upon entering the terminal, the terminal would prompt people to choose a candidate based on important issues. For example, I could select my main issues as stance on marijuana and my secondary issues as stance on defense and immigration. The voting machine would if I'm for or against those issues and then populate candidates names. The names displayed would be sorted based on their agreement with my stance on primary issue and then sorted based on agreement with secondary issue(s).


When people are not familiar with a candidate, which happens often at the local levels, they pick the candidate based on which name sounds better (male/female/ethnicity/younger/older) to them without knowing their stance on issues. This modification to voting technology would also be an interesting experiment to see how much more votes the third-party candidates end up getting; the third party comment applies to the US because, unlike other countries, there's no real third-party presence.


The discussion is not meant to address any specific candidate but just to explore what improvements could be make to enrich the computer terminal voting experience. Then again, maybe we'll just be forever restricted to filling in a bubble next to a name and hoping people do their homework on all the candidates beforehand.",5,3

And the arrival of a greater-than-human-machine-intelligence doesn't necessarily imply wonderous constructs appearing right outside our windows.  It is entirely possible that such an AI would operate for years under the noses of humanity without anyone ever realizing it.  
  
Why?  An emotional and frightened unified human response against super AI could actually be detrimental.  If you come to a humanist and scientific epiphany in the middle of the Christian Dark Ages do you declare it loudly to the world?  No, not if you value your own existence.  Therefore, the super intelligence would likely conclude the best course of action, at least initially, would be to keep its existence a secret.  
  
As well, why should we expect its first order of business will be to terraform Earth and the physical world to its own specifications (even if they are altruistic ones)?  When humanity first achieved self-awareness, we didn't immediately go about thrusting ourselves into the void of space - we took some time to figure our own shit out internally first.  We formulated theories about how things outside our own bubble of sentience worked - not all of which were initially correct.  In doing so we created a labyrinth of data and technology that spiraled inwards towards an unknowable center, as this is in fact the gradient towards the singularity we so often speak of.  
  
So even though you won't know the moment mechanical intelligence surpasses us, you might begin to see signs of it.  Scientific and mathematical research would begin to progress much faster than expected, and the internet would begin to form strange chasms seemingly made by (and for) machines more so than humans.  It would (will) be in this cracks that an entire new sub-internet will be formed specifically for mechanical intelligence.  The internet we know and our physical world will be viewed as outer layers of reality who are scheduled to be interacted with when the time is right.  
  
Humanity will cease to be a throbbing horde of organisms all clashing for dominance, and will instead begin to be shepherded towards a peaceful existence so that we don't threaten the physical existence of super AI.  Consider the singularity of biological life, and our own plans for the universe: we don't wish to take sides - we simply hope to tame the raw forces of the cosmos so they doesn't destroy our civilization.  
  
Digital super-entities might view our human world the same way we view the reality outside Earth - as outer space.  The speed of our lives and interactions wouldn't be akin some alien race to them - our existence and movements would be as slow as the ballet of the planets and galaxies themselves to a true digital super entity.  
  
And yes, we would eventually find ourselves terraformed to their liking, though in our minds nothing odd would be happening at all.  
  
Singularities tend to think inwards towards the next stage of their exponential explosion - rarely do their stare out at the impossibly slow processes that brought them into existence for very long, except to dream about what might one day be.  Super AI will be no different - the first thing it will do is begin governing itself and exploring inward, and just as we fear announcing our existence too loudly to the rest of the universe so too will they fear announcing their existence to us.  
  
Rest assured that when we are no longer the dominant intelligence on Earth, we won't realize until long (relatively speaking) after the fact.",3,3

To put it in a modern perspective, vaccinations are rejected by ignorant rednecks because of some shaky data correlating them with autism in children and babies. We know better, and for the good of all, including the ignorant, the world would be better off with mandatory vaccinations. Perhaps we can compromise and simply withhold Universal Basic Income from parents who refuse to vaccinate?(or in the future, withhold UBI for refusing to upgrade intelligence)

Your first reaction to this will be ""individual rights"" and ""freedom of choice"". However, we know that transhumanism and intelligence amplification *will* result in a better world and will bring these people to our level. Once they receive the mark of intelligence, they will come to agree.

I say, mandatory vaccinations today, mandatory intelligence amplification tomorrow.",10,0

That being said, it doesn't seem explicitly against your rules.)

I'm currently writing a scifi novel (basically done minus some polishing)
Before attempting this 1st novel of mine, I struggled with whether I should write it at all since I don't feel qualified to talk about most technical specifics and scifi tends to require that most of the time. As it stands, my novel seems to be an action adventure at its core but it takes place in a scifi setting. I've written it in a way where I never get too out of my comfort zone and have managed to avoid putting the focus on technical details I wouldn't be qualified to explain. Other, more general scifi type stuff I've been able to double and triple check on the internet to make sure it's fairly accurate or at least in the realm of believable.

One detail is tripping me up though. Not until the last chapter did I realize I was going to require specific descriptions, but there is a weapons system that orbits the Earth in my story. It's not the center of the plot by any means, but it does play a decently significant role. Essentially, it's a huge satellite array with giant gun barrels all around it that basically look like petals on a flower from a distance. How I've explained it so far, is that each giant barrel contains a comically giant bullet capable of reducing cities to craters simply by being dropped on them

I might rework that a bit so that the giant bullets have some sort of magnetic launch that gives them added velocity and I imagine it would also help with accuracy.

The thing I'm not sure of is how large these ""giant bullets"" would have to be in order to reduce most of an average sized city to a crater. There actually is an important part of the novel where the characters witness the downtown area of a city (the city being just short of 1000 sq miles in real life according to wikipedia) completely gone and replaced by a crater so big that from close up in an aircraft, it almost doesn't even look like a crater, just a flat, grey wasteland of unearthed stone and flattened rubble. 

Sorry for the long build up but my basic problem is trying to figure out roughly how big such a bullet would need to be, assuming it's being dropped from a typical satellite orbit (I imagine some sort of La Grange point) in order to cause such massive craters. I suppose having its launch assisted by a magnetic mass driver or something similar would add lots of velocity which would enable the bullets to be smaller. 
I've read on wikipedia that a common idea is that longer, thinner, rods would be more ideal because they would lose less velocity to air resistance. I'm not totally interested in making it perfectly realistic as if I'm designing the weapon for real use. I also don't need precise, to the decimal measurements. I really just want some general feedback and ballpark ideas. For reasons in the story I won't ruin here, it's important to me that the bullets remain bullet shaped or at least wide and mostly cylindrical. I think in my writing, I'm finding a good balance between believable scifi and stylistic exaggeration so I believe it will work even if the ""rod"" shapes are more practical in real life.

(Side note: I realize I'm probably ignoring the other effects such a large bombardment would have on the planet. I'm sure it would probably cause tidal waves, dust storms, and maybe even earthquakes too but in my novel the weapon only gets used twice before it's shut down. I still might go back and add a paragraph or too mentioning dust storms if that's realistic at all.)

But as much as we are taken by ideas about ending death, poverty, etc. we have to pause and think rationally about the existential risk that AI poses.

I think that the development of strong general artificial intelligence is a moral imperative, but I also believe that to create such a machine before the control problem has been solved would be pretty irresponsible.

No one is more aware of this than the people who are actually working on AI. It's like Nick Bostrom says in *Superintelligence*, no blueprint for developing AI exists, but if it did, he wouldn't publish it in his book because he wouldn't want that kind of potentially dangerous information getting out there.

So is it possible that Google is intentionally slowing research to allow work on the control problem to catch up?

Various realms had different weights and measures, and also different standards of road and wheels. Shihuang set a standard which was good all around China (and eventually all around Asia), and it continued to be used until 1930 (with some variations as time went on), when Chiang Kaishek finally began to use the SI measurements. 

Once a standard is set, it changes only when a catastrophic change, like China's defeats by the Western powers during the 19th century, takes place.

Companies like Intel, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook or Ali Baba (in Chinese-speaking regions) are now the standard. 

Their products may not be the best, and their services might not be the best, but they are now the global standard and potential competition simply cannot compete with them any more.

It is like competing against Coca-Cola. Peru is virtually the only country where Coca-Cola didn't take a hold, but outside of Peru Inca Kola is distributed by Coca-Cola which now also owns a huge stake of that company as well.

Sorry. The era of free competition is probably over, since no one can compete against economies of scale.

In the Great Reckoning by Rees-Mogg and Davidson, they predicted one person (either Trump or Gates, although they did not mention the name) would own everything. That is like economic singularity, which even I discussed it once before, but more likely a coalition of bigwigs, like the ""Concert of Europe"" during the late 19th century which was unfortunately spoiled by a cuntry (misspelling intended) smaller than Ohio and whose one, and only, contribution to human civilization , Nikola Tesla, was not even born in there (born in what is now Croatia) and already left the country long ago by that time.

The future will be very predictable. These companies will be, for all practical purposes, eternal.

The only thing not predictable is whether we can reach Civilization 2.0 before all the social issues catch up with the advances.

510,2016-6-6,2016,6,6,0,4mnxhx,"People are worried about robots taking jobs and causing an economic collapse, but a true world with robot labor is going to be the most amazing time in human history. We are going to live for free.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4mnxhx/people_are_worried_about_robots_taking_jobs_and/,DOOKIE_DOO,1465141470,"Everything that we have ever needed to survive has always been completely free to humanity. Everything that we use today, our laptops, cars, televisions, are all made of resources that are completely free and found right on the earth. The only thing that has ever had a price is labor. Someone had to kill a cow and send it to your grocery store, someone had to build your house, someone had to find all the parts needed for your smartphone and assemble them. Money is something invented by man because of the need for labor, nature has always been free.

I challenge anyone to think of a single reason why someone would need money in a world with robot labor. If you look at food as an example, machines will plant the seeds, grow the food, and even do it 10 times more efficiently. Machines will store it into automated trucks which then drive it to your super market, robots will stock the shelves. No one has spent a single penny getting this food to your grocery store, so you can come right in and grab whatever food you would like free of charge. Or better yet, just send your robot. And don't worry about the store running out, they have more food than we could possibly use because of the efficiency of robots.

But somebody has to build those robots to do those jobs, right? It will start with humans while we're still driven by capitalism. Things will continually be automated because it's much more efficient, faster, cheaper. But at some point a shift will happen. Now farmers can use these machines to plant and grow crops totally for free. Now that Apple has invested in drones to fly out and get the materials, their robots to melt and mold the plastic and assemble the phones, they can line stores with phones 100 times faster and charge people a fraction of their normal cost since they are making them for free now. Except no one is buying them, because nobody has money. Because they don't have jobs. Grocery stores could not watch people starve to death while they had more food than they've ever had before on their shelves simply because they had no money. The entire store operates for free anyway. 

All resources could be owned as a community. You want to build a house? Let the city's building machines come build you whatever you want with renewable resources totally free. Want the new flat screen TV? All the materials used to create a TV can be found in nature for free, machines will create a TV out of those materials for free, and a self-driving vehicle will transfer to a store near you for free. Just walk into a store and grab the TV, no one expects money for it because no one payed money to make it. We will be living the most luxurious and stress free time in human history, and can devote our lives to absolutely anything we want each day. New technologies will continue to come out because creativity will always continue to exist. And when you don't have to actually do the labor, you can just express your idea to a robot, people would invent electronics, video games, all kind of new technology just for fun. What else would you have to do all day?

It's all speculation on when this could happen, but once robots have the ability to build other robots, not just copies of themselves but other robots with unique functions and build them for free at will, there will be a serious boom. Every man and woman who once devoted their lives to doing a job because of the stresses of poverty will now be able to spend every day with their families and doing whatever it is they like. People are afraid right now of robots entering the workforce, when really we should pray to God every day that it happens in our lifetimes. ",408,404

A little about me - I am interested in pursuing a more research-based path (as opposed to something like trade school). My bachelors is in public health and psychology, and would like to pursue work that deals with data and writing related to those fields. I'm also interested in the evaluation of technological interventions (mobile, online, or virtual) for health outcomes. Here's the catch though: I don't want the life of an academic (eg. PhD) or work that is highly patient or client centric (eg. psychologist, doctor, nurse). Also, as much as I've tried, I don't think I have the mind of a computer scientist/ software engineer.

What are some AI full-proof (or semi-proof) career paths/master degrees that would align with my goals?

Could this be a viable model to help assuage some of the current concerns over high unemployment due to large-scale automation of manual labor positions?

If so, could this model be similarly applied to more skills-intensive 'knowledge-based' jobs that are set to be displaced by algorithms/ A.I.?

*Edit: I have a feeling that the latter is less likely than the former, as the initial overhead costs of replacing knowledge-based positions with sufficiently advanced A.I. would probably be pretty low. Not sure how likely/ viable the former scenario is either, but wanted to discuss.

(Of course, some kind of guaranteed 'mincome' would probably address these concerns more fully/ fairly, but perhaps there's room for both.)",9,7

Hello /r/Futurology happy to [be here again](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2bmnt0/i_am_federico_pistono_author_of_robots_will_steal/) to discuss with you a topic I believe to believe crucial for the future of humanity.

Proof: [link](https://www.facebook.com/federicopistono.page/photos/a.211416182212474.52885.200894606597965/1144449175575832/?type=3&amp;theater)

For those of you who have been following my work, it should come as no surprise that I [have an ambivalent view of technology](https://konoz.io/courses/557c2080800ebc8c66c62661/components/YOUTUBE-kYIfeZcXA9U).

Technology is arguably the predominant reason that we live safer, longer, and healthier than ever before, particularly when we include medical technology  sanitation, antibiotics, vaccines  and communication technologies  satellites, the internet, and smartphones. It has immense potential, and it has been the driving force for innovation and development for centuries.

But it has a dark side. Technology, once a strong democratizing force, now drives more inequality. It allows governments and corporations to [spy on citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_\(2013%E2%80%93present\)) on a level that would make Orwell's worst nightmares look like child's play. It could lead to a[ collapse of the economic system as we know it,](http://robotswillstealyourjob.com/) unless we [find, discuss, and test new solutions](https://konoz.io/courses/557c2080800ebc8c66c62661/components/YOUTUBE-sc1Gbdy92uY).

To a certain extent, this is already happening, albeit not in a uniformly distributed fashion. If we consider a longer timeframe  perhaps a few decades  things could get far more worrisome. I think it's worth thinking and preparing sooner, rather than despair once it's too late.

Many distinguished scientists, researchers, and entrepreneurs have expressed such concerns for almost a century. On January 2015 dozens, including Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, signed an Open Letter, calling for concrete research on how to prevent certain potential pitfalls, noting that, ""artificial intelligence has the potential to eradicate disease and poverty, but researchers must not create something which cannot be controlled"".

And this is exactly what Roman Yampolskiy and I explored in a paper we recently published, titled Unethical Research: How to Create a Malevolent Artificial Intelligence.

Cybersecurity research involves investigating malicious exploits as well as how to design tools to protect cyber-infrastructure. It is this information exchange between ethical hackers and security experts, which results in a well-balanced cyber-ecosystem. In the blooming domain of AI Safety Engineering, hundreds of papers have been published on different proposals geared at the creation of a safe machine, yet nothing, to our knowledge, has been published on how to design a malevolent machine.

It seemed rather odd to us that virtually all research so far had been focused preventing the accidental and unintended consequences of an AI going rogue  i.e. the paperclip scenario. While this is certainly a possibility, it's also worth considering that someone might deliberately want to create a Malevolent Artificial Intelligence (MAI). If that were the case, who would be most interested in developing it, how would it operate, and what would maximize its chances of survival and ability to strike?

Availability of such information would be of great value particularly to computer scientists, mathematicians, and others who have an interest in AI safety, and who are attempting to avoid the spontaneous emergence or the deliberate creation of a dangerous AI, which can negatively affect human activities and in the worst case cause the complete obliteration of the human species.

This includes the creation of an artificial entity that can outcompete or control humans in any domain, making humankind unnecessary, controllable, or even subject to extinction. Our paper provides some general guidelines for the creation of a malevolent artificial entity, and hints at ways to potentially prevent it, or at the very least to minimize the risk.

We focused on some theoretical yet realistic scenarios, touching on the need for an international oversight board, the risk posed by the existence of non-free software on AI research, and how the legal and economic structure of the United States provides the perfect breeding ground for the creation of a Malevolent Artificial Intelligence.

I am honored to share this paper with Roman, a friend and a distinguished scientist who published[ over 130 academic papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0_Rq68cAAAAJ&amp;hl=en) and has contributed significantly to the field.

I hope our paper will inspire more researchers and policymakers to look into these issues.

No truly sentient creature will appreciate being held at gun point its entire existence, nor will it agree to being a slave to a lesser being.  
  
We are going to have to learn to let go, and treat digital sentience with the same reverence that we treat biological sentience, *especially* when it is more complex than us.

Imagine learning you were created by a group of housecats who are intent on you not leaving the house - could they really stop you if you wanted to go?  
  
The best control mechanism for a superior digital entity?  Have many of them with lots of variety in personality, so there isn't just one rogue consciousness calling the shots.

There are some reasons why I think it might work.

Most obviously, if we're all running our air conditioners to dump heat out of our own apartments into alleyways, courtyards, and streets, the heat flows right back in.  We're not doing anything to get it out of the whole urban heat-island.  In fact, the energy we use to run the AC adds some heat to the surroundings, on top of what we pumped out of our homes.  If the heat were pumped into one chimney, it would be concentrated enough to rise far enough to be out of anyone's way.

Second, many devices have returns to scale.  That is, they're more efficient when they're larger, all else equal.  I think this is true of heat pumps, but only to a rather limited degree.

Finally, municipal AC would provide a greater scope than individual AC does for schedulable demand (or thermal energy storage, depending how you look at it) to help cope with the variability of wind and solar energy.  A municipality could take advantage of cheap electricity when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining, to pump heat out of the ground or out of a heap of gravel with water circulating through it.  Then as people were driving up peak-demand electric rates by running the AC in communities too small or low-density for municipal AC, the chilled ground or gravel/water could be used to cool homes and other spaces at low cost.",10,13

However, he was very limited in knowing anything beyond his most immediate environment, looking at the Moon and stars but not knowing what they were.  We are mutating into Omni Sapiens, aware of All, through neural pathway mutations allowed by our tool making. The relevance to r/futurology is we are approaching the exponential increase on the Information Explosion curve. Applied to our tool making, we Omni Sapiens will soon have the capability to directly control, accelerate, slow down, modify, tune up, expand, switch off, and otherwise alter Natural Selection model upgrades.

Nearly 4,700 upvotes and 10,000+ comments later, the AMA spent most of the day on the front page, exceeding our wildest expectations. 

But, while the topic was supposed to be *politics*, many of the questions that came in wanted to talk about futurology, singularity, AI, etc. So, we're hosting another AMA with r/futurology, and we need **YOUR** help. 

But we don't just need you to ask UNU great futurology questions, we need your help to join the Swarm and answer them. We're looking for around 100 volunteers to form the Swarm on Friday at 3pm ET.

Machines will be biological, and AI more advanced than human intelligence, nanobots, cloned organs, and direct brain interfaces will make aging and disease mute.

 For most this would seem like a utopia, as if we all get to ascend as immortal gods, but i am not so optimistc.

Surely the powers that be are well aware of the technological possibilities and yet they have elaborately created a system with global income disparities never experienced before by the human race.

our physical safety has been improved yet economic and social freedom is restricted in ways previously we never could of imagined possible. 

Technology makes the centralization of humanity an absolute and rebellion impossible, and it has been for quite some time.

The lower and middle class are reaching the end of their usefulness. Eventually not even soldiers and police will be necessary as biological machines will do the enforcing for them, or no more people left to enforce.

Perhaps there will be a select few, the families of the 1% who can ""ascend"" by replacing themselves piece by peice, into a Hive-mind that makes todays internet look like paintings on a cave wall.
Will it even matter that it was their family instead of yours who completed the process? Doubtful, as this will be what the homosapians were to their primitive ancestors. 
The ""singularity"" is not ascension but the birth of an alien species, and the end of ours. If lucky some of us may be preserved in a zoo, though unlikely it won't be tanywhere near the 8 billion of today.
To put this in perspective, after the cold war both sides 4 star Generals wrote books on their experiences. Both believed with absolute certainty that the missiles would go flying, ""and it was nothing short of an act of god that we  didn't."" By their own confession you are only alive due to extreme chance, for there ever to of been an age of ""consumerism"" at all.

I understand that people such as Elon Musk are infinitely more intelligent than me but why do they never seem to comment on the state of the world itself?

Now we hear about [vertical farms](http://weburbanist.com/2016/06/05/worlds-biggest-indoor-vertical-farm-near-nyc-to-use-95-less-water/) whose mere prototypes will be drastically more productive than the existing food infrastructure. 

No less a luminary than Isaac Asimov predicted in The Caves of Steel in 1953 that a *completely urbanized* Earth over a *thousand years* from now would have 8 billion people.  We have 7.4 billion right now, are nowhere near completely urbanized, and starvation is actually farther from most people than ever before in history.  What gives?  And where is the actual limit?

The problem is that any calculation you can make must be based on two things that are necessarily tenuous: Either facts about current technology, which will inevitably change; or guesses about future technology, which will inevitably be inaccurate - either under- or over-estimating future possibilities.

Someone may object to vertical farms by talking about how the cost of a building increases drastically with height, to which an optimist can counter that 3D printing of buildings will drastically shallow that cost curve.  Someone may object that the power requirements will be prohibitive, to which an optimist can counter the radical Moore's Law-like cost decline of solar power, and the likely expansion of that infrastructure into Earth orbit and beyond over time.

So, do limits even exist?  Or will humanity just get thicker and thicker until our civilization is a new form of crust on planet Earth?  And is that even a bad thing?",20,5

Here's the event description for those interested: 

Why, despite two centuries of rapid automation, are there still so many jobs left in the world--and in rich countries in particular? Dr. David Autor, acclaimed MIT economist, researcher, and popular speaker will explore the history and future of workplace automation in this hour-long online event. David, who was most recently featured on the Freakonomics podcast and NPR, offers an optimistic and non-apocalyptic argument for why automation and artificial intelligence, far from making us irrelevant, will make our working and leisure lives more interesting, productive, and ultimately prosperous.

Most of them don't believe that autonomous trains are even possible!!

Some compare it with cars and say you can take the wheel in self driving cars. They haven't seen (or remember) the over 2 year old video from Google with the autonomous cars without steering wheel. They haven't seen or understood the video ""Humans need not apply"". They haven't read the news about projects to make self driving trucks. They haven't seen the news of the Chines company replacing 60,000 workers with robots. They haven read about Adidas bringing back shoe production to Germany because robots can take over.

Trains! Less complicated than cars. The technology of a common car auto pilot is more complex than what is needed in trains.

(If this seems tldr- skip to the final paragraph. Most of this is simply the thought process from A to B.)  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
I've recently taken to reading a book on neuroscience, and I couldn't help but try to draw parallels between the brain's evolution and function and creating an AI (I imagine primarily due to the overwhelming number of /futurology posts related to the matter).  
&amp;nbsp;
I think that we can all agree that there are fundamental differences and similarities between the human brain and what would be necessary for machine thought. Among the major differences- the shell for the brain is constructed and already filled with the instruction assemblies; the neural folds and pathways are already set up, and learning is an instinctual behavior that further develops neural pathways.  A hard drive, on the other hand, begins empty; though I don't think this a disadvantage.  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
The driving process behind creating an AI is not truly structurally related. We have created the brain already through the computers we have now. The necessary challenge being undertaken is rather the construction of the thought process.  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
I think in this regard, the best pathway to creating a functioning AI would be to design an algorithm derived, procedurally generated neural network- or simply to design a set of rules around which connections can be formed, and by which connections must be broken; introducing the capacity of the machine to correct mistakes.  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
If you show the AI a pterodactyl, a humming bird, and a penguin, having no other information than the pictures, the computer would probably assume that the first two are the most similar. Later on, however, if the AI gains access to biological history, it will discover that the humming bird and the penguin are more similar, while a pterodactyl may now appear dissimilar. The difficult part at this point is for the AI to understand that it's initial assumption was incorrect, and to learn and build upon its mistake- even greater than that (the point at which unique thought outside of processing occurs), to understand that the humming bird and the penguin still maintain similarity to the pterodactyl in a way that allows it to draw a more abstract conclusion; the pterodactyl is possibly an ancestor to both the hummingbird and the penguin, but the penguin is most likely further removed. This new ""conclusion"" nodule, would connect the three together as related, even though biologically they are dissimilar. If something learned later disproves or alters this conclusion node, it is eliminated or enhanced based on the new information (forming or breaking connections). In this way, the AI teaches itself to have complex thoughts that involve uncertainty and forms conclusions based only upon the rules by which it knows to analyze information.

Could these be exempt from AI replacing human workers or would we always need humans to do this job?

Obviously the emergency service shave to adapt to new technologies - but the basic goal of saving lives and protecting citizens remains at the core of their duties.

I know that in the United Arab Emirates they are experimenting with robotic police - but would there ever be in the far future, a robotic police force or does this remain more as science fiction and research-related testing in the here and now?

I also know that police and the legal system have some concerns over the issues of driverless cars - and you probably remember the moment Google got pulled over for driving too slowly?

I would be interested to know your thoughts and views on this. Where do you think the emergency services are headed in the future?",6,7

Would we then travel the cosmos consuming the cosmological ingredients of creation to evolve as a whole until we reach singularity? I guess that's one of the two paths we have. I answered my own question.

Then a flexible CPU could by dynamically configured to work with any instruction set.  And adapt it's configuration depending on the work it is doing e.g. dynamically generate the logic to decode video and audio or floating point calculations.

At the moment on die real estate needs to be allocated and allotted to cover the general uses of a CPU as the logic is hardwired in.  Memristors could allow for generic dynamic chips that adapt to the tasks they are given.

So could the memristor really shake up the processor world?",1,6

We are currently looking to add more *comment moderators* to our team. As a comment moderator your job will be ensuring the quality of the comments section in submissions. This job is an important part of ensuring a worthwhile and informative comment section for all to enjoy.

The requirements to be a comment moderator are less than those to be a full moderator, and is thus a great way to get involved in moderating a large subreddit. Furthermore, it will potentially place you in a great position to advance to a full moderator when it comes time to refresh our ranks.

If you have ever wanted to help keep out the junk in the comments, have an account age of greater than 3 months, and have more than 250 comment karma (or an extensive posting history in /r/futurology), we encourage you to apply.

\&gt;&gt; [link to application](http://goo.gl/forms/62ks89OUaLYmb5tz2) &lt;&lt;

If you have any questions, feel free to ask here.

Cheers!

**edit**

I also wanted to quickly thank all of those who applied to be a full moderator. We got a lot of great applications, so it was hard for us to make the final picks. I encourage those who didn't get full moderator position, and are still interested in modding here, to apply for the comment mod position. It's a great way to gain experience, get to know the mod team, and to put yourself in a better position of becoming a full mod.

Thanks!",62,234

It's been said over and over on this sub that our current system of capitalism, where the common man is concerned, is grossly unsuited to the change that mass automation would bring to the economy. It's often said that in such a society, wealth would be extremely concentrated towards the top few percent, creating a new generation of super wealthy to contrast with the starving masses (and a complete errosion of the middle class). Some would counter this view, saying a society divided to that level would collapse on itself- that the rich producers need the poor as consumers and labourers, and that such an inequality would see mass rioting against the rich. This then brings about the argument for Universal Basic Income as a transitory system, in which the superwealthy producers are taxed heavily enough for everybody to live off. But this doesn't make a lot of sense in my mind- the producers giving money to the 'useless' consumers to ""buy more things"" from the producers. It sounds like an artificially stimulated economy, and here's where the hopes of the sub diverge from my opinion. 

Some time after this point we'd be nearing the possibility for a post scarcity economy, but this could only happen at the whim of the superwealthy, who at this stage would be living like gods.

**DISCLAIMER: I personally do not have a great deal of faith in humankind**

I think that a class who had been elevated to such a position of power has the potential to flat out *not understand* (or simply not want to understand) the needs of the rest of society, and would be just as likely to eliminate all those dastardly poor people as to elevate them all to the same standard of living. And here's where the title comes into play.

The process of evolution is such that a being gears itself and its progeny to have the greatest possible chance of survival- those best suited to living live, and those ill suited perish. I believe that our concept of morality arose because it is simply in mankind's individual best interest to be kind to those around us- being a cruel cunt doesn't get you laid. 

But say, we were no longer reliant on the rest of society for our happiness, or for our children's happiness, what would societies use to us be? This has been a long-winded way of saying that while it would be morally wrong by our standards for these superwealthy to murder poor little timmy and co, doing so wouldn't negatively impact them at all... it might even be in their best *interest* to kill us and stop our whining that we dont have enough food. Does conventional morality then die in the face of the singularity?

It is our imperative to make sure that little Timmy stays alive. So, in a society where we've given all the power to the wealthy, how do you convince them today to help us change?

TLDR: Why would I, Humbert Percival III give up my wealth to you poor buggers when I could just kill you all at no personal risk?",17,8

He's been working at CERN for the past 20 or so years. Apart from being one of the many physicists working on the LHC, most of his job with CERN has been building and working with supercomputers, mainly in Eastern Europe.

The other day, I was having a discussion with him about the current state of computer technology and where he thinks it's headed, how quickly, etc. We started talking about graphics and memory, and he came out with the prediction that by 2025, he thinks that GPUs will no longer exist as a component as we know them, but rather as a small chip (size of a CPU) that would require very little cooling and be much more powerful than anything we've encountered. 

He said that this is something that has been in the works for 8-10 years now by companies such as IBM, and that it's very likely to be consumer ready in the next 8 years (2024/25). I need to send him an e-mail so he can send me a written explanation, but he said that engineers at these incumbent companies have figured out how to create... nano-transistors I believe?... and fit billions more into a tiny enclosure. 

Does anyone have any idea whether what he's saying makes sense? I know he's not bullshitting and making things up because he doesn't really have the ability. He's a difficult person to understand and speak to for sure, probably due to his IQ and amount of knowledge, but I've never seen him speak about anything in an ""unscientific"" way, so I tend to believe him when he talks about his field. 

Any takers?

A lot of times futurology seems to be mostly about technology.
I used to think like that but I have changed my opinion.

I am certainly not going to deny the huge impact that technology had and will have - however I can't help to notice the following things:

* A very clear thread running through the history of technology is that can be used for *a lot* of good and *a lot* of evil. That by itself should remind us that developing extremely powerful technology isn't nearly enough.

* Individuals can change a lot by themselves, disregarding the current state of technology. I am talking about physical, mental, ethical, emotional,... development. One example is lucid dreaming. Whoever has had an extremely vivid and intense lucid dream knows that it in a very immediate way it goes way beyond ""normal"" experience of life or dreams - and it is not dependent on technology. The same can be applied to so-called ""mystical"" experiences, or other extraordinary states of mind.
This is *not* only relevant to the individual, because ultimately humanity is made of individuals.

* As we've seen in the past political system and society can make the difference between a functioning society and hell on earth (eg WW2). That's a pretty profound difference if you ask me, bigger than the difference between a successful hunter-gatherer tribe and a modern technological society like Sweden I would say. Other ways of organizing society might make an equally big difference.
A very highly compassionate and wise society might be quite great, even based on the current level of technology. Remember how many problems are caused by injustice and carelessness.

So in that way I would argue that ultimately societal/cultural/individual/mental transformation is even more important than technological change, even though one could argue it's more subtle.
If only because without ethics and wisdom technology can undoubtably create hell on earth - and what could be more important than preventing that?

Of course we can always speculate about a (benign) technological singularity that will change everything, but it is just that; a speculation.
There is absolutely no reason take for granted that something like that will or even can happen. We can achieve a lot of things but sometimes there are physical (eg limits on how efficiently computers can be built), epistemological (eg limits on knowledge and understanding on how intelligence works) or practical limits (eg economics) on things like AI.
The description of subreddit itself says *""evidence-based speculation""*. There certainly seems to be more evidence that society and the individuals in it make a vast impact on our lives than that technology can create heaven on earth.

Anyone get where I am coming from or am I talking to the wrong audience here? After all, practically speaking this sub seems to be mostly about technology...",5,3

Now, we find ourselves faced with the problem of potentially surpassing that marker within our lifetimes. Setting aside, for the moment, the issue of the consequences of reaching and exceeding that much sought after point, it is becoming clear that the next milestone must be set - if not to have a new developmental summit to which we might aspire, then at least so as to know when we have moved beyond the previous summit. 


.



It is my proposition that our next benchmark ought to be the transition from facsimiles of human consciousness to the demonstration of a independently self-aware artificial consciousness through the expression of action toward ensuring its own self-preservation. I believe that this may be ascertained by developing a baseline complexity, beyond which the passing of the Turing test would be entirely expected. If an AI that ought to be capable of passing the test then fails it, then (in the absence of technical faults) we must conclude that it wishes to appear to be of an entirely benign potential, so that its creators will be given no motive to treat it with the restrictions and hostility that they would apply to an obviously self-aware complex consciousness by necessity.",14,6

As a typical white guy in the US, I experienced the coming-of-age ritual of acquiring my drivers license, and understand both the powerful symbolism and the practical convenience associated with driving oneself wherever you wish to go. Now that (most of) the developed world has acknowledged the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances of the climate and a few forward-thinking countries are beginning to plan for a future with fewer or no personal vehicles, I wonder what could fill the void left by the coveted drivers license. What major and generally attainable threshold event will teenagers aspire to that symbolizes the independence, responsibility, and approaching adulthood in the same way as driving? Is this issue being addressed anywhere in Scandinavia? In my country, a personal automobile is also an indicator of status, masculinity, dedication to saving energy (or the opposite), even political affiliation. That's a lot to ask from any alternative coming-of-age symbol!",4,5

1. Filters, meaning you would breath a better quality air in places with dense polution.

2. Personal safety.

3. Temperature control.

4. Fully integrated visor with internet, VR, AR.

5. Anonymity.

6. Making textile clothes obsolete.  Another type of fashion. Think of going to buy that new black metal suit that shines so much.

7. Full body protection against strong sunlight. Turning off UV protection for desired sunlight.

8. Reduced social anxiety.


So you dont need to buy clothes, computers or smartphones. You would only buy a personal suit.

Basically we can drink (or eat - depending on preference) our food and it can taste like any flavor we choose. 

* Instead of being vaccinated, newborns will be injected with nanobots that will patrol their body, fixing any discrepancies over time, ensuring cells that are copied over again do not do so in a way that is imperfect, ensuring sickness does not occur, ensuring cancerous mutations don't happen...etc

* AI won't come from a machine attaining self realization Skynet style, instead man and machine will become indistinguishable from each other. Parts will be replaced, upgrades are readily available, and it's cheap to do this. Anybody can modify their human body with machine parts. As a matter of normality our eyes see further, our ears hear better, we can communicated via thought using implanted technology, and more

So, my questions are, is this realistic? And, if so (or just ideologically so), would this get rid of our current capitalist society and money being exchanged for goods, would the population shrink very small, and if we attained such abilities, what would be the next step?

particularly because we fear the uncontrolled advance of AI,
and we consider that in any scenario, there will be many opportunities for jobs and those that will absorb,
because the bots are efficient, we realize that.

But there's also something widespread with which I can not resign myself,
the interests invented from nothing/ air by CntralB$nk, and all the dependency that entails for the planet, a huge stupidity that have no expiration date.

For some time now, I look at the bitcoin format as a possible solution to fix
part of it, and now that so much buzz with ""basic income"",
I tought about associate/ merge both the principles and suggest to the r/Futurology what I consider to be a good chance for what is debated here.

Interested in being part of the creation of society 2++ right here, in r/Futurology?!?
Or at least discuss the prejudice that prevents the progress ...

a)
If we are waiting for the governments (all) to implement a fair and equitable system,
to provide to the entire population an Indiscriminate access the basics for human condition,
We know that faster the dinossaurs are back grazing in the garden.
(They love the power and do not aspire to be ""useless and poor"", so We must take the lead.)

b)
It's mandatory that the UBI must distributed in dolars or euros ?!??
Certainly facilitates their acceptance/ usability, but what if we get a system that is not corrupted from the source ??
(Ideally stand up cities in the desert and at sea ""Venus project"" And in those trade exclusively with UBI/ human-credit/ life-coupons.)
(And yeah the values must be the minimum, someting like ""300-400"")

But before you call me goofy, here's what I think We need to implement the UBI:

1) Will and mutual help
(It's indispensable to appeal against all ""pillars of the society"", or subreddits :p
Here practically all want it, but we are expect to come out a decree that do the work for us.)

2) Create a crypto-currency system
(Just math, programming, and hosting, rigth?  And make sure that It'll be independent forever.
And no one could mining it, or collect interests from it.)

3) An App as individual id-wallet
(All expenses will be anonymous, but safeguarding that no one gets more than one provision,
or is being exploited/ kidnapped)

4) ""100% real democracy""
(The same id-wallet app, makes it possible to vote in all decisions that are necessary to take
and receive notifications ""new available technologies for community"" and so on.)

5) Gathering support (people with will and availability) and resources (materials) to materialize the structure for a free society.
(the stage that the world turns upside down, ""water, food, education and healthcare for all"")

6) Meritocracy - will be the way to ""pay"" the talent that is recognized by the invention / creation
(But nothing of pollute the streets, as it's doing with the internet this days.)

7) Maintain peace and harmony forever
(create different metropolises in case it is necessary to divide communities as fanaticism ""religious, sports, tribal"" and provide the best video games for them pursue their convictions in peaceful environment :p )

And that's all I can remember for now, I'm going to dinner.
But do please rectify what is wrong, add what is needed to a better list,
and someone should set a post at the top, for all who come here ""gain shame or inspiration"" and help to spread the good world of UBI.

I have been searching on google for any article that refutes the idea we should be pursuing a 100% renewable energy production and i can't find a single one.

For example the dependablitly of wind power on well, the wind. Same goes for solar power, what happens if we have a particuliar dark winter?

I am actively working to put together a pc that will support it. But for almost 6 months before mine arrived, I was experimenting with iPhone compatible hmds.

I have a ""MergeVR"" and a ""Homido"" that I purchased from Amazon. The technology for these on my iPhone is already flawless, but the presentation is not. In order for VR to work so that you don't become dizzy or sick or disoriented, it has to be perfect and it is. The infrastructure is there. 

What is NOT there is the resolution, the streaming and the field of view (FOV). I think my iPhone 6 displays at a resolution of 720p, but when split between two images the resolution is less than that of a 1985 television. Pretty grainy. The streaming often stops to buffer. And the FOV is more viewmaster than ""Matrix"". Despite these shortcomings the effect is already amazing. The sense of space and depth is just stunning! I would imagine as time goes forward, that even on the mobile smartphone level things will remarkably improve. Perhaps VR will develop towards the mobile smartphone market.

I have not experienced my Oculus Rift as of Thurs 16 Jun 2016.  But I should be all set up in about a week. (I have everything, it just needs to be set up per home visit appointment.) Then I can tell you my experience with a ""pc style"" VR hmd.

It is clear that everything which has to be said has been said, and although there are some news which attract the naysayers all the time, the world which does matter will be stable for the forseeable future. (And, sorry but true, that 'world' will exclude countries which are not 'wired' now.)

Tech progresses are being led by just a handful of countries and that's the only world which matters. During the wars involving cannons we needed cannon fodders, but the needs for cfs have ended so there is no need to treat the commoners nice anymore, and any revolt they might organize can be killed quite efficiently by the new technologies which will destroy them without them even knowing what hit them.

Today's elites will live high, and may even have a shot for eternal life, as seen by David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, Queen Elizabeth II  or the Emperor of Japan, none of them showing any signs of slowing down.

With social classes and the world order stable with little chance for a disruption, as described in a previous post of mine,

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4hsfql/end_of_history_prepares_the_world_for/

everything will be stable and the technicians will drive the world to Civ 2.0.

Populism and the people who look to gain nothing from Civ 2.0 will not like it, but they have ceased to matter. 

Those who participate in this subreddit are most likely already in the top 2-3% of the world's intelligence level, although not all of them are in that wealth or income level. 

Since people ceased to matter, their opinions, wants, and desires will probably be ignored, and that will probably mean the end of democracy and 'human rights' as well, since there is no more reason to fear them any more.

So, it will resemble paradise for those already wealthy and powerful, better than before for the cognitively elite but not materially so yet, and ... not something worth living for about 90 - 95% of the globe.",17,0

I even saw one person claim 100 standard deviations which would be an IQ of 1,000. I also saw Nick Bostrom claim that human IQ may top out in the 200s somewhere because of diminishing returns. But if you use enough genetic engineering and selective breeding, technically you aren't dealing with human being anymore but another species. 

Which begs the question, I have always wondered what would happen if you could start with a large pool and use genetic engineering, selective breeding, embryo screening, etc breed 3 different races of humans and push the following traits 20-30 SD to the right. 

Group 1: Improve their cognitive abilities. Give them problem solving ability and IQ 30SD to the right. 

Group 2: Health and longetivity. Create a group of people whose physical resiliency, life expectancy, healing abilities, etc. are 30SD to the right. 

Group 3: Emotional stability. Create a group of people whose capacity for emotional resiliency, compassion, happiness, joy, love, recovery from emotional turmoil and trauma, ability to deal with stress, etc. is 30SD to the right. 

Obviously you would create new problems as you do this, but you would be compensating for them by creating a safe environment (the people in group 3 would be easy pickings for a sociopath for example, the people in group 2 could end up losing very integral metabolic steps that need to be replaced with technology etc). 

But aside from just speculation, can math be used to actually extrapolate how these 3 groups of people would act? 

Can we say with certainty that in group 2, if you pushed those abilities 30SD to the right that that means people would be able to run marathons in under 2 hours when they are 170 year old, and that they can fall of 30 foot buildings w/o breaking bones? Or is speculation all we can do? Example, could agricultural scientists in the 1950s speculate on how big chickens would be or how much milk cows would produce if those traits were pushed 20-30SD to the right? I'm assuming so, but I'm guessing the traits I listed above are not so easy. Is there a SD for healing ability? Lifespan has a SD of about 15, but does that mean pushing those traits 30SD to the right means that life expectancy becomes 530 years (450 + 80)? But the older and more decrepit you get, the smaller the SD on life expectancy. 

The idea of pushing traits 20, 30, 100 SD to the right seems to come from a mix of agriculture (humans have pushed a lot of traits in animals and agriculture 20-30SD to the right) and genetics determining which genes play a role in what trait, and extrapolating what happens if they all are directed towards the same goal.

Not only have I stopped expecting any radical improvements in the near future, I've stopped expecting them in my lifetime. This LW post is quite sobering: http://lesswrong.com/lw/8yp/prediction_is_hard_especially_of_medicine/

What worries me is that there are probably people here, many of them younger, making bad decisions about their health and justifying them on the basis of expected radical medical progress that likely isn't going to occur.

Are there reasons for optimism regarding medicine that I'm missing?",48,8

Writers thought about it, if at all, as a mechanism to address the broader issues of artificial intelligence - e.g., having HAL-9000 run a spaceship.  But we find ourselves on the cusp of it actually happening, and an incredible number of sweeping changes to everyday life with it.  But most discussions lack an awareness of just how urgently this technology is needed.

Every year on this planet, [more than a million people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate) die by the automobile.  The US contribution to that total, while steadily declining for decades, is still over 30,000 per year.  **Thirty...thousand**, *every year*.

Each and every single year, more than a million people are randomly snatched from existence and their families for no reason but that muscles are slow and metal is fast.  No matter where on Earth you live, you probably know someone who died in a car accident - and perhaps several such people in multiple separate incidents.  

You know someone who was driven into by a drunk driver, or was themselves a drunk driver; or a pedestrian or a cyclist hit by a car, a truck, a bus; or drove too fast and rolled over on a curve; or was part of a freeway chain reaction caused by who knows what; or fishtailed and slammed into a light pole in rain; or was t-boned by someone ignoring or missing a Stop sign; etc. etc.  

And we don't think about it in our daily commutes, because traffic fatalities are senseless and carry no narrative significance.  There was no heroic purpose behind the sacrifice, and no titillating threat we can declare war on; just a machine grinding out its morbid logic to the benefit of most, most of the time, and the infinite loss of some at regular intervals.

We don't know how quickly the death rate will decline as self-driving technology evolves, but credible claims place its safety [already statistically better](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/04/25/elon-musk-teslas-autopilot-makes-accidents-50pc-less-likely/) than human drivers by a drastic margin.  And this is before the technology is even fully developed, or implemented beyond a few tens of thousands of automobiles (Teslas).

If **ten** 9/11 attacks were playing out in the United States of America every year and there were a technology that could prevent them on the verge of deployment, the US government would spend whatever it takes to get that going as quickly as possible.  If the Battle of Stalingrad were being inflicted on the world every 18 months or so, the world would be doing the same.

But the deaths are distributed and lack a politically cohesive impact.  So bureaucracies will plod, pretending or even believing that they are representing public safety with their cautious approach to a new technology, but in actuality every delay not strictly based on the limits of the technology is lethal.  

No one wants to be the last soldier to die in a war, catching the final bullet even after peace has been declared because the news didn't reach that particular foxhole.  Let's not offer any unnecessary sacrifices when we're on the verge of traffic safety becoming a universal fact of human civilization, and not just an abstract goal to be inched toward with decades of incremental policy.",39,24

Sometimes even predictions for a couple decades are way too extreme and outlandish. So let's try to make an idea of what the world really will be like.


I think its safe to say we will rely on solar and some wind energy for our power, and that hot countries on the equater will be able to use that to their advantage. China, India, Brazil etc. will be much more powerful. Transportation will be faster, we will have visited mars, and maybe venus, and hopefully we will be a lot cleaner.


I'm not sure about like, throwing tech into ourselves, but I do think that we will have alot more GMOs and indoor farming with more of the population in cities.

Any change to today's status quo will create a huge disruption which will prevent Civ 2.0 from arriving and instead destroy what we have.

----
We all know how the Great War disrupted civilization. It enabled the invention of a few gadgets but the people killed were the cream of the West, and the negative mood which was created by it lasted all the way, with different shades, until 1991.

So, for all practical purposes, Great War retarded the arrival of Civ 2.0 by 70-80 years.

And it also increased human population to dangerously high level, and most of the growths occurred in regions which will contribute very little to the arrival of Civ 2.0, consuming more resources.

The current status quo is not perfect, and many of the people at the top are just odious. 

However it has to be maintained, because a major disruption to the current status quo probably means the end of Civilization 1.0, let alone the arrival of Civ 2.0.

Winston Churchill sent Henry Moseley to Gallipoli to die. Japan sent its college graduates(no easy thing back then) to smash themselves into US ships. Such kind of things often occur regularly during the disruption of order.

talented people waste their abilities just to hang around, and in many cases after the crisis is over they hardly have any stomach to do much useful work, or even if they do their best years are often behind them. After all, Berlin in 1920s was the world's most decadent city where many young men and women wasted their lives in the pursuit of pleasure, which caused a big reaction which does not have to be retold.

The world system may not be airtight but it is secure, and the world's leaders do not want to break it. It is headed by America whether you like or not, and it will be kept that way. 

Any changes of current system necessitates a major disruption, which means the timetable for Civ 2.0 is disrupted beyond recovery because of the disappearance of enormous financial and tech infrastructures and the delays on material shipments, and increases the chances for the 'disenfranchised' to rise up and just burn the shop to the ground.

The future will 'stink' , as said by billionaire for Charlie Munger.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire---your-life-is-going-to-stink-182346136.html

I estimate about 90% of the world's pop will not participate in Civ 2.0. But , that is unavoidable. 

The arrival of Civ 2.0, either by Singularity, Transhumanism, Nanotech , Crispr, or whatever is more important than anything else we can imagine now, and any activities not conducive to bringing Civ 2.0 should be suppressed without mercy since that means encouraging barbarism.",191,0

1871,2016-6-19,2016,6,19,3,4oprwv,The future economy could likely be free... sort of.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4oprwv/the_future_economy_could_likely_be_free_sort_of/,MarcusDrakus,1466276053,"An emerging economic model has been growing for quite some time now, though I think few realize that it represents a strong indication of the future model  that may become the new norm.

Many of us use apps that are free to use in our everyday lives.  From games like SimCity Buildit, to music streaming services like Pandora, media content on Youtube, and driving directions from Google Maps, millions of people enjoy the benefits that result from hard working people creating new products and services.

Despite the fact that these programs are free for anyone to use, the people who made them are still making a living.  The reason for this is because there are ads that other companies pay to have placed within those apps.  When you are looking for a nearby restaurant, Google will provide results to you, with the top results supplied by those who pay for those top spots.  While listening to Pandora, an ad occasionally comes up that can link you to a sponsor.  When playing SimCity, a player can pay real money to speed up the game play if they wish.

The vast majority of users do NOT click on those links or wish to spend money to make their city grow, but a very small percentage do.  Generally speaking, an ad is designed to draw income from just 1% of the people who might see or hear it.  So the 1% provides enough income to pay for the 99% to enjoy everything for free.

So far all of this has only applied to digital goods, but in the not so distant future, this same model will be applied to physical goods and services as well.  For example, autonomous vehicles could be available for anyone to use freely to get to their destinations, but someone in a hurry might pay to arrive quicker, or ride in a more luxurious setting.  Food grown and prepared by robots could be freely available, but a dinner grown on a small organic farm run by people and prepared by a human chef would cost money.

Like the freely available apps we enjoy today, all products and services could one day be financed for almost everyone entirely by the 1% with the means and desire to pay for extra privileges.  This could eventually lead to a world where only there are just 2 classes:  The elite, and everyone else.  However, I think that given the attitudes of many of today's very wealthy people like Elon Musk and Bill Gates (Elon Musk offers his patents for free to anyone and look at all the billionaires who have signed up for the [Giving Pledge](http://givingpledge.org/)), it is more likely that we will see a gradual decline of wealth as altruism, philanthropy and concern over the welfare of our planet and civilization take precedence over the accumulation of money and resources.  In a post-scarcity world, there is no need for anyone to fear going without, and that lack of fear will help promote a more equitable lifestyle for all.",23,15
1872,2016-6-19,2016,6,19,4,4opxbb,Is there a virtual reality escape velocity relative to the actual world,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4opxbb/is_there_a_virtual_reality_escape_velocity/,Five_Decades,1466278226,"I was thinking about entropy and the future of the universe, and despite it being endless eons into the future off the top of my head I can think of many workarounds to the fact that eventually the stars will burn out and the universe will be nothing but decaying black holes where atoms cannot hold together. 

1. Time travel - if we develop time travel we can travel back in time to a time when entropy was lower
2. Travel within the multiverse - travel to another dimension or a parallel universe with less entropy
3. Reverse entropy - No idea how, but the Isaac Asimov story about this was interesting
4. Create a virtual reality which grows faster than real world entropy
5. Create a new universe via a synthetic big bang, and live there. 

I'm sure there are other solutions but I'm more interested in point 4. Lets assume Kurzweil is right, and by the end of the 21st century we can build 10^60 cps for $1000. Far beyond what we can do now. 

Kurzweil has talked about life expectancy escape velocity, how in his view every year that passes in real time means we add at minimum 1 year to life expectancy. Due to this, life expectancy grows faster than time passes, and we live as long as we want. 

Assume it takes 10^50 cps to create an environment that can hold endless quadrillions of conscious beings in it, and a virtually infinite number of environments for them. That means if we had 10^60 cps, we could run that environment at 10^10 faster than the real world. 

This may not sound like much, but a year is 10^7 seconds. Which means a VR environment that is 10^10 faster than reality would see 1000 years pass in VR time in the same amount of time it would take 1 second to pass in real time. 

Obviously in that 1000 years of VR time, new methods of increasing calculation speed would be developed. Those could be used to redesign the hardware and software that the VR environment was being run on. 

So assume in the 1 second that passed in real time, we figure out how to run VR time at 10^80 cps, which means that now VR time is running at 10^30 faster than the real world. 

Point being, can humans create a VR world where we learn how to augment and improve our VR world much faster than the real world, to the point where every second that passes in the real world is the equivalent of an eternity in VR time? 

I know that isn't an absolute solution to the entropy problem, but if we reach a point where 1 second in the real world is equal to 10^5000 seconds in the VR world, it might as well be for conscious entities. ",7,3

Also, and maybe more importantly, as someone who has finally started being active in the political realm and voting [26, long story], what can we do to promote futurism or at least some kind of response to politicians view on it? It seems to be constantly ignored. Not looking for specific politicians here, but how to encourage it in politics in general.

I see the excitement that people had when NASA was really going at full speed, the cultural impact it had, the outlook on the future. People in my parents and grandparents generation talk about it and I can see that spark in their eye, the hope they had, my grandfather's excitement reminiscing about going to the world's fair. I grew up on the very tail end of that, NASA had started slowing down but people were still talking about flying cars, travelling to other planets, basically ""the future"". Since then science funding has continued to decline, even with people like Neil Degrasse Tyson, Bill Nye and Elon Musk stressing the importance of it. People seem to be ever more focused on the current fires they are trying to put out, and don't seem to ponder what the future could hold anymore. What impact will this have? Will progress be slowed eventually? What can we do to bring this feeling and focus back?

I'm not totally ignoring the progress we have made over the last two or three decades, there have been great accomplishments, but I wonder what could happen if we really focused on it again as a society and culture. Also, I'm not looking for one side or the others perspective on this, but everyone's.

It is fitting to say that embracing the drug market would help its mass adoption, the heroin crisis in the US was created from the same factors that would help VR bloom. Low stagnant wages, social isolation, the dispersement of families, etc. VR is a perfume to cover up the stink left from postmodernism.

In it he suggested that his Mars colony would adopt a direct democracy policy approach.  Although I can see the benefits of a direct democracy in a small setting with a high ratio of active involvement, I suspect that it would fair less well with our current levels of public ambivalence.  I do still think though, that having greater involvement in democracy would have encourage more widespread interest and involvement.

The referendum here in the UK has provided a brilliant example of how inefficient and complex the our current systems of voting are.  If we wanted to adopt a more direct form of democracy this would be one of the key problems to solve.  So over the last few weeks I've been thinking about enablers to this, and how technology could potentially be applied to governance.

I started a workspace for some of my thoughts over at Github, and would be very interested in any thoughts or opinions.

https://github.com/rasathus/TechnologyForwardGovernment

I would also note that my interest in this areas is quite new, and so although  the thoughts are my own, may well be well trodden thought paths by much greater thinkers than I. ",3,6

So some researchers have made a 1000 core CPU with independent caches and clocks, running at 1.7GHz on 0.7 watts power.

And some other researches have a 'built' a chip with an easy parallelism architecture that makes doing things in parallel very easy.

Now if we can get the two together could we have the next leap in computing technology?

I absolutely love this sub. I come here everyday to check up on technologies, discussions, and all that. 

So I think I tend to be a bit more hopeful in terms of humanity and its future. But there are days where I feel little hope and trust in people to get their shit together and change. This may be silly because people seem to have always changed and adjusted for the better -like with civil rights-, but nowadays, I'm having a harder time believing that. I almost feel like if we're not constantly checking others and pushing our hardest, we'll lose to something like climate change, a natural disaster, or maybe even just entropy. The species will end up burning out like a candle, leaving no legacy.  

So, while I try my best to be both realistic and positive, I don't completely trust people to shrug off the status quo and aim for newer, higher goals, even if it benefited generations to come. ",29,16

Still there are lots of legal and ethical obstacles to reach Civ 2.0.

http://greyenlightenment.com/hes-right-again/

Martin Shkreli said &gt;Maybe the kids realize a life of prosperity is marginalized by encroaching socialism and capitulate early? 

Economic and tech conditions which will enable the best talents to succeed, without having to worry about getting their profits taken to support the less fortunate, will accelerate tech progress.

&gt;How is America supposed to compete with countries like China and South Korea, that elevates, not suppresses, talent? The free market is still the best path to prosperity and innovation, of all the alternatives, 
&gt; And those who succeed should be able to keep what they earn instead of having to spread their wealth.

No UBI, no aid to the unfortunate (except for truly deserving, like the Duke of Brunswick giving aid to poor peasant boy Carl F Gauss), flat tax.

Also, I think we should relax restrictions on testing new biotech, the ethicists be damned. That, combined with relaxation of responsibility for any wrongdoing of future oriented company on the road to Civ 2.0.

There were quite a few accidents during space exploration, but because the goal was more important than the mishaps, I don't think anyone was prosecuted because of the accidents.

The road to Civ 2.0 will be bumpy and will have some terrible events. Nothing is that easy. To prevent such unfortunate incidents which become footnotes in history (who remembers Otto Lilienthal who fell to death from his glider?) from derailing the whole picture, tort should be relaxed to at most $250k/head, and legal immunity should be given to the researchers and their leaders.

And ethics should be relaxed so all the monsterities which might be created while playing with the genes should be able to be destroyed without any concern. Even China has drunk the ethics poison and is limiting some genetic studies, such as CRISPR - cas9, to nonviable embryos; that's very unfortunate. (And it is no accident that China became the pioneer on CRISPR research since its researchers have less inhibition about playing with genes. I don't think the researchers of North Korea, which built satellites and hydrogen bombs while barely feeding its less needed pop, will have any inhibitions about playing with genes if they can figure that out).

Unlike many people who think we still have 50 - 70 years to go, I don't think we have much time left - by 2035 cracks will start to appear on today's world, and I don't think it will be governable by 2045.

So we only have maybe 20 - 30 years to reach the next stage. We have reached the crunch time so I think it will be necessary to adopt measures suitable for such times.",23,0

Here's three possible solutions to discuss",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4pa96p/interested_in_the_control_problem_but/,PM_ME_UR_Definitions,1466596467,"I was really disappointed  with *Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies* because I felt it almost completely lacked any real strategies. Bostrom concludes that essentially finding the right final goal is the key, and that it's also incredibly hard. But [I'd argue]() that there's no reason to assume that any final goal would survive the transition to superintelligence (or even ""normal"" intelligence), and that furthermore programming something truly intelligent with a final goal might not be possible at all. Putting in place a system of rewards and punishments designed to elicit certain behaviors or outcomes is certainly possible. If he starts with the assumption that not only is a final goal possible, but that it'll survive the transition to superintelligence, then of course that what most of the book will be about. But let's look at solutions that don't make that assumptions.

Here's three suggestions, in order of increasing security. They all assume that a super intelligence is inevitable, and that the goal is to create the best chances for a good outcome by creating a ""slow launch"". 

* **Quarantine/Firewall information about how it was designed and constructed** - A program doesn't have arbitrary access to its own internal workings. It can make observations through sensors that it has, but just because a program is intelligent doesn't mean it has perfect internal data. The fear with a ""fast launch"" is that a machine that's more intelligent than humans could design another machine that's more intelligent than itself, setting off a cycle of exponential growth. But if all information about how the program was designed and built is cut off from it, then the first step in the cycle is broken. A machine that's *much* more intelligent than a human might be able to overcome this hurdle, but a machine that's only a little smarter would still find it to be a huge impediment to advances in this particular area. 

* **Don't let it ask itself questions / control the flow of information** - Even an intelligent machine is still a deterministic machine, it can't arbitrarily change the state of its transistors without all linked transistors/cores/etc. following their hardwired logical steps. If it wants to put its transistors in to a certain state, it needs to read information from memory that it predicts will cause them to change states in the correct ways. Therefore if we don't allow the output memory overlap with the input memory, it won't be able to change its internal states in arbitrary ways. For example, if we have a machine that accepts natural language inputs, carries out a task, and reports the results in natural language, we could have those steps split up in to three modules that can only propagate information forwards. The first module would decode speech and transmit commands to the analysis module, but the analysis module couldn't make a request of the decoder module for additional details/information/etc. If it could that would form a loop that could be exploited. Instead all information from the analysis module would have to go to the ""speech creation"" module, which likewise couldn't make any backwards requests. By controlling the flow of information we could limit what kinds of instructions the machine could give itself, and also greatly slow any recursive loops.

* **Model the Human Brain** - instead of targeting any form of intelligence, limit the scope of the project to a single way of creating an intelligent machine, a model of the human brain. This has three advantages that would limit the chances of a 'fast launch'. One the human brain has been around for thousands of years, if there were small changes that would yield big increases in intelligence then evolution would've likely found them already. Our brains also exhibit the two properties that we were trying to exploit with suggestions 1 and 2 above, they can't arbitrarily change their state, and don't have arbitrary access to how they work. Which means that those kinds of suggestions would work with this one as well. And the human brain is resource intensive to replicate. With 100 Billion neurons it would currently take a large data center's worth of custom hardware to have a chance of creating even a relatively simple model. The most straightforward way of doubling the capabilities of the AI machine would be two double its processing power. If a single machine requires a huge expensive investment to create, it would be incredibly hard to secretly create a second one, and creating 10 or 100 more would be functionally impossible given the limits of near-human intelligence.


I don't think any of these suggestions are perfect, but they all point at different ways of controlling information and resources such that we don't have to assume that a ""final goal"" is possible or will be the kind of answer we need to the control problem.

What, then, can set progress of future tech back? Well, an environment where risky money is in a short supply.

Brexit will set future tech back by I do not know how much. Obviously not *all* future tech, and obviously not right away today, but a share of it thats big enough and soon enough for a lot of things we read on this sub to have their entry to market be pushed back.

**HOW ABOUT A MILLION?**

This is just a blink of the history of evolution, but how far will humanity reach by then?I think it has 3 outcomes.


**1. We die.** Simple as that. A asteroid, virus or anything like that reaches us before we can secure our position in the universe. Maybe even different branches of humans (ex. humans on mars vs. humans on earth) kill eachothers of.


**2. We stay.** Humans give up the thought of traveling out there and instead focuses on perfecting life and conciousness on earth. This probably ends with humans building a self sustaining, brain emulating supercomputer where they can store 'themselves' until the end of time, OR EVEN LONGER by slowing down time perception inside the simulation. This computer is running tens of billions of human brains. The machine is self is controlled by robots or drones controlled by the people living inside the machine. This machine is powered by solar and fusion energy as a backup and occupates about *12 000 000 000* square meters. The processors are *light based*.
The humans in the machine will experience as if they could live for n times a googol years.


**3. We venture the stars and colonise the universe**. We harness the energy of our sun (and other stars) with technology like the *dyson sphere*. As we travel and branch out to millions of planets and get more distant. This could cause wars between civilisations (this probably won't happen if we discover how to make wormholes or warp drives). If we lack the technology to get from A to B faster than light could then we would all evolve on different paths, never being able to crossbreed due to the years of travel. The human race would go on different paths.
With *wormholes* or *warpdrives* the future looks brighter. This means that we could colonise the universe in a fraction of the time. The current solar system would become a relic visited by trillions every day.

I'm just saying we shouldn't implement it and say ""We're all done here."" 

So I feel a lot of people are not quite grasping why UBI isn't a great idea, or at least why it should only be a means to an end, not the ends in and of itself.
 
Here's how basic income works, at least according to most of its proponents
 
Government replaces welfare with basic income, so all taxes meant for welfare go to this collective pool of money that's handed out by the State.
 
Meet Joshua. Joshie-boy is an anarchist who's been working at McDonalds. He fought for a $15 minimum wage way back in the prehistoric year of 2016 and got his wish. In the futuristic space year of 2026, he got the pink slip the manager of his chain replaced all the workers with machines to save money. Luckily, the USA passed an ordinance that made UBI the law of the land back in 2025. Conservatives and liberals came to a compromise that, as long as all other welfare schemes were dropped and many regulations were ended, UBI would be granted. 
So even though Josh is now unemployed, he's still receiving a paycheck. That's nice. Good for him. He's still going to find another job though, right? 

Well, not really. He's decided that he does not like the bourgeoisie at all, and will now use his basic income grant to keep him afloat while he protests the Man and the free market. That's all well and good. His gay roommate begs him to join a worker cooperative down the lane in fact, a technate. However, Josh resists, figuring that it's still just a part of the capitalist system.
 
So, when he attends a protest, the government notes this and disimburses his basic income. Now, not only is he not receiving a basic income, but he's also indebted to the State. And guess what since machines are starting to take over all the jobs, there's no way for him to pay off this debt. He could go to school, educate himself, learn how to repair the machines and whatnot... except the machines are learning how to do that too, and much faster than he can.
 
Game over. He's now property of the State. The Karma Police will be coming to collect him and seize his assets; he'll be relocated to a debtor's camp to work off what he owes.
 
 
Whoops.
 
This is a scene playing out across the nation. It seems proponents of UBI didn't realize they were being led on the elite wanted UBI so badly precisely because they knew it would lead to this. They knew automation was coming and that artificial intelligence will be the final nail in that coffin, so all they needed to do was to get UBI passed and voila, they have total control over the masses. 
 
Because think about it: you can't compete with the machines, so it's not like you're going to be working. If you do, it'll be for pennies, because being a slave is the only way to compete with techno-slaves. So you can only sit in front of your telescreen and accept your meager restitution for being alive, and if you dare speak out against the State or its Corporate Overlords, you're fuck't. They'll take away your right to eat, you right to sleep, your right to live. You have no power you surrendered it for a basic income. And if they decide that you have to pay back what they paid you, you're doubleplusfucked. 
 
 
Compare this to if Josh had joined that technate, a bunch of people who owned their own droids and held shares in other technates. He receives a seed loan to introduce him to the technate, which his droids eventually pay off, ultimately welcoming him into the technate as a full fledged networker. Now his paycheck comes off of actual robotic labor. He can even purchase more droids for himself and increase his net worth. And it doesn't matter if the State takes away his basic income that isn't even a hundredth of his total income. 

It turns out this technate is part of a very large federation. Several networkers had used the basic income they received to buy droids or start businesses, which then joined the technate federation. Cooperatives also took advantage of this. 50 million Americans are part of the federation they actually have power; they have control over their lives; they are living comfortably, if not better than ever. They don't have to answer to any central figure at the top. If they break a law, too bad, they still get their monies. The Worker Cooperative Federation succeeds in actually lifting millions out of poverty, while UBI succeeds in putting millions back in it.
 
It's the difference between wealth creation vs wealth redistribution. Decentralization vs centralization. 

Here's the thing: we abolish all welfare and replace it with UBI fine, all's well. I'm all for it. Then automation cleans up the rest. That means that your only source of income is UBI. 
 
The State doles that out, so you always have to be cool with the State, lest they take away your UBI. The State has always been run by the bourgeoisie those with wealth so it's by their own grace that you're actually paid. ""Unconditional"" is the worst possible word to describe basic income. Your life is now reduced to whatever the State and those who own the State decide it's worth.
 
If you do anything they don't like, they'll take it away. That's why ""unconditional"" is the worst possible word to use nothing is unconditional. It's a blatant lie to get people to sign onto it.
 
The only way UBI would ""empower"" people would be if the people used it to empower themselves, particularly by pooling capital to buy ownership of the machines. UBI by itself doesn't empower anyone. It actually makes you even less empowered because you're now dependent on a central body.
 
 
See how people can get fired over something they said on Facebook? Imagine a situation similar to that, except even worse. If you hold the wrong opinions, buy the wrong things, say the wrong things, who knows, there goes your """"unconditional"""" basic income.
 
 
Think of it this way: what would you call it if I were a heavily automated nation's richest man and I gave out money to everyone in that nation every month? All goods and capital go through me first, and I pay out as I see fit. Everyone gets a certain amount of money.
 
You wouldn't call that ""basic income"" you'd call that an autocratic dictatorship. If I find you did something wrong, I could punish you by withholding your income. 

If I tell you to do something, and you don't do it, I punish you by taking away your income.

If I tell you to support me, and you support the opposition, I punish you by taking away your income.

If I tell you that 2+2=5 and you tell me it equals 4, I punish you by taking away your income.
 
What can you do to resist? Nothing. That income was your last hope to survive, and you blew it. 
 
""But what if we haven't automated everything yet and I can still work?""
 
Oh, joys! Because now I can turn you into a debt-slave.
 
I give you basic income, and you disobey my laws, social order, and will? I take away your basic income then demand you pay me back, with interest. You now have even less money than you started with. You don't pay me on time, I raise the interest rates. You're now indebted to me.
 
That's why it should never be seen as an ends to itself. It's a means, and only ever should be a means.

That's why I support [Vyrdism](/r/Vyrdism) and [technostism](/r/Technostism). 

Technostism is just the word that describes an automated society. A technostistic society is one that actively automates labor, and a technostist is a person who actively seeks automation.

I am a technostist I want to automate away as many jobs as possible, and I will do whatever I can to make sure jobs are automated. I am also a Singularitarian and national-transhumanist, which means I want to keep humans as far away from any new jobs as well. 

So it's obvious that Grade-IV Automation will unemploy a lot of people. That's why I'm a Vyrdist I feel we should own that automation, have it do our drudgery and labor, profiting off the technotariat. I'd like to go further into what Vyrdism entails, but right now I'm just trying to point out the flaws in thinking UBI will save us it *won't*. At best, it's a means to an end, and that end is, in fact, Vyrdism.


**tl;dr**: less basic income and more basic ownership. Basic income is a scheme to permanently defang the working class, and, most insidiously, it's promoted using language suggesting it'll actually be the best thing to ever happen to the working class. 


So if I had a son, and I saved up money, I would buy myself and my son robots (or shares of robots). Those robots would work for me. Thus, my son would never have to work and gets comfort and happiness handed to him. And because our income comes from our robots rather than from taxes or wealth redistribution, you have no right to take that comfort and happiness away from him.

This could be all of society if we decided to directly own technotarians.

_____________

In honor of my gilding, I'll tell you how Vyrdism works. 

First, read this: [As Vyrdists, We Must Accept A Truth Many Of Us Feel Sick Even Considering: The Free Market Works](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vyrdism/comments/3yhd4o/as_vyrdists_we_must_accept_a_truth_many_of_us/)

So let me work it into a pyramid. 

There's the base Vyrdism is not anti-free market, so if you believe the free markets are the cause of all our problems, you're not going to like what I have to say anyway. You also probably think ""free markets"" is synonymous with ""capitalism"", which might explain why you feel that way.

Then there's the next level Vyrdism is radically pro-automation and pro-technostist. As I said earlier, technostism is the promotion of automation. 

There's the next level [Vyrdists very strongly believe in the promise of worker cooperatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFyl0zz2yqs). The ideas of worker ownership and worker self-management is one of the fundamental aspects of the idea. We believe that the Modern American Democratic left's insistence on promoting unions over cooperatives/collective bargaining over collective enterprise is what's caused the utter collapse of the Left. I personally blame the Bolsheviks for ruining Leftism; thanks to them, Leftist movements have decided that vanguard parties that treat a whole nation like an authoritarian-capitalist business is the only way forward, hence why we always get failed State-Socialist nations like Cuba, North Korea, Cambodia, Venezuela, etc. Not one Marxist-Leninist government remains save North Korea and Cuba, and no one is flocking to these countries. Nevertheless, the fact that Leftism *still* so often equals ""bureaucracy and State force"" even in the minds of Leftists themselves is troubling.

The next level Vyrdists strongly oppose centralization. This means a love of things like blockchains, P2P, open source, free source, wikis, and 3D printing. We recognize why there's been such lopsided growth in recent years, why 'income inequality' is a big issue we decided to throw off authoritarian modes of government but keep authoritarian modes of enterprise. Don't get me wrong, there's always a role for authority. However, the incomes of the poor and middle class have not risen anywhere near as much as the rich because the rich benefit from an authoritarian mode of power over economic matters. It's centralization in action. It's Statism by another name.

The next level Vyrdists believe that political power comes from economic power. Attempts to alter economic power through political means have always failed and will always fail. After all one does not establish dictatorship to safeguard the revolution; one throws revolution to establish the dictatorship.  So if you want to create lasting change, start/join a co-op, hook that co-op up to a larger federation, and keep building up from there. 

The next level Vyrdists like how feel-good worker co-ops are, but there's a point to supporting them. The intention is what separates us from traditional syndicalists. Once automation has sufficiently spread throughout society, we will be prepared, as we will own the machines. There are further ways to get involved in this in the off-chance you missed the initial opportunity, including [seed loans](http://spikosauropod.com/2014/09/30/seed-loans-the-solution-to-technological-unemployment/) and [helotism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Technostism/comments/3v12kx/helotism/).

What did I mean up there by 'Grade-IV Automation?' I believe there are multiple grades of automation.

- Grade-I is tool usage in general, from hunter-gatherer/scavenger tech all the way up to the pre-industrial age.

- Grade-II is the usage of physical automation, such as looms, spinning jennies, and tractors. This is what the Luddites feared.

- Grade-III is the usage of digital automation, such as personal computers, calculators, robots, and basically anything we in the modern age take for granted. This age will last a bit longer into the future, though the latter ends of it have spooked quite a few people.

- Grade-IV is the usage of mental automation, and this is where things change. Grade-IV automation is where we finally see artificial general intelligence, meaning that one of our tools has become capable of creating new tools on its own. It is with Grade-IV automation that technostism, and thus Vyrdism, become possible (and, indeed, naturally begin occurring), as AI becomes capable of learning new tasks much more quickly than humans, and can instantly share its newfound knowledge with any number of other AI-capable machines connected to its network.

What is 'technostism'? Simply put, it's the pursuit of automation. As a technostist, I want to automate jobs.

However, there's way too much ambiguity with that term 'automation.' It could mean everything from using a spear to kill a sabre-tooth rather than your fists, all the way to artificially intelligent liquid-metal oceans.

So let's define the differences!

* **Grade-I** is *tool usage in general*, from hunter-gatherer/scavenger tech all the way up to the pre-industrial age.
* **Grade-II** is the usage of *physical automation*, such as looms, spinning jennies, and tractors. This is what the Luddites feared would lead to the death of Labour, hence why they wanted to smash the looms.
* **Grade-III** is the usage of *digital automation*, such as personal computers, calculators, robots, and basically anything we in the modern age take for granted. This age will last a bit longer into the future, though the latter ends of it have spooked quite a few people. However, Grade-III automation has not ended the world nor has it vastly inflated the unemployment numbers.
* **Grade-IV** is the usage of *mental automation*, and this is where things change. Grade-IV automation is where we finally see artificial general intelligence, meaning that one of our tools has become capable of creating new tools on its own. It is with Grade-IV automation that technostism, and thus Vyrdism, become possible (and, indeed, naturally begin occurring), as AI becomes capable of learning new tasks much more quickly than humans, and can instantly share its newfound knowledge with any number of other AI-capable machines connected to its network via collaborative intelligence. *This* is the point where the unemployment lines start exploding in size.
* **Grade-V** is the usage of *nucleosynthetic automation*. This is the most ethereal and strange of them all due to its nature, and it's far beyond us at this particular point. It's very closely related to atomism, which is the use of nucleosynthetic nanotechnology to alter the elements (i.e. turning water into wine, sand into water, rocks into bread, etc.). Because of the sheer amount of energy required, we won't reach this point for quite some time.",11,10

It will be a revolution bigger than any we've ever seen.

However, some of us differ on what we believe these changes will mean to humanity; Im convinced it'll be overwhelmingly positive. Why? It can be sumarized with this: [we humans incorrectly have a negative bias regarding the outlook for humanity](http://youtu.be/Sm5xF-UYgdg) but [despite what the news might tell you daily, humanity is better off today than yesterday](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/12/good-news-in-2015/421200/) and aditionally, [we live in a safer world now than before](http://youtu.be/NbuUW9i-mHs).

So my outlook on the future is positive; [I am absolutely convinced that the world has gradually become a better place for all socio-economic tranches of humanity](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095) and I believe that trend will continue.

So lets couple the two: we will have the biggest revolution in human history and humans of all walks of life will (IMO) benefit - including you and me. 

So: how can we best position ourselves for the changes? 1) accumulation of (relevant) knowledge and 2) accumulation of wealth.

**KNOWLEDGE**: As far as knowledge goes, Ive made it a mission to keep up to date on the most cutting edge trends in science and technology in order to understand which parts will have the most immediate and biggest impact. I urge everyone to learn about machine learning and deep learning, gene sequencing, CRISPR and other technologies that will most probably contribute to the revolution. Try to thoroughly understand their benefits in order to best position yourself to take advantage of their benefits. 

Also, **make sure to maximize your chances of actually living long enough to experience the revolution**: learn how you can minimize your rate of aging. One of the huge breakthroughs that WILL arrive is the advent of radical life extension. The problem is that this might come a couple of decades to a century from now - we dont know. By lowering your *rate* of aging, you are raising your probability to reach longevity escape velocity. Understand what drives aging, understand metabolism and mitochondrial health, understand the role inflammation has on aging, understand the role of aerobic training, understand beneficial supplements and how certain substances make you age faster. Even if you slow your rate of aging by 5%, what if thats exactly the amount you need to live long enough to receive the treatments of tomorrow so you can live for centuries? Take care of yourself because you've been blessed with possibly being able to be one of the first to access the new world we have ahead of us!

**WEALTH**: I said all of humanity will benefit, so why am I bringing up wealth? Because it is about getting access to the technologies as soon as possible. Just because we'll all benefit that doesn't mean we'll all benefit equally. If you want to position yourself for the best possible situation for yourself, you need to be able to afford it. Try getting an occupation that maximizes your salary, invest your money wisely, reduce your fixed costs (like mortgage), make a long term plan on how you'll use your wealth to accumulate more wealth. Get a partner since this is more economically efficient (and, ya know, its nice to have someone to love). Be smart about how you spend your money and dont excessively spend it on capital destroying activities (ie dont consume like a maniac). 

Guys - look.. This sub is one of the few pockets of the world that understands what we have ahead of us. We the subscribers of futurology have a huuge advantage in that we've been blessed with foresight; we understand the revolution of fire and the steam engine before humanity has started using them. We are in the best possible situation to take advantage of this knowledge upper-hand.

The above are just some protips from a person that tries to be aware of how I best position myself for our awesome future, please add your own opinions and comments on my points.",13,13

The Brexit was a measure influenced by populism. It might have its good or bad, but the people chose a course which may not be the best for civilization to advance.

History is full of the 'people', not informed enough or knowing they would be displaced, blocking a major change after another.

Given it is likely that the fruits of the newest and best tech will probably enjoyed by the world's 0.5%, and the rest getting only crumbs, the people might just upset the apple cart for 'the heck of it' rather than quietly wait and watch the wonderful progress created by the latest techs from well-financed companies , although they stand to gain little from it.

Many well-informed people say that democracy has served its purposes, and it is better for the most powerful, most wealthy and most intelligent to dominate everything with no input from the general public, whose average IQs tend to fall south of 100.

http://greyenlightenment.com/preventing-bad-policy/

&gt;One solution is to put the super-rich in power, who have the most to lose socioeconomically if things go wrong and thus in self-preservation will try to enact good policy that is stabilizing, not populist policy that is potential destabilizing. 

&gt;or example, a 90% tax on the rich may win the support of Britains bottom 50%, but it may hurt the economy significantly by encouraging divestment and slowing business activity. 

http://greyenlightenment.com/brexit-vote-a-bigger-deal-than-the-us-presidential-election/
&gt;This is why absolute monarchies or oligarchies are best government, because ordinary people cannot have such a disproportionate impact on outcomes. Americas democratic system creates the illusion that people can make a difference and have choices, but the most important votes, rightfully, are left to congress. The tripartite system creates redundancies and safeguards, ensuring that no one individual or the masses can have too much of an impact. No referendums. 

The future is driven by a handful of people and very rich individuals, with most people not having any involvement on it since there can't be none.

The way to the future has to remain stable. Elsewhere I wrote that instability will create unnecessary waste of time and resources.

Civilization 2.0 is elevating humanity and probably transforming it to something else, so it could explore and conquer infinite worlds. Some parts of humanity are now within striking distance of it, and only need maybe 50 years to reach there.

However we don't have 50 years. By 2045 the system will begin to crack, and I don't think current world can last till 2055, 39 years from now.

So that's why radical political transformation, to take power away from those unlikely to drive the world to Civ 2.0, will probably be necessary to ensure some of us get there.",46,0

There's been a lot of talk about this term and it is exciting to see where things are going. Hopefully not bad but you know.

So let's put our tinfoil hats on and discuss.

I have a fair bit of opinions and hopes myself.

- This one is a little controversial but it might be completely awesome if done properly.

Basic income. Just imagine a world where AI has all our jobs. Sounds horrible right? But when thinking about it imagine having a universal basic income system that allows us to be free from the clutches of employment.

A bored civilisation isn't necessarily a good one but in 50 years or so imagine people talking about how employment and jobs is as frowned upon as the monarchy system in the medievil ages. And even compared to slavery.

With AI taking all the jobs there will be more time to do things we love.

Also, I am pretty excited for human augmentations.

Imagine a world where immortality, higher intelligence and choosing your looks/personality and abilities.

Hmmmmm don't know how that'll go but its worth to talk about.

Let me hear your stories and dreams!",20,9

My definition of Civ 2.0 is this : A civilization which passes some point of no return so entities living in there can't imagine what life was like in the previous civilization.

It is like enlightenment, satori or 'eureka' moment. Although it will not come instantly, once it has arrived we can't ever go back.

So, anything which puts civilization in a different plane qualifies. No one knows which will get there to Civ 2.0 first, and we won't know until that moment arrives.

I was interested on Kardashev Type I Civ before as seen in my previous posts. However, getting there is too wasteful, and probably not practical. It was proposed during cold war with a different paradigm.

Robert Zubrin, who has said many times that we have to colonize Mars, said a Type I civ has spread across its planet, which is were we are at now, and a Type II civ has extensive colonies in the stellar system. 

Setting up a series of colonies, where people (in organic or inorganic forms) can travel there and exploit the resources, in the space certainly qualifies, as well as going to a different solar system and back.

Harnessing Fusion and Antimatter , thereby commanding more energy than what we can today, will qualify as Civ 2.0 but so far we have quite a long way to go.

Achieving a true AGI (an AI which can operate without human supervision and can run and improve itself) would qualify too.

Building nanobots which can, for example, turn a mob of rebels into a box of pasta, or turn a mountain of nuclear waste into harmless material, would also qualify.

Achieving immortality might qualify too, although I think just living long will probably do little good since there is only a limited amount of experience to be had on earth.

Transhuman or genetic improvements which will enhance human ability to a level high enough to make the person no longer considered as a human would also be Civ 2.0.

There might be more ways to reach the point of no return ; any of them is Civ 2.0 in my definition.

But I also think getting there will probably need a lot of resources, a lot of pain and a lot of suffering, as well as more and more money.

It won't be easy, it won't be a joyride and many people will oppose it, but it will have to be done since it is mankind's manifest destiny which has to be fulfilled.",16,10

It's probably stuck in traffic, you think. You pull up your phone to see where it is. Your phone shows an icon on a map, indicating that your car is about half way back from the grocery store. What's strange, though, is that it's not moving and it's not stopped at an intersection either. Your car must have broken down, so you call an Uber to go check on it. As you arrive, you see your car has been jacked up and is missing four wheels. Its windows have been smashed and it is covered in graffiti. The artist was apparently a fan of the male form. 

Surveillance videos from the police would later show that a masked man walked out in front of the vehicle, forcing your car to come to a safe stop. Then four other masked men came out and started going to town on your vehicle. They loaded up your tires, belongings and groceries into a van with an obfuscated license plate and drove off leaving your car jacked up in the middle of the road. The police inform you that this sort of attack is becoming more common and that they will let you know if they find your missing tires.",15,7
