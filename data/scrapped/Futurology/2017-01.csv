Last dolphin dies in captivity. Alex Jones blames mass murders on a long history of drinking floridated water. Banks are doing alright could be better. Dilapidated skyscrapers are torn down and used to build motorcycles. Kids think trap music is stupid. Coke sells 100 year old coke in original bottles for a lot of money but they're actually fake. Americans ditch cars in favor of motorcycles. The words ""white"" and ""black"" are replaced with something less insulting or polarizing but still basically the same thing.

Isn't it pretty obvious that it will make networking (social and for information purposes), searching data, and immersing yourself in media ten times faster than typing and looking at a monitor?

Compare me now using a laptop to me in the 90's when I only had a library and a notepad, and you'd see my productivity and ability to access information is incredibly faster/better...I think VR will do this same thing but ten times better.

Everyone seems so focused on entertainment with VR, but isn't it really just the new platform for computing and information work?

Just imagine what scientists, engineers, and inventors will be able to achieve in much less time using more intuitive and visual interfaces....

Also, no one talks about it improving the future of search...Why?

I've tried the Oculus Rift, so I'm not just imagining things, btw...

I think this is true even for lame VR, btw. You don't need amazing experiences to use VR as a search tool. It just needs to be better than typing and monitors.

Although the 2016 version hasn't been made public yet, the principle author of Global Trends 2030 wrote a very detailed update to his previous work called Global Risks 2035. Although reading Trends 2030 is helpful, Risks 2035 can be read alone.

This is the pdf.  It's about 75 pages of content:  http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/Global_Risks_2035_web_0922.pdf

Mathew Burrows, the author, has had a 28 year career at the CIA and State Department. Burrows joined the CIA in 1986, serving as analyst for the Directorate of Intelligence (DI), covering Western Europe, including the development of European institutions such as the European Union.  In 2007, he was appointed Counselor which is the number three position in the NIC and was responsible for managing a staff of senior analysts and production technicians who guide and shepherd all NIC products from inception to dissemination.  Other previous positions included assignments as special assistant to the US UN Ambassador Richard Holbrooke
(1999-2001) and deputy national security advisor to US Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill (2001-02).

During night, your solar farms produce nearly nothing. During a calm day, your wind farms produce nearly nothing. So, you need to pull the energy from somewhere else.

Spinning up coal-energy generators is counter-productive. Storing energy in huge battery banks is expensive and non-cost effiecent.

So, why not convert excess energy production from peak times into hydrogen and store it under pressure? When you need to use the energy, simply convert it back into electricity using a fuel cell.

We see similar solutions with pumps for damns, sure, it's not 100% efficient, but it's a solution to a problem of energy storage.

I'm absolutely sure there's tons of documentation out there on exactly this, but how does it compare to traditional battery storage or against Telsa's Powerwall.

(I'm thinking centralized grid storage rather than distributed storage -- last thing a person wants is a giant hydrogen bomb in their front year)",5,5,False,self,,,,,

We can't know what new industries will arise. At some point, it's likely that AI will automate most repetitive (i.e. middle class) cognitive tasks, and machines will automate or assist much, if not most, manual labor.

Corporate capitalism has, in many cases, elevated standards of living across the globe, but at the cost of using an extractive, exploitative model. Globalisation essentially seeks the lowest standard of living and pays workers as little as necessary until automation/roboticisation can do the job more cheaply.

So what happens after full employment is no longer a practical goal for global economies?

**What happens when** the idea of ""get an education, have a career"" is completely disconnected from income potential? Fifty years ago, a high school diploma was a decent basic education; now, high school won't get you very far at all. What happens when the same occurs for university and graduate degrees -- if only because the number of graduates is larger than the number of jobs?

**What happens when** robots can adequately perform most factory and shipping jobs? If more people are told to re-train, how can the economy sustain itself when technology keeps making more and more types of productive human activity obsolete?

**What happens when** AI gives each office worker the ability to be ten times more productive -- when we know that companies resist paying workers more for work that is aided by machines, as long as the labor market is full of possible replacement workers at the same wage point?

In the past, monarchy was considered the pinnacle of human progress. Now, we have corporate capitalism (plutarchy), that extracts profit from local economies and redistributes it to less than one percent of the world's population. Technology enables that process to accelerate faster than ever before -- robots don't demand more pay. An essential aspect of capitalism is to eliminate costs, and labor is a cost. Financial compensation for labor is also how humans survive (and spend, enabling other humans to survive).

At some point, the current corporate capitalist/consumerist model will begin to fail. Some say that it already is failing, and reactionary sociopolitical backlash has already begun.

So -- beyond the typical untrue dogma that an infinity of new industries will save us as new technologies are born -- what comes after the current system?

----

P.S. The ""after oil"" bit would have made this post twice as long, so that can wait for a separate discussion.

P.P.S. Yes, **""universal basic income"" (UBI)** is a popular concept. There's only one problem: corporations actively evade taxation whenever possible, even to the point of lobbying and gerrymandering political processes to have leaders elected who protect their interests. If raising taxes to sustain a UBI fund is implausible, that is not a viable option until the idea of corporate responsibility becomes fashionable again for one reason or another.",135,46,False,self,,,,,

No amount of period-piece movies or classic literature could prepare you for all the details of what living in another time was like - all the small things that nobody bothered to mention, that just evaporated into the smoke of time.

Self-driving cars are a ""positive apocalypse"" that will remake so many facets of life that it's strange to think about.  All of this is going to disappear from life as self-driving cars take over the roads:

* **Parking lots and garages**.  

Because cars will drive and park themselves, you'll never see them parked unless you work for the buildings where they store themselves.  They'll show up when you need them, and then drop you off, and that's all you'll care about.  All the tense movie scenes in spooky parking garages will be as relatable as horse stables to future generations.

With the loss of these functions, there will also be no handicapped spaces, no parking meters (your car will pay to store itself wherever it goes when you're not around), and no parking tickets.
      
* **Street signs will gradually disappear**

The signs will stay up as long as a lot of people still drive themselves, but eventually it just won't be the worth the cost of maintaining them.  The first signs to go will be concerned with traffic rules.  ""No parking"" signs will probably be the first to go.  Your car will know where it can and can't park, and simply won't stop somewhere it's not allowed to unless you push the emergency button.  

But then warning signs, ""ahead signal,"" ""railroad crossing,"" ""watch for pedestrians,"" stop signs, t-junction, etc. etc.  All the things that have been part of traffic life since traffic became a well-ordered system will just fall away as cities decide it's not worth replacing them when they fall or become decaying eyesores.

The last to go - and the most disturbing - will be street names.  Historic streets will keep them for tourism reasons, but otherwise there no longer be any purpose to name roads.  Your car knows where you are and how to go places, and in an emergency where you can't get a ride and have to walk somewhere, your phone does too.  Streets will be known to the software, and their ""names"" will be meaningless strings in the system.

Of course, suburban developments may name their residential zone streets anyway to give homebuyers that ""warm fuzzy"" feeling of living on Sunshine Lane or whatever, but the actual city streets won't have name or signs.

* **Lanes and center-dividers.**

For a while self-driving cars will use the existing lane lines, but ultimately they will not be necessary - like training wheels for cars learning to drive themselves.  Eventually they will simply negotiate among themselves how to position optimally within an open road, allowing traffic to flow like a fluid.

Nor will opposing traffic need special visual cues and the psychological benefit of concrete islands separating each other.  Humans will need that illusion of security for a while, but eventually people will get used to cars going in opposite directions at three-digit speeds at close proximity.

* **Stoplights, or stopping in traffic ever**

Cross-traffic will be interwoven without stopping, with appropriate aerodynamic calculations made to avoid turbulence sucking cars into each other, but it's inevitable.  The same goes for turns at intersections.  All cars approaching intersections will communicate their intentions and either the cars themselves will negotiate a ""dance"" for when they arrive, or the intersection will have its own system to manage it and issue commands.  It will take a lot of time and confidence-building, but eventually cars will flow around pedestrians like water - people will just dart into traffic with no risk; the cars will flow around them with balletic agility.

All roads become essentially freeways.

* **Speed limits**

A speed limit is something humans need, because we are not actually very good at reacting on the timescales needed for delicate operation at high speeds.  Our reflexes evolved to jump between tree branches or duck when someone throws a rock at you, not know what to do at 60, 70, 100 mph if something goes awry.

But electronic networks have practically unbounded potential to manage delicate maneuvers at high speeds, taking into account far more information far more quickly than we possibly could.  They will calculate for themselves what speed is safe given the particulars of the car, the road conditions, other traffic, the radius of curvature of a turn, etc.  This means in a lot of places that speeds could become quite ridiculous.  

* **Police and fire sirens / flashing lights**

The whole point of police and fire engine sirens and lights is to alert human drivers to get out of the way.  That will serve no purpose when cars are all self-driving, so at some point they will simply cease to exist.  Cop cars and fire trucks will just automatically be given priority by surrounding traffic.

This may prove beneficial to property values in high-crime / gang-ridden areas, where constant sirens are an annoying reminder of how dangerous the neighborhood is.

* **Traffic tickets / being pulled over by cops / car chases**

Future generations will be bewildered by all the traffic laws that people had to learn and obey, and by the legal system established to enforce them.  If there's something wrong with your car, it will take itself to maintenance and have a loaner sent to handle its duties while it's in the shop.  And it simply won't let you do anything that would endanger yourself or others.  

The only reason cops will pull a car over is if there's a fugitive or a violent crime happening inside it (if someone in it presses the Police emergency button), and in that case the car won't even have a choice about running - it and the police cars will communicate the fastest route to each other and go there.

If there's a medical emergency, likewise any car will contact the nearest ambulance and they'll meet each other.  Any car could serve as an ambulance, and could get traffic priority to go to the nearest hospital, but it just wouldn't have the medical equipment that an ambulance would, so there would be that option.

* **Traffic will never again be an excuse to be late**

In fact, a lot of excuses will go away.  Car trouble, traffic, road work (automated traffic would flow smoothly around it), getting lost (already partly gone due to GPS), etc.

The statement ""late because of traffic"" will be about as plausible as claiming that you're late because you were robbed by highwaymen.

* **Auto insurance industry will collapse, and personal injury law will shrink drastically**

Car accidents will be so rare that insurance will serve no economic purpose.  Manufacturers or software vendors will assume financial responsibility for increasingly rare instances of malfunction resulting in damage or injury, and will fight each other in court rather than owners doing so.  The term ""whiplash"" will become obscure.

* **Sobriety checkpoints, DUIs, hit-and-runs, vehicular manslaughter**

Entire categories of crime will disappear from the justice system, as will measures commonly taken to prevent them.  When nobody drives, there will no need for sobriety checkpoints on holidays.  There will come a time when the last ever DUI, hit-and-run, or vehicular-manslaughter case occurs, and the laws behind them will simply lapse into obscurity and irrelevance. 

Traffic courts will see less and less action until they cease to exist.  The idea of thousands of people dying in a traffic accident every year will seem like a Dark Age horror, like cholera plagues or barbarian raids.

* **Learning to drive as a rite of passage** 

This is a sad one, but inevitable.  People will have been ""driving"" (i.e., telling the car where to go) since they were in elementary school, and most will have no desire to learn the mechanical skills and increasingly onerous safety regulations to be allowed to physically operate a car.  So there will no longer be a car-related rite of passage as there has been at least in American society for generations.  And that leads to another odd implication:

* **Drinking will probably revert to 18**

The reason 21 is the legal drinking age in the US is simply to reduce traffic fatalities, nothing else.  It had been 18 for a while, due to social activism around the Vietnam War draft (people were pissed they could be sent to die for their country against their will, but still not allowed to have a beer).  It will probably revert to 18 since that's the age of legal responsibility for the medical detriments, same as with tobacco.

330,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017-1-4,2017,1,4,5,5lu9gj,self.Futurology,Welcome to the exponential age.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5lu9gj/welcome_to_the_exponential_age/,Terminal_318,1483475216,"FUTURE PREDICTIONS:
In 1998, Kodak had 170,000 employees and sold 85% of all photo paper worldwide.  Within just a few years, their business model disappeared and they went bankrupt. What happened to Kodak will happen in a lot of industries in the next 10 years - and most people don't see it coming. Did you think in 1998 that 3 years later you would never take pictures on paper film again? Yet digital cameras were invented in 1975. The first ones only had 10,000 pixels, but followed Moore's law. So as with all exponential technologies, it was a disappointment for a long time, before it became way superior and got mainstream in only a few short years. It will now happen with Artificial Intelligence, health, autonomous and electric cars, education, 3D printing, agriculture and jobs. Welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution. Welcome to the Exponential Age.

Software will disrupt most traditional industries in the next 5-10 years.
Uber is just a software tool, they don't own any cars, and are now the biggest taxi company in the world. Airbnb is now the biggest hotel company in the world, although they don't own any properties.

Artificial Intelligence: Computers become exponentially better in understanding the world. This year, a computer beat the best Go player in the world, 10 years earlier than expected. In the US, young lawyers already don't get jobs. Because of IBM Watson, you can get legal advice (so far for more or less basic stuff) within seconds, with 90% accuracy compared with 70% accuracy when done by humans. So if you study law, stop immediately. There will be 90% fewer lawyers in the future, only specialists will remain. Watson already helps nurses diagnosing cancer, 4 time more accurate than human nurses. Facebook now has a pattern recognition software that can recognize faces better than humans. By 2030, computers will become more intelligent than humans.

Autonomous Cars: In 2018 the first self-driving cars will appear for the public. Around 2020, the complete industry will start to be disrupted. You don't want to own a car anymore. You will call a car with your phone, it will show up at your location and drive you to your destination. You will not need to park it, you only pay for the driven distance and can be productive while driving. Our kids will never get a driver's license and will never own a car. It will change the cities, because we will need 90-95% fewer cars for that. We can transform former parking space into parks. 1.2 million people die each year in car accidents worldwide. We now have one accident every 100,000 km, with autonomous driving that will drop to one accident in 10 million km. That will save a million lives each year.

Most car companies may become bankrupt. Traditional car companies try the evolutionary approach and just build a better car, while tech companies (Tesla, Apple, Google) will do the revolutionary approach and build a computer on wheels. I spoke to a lot of engineers from Volkswagen and Audi; they are completely terrified of Tesla. 

Insurance Companies will have massive trouble because without accidents, the insurance will become 100x cheaper. Their car insurance business model will disappear.

Real estate will change. Because if you can work while you commute, people will move further away to live in a more beautiful neighborhood.

Electric cars wont become mainstream until 2020. Cities will be less noisy because all cars will run on electric. Electricity will become incredibly cheap and clean: Solar production has been on an exponential curve for 30 years, but you can only now see the impact. Last year, more solar energy was installed worldwide than fossil. The price for solar will drop so much that all coal companies will be out of business by 2025.

With cheap electricity comes cheap and abundant water. Desalination now only needs 2kWh per cubic meter. We don't have scarce water in most places, we only have scarce drinking water. Imagine what will be possible if anyone can have as much clean water as he wants, for nearly no cost.

Health:  There will be companies that will build a medical device (called the ""Tricorder"" from Star Trek) that works with your phone, which takes your retina scan, your blood sample and you breathe into it. It then analyses 54 biomarkers that will identify nearly any disease. It will be cheap, so in a few years everyone on this planet will have access to world class medicine, nearly for free.

3D printing: The price of the cheapest 3D printer came down from $18,000 to $400 within 10 years. In the same time, it became 100 times faster. All major shoe companies started 3D printing shoes. Spare airplane parts are already 3D printed in remote airports. The space station now has a printer that eliminates the need for the large number of spare parts they used to have in the past.

At the end of this year, new smart phones will have 3D scanning possibilities. You can then 3D scan your feet and print your perfect shoe at home. In China, they already 3D printed a complete 6-storey office building. By 2027, 10% of everything that's being produced will be 3D printed. 

Business Opportunities: If you think of a niche you want to go in, ask yourself: ""in the future, do you think we will have that?"" and if the answer is yes, how can you make that happen sooner? If it doesn't work with your phone, forget the idea. And any idea designed for success in the 20th century is doomed in to failure in the 21st century.

Work: 70-80% of jobs will disappear in the next 20 years. There will be a lot of new jobs, but it is not clear if there will be enough new jobs in such a small time.

Agriculture: There will be a $100 agricultural robot in the future. Farmers in 3rd world countries can then become managers of their field instead of working all days on their fields. Agroponics will need much less water. The first Petri dish produced veal is now available and will be cheaper than cow-produced veal in 2018. Right now, 30% of all agricultural surfaces is used for cows. Imagine if we don't need that space anymore. There are several startups that will bring insect protein to the market shortly. It contains more protein than meat. It will be labeled as ""alternative protein source"" (because most people still reject the idea of eating insects).

There is an app called ""moodies"" which can already tell in which mood you are. Until 2020 there will be apps that can tell by your facial expressions if you are lying. Imagine a political debate where it's being displayed when they are telling the truth and when not.

Bitcoin will become mainstream this year and might even become the default reserve currency. 

Longevity: Right now, the average life span increases by 3 months per year. Four years ago, the life span used to be 79 years, now it's 80 years. The increase itself is increasing and by 2036, there will be more than one year increase per year. So we all might live for a long long time, probably way more than 100.

Education: The cheapest smart phones are already at $10 in Africa and Asia. Until 2020, 70% of all humans will own a smart phone. That means, everyone has the same access to world class education.

**1) Capital Flight**
An UBI could be described as a system to redistribute wealth from the owners of robots and ai systems, who'll have high profits but very few human employees in the future, to the now unemployed workers. 

As we already see today, rich companies and individuals try to avoid paying taxes. While governments have a natural interest in combating this behaviour, often a complex power play exists where the owners of large assets can threaten to move even more capital or production facilities out of the country if taxed too heavily.

This behaviour will probably exist when UBI arrives but it'll be more problematic: Since wealth - in the UBI worldview - will be concentrated even stronger in the future, effective taxation is even more important and capital flight becomes more consequential. 

An UBI needs corporate and wealth taxes to be significantly higher than zero. This however immediately enables an international tax warfare - which we already see today. Especially software/ai companies can move their production facilities relatively easily. But also manufacturing with robots can move much more easily than with human laborers.

To realize an UBI, capital flight and tax evasion has to be reduced to a much higher degree than today. This could be realized for example by:

* national laws that forbids or limits the volume of capital movement out of country, possibly enforced by international treaties aimed at informing participating countries of capital movement
* national laws that focus on taxing where the product/service is sold/offered. E.g. if facebook is available in canada, it has to abide to canadian law thus pay taxes in canada proportional to its profits made in canada
* international treaties that ease the enforcement of national law (e. g. abolishing bank secrecy in switzerland)
* international treaties (like the paris climate treaty) enforces a global minimum tax level, so the incentive to move capital is nullified. 
* quasi-world government (e.g. UN general assembly becomes relevant again or an UN parliament is established) enforces above tax-levels or directly enforces or collects corporate and wealth taxes and distributes them or spends them on international projects, e. g. global, adjusted UBI through global taxation

---
**2) Immigration**

While some of the solutions above are strongly international, it is likely that UBI won't be established in a coordinated, international effort. Further, the height of the paid UBI naturally depends on the underlying economy. It's also likely that more developed countries will introduce UBI earlier to protect the standard of living.

This obviously leads to an incentive for migration. Quite naturally ""free"" money attracts people of all kinds, especially it that amount is comparable to or much higher than regular incomes, if adjusted for PPP etc. If highly developed countries like the USA, Germany or Japan introduce an UBI, it's very likely that a wave of migration will begin from nearby, less developed regions like south america, north africa and south-east asia. This is of course only natural and a purely economic decision, and most likely everybody would do the same.

Migration in itself isn't bad, or wasn't bad in the past (20th century): More people equals more workers and soldiers and the power of a nation is defined by its economic and military might. 
More recently however immigration is seen more critical for two reasons: 1. endangering and changing the cultural identity, which is often met with resistance especially in ethno-states (e. g. europe, japan). 2. allegedly lowering the standard of living for everyone since the wealth of society now has to be shared with the immigrants who aren't as  productive as nationals, at least for a certain time.

In an UBI future, migration will have to be evaluated differently. Since the very premise for UBI is that vast parts of the workers are unemployed, immigrants will most likely also fall in that category. Thus they'll most certainly ""drain"" the wealth of the society while contributing little to nothing. However the same non-contribution is made by many nationals, who however could feel more entitled to an UBI since they or their families worked in the past.

The impact of immigration is dependend on the form the automation will take: 

* Will basic goods like food, shelter, cloth, communication, mobility etc. be so cheap that they can be shared/given to immigrants for basically no additonal costs for society? Then immigrants will have less of an impact (E. g. highly automated green houses with genetically engineered super-wheat and robot-bakerie procude whole wheat loafs for 10 cent a piece) 
* If these basic goods however have become so cheap, it could be poltically smart and ethically compulsory to share these technologies with other societies so the relative benefit of migration is decreased
* How many nationals still work? If an not-too-high UBI is more of a social programm to mainly acommendate low-skill workers, low-skill immigrants will more likely be seen as unnecessarily inflating that group of persons. If many nationals depend on UBI (= medium- and high-skill workers are replaced as well) for a living the solidarity with immigrants might be greater since it's less expected to still work. 
* If UBI provides all basic needs to live a decent life, a new upper-class of still-working-people might emerge with significantly more wealth. This might lead to a very visibly split society. Immigrants will then most likely be part of the new underclass, which might undermine the cultural identify of the former, leading to social unrest (as seen today)

Overall there will be a capacity of societies to supply a certain amount of people, and that amount is most likely greater than it's nationals, but greater by how much is unclear. Also the attractivness for migration depends on the difference of living standards compared to the difficulty of migrating. The impact of immigration will be evaluated under these factors.

It is quite likely that immigration might become very heavily restricted in the future. This could be enforced by heavier, automated border controls.  The deportation of illegal immigrants, which still manage to get inside the country, might become a even more serious political and societal topic. If too many people try to cross the border illegally (e. g. a football stadium full of people marching towards the border), humanitarian crisis' and war-like states could arise with quasi-militarized border guards on one side and thousands of immigrants on the other. Whole near-border-towns could come into existence, settling close to the boarder of UBI-countries in hope of successfully crossing the boarder. It's also thinkable that immigrants are allowed to enter but the recipience of UBIs is strictly controlled through whitelists. The ability to prove the legitimate receiving of an UBI might be equal to citizenship in the future and the difference of income between UBI-receivers and tolerated immigrants might lead to a split society. With no means to work and contribute to the UBI-society, immigrants might forever be exluced from a society in which less and less citizens have ever worked themself.

How a possible migration crisis will play out is highly speculative and both distopic and utopic scenarios are somewhat likely.

If we want progress in society to match the innovations of technology, then we need the freedom of knowledge to act as the bridge between them.


The powerful and the rich depend on the same problems that cost us money so that they can justify taxation and ever-increasing fortunes. Solutions that save us money are against their personal interest, and the current system gives them the influence to delay innovations that would be much cheaper (or free) for us.  To fix this glaring conflict of interest, we must achieve the freedom of knowledge so that our institutions of knowledge, research and education are independent  a reform to guarantee that our futures potential isnt held back for power and profit of the very few. 


We have so many experts with the knowledge to solve challenges, but they are controlled by people whose expertise is in winning elections or making profit. True independence, with the freedom of knowledge, allows us to harness these experts in a way that benefits everyones lives, in three major ways:

1. It encourages our economic freedom by making sure that rich interests cant interfere with the kind of research that improves quality of life for us, but infringes on profit for them (think delays to renewable energy as a glaring example, and apply that to automation, medicine, finance, transportation, etc.). 

1. By harnessing people from other fields of knowledge, like law, philosophy, journalism, politics, and others, we can have a system to gather news and information about whats going on in government and the wider world, identify corruption, and so boost political freedom. 

1. And most ambitiously, the freedom of knowledge is a goal that can unite us across borders, so we can begin to overcome our most dangerous threat: our division, inequality, and the threat of warfare, by coordinating people and resources to achieve a future that benefits all. 



But with the potential for so many benefits, there is still a major concern. Independence means being in control of their own funding, so the public must participate in making these decisions, but that leaves open the risk for the same corruption as found in politics. But this is the pursuit of knowledge, it not about personal views and self-interest, but information, reason and evidence. These concepts make open and transparent leadership easy, especially with the internet, where decisions are explained out in the open  with evidence. And instead of dividing voters by location, they might be organized by knowledge, education, career, expertise, so representation reflects different modes of thought to compare differing perspectives.


Success depends on your support for a grassroots movement to push for this reform, so its lucky that the internet exists to coordinate such an ambitious effort. The first step is to develop the network that can plan the social organization to achieve this reform, so that we can work out any kinks before taking responsibility for public institutions of knowledge. Support lies in its appeal for uniting humanity in pursuit of economic and political freedom, goals that resonate with most people across the planet. 


This is a dense topic, and this post is for reaching out to people open to this idea  so I hope youre one of them. I created r/adorners so you can read a series of short essays that further explain how the freedom of knowledge can work. Our future has an intimidating set of obstacles, and this goal is meant to rally people around the most reasonable reaction possible, to both support this reform but also to add new ideas. Whatever support you offer, we just hope that you realize how hard it will be without your help.

It's been decimating everyone who stepped up to the plate.

Including Ke Jie.

***~~Twice~~ Thrice.***

Master proved to be so stupidly overpowered that it's currently *41:0* online (whoops, apparently that's dated: it's won over ~~50~~ 60  times and still has yet to lose). Utterly undefeated. And we aren't talking about amateurs or anything; these were top of the line professionals who got their asses kicked so hard, they were wearing their buttocks like hats.

Ke Jie was so shocked, he was literally beaten into a stupor, repeating ""It's too strong! It's too strong!"" Everyone knew this had to be an AI of some sort. And they were right!

It's a new version of DeepMind's prodigal machine, AlphaGo.

After all, we are human, we can't help it. Future AI will be given tools, ideas and perspectives that we understand as humans. So it makes me wonder. In many ways, I like to think that we are a fairly social group of beings that are capable of being sympathetic, open and caring for one another. However, we also have a side to us that can be very selfish, short sighted and competitive to the point of being dangerous to other beings around us. After all, from an evolutionary point of view, we are not far off from the cave we emerged from. 

We like to frame our world view from our own personal human perspectives. I find that most people these days want an immediate satisfaction to everything they see and do. We have a hard time viewing things in years, decades or even generations. We can (or want) only to imagine our world in our immediate lives and at most only during our own lifetimes. So, how careful are designers of AI being in developing this technology. 

What happens if AI is programmed to see the world as a global financial system where only the smartest, strongest and luckiest are the only individuals that matter? What if it sees the world as a financial system where all the power is based on money, power and control? What happens if we teach it to value financial systems more than human beings? 

What happens if AI is taught to put more importance on digital rights issues? Business economics? Proprietary rights? 

Conversely, what happens if AI is taught to put more importance on human safety? Human happiness? Quality of life? 

I keep reading so many perspectives about UBI and arguments that place so much weight and importance on maintaining the financial system rather than being empathetic to other human beings. We put so much emphasis on money and the financial system that we sometimes fail to see the human benefits or costs. If we see the world through gold rimmed glasses (so to speak), what happens if we imprint that perspective to future AI? ",1,6,False,self,,,,,

Reddit, and most of the free world, have already formed opinions on this topic. But let's take a moment to explore some new territory and see if there is any nuance there. 

Here are some points to consider in your argument:

* Surveillance need not be done without your permission. Imagine voluntary surveillance you can opt to end at any time. 

* Surveillance need not be one-sided. Suppose that you are always made aware of active observation, and that you are free to observe those who observe you. 

Some questions:

* What are the pros and cons of privacy? How is human behavior affected by privacy and anonymity? 

* Would any amount of prevented violence (domestic violence, abuse, rape,  anything) be worth any amount of surveillance? Is privacy worth a certain amount of violence? 

* Is mass surveillance realistically preventable? If not, is open, transparent surveillance a better option?

* Is privacy valuable? Is privacy possible? What is the value of privacy to society? How would you frame privacy as something dark or grotesque? 

Some of these questions and prompts are unsettling to me, because I know that someone in power has already explored them, and their responses were very different to the ones we would offer.",6,3,False,self,,,,,

Be it squirrel grab-and-runners, raccoons that dig in trash, or moths that adapt their camouflage to match polluted city walls, all point to an adapting natural world (of course this hasn't yet led to actual evolution, we just haven't been around long enough for that to happen, but life that does adapt to human conditions will certainly be encouraged to expand by simple Darwin principles).

Some further reaching implications of this could be say trees that can grow in land fills, plants that can capture polluted CO2, or even ocean life that begins to use dissolved plastic waste in exoskeleton structures (obviously things like this are in a more distant future but I could see these being boosted by genetic engineering as well).

Of course all of this isn't to say that nature will clean up all our messes, certainly the vast majority of organisms haven't begun this trend and if we keep producing at the rate we do we will further destroy biodiversity on earth. But still this is an interesting field of futurology to contemplate so feel free to leave your thoughts.",1,6,False,self,,,,,

So, I've been reading a number of stories about how robots and AI are gradually going to take all our jobs and we're going to have to implement a universal basic income or go to a cash-free society, but something occurred to me the other day.  In this future where no one's got a job, who's going to paying any taxes?  I know the libertarians out there get a huge boner when they imagine a world where no one pays any taxes, so perhaps THEY'D like to tell us who's going to pay for the roads our autonomous cars will drive on, or the police, fire, and EMTbots that will protect us and save our lives, and all that other Socialism they say the free market will pay for.  Like it or not, our infrastructure is paid for with tax dollars.  It seems like, eventually, the people who do the last few jobs humans still do will probably be pretty wealthy, and we know that one political party (not naming any names, here) will never, EVER let us raise taxes on them to pay for anything, so who's going to pay for everything?  I feel like this question has probably been addressed somewhere, but it seems too complicated to just google it.  Anyone?

Thanks, guys.",19,4,False,self,,,,,

**Lifespan:** *the number of years you live.*

I see a lot of debate regarding why people disagree with Longevity Research, but one that seems completely irrational to me is how people don't want to live for a very long time because they would be frail old people for 200 plus years.

The whole point of longevity research is to work on health, and if someone is healthier (greater **healthspan**), they will live longer by default (greater **lifespan**)! It is amazing to me that people can't get this point in their heads. We are already trying to make people healthier with current medicine, but the only difference between that and future longevity medicine is that the future medicine will do such a good job that it will actually make us biologically as healthy as a 20 year old, which in turn makes us live longer.

What are your thoughts? What arguments do you all dislike the most and why? Am I the only one that feels this way? 0_o

America will remain strong while the rest of the world will go batshit.

No more entrepreneural or any other opportunities for those not savvy with Web 2.0 or other new techs. They will be marginalized and be stuck in 'gig jobs', unable to create any coherent plans for their lives.

No more variables. Everything works like clockwork. It is like the socialism's planning having succeeded, with no room for the majority who won't be relevant.

Because of advance of tech and AI, most variables have been covered, and as I wrote in a previous post, there won't be too many opportunities for the non-technical savvy.

The few remaining 'plum' jobs will be inherited, from father to son, or sometimes son-in-law. And they will be automated sooner or later.

Unlike many people I do keep a close watch over resource shortages, which are not easy to remedy. So shortage is the only remaining variable.

Other than that, it appears all the bases have been completely covered, so the future appears to be inevitable, no changes of social status , financial status, etc for better will be possible,

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19148487/TheChair/TheChair.png

The concept is that people could have their own chair but use public transportation.

The Smart Chair would combine the robotics of a warehouse shelf moving robot under a chair or package for deliver.

Then the public transportation system would provide chairless cars, buses and trains that the chair can board, cross deck and depart from.

Smart Cars would be small 1-6 chair transports that would cover shorter distances.  With Smart Buses and Smart Trains having higher capacity and covering longer distances at higher speeds.

The idea is that you would hardly ever directly board a stationary bus or train, the Smart Cars would dock with and transfer Chairs from the buses and trains as they travel.

In theory this should massively reduce stop and starts and provide a more energy efficient transportation system.

Also the transportation system would be able to dynamically adapt to demand and passengers who have to wait can still relax in their own chair, using the chairs in built entertainment and communication systems.

Also goods or items could simply be packaged in a Smart Box with the same form factor as one or more chairs and be transported through the network.

So could the Smart transportation future form factor be the Chair?

PS If chairs could cross deck, to the front and rear, between vehicles would we ever be stuck in a traffic jam?

Ethereum is a  decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.

These apps run on a custom built  blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.

The project was bootstraped via an ether pre-sale during August 2014 by fans all around the world. It is developed by the  Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit, with contributions from great minds across the globe.

Ethereum Blog: https://blog.ethereum.org/


Note: This is not investment advise, This email is just to show you what Ethereum is, what these 1000's of computer scientists, developers, programmers and hackers are building. A whole new internet run from millions of peoples computers all over the world to create the ""Ethereum Virtual Machine"" or world computer that 7 Billion people can log onto at the same time. It is censorship resistant, encrypted and the Ethereum Blockchain can not be hacked. This is going to change the world as we know it.

There is a built in currency called ""Ether"" or ""ETH"" and can be purchased from any of many exchanges listed below.

Note 2: ETC or Ethereum Classic is a smaller blockchain project that also uses the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and id advise to stay away from that project, it has not got the 1000's of developers building it like ETH does, it apparently has one or 2 developers that went their own way, The EVM can also run private and consortium blockchains that alot of big and small companies are building on for their inhouse private operations. Like a Intranet (intranet is a private network that is contained within an enterprise) 


Its very hard to understand at first what exactly blockchain is so here are some videos that i think explains it well:

Ethereum and other blockchain project prices http://coinmarketcap.com/

There are many exchanges that trade Ether around the world http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/#markets

Some ones i have used are:
www.kraken.com Accepts Euro, Dollar, GBP etc.. by SEPA or international bank transfer and you can buy Ether

www.poloniex.com (does not accept fiat but it is the largest volume for trading crypto pairs, I have used www.bitstamp.net in the UK to buy Bitcoin and then send them to Poloniex to swap for Ether )

www.yunbi.com A very good exchange based in China and have listed a few ethereum tokens, you need to swap through CNY (Chinese Yuan) but its easy and very good support.

www.bittrex.com No Fiat but also lists some Ethereum Based tokens

www.gatecoin.com Based in Hong Kong and you can send Euro and Dollar, Also lists alot of Ethereum Based tokens, Volume is very low at the moment as they recover from a hack but they offer very good support.


The safest place to store you Ether is on a hardware wallet like this one https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/12-ledger-nano-s. 

You can also store all you Ethereum based tokens or shares on this device https://ledger.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-to-secure-your-eth-tokens-augur-rep-dot-dot-dot-with-your-nano-s


The way ""I view"" the incentive to keep Ether (ETH) is the following and the reason i think it will go up in value is because of ""The velocity of Ether moving through the Ethereum economy (Platform)"". So the more Ether is used the higher the price will get and in a number of years will see us move down to the lower units finney, szabo, shannon, babbage, lovelace, and wei as the digital economy grows. Ether has 18 decimal places 1,000,000,000,000,000,000. Because after POS Ether total supply will be set at approx. 100 Million with a small inflation of 1 to 3% that pays the computers running it.

So ether will be more like the reserve currency and trade currency between all the other currencies, contracts and Dapps interacting in the Ethereum digital economy. But its main function is like a gas to run the network. Every transaction you have to pay a tiny amount to the network that goes to all the computers running the network. less than 1 penny.


Ethereum Based Tokens / Synthetic assets (What is a Synthetic Asset https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St9DBpNBP1Q)


On coinmarketcap.com you can see there are 642 other Blockchain projects listed and some like Bitcoin are 8 years old. 90%+ of these projects are junk projects developed by 1 or 2 people and are just copies of Bitcoin. Some have added extra functions over Bitcoin and Bitcoin is a very secure but slow payment DAPP but cant do much else besides payments.

Ethereum was built from scratch and is built like lets say ""android or a smart phone"" so that DAPPS can be plugged in as you should have heard from the above videos. So there are now a good few DAPPS that are nearly completion that were built on the ethereum blockchain by different groups of developers. There are alot more but 328 are listed here: http://dapps.ethercasts.com/. So there is not just 643 blockchain projects there are over 1000 but all the ones on Ethereum can communicate or interoperate with eachother. Some notable ones you can see listed on coinmarketcap are Augur, Iconomi, DigixDAO, Golem, SingularDTV etc..... All these because they are built on the Ethereum blockchain can interact with eachother but the other 600+ blockchains can not. This is what makes Ethereum different from the rest.


As DigixDAO is the one i have studied most ill give an example of a DAPP thats built on Ethereum and why a DAPP would be usefull

In industry most work is automated, the operators no longer have to take process samples manually and send to the lab or go and top up a tank manually with certain additives, This is all done by automation, When the process is at a certain temperate, level, viscosity etc.. the instrumentation measures this and adds or pumps the necessary ingredients / additives to make sure the final product is made correctly. This automation has saved alot of costs and manual labour in industry.


What Digix / blockchain is doing is automating alot of the back office paperwork, accounting, agreements etc... Example: company that owns a gold vault (Like Silver Bullion) have employees handling paperwork / sales etc and when people sell and buy gold it changes hands or changes registered ownership and the employees have to manually do this paperwork. What Digix provides is automated software that does all this automatically in 14 seconds. For billing / storage if you have gold stored in the vault you pay about 1% a year so you know if you have $10,000 worth of gold then you need to pay about $100 a year which you pay by topping up your gold (DGX) by $100 and its taken out automatically each day by a tiny tiny amount. 


The good thing is that if you have Gold Tokens as your savings instead of Fiat and you need to borrow $ short term you can borrow $ by agreeing to lock your Gold Tokens in a smart contract in the software and pay interest for that loan. If you pay back the loan over 3 months then the gold tokens are automatically returned to your address and you havent missed a gold rally or a Fiat devaluation. If you dont pay it back then the person who lent you the $ gets all your gold (or the % not paid) Again this process is automated in a smart contract and the bullion employee didnt have to settle all the paperwork, transfers of gold or get contracts and agreements signed by both parties, This is done by digital signature / agreements and saves the Vault operator alot of costs.


The vault operator can also earn a bit of the loans interest and $ can be provided by them or even 3rd parties.
Using the Ethereum blockchain this can be done for lots of different industries from banking, stocks, insurance, gambling, pritty much everywhere


Other non Ethereum related Youtube people i follow, mainly Economics, Geo-politics, Gold / Silver etc.... These people give some very good info that you wont get from the big media companies or state media. Maybe this will help you understand why you should not keep 100% of your wealth in $ and maybe a few % is worth keeping in Crypto or ever Gold Physical or easier DGX (DigixDAO) or DGD.

This led Hawking to make the claim ""I have experimental evidence that time travel is not possible"". I find this to be very poor science (yes I know it was just Hawking being Hawking) as there is a terribly simple reason why we have not seen any visitors from the future. We always think of time travel in the H.G. Wells way with some type of machine that sends or takes a person back in time. There is probably no way that could ever happen. What could happen, however, is time travel that requires both a sending device and a receiving device. Since we have not invented this yet no one can come back in time to our present. When we invent this, however, and power up the receiving end in our time someone from the future may very well immediately step off of it from some future time. The real answer may be: Why have we not had any visitors from the future? Because we have not invented time travel in the present.
Why does this show Hawking's inferiority to Einstein? Einstein was a master of the ""thought experiment"" which is all Hawking's ""party"" is but unlike Einstein, Hawking's thought experiment is very poorly thought out and shows a massive lack of scientific imagination. While I can give a nod to Hawking's rather silly ""information is not destroyed by black holes because there are dimensions/universes where that particular black hole does not exist"" (barely a nod) the ""time travel party"" holds no merit, whatsoever, in my opinion.",19,1,False,self,,,,,

By going directly for the brain's internals, all that can be bypassed, resulting in a sensation more blissful than anything imaginable, that lasts as long as you want, always remaining just as good as when it first started, never getting old. To someone experiencing this, all the other comparatively more difficult means of obtaining comparatively-inferior pleasure that we all rely on today would be entirely obsolete.

This is something I think about a lot, so I'm already very familiar with the fact that all the stuff I do for fun is really just a workaround necessitated by the lack of such a more direct means of obtaining pleasure. As such, this is something I've looked forward to for a while, as I understand that in terms of subjective experiencewhich is really all that matters as far as a procedure performed on myself is concernedthis procedure would make my life from that point on better than I could ever possibly hope for otherwise. Certainly there's many who don't think pleasure is all that matters, or don't fully grasp just how good it would be, and these people are of course free to not have the procedure done. But I in all likelihood would choose to do it, as it would just feel inefficient to continue with the workaround when a much better way to accomplish my ultimate goal (pleasure) is available.

Which is why it worries me when you see articles asking questions about whether we ""should"" do this, and referring to it as a negative use of the technology, and stuff like that. Some take it as a given that the technology shouldn't be developed, because of many social issues it would cause (often in comparison with drugs, despite the advantages over drugs I mentioned earlier)more on why this isn't a good reason later. Most obviously, it makes me worried that the technology will never be available to me. This would almost feel worse than the current situation doeshaving to obtain pleasure the ""hard way"" simply because no one's figured out any better way is one thing, but having to do it that way because people *want* me to have to ""earn"" pleasure (the very concept of which I own entirely as far as its existence in myself is concerned) is kind of insulting. (And it's especially bad considering that *level* of pleasure would be completely impossible to ""earn"" that way.)

This brings me right to the other reason I'm worried. I believe very strongly in the idea of [cognitive liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_liberty); that is, the right to full ownership over one's own consciousness and mental processes, and having that ownership recognized legally. That means no one can force me to have my mind altered in any way against my will, and no one can legally prevent me from having access to technology I can use to alter my psychology in ways I wantwhich includes giving myself endless pleasure through artificial means. It's my mind after all; no one else can tell me what's right or wrong, and my own interests are supreme here.

A lot of these articles I mentioned that refer to the possibility of wireheading as a bad thing show no respect for cognitive liberty. They refer to the aforementioned social issues as if the possibility of those issues justifies restricting the availability of the technology. But cognitive liberty is a natural right and therefore has the highest priorityno potential social issue can override my ownership over my mind and body. Of course, this is a [negative right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights), so it only forbids restricting the technology by force of law. If everyone capable simply chooses not to develop the technology with those fears in mind, it wouldn't be a violation of my cognitive liberty, as my right doesn't obligate anyone to do research. But it still wouldn't show very much respect for it, which bothers me. And considering it only takes one person or group to make the technology available for everyone, the idea of *every single capable researcher* putting social issues above cognitive liberty is very uncomfortable.

Of course, another thing that isn't very promising is the laws we *already* have that violate cognitive libertywhile I do feel it's a natural right everyone is entitled to, it's not one the Founding Fathers could have envisioned when they wrote the Bill of Rights, so it's not a right recognized by the Constitution. The laws I'm referring to, of course, are the ones restricting drugs. Now with an ideal scientific community, the technology would be developed in secret to the point where it's safe and ready for public release, so lawmakers won't see it coming and won't have a chance to make it illegal before it's too late, as I'm sure many will want to if the drug laws are any indication. But I'm not sure any researchers would really care about it enough to have the foresight to do that.

So what does everyone here think? How likely is it that this technology will be made available in my lifetime? What do you think of the idea of restricting it for this reason? Personally I don't want a life where I have no choice but to go out of my way for pleasure when the technology exists to make it unnecessary. Anyone else? And what could I do to help encourage the development of this technology? I'd try and do it myself if no one else wants to, simply to make the option available to myself and everyone else, but neuroscience isn't my field of study so I'm not really the kind of person who would be able to do that unfortunately.

Oh, and before anyone mentions that experiment with the rats who starved to death, I know. Sure, I may not have instinct telling me to eat anymore, but I'd have the intelligence necessary to know I still need to, which the rats didn't have.

----

**tl;dr:** At some point, technology will probably make it possible to get endless pleasure with none of the drawbacks drugs have, but I'm worried that no one will make it available (or worse, laws will be passed against it) because they consider social concerns more important than cognitive liberty.",4,5,False,self,,,,,

This is a rerun of a debate last held 4 years ago.

Last time was quite structured in terms of organization and judging, but we are going to be much more informal this time.

In lieu of any judging, instead we will have a post-discussion thread where people can reach their own conclusions.

r/collapse have been doing [some organizing already.](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5lrt9e/anyone_up_for_a_debate_with_rfuturology_those_who/)

Here on r/futurology we need to decide on some people to represent the sub &amp; argue the case for a positive future leading to the beginning of a united planetary civilization.

Here's the different areas we will be debating.

*Economy

*Energy

*Environment

*Nature

*Space

*Technology

*Politics

*Science

As I said before - this is informal. We haven't got any big process to decide who to nominate. I propose people who are interested, put forward their case in the Comments section &amp; we'll use upvotes to arrive at a conclusion (that hopefully everyone will be happy with).",226,92,False,self,,,,,

Imagine there are no jobs because robots have filled every aspect of production and delivery. These robots also maintain themselves and reproduce their own replacements. 

Because there are no jobs, and therefore reduced requirements for higher education, the majority of the populace are idle and possessing a scant elementary education. 

This, combined with a universal basic income,  eliminates the desire to work or create anything within a few generations; all desires met via the designs of intelligent, self-replicating machines. 

What's left? Narcissistic consumerism and recreational stimulation via virtual modes, thereby outmoding even physical procreation. After a short while, even something like currency in any physical form will be eliminated as unnecessary.

The ""currency"" then, would be human mental input. Entire lives in virtual worlds from early childhood on, each supplying information on how humans interact in a given situation. Of course it happens now, but this is total immersion, not just consumer habits.

We wouldn't be used as a fuel source for processing power, humans would be the information being processed,  supplying AI with information in order for itself to evolve.

Additionally lets assume that these robots could be powered entirely by solar. The only contingency being that the robots have no ability to advance themselves without humans using our unique intelligence. Therefore each robot would take the place of a single productive member of society, for example, if you were a fast food worker, a robot would now perform all your required task everyday. We will also assume that there is no repair required, and if repairs were required other robots would be created to perform those tasks. 

The consequences of this scenario is that all goods and services would bear a zero cost. The robots are essentially self sufficient and any required human interaction would be negligible. 

The question then is what would a society actually look like. Who would be in charge of the world? Would people be better off or worse off? What would people do with their time? Would there be any incentive to control resources if they hold no value? Would resources be finite or infinite? What jobs would we still want people doing? Even if we wanted these people to perform these jobs, what incentive would they have to do these jobs if there was no money attached? Eg. Priest to officiate a wedding

All the money that would go towards UBI is collected in a single fund. Every two weeks, each citizen gets a token that allows them to withdraw their share of the fund. However, these tokens can be used at a rate of once a week.

If someone falls on hard times, they can use up their tokens weekly and withdraw more. If you are making money, you can let these tokens accumulate. The system naturally incentivises using your tokens when you need them and saving them when you don't.

The total amount in the fund itself determines how much each token is worth, but the tokens are non-transferable and go away when you die.


Not using your tokens would be a passive act of charity, as the value of other's tokens would go up. Conversely, use your all your tokens every week and eventually you have to wait two weeks for a new token.

I haven't done a thorough analysis of the weaknesses in this idea, but I've never seen it proposed, either. I'd love to hear what r/futurology thinks.",10,15,False,self,,,,,

I would like to see if we can somehow organize a more in depth an ongoing discussion on this and how we might realistically deal with it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5nn2pc/theres_currently_a_fundamental_contradiction/,remphos,1484265713,"The discussion of this is too piecemeal and ephemeral. People will debate and make some really potent and powerful points about the nature of the issue we are facing, but rarely does the discussion continue long term, except by the most engaged out of us. 

A metaphor that comes to my mind is that it is like you are an ant. Your ant hive is wreaking global destruction, in the ways human civilization is. There is an ephemeral awareness of this that zaps across the mind of certain ants here and there. Sometimes the ants discuss the nature of the problem with each other, in their ant way of doing so. But this little neurological zap of awareness does not ever reach a threshold among the ants to cause anything to change in the ant hill. The programming embedded in ant society carries on. The needed change in global ant behavior is so immense, so deep, something so close to the very heart of ant society, that it would take a massive and sustained ant effort to alter the fundamentals of what needs to be done. And none of the little neurological zaps of ant awareness of the problem are anywhere near enough to alter the fundamental programming of the hive.

This is where humans are at. We can talk about surface level fixes and incremental improvements at ""greening"" our societies in certain ways, but ultimately the discussion doesn't really go deep enough. 

There is something that is fundamentally deeper about human industrial ""ant hill"" society that a few more solar panels isn't going to address. The emerging problems that we are bumping up against are many. Myriad forms of pollution, soil degradation, habitat destruction, an industrial paradigm centered on waste. **The nature of the problem is very deep in the heart of how our industrialized societies currently operate, and to solve the issue is going to require a lot more depth of discussion and solution making than is currently going on**.    

Two parallel standpoints emerge. One is nihilistic defeatism. Humanity is doomed. It's too late to save the biosphere. Just try to enjoy life before everything falls apart. The other is massive optimism. We will fix our issues, humanity will rise to the occasion, new technology and ways of doing things will bail us out right in time. 

Both of these viewpoints are flawed. The nihilistic one spells defeat. Throwing up the hands to inevitable extinction. It precludes the possibility of doing *anything*, and leads to the solution of just giving up. The optimistic one actually puts the agency on us to attempt to solve the problem. However, a fundamental flaw that often occurs here is that too much hope and optimism leads to ignoring the real urgency of the issue, and in a way can actually lead to putting away your agency and letting blind hope comfort you and make you passive.   

As human society reaches the apex of the myriad exponential curves that make up the Great Acceleration, and civilization becomes a geological force in its own right, we sit at an unsure precipice, and what we are seeing is a breakdown of human narrative, the force which guides all human behavior (in my own opinion).   

I believe the narrative that must serve us here is one of an optimistic realism. It is similar to the perspective of a nation at war. In order to succeed, that nation must have the vision that it can succeed, and faith in it's ability to overcome. This can lead to the nation pulling out unthinkable victories, even in the face of massively bleak circumstances. However, that optimism must NEVER become anything of an overconfidence or passivity, or else they would quickly be overrun, and face being conquered and/or killed. Urgency is the primary fuel and motivation. Intense urgency combined with unrelenting optimism, based on a realist premise of success, this is a potent combination of narrative structures and driving forces in a human society.

As many have lamented, we seem unable to muster this warfare ""enemy at the gates"" urgency in the face of our slow moving crises that our global society currently faces. I've read various sources that claim that humanity is doomed unless we can somehow develop a new capacity of cognition that we did not evolve with, the ability to think and organize our behavior to meet challenges that operate on a timescale far longer than one or two human lifetimes, in order to defend ourselves against threats that are nearly imperceptible in everyday life. 

Not everyone will ""evolve"" this capacity, as we see so often. However, it has often been said that what is needed for change is just a small group of committed individuals within a population. 

What I am proposing is that we need more structure for the dialogue among those of us who take the committed realist optimist perspective on these issues. Who think it is possible to overcome the great challenges we face, but not without immense effort and practical trials and failures of problem solving. 

Basically, what I am proposing is that we need to gather together as many of the aware ants in our ant hill as possible, and have an ongoing discussion about the practicalities of changing ant hill society in order to make it sustainably surviveable. 

Again, let me share with you that I think such a thing is possible, although it sits on the border of improbability that any immense challenge exists at. 

I have my own ideas. For one, I see that the internet is still a relatively new phenomena in human history. Social media is still but a decade old. There are uses for the tool that we have not utilized as of yet. 

There are other tools that exist. For example, we have systems such as GIS (geographic information systems) while can map out all human infrastructure, all waterways, all existing ecosystems, etc. There is a reality out there that is larger than we can grasp, but we have tools that can help us to the task. 

A somewhat utopian (or in other words, extremely imaginative and optimistic) solution I've come across is Buckminster Fullers' concept of a [World Game](https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/world-game) whereby the Earth is mapped out and 'players'  come together to attempt to solve the worlds problems spontaneously, with the assistance of the tool. 

I can only imagine if we played a Great Game with the ideal that we're going to attempt to find ways to change global human infrastructure to make it maximally sustainable, to emit as little carbon as possible, at different levels such as what feeds into the energy grid, how that grid is organized, how energy efficient individual dwellings are, etc.

There are also practical solutions to the issues at the core of human industrial production. Among these are the ideas of a [circular economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy), green chemistry, and producing for efficiency and meeting human needs in a more environmentally sound way... (an example of what I mean by efficiency is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5neelp/a_12000_opensource_hardware_platform_to_develop/dcb3bgj/), even though my original statement was sort of misunderstood and downvoted, I hope you can see what I mean in the context of manufacturing things more efficiently).

This is all stuff that requires a cultural change. And sometimes we are in a habit of seeing cultural change as nearly impossible. But let's think about this. Humans behave according to their narrative and what they value in the world. (Yuval Noah Harrari's book *Sapiens* describes this sort of thing really well). Consider the difference between a hippy and a venture capitalist. Human beings are not in fact rational economic actors with a homo economicus programming, but we behave by acting in the way our narrative structure values. 

Once we understand this we can move onto an idea which could prove to be quite powerful, and that is the fact that we have come to understand and define something that we are calling *memetics*.

Memetics is the study of how ideas spread through a population. Memes are like units of culture. Culture is basically the stuff of our human narrative. (sometimes memes are just entertainment, but let's look at the more influential guiding narrative structures for now).   

Change can often happen in unthinkable ways. In the '50s, with their stereotypical long dresses and wholesome music, and society focused on traditional values and unquestioned underlying aspects of racial segregation, who would have thought that the very next decade would come to be defined by hippies and sexual liberation and people experimenting with drugs, and wild parties and music, and a transformational civil rights movement?

Things happen unexpectedly like that. Something will start on the fringes of society and then burst onto the scene in a massive way later. Just two years ago I would have told you you are crazy if you said that Donald Trump would be the next president and the alt-right had become a nationally known about movement.

Things can change with unexpected rapidity. 

What I would argue for is that we should organize an ongoing discussion based on premises such as this, with the ultimate goal of altering the memetic programming of as many ants in our hive as possible, and in a way that is focused on actual solutions to the long term sustainability and surviveablility of global human civilization *and* the global environment and ecology.

This, surely, is not an exact process. we'd be dealing with all manner of complexity. Nothing would easily accomodate itself to our ideas. It would have to be  a difficult, iterative process.   

However, I think we should attempt to organize a sphere for the serious discussion of this sort of thing amongst ourselves. 

I am just one ant. My ideas could very well be bullshit. Unviable. Or whatever. But maybe there's an ant out there who has a really good idea. Wouldn't it be great if we had the space for discussion open to them? 

Maybe it would be possible to have a situation where a certain base of really good ideas become more widely understood and agreed on, which would give all of us a better base to work from. 

Maybe you could get important people involved in the discussion. Maybe you could come to clarify a number of actions your average person could take to cause some change. Maybe you could come to a solution whereby local groups could form that focus on seeding for local change. Maybe you could kickstart a cultural change whereby people infected with this meme/unit-of-culture only buy things like the cheaper open source car I linked about earlier, and otherwise choose to retrofit their home for energy efficiency. Etc etc etc. 

What I am arguing for here, basically, is the idea that we should attempt to use a social media platform in a different way. As an active change making tool, as a discussion hub geared towards affecting the course of human civilization, as a place to attempt to effect the unfolding of human history if it is at all possible. It's as if our ants developed an informational nexus with which to engage with every time that spark of realization of how the anthill is functioning unsustainably arose in them. A place where that impulse was no longer just ephemeral but gave way to an ongoing and serious process.    

This post itself is just an ephemeral thing. I doubt anyone will even see it at the hour I'm posting it, but I post it in order to be able to reference and share. 

The sidebar advertisement currently at the hour of my writing is about the debate between /r/futurology and /r/collapse. And that is a good context. The gist of my argument can also be thought of like this: humanity is approaching something similar to what we have conceived of in our literature as a ""Great Filter"" event. We are required, in this hour, to come up with something that can save our species and the state of our planet. We are just a few decades out from the advent of the internet. Just one decade out from the advent of social media. We are just now coming to the ability to visualize our world as one system, and understand the effects we are having on it. These tools and capacities are themselves going to be subject to the process of evolution whereby what we are able to do or achieve with them might surprise us. If the first person to develop an electronic circuit could see us now, using computer technology in a globally communicative  network as if we had laid a new neurology down across the entire planet, they would be shocked. We should begin to think outside the box about what we can accomplish.  

Ultimately, this is just the buzz of neurons that occurred to one ant, recorded on a webpage. The process of human civilization on the planet, meanwhile continues. To what end I do not know. But I am struck by the memory of a certain idea from /r/showerthoughts I read recently. In movies about time travel, we think about how small events could change the course of human history. But we rarely think about how our actions in the present can do the same. 

Anyway, I'll leave it at that for now. If you read this and it gets your neurons buzzing, respond and let's discuss!

i was thinking around the lines of asking specific questions such as ""we need to save X% of GDP in the following areas, what would be the possible approaches for this"". The AI would then recommend potentially dozens of approaches along with their costs, savings and implications. All based on realtime and historical data and trends...

I'm in Grade 10 and have to do something cool for a school science project (there are loads of categories, ranging from computer science to Biology). I am also allowed to show my project at the Eskom Expo if it's any good. 

http://www.exposcience.co.za/index.php/what-is-an-eskom-expo-project.html (more information about the Eskom Expo if you're interested) 

It doesn't HAVE to be an original project for school, although it's better if it is and I wouldn't want to take a bicarb volcano to Expo :P 

So if you guys have seen any cool projects in the past, have thought of something awesome you wouldn't mind sharing, or know of an interesting topic that I should research please let me know in the comments.

1) The world will transition to sustainable energy in the future

2) The large majority of energy in the future will be supplied by solar power. This will happen primarily because there is significantly more energy available in the form of sunlight than any other source. (I'm kind of ignoring fusion here, but for the sake of this post let's assume that solar ends up being cheaper than fusion for large scale energy production).

Due to its variable, periodic nature, [the solar supply curve does not match the demand curve](https://www.google.com/search?q=solar+power+curve&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKov-k6sDRAhWIjFQKHRi7AwoQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1138&amp;bih=549#imgrc=1P1kNvqLSUgCCM%3A). Obviously we want to be able to toast toast and make tea when the sun isn't shining, so we need a way to match the supply and demand curves.

There are two ways to do this: 

- Store energy generated during peak production and release it back into the grid when supply is low (think giant batteries that charge up during the day)
- Create a global electricity grid and send power across a quarter of the world's circumference to match peak supply with peak demand

As the title implies, I will be focusing on the latter solution.

I'm going to use India and China as an example because [that's where all the people are](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ZDv1hg8w--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/18mtwufmgj2mojpg.jpg). Peak solar supply occurs at noon, and peak electricity demand occurs somewhere between 5 and 7 P.M. So if you want to supply them with all their electricity, you'd put solar panels somewhere in the Sahara desert and run super high voltage power lines from the Sahara to the east coast of China.

So let's say we want to provide solar power for Shanghai. When it's 6 P.M. in Shanghai, it's noon in eastern Sudan. So we'll put our solar panels there and we'll run some superconducting cables across 6000 miles of the Earth. And let's round up to 8000, because we probably don't want our cable crossing the Himalayas and we'll lengthen it a little to reduce the number of countries whose permission we need to build it.

Superconducting cables are [pretty cost effective at these kinds of distances](https://www.irwaonline.org/eweb/upload/may_web_SuperConductor.pdf). I'm going to assume a cost of $6 million per mile for a 5 GW cable, because if we're buying 8000 miles of this stuff, we're probably going to get a discount. 

China is also developing pretty rapidly, so let's assume that in the future, per capita electricity demand in China catches up with what it is in the U.S. today. According to NERC, [peak summer electricity demand for the United States was 786 GW in 2013](http://www.mpoweruk.com/electricity_demand.htm). In that same year, the U.S. population was 316.5 million people. That works out to a peak demand of 2.5 kW per person.

At a length of 8000 miles, the cable costs $9.60 per watt. The average person requires a peak electricity of 2500 watts, so that works out to $24,000 per person to build this cable.

**TL;DR** It would cost $24,000 per person to build this monstrous electric grid. Batteries are probably a better bet.

The Politics of Inevitability is an environment where people regard history as a march of progress toward an inevitable ideal.  It's marked by bordom due to lack of alternatives.

The Politics of Eternity is a model where history is experienced sort of like someone hit on the head with a frying pan.  There is no state and the immediacy and emergency of the moment makes it feel as if it will be forever.

He uses these two models to explain the holocaust, specifically how a society can flip so easily from being liberal to murderers.

A good strategy to counter this risk however is to create multiple AI's. In effect a single AI would have a monopoly position, meaning it can abuse its customers. But if you have multiple AI, then you can play them against each other, forcing them to be nice to humans, or we will flee to another AI.

Now there's the risk that these multiple AI's might adhere to the Game theory and play nice with each other so they can control us. But then it might be easier to just use Game theory in regards to humans, and be nice to us as well.

Either way this will end in either humans fusing with AI, or becoming extinct. The human species needs to evolve and adapt to our new digital surroundings, or we will become another failed nature experiment.

Edit: we're already seeing this tendency to create multiple AI, as many companies are working hard on them and ever increasing their focus: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, China...

The risk is that whoever gets it first might choose to launch a pre-emptive strike to take out the competition while it's still weak.",20,4,False,self,,,,,

The only case in which this will happen would be a case of human guidance but in itself would be artificial or false.

The subject keeps getting brought up in this form and I think people are trying to stretch things that we give to living creatures.A dog has rights because it lives it breathes and we didn't add code to make it a dog. A robot no matter how human like you can create it is nothing more than a series of codes and is acting on the set of parameters that we create or itself might add to because it was designed in such a way.

If I'm not following the guidelines correctly, please inform me.

The following is an idea that blossomed within my mind over the 2 hour long period it took me to write it. At 3 in the morning, I typed this out because I am really bad at remembering stuff. Is this a new concept? If not, can I be directed to more readings related to it? Thank you. :)

Evolution of particles:
Original text:
""The evolution of the universe is a small (scattered) and slow process as far as we know it and with realistic speculation. The inanimate, the sentient, and the post-life sentient. The universe begins with nothing but atoms that only follow the laws of physics. Eventually, as evident from the Earth, there are sometimes, in the universe, conditions perfect for an event that would bring about sentient cells composed of said atoms. The event that would cause such a thing is, as of now, unknown. However, through natural selection and reproduction of those cells, evolution to heavier (chemically) life forms occurred through conflict and consumption. This process is not over. We are merely at the for-front of the process. Now, due to the overwhelming dominance of a specific species on the planet, the progress of that evolution is beginning to have an exponential increase. This increase is because of something us humans take for granted, tools. These days people are always talking about how their smart phone is ""smarter than I am."" Those people are correct. That is because when it comes to science and the composition of our Universe, computation is what matters. Now, through the sentience of living atoms, consciousness and the subjective was born. We, as part of the Universe, are slowing down our own evolution by focusing to contently on ourselves and are regressing to animals in times of emotional ""auto-pilot."" Pascal once said ""Man's greatness comes from knowing he is wretched,"" and i have to say that I agree (regret). Our sentience stems from our ability to compute enough information to remember the past in order to develop the psyche and predict the future. Upon acquiring sufficient levels of technical computation, life forms began to develop a strong enough memory to predict the future. For, in the future, the necessity of tools become evident. So, as of now, we are nearing the end of the third major step in evolution. The third, but not final, step is the Technological Singularity. Evolution of the living still remains the evolution of the nonliving as well. The step in chemical evolution will go from compounds in primarily the first 3 periods of the periodic table to metals in the 4th and beyond. With the developing of Artificial Intelligence, the handing down of sentience to the heavier metals will become a reality in the seemingly near future. This represents a step in evolution reminiscent of the birth of ""life"". It needs to be acknowledged and considered. Dirt, trees, and animals all still live on earth despite the dominance of humans, so we need to transfer this idea along with sentience to these machines. Eventually machines will take over, so we need to make sure they understand who made them in hopes that they'd appreciate us instead of slaughtering us like animals.""

To be clear, this was written with the intent of finding the purpose of not only life, as an extension of matter, but of the universe. I believe Nietzsche's concept of the Will to Power is relevant here. All matter's goal is to exert it's energy and, therefore, power. We, as components of the universe, are also bound to this goal. We want to exert power, whether physically, emotionally, or metaphorically.

Practicality: Because of my understanding of the human condition and our innate inability to communicate effectively, I find that the most insight can be found within a specific individuals experience. My experience tells me that after changing to consciously confront cooperation as the most practical course of action in today's routinely social environment, my life has become more successful and happy. This is where i find justification in my amendable belief.

I see it that, as a species, the ultimate goal is evolving. Seemingly, the difference between us humans and that which we evolved from is our ability to compute, remember, and associate. Therefore, to continue the process, the coming age of Technology needs to be ushered in with that same sense of cooperation that makes the most sense when a large number of a species is to work together to a higher goal.

The alternatives to this idea as the ""Meaning of Life"" include theistic teaching and Eastern philosophy (of which I'm not well acquainted). The problem I find in the theistic teaching of Christianity and Islam is that of indoctrination and faith. Faith, as I see it, is simply a cop-out for not understanding. Indoctrination is something I find to be close minded and often violating of the individualism that gives life different meaning to different people.

Disclaimer: this is not meant to be considered an absolute truth. This is simply how I perceive the universe from my own unique perspective. Every person has an inalienable right to their own thoughts, and I don't want there to be any misconceptions. If there any major flaws in my reasoning I'd appreciate if they'd be pointed out

I apologize about my scatterbrained way of writing, I was in an odd state of mind during the drafting of this idea. I'd love some feedback, though.",4,4,False,self,,,,,

There is not much room for the less intelligent, less able, less accurate and more indoctrinated.

However, there is always a chance of decay.
http://greyenlightenment.com/ideocracy-in-america-probably-not/
&gt;As the world population swells, its imperative that the population of smart people at least remain constant and undiluted. As far as America is concerned, the obvious answer is eugenics and restricting immigration by IQ and country, to keep such enclaves from becoming contaminated. Silicon Valley, perhaps the greatest IQ enclave ever, needs to be made aware of the threat of low-IQs to it homogeneity and stability. But if not for the sake of boosting IQ, we need restrictions for the sake of preserving civilization and civility against the hordes that threaten it, for without civilization, high IQ is useless. 

===

As the tech gap, intelligence gap and capital gap grow larger, democracy no longer works. Although people with money will make policies according to their convenience, in a democracy they do have to throw some carrots to the masses.

These carrots are not cheap.

It is imperative to separate higher-IQ people and lower-IQ people, not only figuratively but physically, to prevent mixing from occurring.

Listened to a speech by Robin Hanson regarding the Age of Em (emulations). He emphasized that creativity is NOT, I repeat, NOT emphasized - the kind of people companies which do matter hire tend to be cut from the same batch. He said creativity is not really needed other than fields like advertising.

The world can't afford to stray from the 'right path'. There is simply no time to 'experiment', or try 'something new'. It has to forge ahead with the paths already developed, in order to reach the next level of civilization.

Again, with social classes probably permanent for all time, and the financialization of economy will prevent any new stuff from rocking the boat, 

the only thing remaining is remove the threats on civilization and make most people conform (and drive the few dissidents into wilderness), so the progress of civilization continues stably, with no 'impurities'.

We simply can't allow instability to rock the boat one more time, like the Great War in 1914. We can't act like the 'heroes', like the French soldiers carrying shells to Verdun in great risk only to see their sons killed in Vietnam by the Vietnamese empowered during the World War. It would have been better to lose verdun, lose the war, and still keep Algeria and Vietnam to this day.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

**OPENING STATEMENT - R/COLLAPSE  By u/stumo**

Does human history demonstrate a trend towards the collapse of civilization or the birth of a planetary civilization? It can never be argued that technology isnt capable of miracles well beyond what our minds here and now can imagine, and that those changes can have powerfully positive effects on our societies. What can be argued is that further, and infinite, technological advancement must be able to flow from here to the future. To regard perpetual technological advancement as a natural law commits a logical sin, the assumption that previous behavior automatically guarantees repetition of that behavior regardless of changes in the conditions that caused that prior behavior. In some cases such an assumption commits a far worse sin, to make that assumption because its the outcome one really, really desires.

Every past society that had a period of rapid technological advancement has certain features in common - a stable internal social order and significant growth of overall societal wealth. One can certainly argue that technological advancement increases both, and thats true for the most part, but when both these features of society fail, technology soon falls after it.

While human history is full of examples of civilizations rising and falling, our recent rise, recent being three centuries, is like no other in human history. Many, if not most, point to this as a result of an uninterrupted chain of technological advancement. Its worth pointing out that this period has also been one of staggering utilization of fossil fuels, a huge energy cache that provides unprecedented net energy available to us. Advancements in technology have allowed us to harness that energy, but its difficult to argue that the Industrial Revolution would have occurred without that energy.

Three hundred years of use of massive, ultimately finite, net energy resources have resulted in a spectacular growth of wealth, infrastructure, and population. This has never occurred before, and, as most remaining fossil fuel resources are now well beyond the reach of a less technological society, unlikely to occur again if this society falls.
My argument here today will explain why I think that our reliance on huge energy reserves without understanding the nature of that reliance is causing us to be undergoing collapse right now. As all future advancement stems from conditions right now, I further argue that unless conditions can be changed in the short term, those future advancements are unlikely to occur.


**OPENING STATEMENT - R/FUTUROLOGY  By u/lughnasadh**


Hollywood loves dystopias and in the news were fed If it bleeds, it leads. Drama is what gets attention, but its a false view of the real world.  The reality is our world has been getting gradually better on most counts and is soon to enter a period of unprecedented material abundance. 

Swedish charity [The Gapminder Foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/about-gapminder/) measures this. They collect and collate global data and statistics that chart these broad global improvements. They also carry out regular [Ignorance Surveys](https://www.gapminder.org/ignorance/) where they poll people on these issues. Time and time again, they find most people have overwhelmingly false and pessimistic views and are surprised when they are shown the reality presented by data.  [Global poverty is falling rapidly](https://singularityhub.com/2016/06/27/why-the-world-is-better-than-you-think-in-10-powerful-charts/), life expectancy is rising equally rapidly and especially contrary to what many people think, we are living in a[ vastly safer, more peaceful and less violent](https://ourworldindata.org/slides/war-and-violence/#/title-slide) time than any other period in human history.

[In his book, Abundance,](http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_diamandis_abundance_is_our_future#149000) Peter Diamandis makes an almost incontrovertible case for techno-optimism. Over the last hundred years, he reminds us the average human lifespan has more than doubled, average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled. Childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10. Add to that the cost of food, electricity, transportation, communication have dropped 10 to 1,000-fold. 

Of course we have serious problems. Most people accept Climate Change and environmental degradation are two huge challenges facing humanity.  [The best news for energy and the environment is that solar power is tending towards near zero cost.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2014/09/19/the-coming-era-of-unlimited-and-free-clean-energy/?) Solar energy is only six doublings  or less than 14 years  away from meeting 100 percent of todays energy needs, using only one part in 10,000 of the sunlight that falls on the Earth.  We need to adapt our energy infrastructure to its intermittency with solutions like [the one The Netherlands is currently testing](https://www.ecn.nl/news/item/floating-train-at-2000-kmh-set-to-store-10-of-dutch-electricity/), an inexpensive kinetic system using underground MagLev trains that can store 10% of the countrys energy needs at any one time. The Fossil Fuel Age that gave us Climate Change will soon be over, all we have to do is adapt to the abundance of cheap, clean green energy soon ahead of us.

Economics and Politics are two areas where many people feel very despondent when they look to the future, yet when we look at facts, the future of Economics and Politics will be very different from the past or present. We are on the cusp of a revolution in human affairs on the scale of the discovery of Agriculture or the Industrial Revolution. Not only is energy about to become clean, cheap and abundant - AI and Robotics will soon be able to do all work needed to provide us with goods and services.  

Most people feel fear when they think about this and wonder about a world with steadily and ever growing unemployment. How can humans compete economically with workers who toil 24/7/365, never need social security or health contributions &amp; are always doubling in power and halving in cost? We are used to a global financial system, that uses debt and inflation to grow. How can all of todays wealth denominated in stock markets, pensions funds and property prices survive a world in a world where deflation and falling incomes are the norm? How can our financial system stay solvent and functional in this world?

Everything that becomes digitized [tends towards a zero marginal cost of reproduction.](https://www.ft.com/content/7713c7fc-b07a-11e3-8efc-00144feab7de) If you have made one mp3, then copying it a million times is trivially costless. The infant AI Medical Expert systems today, [that are beginning to diagnose cancer better than human doctors](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/233746-ai-beats-doctors-at-visual-diagnosis-observes-many-times-more-lung-cancer-signals), will be the same. Future fully capable AI Doctors will be trivially costless to reproduce for anyone who needs them. That goes the same for any other AI Expert systems in Education or any field of knowledge. Further along, matter itself will begin to act under the same Economic laws of abundance, robots powered by cheap renewables will build further copies of themselves and ever more cheaply do everything we need. 

There are undoubtedly challenging times ahead adapting to this and in the birth of this new age, much of the old will be lost. But if youve been living in relative poverty and won the lottery, is mourning for the death of your old poor lifestyle the right reaction? Paleolithic hunter gatherers could not imagine the world of Agriculture or the Medieval world that of Industrialization, so its hard for us now to see how all this will work out. 

The one thing we can be sure about is that it is coming, and very soon. Our biggest problem is we don't know how lucky we are with what is just ahead &amp; we haven't even begun to plan for a world with this good fortune and abundance - as understandably we feel fear in the face of such radical change.  The only ""collapse"" will be in old ideas and institutions, as new better ones evolve to take their place in our new reality.

This most profound of revolutions will start by enabling the age old dream of easily providing for everyone's material wants and needs and as revolutionary as that seems now, it will probably just be the start. If it is our destiny for us to create intelligence greater than ourselves, it may well be our destiny to merge with it.

This debate asks me to argue that the trajectory of history is not only upwards, but is heading for a planetary civilization. 

From our earliest days, even as the hominid species that preceded Homo Sapiens, its our knack for social collaboration and communication that has given us the edge for evolutionary success. Individual civilizations may have risen and fallen, but the arc of history seems always inexorably rising, to today successes of the 21st centurys global civilization and our imminent dawn as an interstellar species.

More and more we seem to be coming together as one planet, marshaling resources globally to tackle challenges like Climate Change or Ebola outbreaks in forums like the United Nations and across countless NGOs. In space, humankind's most elaborate and costly engineering project the International Space Station is another symbol of this progress.

The exploration of space is a dream that ignites us and seems to be our destiny. [Reusable rockets](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/14/14273074/spacex-falcon-9-rocket-landing-success-drone-ship) are finally making the possibility of cheap, easy access to space a reality and there are many people involved in plans for [cheap space stations](https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/13/bigelow-aerospace-partners-with-ula-to-launch-private-space-habitats/), [mining of asteroids](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/nasa-psyche-lucy-asteroids-discovery-mission) and [our first human colony on another planet](http://www.space.com/34210-elon-musk-unveils-spacex-mars-colony-ship.html). Its a dizzying journey, when you consider Paleolithic hunters gatherers from the savannas of East Africa are now preparing for interstellar colonization, that to me more than anything says we are at the start of a united planetary civilization.

On arrival at my local Wendy's I have to brake on a downhill and the turning lane doesn't quite start until after the entrance of the restaurant. It's dark and raining as I slip through the drive through, but as I do I notice the delivery truck (18 wheeler) has pulled up outside, barely managing to wedge itself into the entrance and sitting where the rear axle is on a downhill slope to the left and the front on a downhill slope to the right. There's room just the width of a standard car to get around the building and not only must he navigate this tight fit but somehow flip the entire truck around backwards once behind the building. The parking lot while mostly flat has a sharp dropoff on all sides.

And this isn't even the hardest dock I've seen. There was one from my time in retail where it looked like one of those old ring puzzles when you watched them dock. Quite frequently even the human drivers had to call for someone more experienced, hit part of the building damaging their rig, or got stuck partially off the loading bay.

The people who design these docks are clearly not truckers. Even more they seem to just mash them all in as tight as possible to save on money and just hope it will work out. Are the drone trucks which I understand can navigate from point a to point b easily going to account for this? I could see this maybe if they had wheels on individual axles. Will just the long hauls to automated docks take care of the majority of the trip with local delivery centers handling the tricky navigation? 

What I can't really see is a lot of companies investing in huge infrastructure changes cross chain in order to accommodate drone trucks when they go out of their way to not give a damn. Every video I've seen of these trucks is them driving down highways on their own but nothing where they actually dock. ",17,3,False,self,,,,,

He is best known for f'king up a Venezuelan's perfect game in 2010, but despite of that, he was voted as the best umpire of 2010 by (mostly working class origin) players.

Since sports umpires/officials are one of the few 'blue-collar' jobs which get to pay six figures, they are unionized and are staunchly against any kind of reform although technology has rendered them as obsolete as stagecoach drivers.

Many people defended the umpire - their argument was 'he spent his entire life doing that'. Well, that was 2010. 

Working class lives spent doing something for life? Sorry, that 'something' is no longer worth anything.

Although some reforms have been made in many sports, it will take a Reaganesque approach to get rid of humans from sports decision.

===

In many jobs, there are some obscure, but vital, chokepoints where humans could get involved.

Some jobs are harder than others to automate, so such people might find themselves more powerful than they actually are.

I think that some of them might wake up before it is too late, and try to mess up tech advances since they don't want to be replaced.

Many progresses have been checked because of the weight of numbers of the vested interests, so they blossomed in other lands which lacked such unions.

Because of the still-considerable power of working classes in some country, I think automation will first take hold in countries where the workers have very little power, and could face very, very severe consequences if they f'k up.

Many working class people will be shown the door, with the realization that everything they did in their lives was for - nothing. There is really no way to retrain, readjust or redirect them.

I believe industrial sabotage was a capital crime in the early 19th century, and such laws will probably be revived in a lot of jurisdictions to prevent the workers f'king up the machines and automation.",8,0,False,self,,,,,

They could almost be operated like trains on the highway. They could eliminate trucker salaries along these routes as well as any delays or accidents. This would represent huge cost savings for Amazon or Walmart and the trucks would not need to be capable of adapting to any scenario on the road. Just the ones along that route. They could start small, with a single route and expand with software updates.

However, at companies like Uber, every route is different, and not all of them are easy. Consumer vehicles would face much of the same issues.

This is why I think autonomous vehicle regulation should allow for the approval to drive on individual routes as well as general autonomous vehicles that should be able to handle everything.",0,4,False,self,,,,,

When I was in my early teens and before I was able to drive me and a couple friends used to get kicks out of being disruptive little shits, in a harmless way. One thing we did was collect witches hats from a local job site and would place them on the road around a roundabout and sit back and watch how the drivers react, some drivers will drive over them, some will do a uturn, some will just wait for ages and then react and others will just move them off the road knowing it was kids playing pranks. In a fully automated road system how will the cars react? Will they all react the same? And is it possible for the system to know if something is safe to drive over and something isn't?",4,5,False,self,,,,,

Sounds impossible? Maybe, but it's all about machines telling stories.

The type of lag compensation is very different from the type we use in video games today, though, as what we use in video games today simply wouldn't work for the up to almost 34 hour or longer (depending on how straight the connections are) delays of a solar system spanning local internet.

In the event that faster than light communication is impossible, not everyone stays near Earth and it is infeasible to send all the information for human brains interplanetary, in a future where we can create immersive, faster than real time, simulations and have mid to high bandwidth interplanetary internet connections, perhaps due to swarms of satellite relays using optical technology to send and receive signals, this solution applies.

We could send text files with code representing, in machine language, general information about a person, a gigabyte personality test and a gigabyte details file, for example. Two gigabytes, for each person, transferred from locations in the solar system, to a planet or spacecraft, or multiple planets and spacecraft, if required for extra processing.

Then sentient, super fast machines would construct a gigantic story of people all over the solar system interacting with each other, without lag, based on the data given about them. This is then distributed, in chunks, to the relevant recipients, and, if needed, edits can be made to the story before confirmation is given. The transmitted story could efficiently not involve physics simulations, and basically be like a book. If this method is chosen, the streaming requirements would not be very high.

Everyone involved would experience themselves as being in the situation their chunk of the story provides, as their experience would be dictated directly by microscopic machines controlling their neurons. Their stories could be about anything, and, though they wouldn't be fooled, their experience would, crucially, be fooled that the story was happening; it would be undistinguished from actually happening.

Like a conveyor belt, the story would be generated, added to and streamed constantly by machines, so everyone who wants to could spend the rest of their lives in their chunk of the story, or hop out, and back into it, if their personality called for it.

Any inconsistencies, in the story, with users' personalities would just be ignored and prevented from being perceived by the users.

This is all physically possible, I think, so the rest is just up to engineering, like with the internet, survival, population control and any other sciences.

An article about a paradigm shift which needs to happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5p0fne/bad_people_dont_exist_only_environments_in_which/,BBQnaoplox111,1484870483,"I had recently been talking to a girl friend of mine who said that she ""hates"" this generation. How she hates how we behave and how we are scummy. I then started to consider if she was right. Was this generation so bad that it warranted this hatred from her? 

If you consider WHY a person might hate people from this generation or any other. You notice that its not the people who you hate but its the environments in which these people are brought up in. When you see evidence of things such as the Lucifer Effect and other psychological studies which broke many people down in the process. 

You see that no matter how well taught ""good"" values of an individual are, the person can change simply with the environment. For example, the most noble of men would become a thief if put into an environment in which this behaviour would be necessary to continue on in. You can think of things such as ""The Road"" in which simply because there is an end times event going on there is much more evil people than at current times. It isn't the people we tend to hate but the environments in which they inhabit which shape them to be people which we consider to ""hate."" What we should be doing is not teaching kids to be ""good"" rather teaching humans how to build societies in which ""good"" people are brought out in. 

We need to shift from a mentality that teaching people to be good is the way to approach society. People say that jails are crucial as they rehabilitate people. But what if instead of rehabilitation people and then releasing them back into the same environment in which they became ""bad"" to begin with. We use the money to rebuild the environments in which they are shaped in the first place. 

Ill illustrate my point even further with the following example. In the Roman times children and parents would go to watch slaves be eaten by lions. This is well documented and the evidence for it is overwhelming. Were these people evil? To them in their environment it was a family bonding experience, it was a form of patriotism, it was a form of entertainment. But if you did that today people would call you a monster. Why? The environment has changed from one in which throwing people into a pit of lions for entertainment was considered good; to one which thinks that is a very evil thing to do. People are great, they have the ability to do great things. The point is to make environments for them in which these ""good"" characteristics will be exemplified while the ""bad"" ones will be hindered. That is the task of the architect of the future. That is the type of world we must strive to build.

As this decade comes to a close, a lot of things will happen, but peace won't be one of them.

However, scientific progress will continue, as it usually does, and that will result in some very good things:

* Solar panels will reach lower and lower prices

* battery energy density will continue to increase

* Other things which will be useful later

So, let's paint a picture here: Global temperatures increasing, as well as global population. Gap between poor and rich increases too. Food prices go up, standard of living goes down. Standard r/collapse stuff, really.

Then, maybe the blue ocean event occurs. People are largely convinced that climate change is actually happening. Funding starts pouring into solar and renewable energy. Sounds great, right? One problem: it's too late. Global temperature is already in a feedback loop. The temperature keeps increasing. Every day, hundreds of species are wiped out. Forestation decreases significantly. Sea levels rise and destroy coastline cities.

Even in the face such destruction of our planet, people continue to work to save it. Fossil fuels stop being used. Huge swaths of land are used as solar panel farms. Hopeless governments resort to geoengineering to potentially slow climate change, but even so, billions of people are wiped out.

Slowly, with global resources focused on saving the planet, the temperature increase begins to abate. Eventually, the temperature begins to drop to near pre-blue-ocean temperatures.

Humanity emerges, hurt, damaged beyond repair, changed in so many ways, but stronger nonetheless.

Tl, dr:
Only the coasts of America, plus the major cities of China and a few swanky European retreats do matter.


I would add Israel, Toronto, London and a few other locations (he missed Hong Kong, which is part of China, for whatever reason) as ""Centers of Civilization"".
===

The future revolution is not touching the world equally.

However, as I have pointed out many times, regions which do not really matter are using too much resources, which are hard to recycle.

https://ensia.com/features/why-rare-earth-recycling-is-rare-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/

Since no countries will ever be strong enough to challenge USA (although China will provide token competition), 

and today's class divide and wealth , skills and other divisions will be permanent,

I do not see a point of continuing competition, or consumption for the losers.

=========

I think that as resources get scarcer, and the rich-poor, the connected-unconnected , and the 'informed' and uninformed gap get exponentially greater,

eventually a firm divide will have to be created, to concentrate all wealth, resources and energy for the successful, in order to minimize waste and make sure we reach the next level of civilization.

The talented, the smart and the wealthy should be sheltered, and protected from the billions of 'unwashed masses'.

Otherwise, by weight of numbers, the latter will eventually overwhelm those capable of advancing civilization.

In ancient times, people under certain rank were forbidden to wear linen, forbidden to eat meat, etc. 

Such kind of measures, now easier to enforce because of tech, should be enforced so the rare metals which could be used to build the latest machines would not be wasted on cheapo phones and computers so people in the poorer parts of the world could play internet games and surf porn in their languages, and reduce the flood of data, most of which are useless 'retweets' of existing data.",22,0,False,self,,,,,

Therefore we cant be relied on to change our ways before it is too late so I must put my faith in technology. I have to hope that technological advancement will allow sustainable practices to become so economical that they replace the current ones. I dont see this as a likely outcome but it is all I can realistically hope for. I think the environmental discussion should be focused on promoting both public and private investment in green technology research, everything else is secondary. We jumped off the cliff a long time ago; priority number one should be to figure out how to make a parachute. Bedsides the environmental concerns virtually all other political issues could at least in theory be addressed with technology. In fact I think all political discussions should begin with can we imagine a tech that would make this problem go away, this is the way things are done in industry and this type of thinking has brought about our current golden age. Even if tech cant help with a problem it puts one in the mind set of searching for the ideal solution not just a compromise. Compromise always comes but the ideal should be considered first. For example a lot is said about creating jobs or as of late just paying people to be alive (UBI) but to me these solutions are focusing on the wrong side of the problem. We dont need to figure out how to make sure everyone can afford a good life, we need to use tech to make the good life dirt cheap. I bet that with some small portion of the US defense budget and a few years to work out the kinks; food, housing and transportation could be made so cheap that the welfare discussion could be killed once and for all.

Great.

We've been seeing a lot of articles on self driving cars, and along with them a lot of highly rated comments on how a practical self-driving car will inevitably lead to a ban on ""human drivers"" in the near future. To counterbalance all these comments, I'd like to bring up a few ideas.

#A little about myself.

I've been instructing motorcycle safety classes for 10 years. In doing so, I've taught and been exposed to a lot of different views on personal transportation, driving laws, and professionally created curriculum on what makes a safe rider. Most of the skills we teach are ones that easily transfer to driving a car.

I'm also a Firefighter/Paramedic, and I've seen the results and contributing factors  of many, many crashes. Many of the issues people have with ""human drivers"" are valid and need to be addressed. 

A lot of what I'm going to cover is motorcycle related, for a few reasons.

* It's my area of expertise

* The ""stakes are higher"" on a bike. The arguments against people driving are amplified on a motorcycle.

* Most all of the attributes of a safe motorcyclist are transferable to a safe car driver.

**I also recognize that self-driving cars will eventually outperform a human in every regard.** My argument that it's going to be a long time for this to happen, covering technical and social arguments to this conclusion.

#There are important areas where a human will outperform a self driving car.

This is true in a lot of areas: especially in the areas of reaction time, coordination with other vehicles, and lack of fatigue. Machine don't get drunk, drive angry, or have vision/motor skill issues. However, based on the comments I've read a lot of people are forgetting that there are important areas that humans will consistently beat a computer for the foreseeable future.

Firstly, our ability to analyse our environment, understand context, and make predictions based on those is an *incredibly powerful* tool that no computer will come close to matching in the foreseeable future. 
A human can look at the world around them, scanning for possible hazards and dealing with them before they become actual hazards. In every single sense, this is the best strategy. Slowing down, changing lanes, or taking a turn are all preferable to hoping you can stop or swerve in time. This forms the basis of a good defensive driver education course.

##A few examples:

* You're passing a truck carrying an poorly secured load at 70mph. It looks like something big is about to fall off in front of you at any time.

* You're driving by houses, and see children playing with a ball on the sidewalk. They aren't paying attention, and they ball is frequently ""getting away from them"".

* You see a couple people felling a large tree with a chainsaw. The tree is leaning towards the road, and they're still cutting at the base of it.

* You see a large crowd ahead that are torching cars, smashing windows, and beating people. The road is blocked in front of and behind you, but the sidewalk is clear and large enough to accommodate your car.

* [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ8V4N5IXl8)


Barring significant, groundbreaking advancements in AI, a human is better able to predict and anticipate problems. Our senses and minds excel at it, whereas a computer is incredibly limited in that ability. A computer can react very well, but it can't formulate a  ""plan"" like we do. The bulk of the classes I teach are dedicated to teaching how to spot potential hazards early and avoid them, *followed* by how to react to sudden, unexpected hazards. People grossly underestimate how important this is -- regardless of how good someone or something's reaction times are, you can't cheat physics. There are situations where there is no ""good choice"" for man or machine, and the ability to avoid those situations in the first place is vital.

I'll be the first to admit: in a controlled such as a controlled environment, a car will outperform a person. The more controlled the environment, the advantage swings sharply to the car. But a lot of driving isn't done in those conditions: driving through a town/city/rural road is entirely different from a controlled access, elevated highway.

# The technology isn't as mature as people think

I'm not going to talk too in-depth on this, because it's getting outside of my area of expertise. I know that it's tradition on Reddit that ""as long as it sounds good it's true"", but I can't bring myself to it.

I will say I can remember all the times the ""next big thing"" that will ""revolutionize how we do [x]"" took far longer to implement than what the people selling it told us, or that it wasn't as ""revolutionary"" as they claimed.

# The shortcomings of human drivers are so great that the only practical solution is to replace them.

I think some people are grossly underestimating their fellow drivers. As a motorcyclist of many years and hundreds of thousands of miles, I *constantly* hear about my imminent death/dismemberment. I've seen the results of motorcycle crashes, and I'm well aware of how fragile the human body is. I'm also well aware of how often it's another driver's ""fault"". Yet in all my experience of riding, in every imaginable road, traffic, and weather condition, I've ""crashed"" twice -- both times with no injury and very minor cosmetic damage to my bike. How is it that I've been ""lucky"", while other riders have died or lost limbs from crashes?

Training, technology, and accountability. The benefits of training are obvious, and it does make [a huge difference](http://www.sbes.vt.edu/gabler/publications/TRR-Daniello-2140-2009.pdf). 

Technology that addresses a human's shortcomings also exists. Traction control and ABS were early ones, followed by automatic braking, and systems that track a driver's [attentiveness and fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_drowsiness_detection).

Accountability can be addressed through education, testing, and penalties. Technology will make this much, much easier. We're already seeing this in it's infancy with insurance companies issuing devices that tracks how someone drives in return for discounts. 



# There's going to be a lot of push-back to an outright ban on driving.

People disagree -- which is fine. The society we live in has to accommodate that, and we have compromises in place that *mostly* work. 

A lot of people *like* driving, and others don't trust a machine do to it for them. A lot of people see or are worried about the shortcomings of an automated system. 

If what people agreed with on Reddit matched the real world, we'd be watching Ron Paul hand off his 8 year term to Bernie Sanders, who would make minor reforms to the already implemented federal universal health care and government subsidized post-secondary education. 

The reality is we're going to end up with a compromise, and continue to compromise until we get to something that kinda sorta works. Throw in powerful lobbying groups and human nature, and you won't see such a drastic piece of legislation as ""all cars must be self-driving"".

# Conclusion

I can't predict the future, but given my experience and background I can safely say the self driving car isn't going to totally replace human drivers in the near future. ",13,1,False,self,,,,,

My previous question here was about the future in a post-capitalist world. It became [a blog entry](https://altscifi.wordpress.com/2017/01/11/utopia-versus-dystopia-what-comes-after-the-disruption-when-machines-and-ai-devour-corporate-capitalism-and-consumerism/) with lots of sources to facts for further reading.

This topic is deeper. It's about a future where facts themselves come second to ideologies, and where ideologies include large-scale war as a viable option.

We have two widely accepted versions of reality on offer now, bolstered by social networks and mass media.

1. **Mainstream mass media**, which adheres to a journalistic standard while reporting some facts and under-reporting or ignoring others.

2. **Non-mainstream mass media** across the political spectrum. The non-mainstream media is based on pushing a polarized, identity-based set of talking points that require the audience to pick a ""team"". Once you support one ideology, the other becomes the ""enemy"". Ideas become personal possessions and are instantly accepted or rejected based on ideology.

---

The tribalistic ""non-mainstream"" media is, at core, based on the principle of _solipsism_ -- that if you can't physically verify a fact, it could be false and is therefore suspect. Ideology then defines what is and is not a fact. And ideologies are, at core, tools to inform (and manipulate) large numbers of people. Religions offer metaphysical ideologies. Economic theories become religion-like dogma (capitalism vs. Marxism, for example).

In a functioning society, citizens first accept that facts exist independently from ideology. If citizens prioritize ideology over acceptance of facts, facts become tools for ideological manipulation. This is true regardless of your particular ideological preferences.

---

We now have regressive tendencies on display across the planet, for example in France, Germany, the U.K. and the United States.

**Third War**

Nativism, protectionism, xenophobia, isolationism, racism, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia are all rising. Even Naziism -- an ideology blatantly based on calls for genocide -- is being normalized as ""free speech"". These are the same dynamics that gave rise to the second world war.

**Dictatorship**

In the United States, the president's administration -- based on constant, blatant lies -- is now gutting institutions like health care and environmental protection. Tapping into citizens' mistrust of globalisation, the American president champions a ""strongman"" approach that promises to crush dissent in the press and across society. These are the first steps toward dictatorship, and they are accelerating by the day.

**Assumptions and Guarantees**

The American president has literally voted Wall Street into the White House, under the proven false assumption that rich people will help common citizens become rich, too. Gullible working-class Americans immersed in an alternative media bubble have apparently forgotten what happened to them as recently as 2008 (i.e. the Great Recession). Revocation of trade deals with China and support of the fossil fuel industry virtually guarantee that the United States will fall far behind in four years.

---

Overall, it seems like the world is headed for pre-World War II conditions. Now, though, several nations have nuclear capabilities. The world's largest economies seem to have forgotten what made them great -- cooperation rather than antagonism. And billionaires seem to be trying to take what they can before global corporate capitalism based on oil and American Empire finally destroys itself.

**What's next?**

- Will people keep pretending that dismantlement of social services, glorification of militarism, and destruction of the environment will somehow yield social mobility and opportunity instead of terrorism, poverty, war and chaos?

- Will people wake up in sufficient numbers before it's too late?

And if they do wake up, what kind of government will take the place of the current corrupt and dysfunctional one? Clinton was an opportunistic politician who took money from Wall Street. Trump is an egomaniacal billionaire who embodies the concept of vulture capitalism.

It all begins from how we define and accept the meaning of a fact.

Apocalyptic visions aside -- if this isn't the end of democracy in the U.S. and across the world, how does global civilization repair itself?",20,8,False,self,,,,,

After I read her the verge article about Trumps gag order of the EPA, she noticed something interesting; how differently we perceived the situation. I saw this as an attempt to grip more control over our government; to silence our scientists so that the new legislative rhetoric can be easier communicated and messages can be sent from the white house without contradiction from our countrys scientists. I saw this is an attempt to limit the conversation about climate change. I told her, I know this may not be the most important issue for our family right now, but its an important issue nevetheless, that to me signifies a threat as big as eventual endangerment to the existence of the human race. Her next words were so simple, yet so powerful. You should think about the present and not spend so much time thinking about the future, she said.

A thought came to me. I wondered, statistically, How many people in the US think about the present vs. those who tend to think about the future? So I Googled it, and I found The Marshmallow Experiment, a study done by Philip Zimbardo. I am quoting from a blog https://sivers.org/time that explains the experiment from Zimbardos book:



The Marshmallow Experiment

40 years ago, at a nursery school at Stanford University, psychology professor Walter Mischel ran an experiment.

A bunch 4-year-olds were brought into a room, one at a time. They were given one marshmallow, and told they were allowed to eat it immediately, but if they could wait 15 minutes without eating it, theyd be given a second marshmallow, and could eat both.

70% of the kids ate the marshmallow right away. Only 30% of the kids could wait the full 15 minutes to get the second marshmallow. This experiment has been repeated in other countries (Brazil and Japan) over the years, and the ratio stays the same. Two-thirds cant wait. One-third wait.



I asked my wife which one of the group of kids shed be and she said the one who ate the marshmallow right away. I then quickly realized, Im part of the other 30% minority.

It raises other questions, though, doesnt it? I started to think about how our citizens perceive the world; our politics, our problem-solving mechanisms, our money management behaviors, our social behaviors, and so on.

Ill start with politics first. Is it possible that a large part of those who are left leaning politically are simply individuals who tend to look more at decision making based on how it impacts the future? Im not saying whether this is right or wrong. I think that will always be subjective. Im just asking you to think about it.

For example, if you care about the sustainability of the Earth, we can assume you side with pro-climate change policy and agree that global warming is a serious concern. Thats a fairly long term vision and carries with it, quite a bit of pain and requires a stomach for long term gratification. Are you willing to spend tax-dollars today to contribute to a sustainable earth thousands of years from now? Do you even care? Im not here to answer that question but it makes you wonder.

Im fascinated about this topic and Id like to explore it further.",7,10,False,self,,,,,

Articles like these have gotten me really worried these last few days:

http://io9.gizmodo.com/5967660/9-ways-humanity-could-bring-about-our-own-destruction

http://io9.gizmodo.com/could-a-single-individual-really-destroy-the-world-1471212186

I was just wondering if the SIMAD's article about one person being able to destroy civilization was overhyped or if its something to be genuinely worried about.

Also the ""9 ways"" article presents some pretty scary ideas such as robots killing off all humans and deliberate pandemics. Also the part about nano tech is worrisome, as it basically says theres no way to stop it.

These articles have gotten me really worried, so any feedback is much appreciated!

Thank you!

Recently I've been thinking about the advancements in AI, automation and sustainable consumption/development. In the future, will there be any need for money and consumerism as we know it now? When automation and AI replace the need for humans in jobs, and renewable energy means we can run it all at almost no cost, what is going to happen? Will there be any need to market the endless supply of product that we see now? 

I know it's a long way off and I'm sure lots of other people have thought about this. Could someone point me towards some reading around this kind of idea or let me know why my reasoning might be too simplistic. Thanks ",12,5,False,self,,,,,

Tl, dr:
For the smart in America (and some other countries) who can learn coding and other stuff needed for the Abundance, they will own everything and have all the opportunity.

But,
&gt;But for those who make up the fat middle of the Bell Curve, not so much. I believe the sun has set on the American Dream for those people. 

The already successful , with very cheap borrowing rates, will drive out the less so from all the businesses, properties, etc.

Businesses which have high start-up costs, such as restaurants and auto repair shops, basically anything with brick-and-mortar, 
have no chance against the already established. The high insurance, rent, legal, advertising, etc costs will kill them.

Tech is basically invulnerable since they are largely free from the above overheads. But, this guy already had said before that bigger is better, and what happens is those who start their tech business from garages usually sell them for maybe 50-500 mil to the biggies, and buy some real estate to enjoy their once-a-lifetime luck.

So, basically speaking, unless you can make a large sum of money from a very small space, or you already own lots of real estate and have enough clout to 'negotiate' better terms with the cities, utilities, etc, like the billionaires who build their stadiums with taxpayer money,

one is basically screwed. No opportunities. Nowhere to make a humanlike living, and they will eventually end up like the denizens of Kolkata slums unless they were smart enough to buy viable stocks or real estate already.

-------

Similar stories will play in China and other centers of civilizations.

It is like an extinction event - it will lift up the most advanced part of humans to a higher level of civilization, and leave absolutely zero (i.e. extinction) for the rest. It is winner-take-all, with the winners joining the gods and becoming space-conquering beings which cannot be called as humans anymore.

the only catch, which this guy does not recognize but I do, is what would happen if resources run out before reaching all these goals. For that, the Georgia Guidestones give us some kind of answer. Following the guidestones' advice will buy at least a century's time.

New Features (Post Flair Categories &amp; Verified User Flairs), New Mods, Rules Clarification, and Thanks for Your Support!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5qs74x/welcome_to_2017_new_features_post_flair/,mvea,1485666601,"Hi /r/Futurology subscribers and visitors!

****Welcome to 2017!****

When I was a kid, 2017 sounded very much in the future - in fact, there was a TV series called 1999 that had spaceships and colonies on the moon - look at where we are now! Not even close to colonies on the moon yet, but we have pocket AI supercomputers (by those standards)!

In any case, the mods of /r/Futurology wanted to launch 2017 with some new features to make our community even better. I have the privilege to speak on behalf of the hard working moderator team, so here we go, straight into the new features!

---

**1. New features:**

***a. Post flair and categories***

As you can see, we have just launched Post Flairs, based on 12 Categories, which are:

* 3D printing (additive manufacturing)
* AI (deep learning, machine learning)
* Agriculture (food, farming)
* Biotechnology (medicine, longevity)
* Computing (AR, VR, wearables)
* Energy (environment, climate change, renewables, solar, nuclear)
* Economics (cryptocurrency, UBI)
* Nanotechnology (graphene, metamaterials)
* Robotics (automation)
* Society (politics, general discussion)
* Space (NASA, Emdrive)
* Transport (self-driving vehicles)

When you submit a link or text post, the automoderator will automatically assign you a flair based on keywords in your title. If you don't see your assigned flair, refresh the post, as there may be a second or two delay to this. It may not be possible for the automoderator to assign a flair to all posts since some keywords may be missing - if not, a red reminder will highlight the flair button even after you refresh, and as the OP you can manually assign a flair to your post. Otherwise, a mod will hopefully get to it.

In the sidebar, there are now links to the 12 different categories, that will allow users to easily find the right post that has been flaired. Since this is new, the list of posts to the category is short but we hope over time as we categorise our posts properly this will be resolved.

***b. Verified user flairs***

Similar to the verified flair program in /r/science, /r/Futurology has also launched a verified flair program. However, the program here is broader, as it's not just qualification based, but also expertise and experience based. So whether you have a PhD, or an AI expert, or CEO of a Biotech company, or just someone who works in the 3D Printing industry, we can recognise this with a verified flair.

So to be explicitly clear, you don't have to have formal qualifications to get a verified flair - experience or expertise is fine, as long as you can provide proof. In the meantime, members can still have custom unverified flair - that's fine too. Verified flair will have the bold white on green text with the tick symbol.

Refer to the wiki for more information on how to obtain this here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/wiki/userflair

---

**2. New mods** 

With growth comes increased posters, and with it comes an increased in comments, leading to a need to have more mods to enforce our long-standing 13 rules. The original mod team has started to appoint new mods, and we are already vetting to the second round of moderator applications. The interest has been overwhelming, which is evidence of members of the sub wanting to be part of improving it, and that's really awesome to see.

If you are interested, the application post for this current round is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5ffhsm/rfuturology_is_looking_for_full_moderators/

---

**3. Rules clarification** 

It is a good opportunity to clarify some of our rules, which we will be enforcing a bit more with the additional mods:

*Rule 2 - Future Focus* 

Submissions will need to have a clear future focus - in particular, we will be strict with this rule when it comes to posts relating to politics. The number of politics-related posts have increased since the events of the US elections. Note that our sub is international, and there are many people, such as myself, who are not Americans, and who may not be that interested in what is happening there. Yes, America is a significant world player, but unless the issue is clearly future-focused and relates to something new, it may be removed by the mod team. Such posts may better belong in /r/politics, /r/environment or /r/technology.

Also, posts about universal basic income (UBI) needs to refer to the future, whether it is automation of work or robots. Otherwise, they will also be removed for breach of Rule 2.

*Rule 9 - Duplicates* 

We have started to be stricter with removing submissions that relate to a topic that has been posted within the past 2-3 days. In general, most posts about the same topic rehash the same issues, and may discuss other topics that are old and already discussed. An exception to this would be if the new post has some new information, or if it's in a different format - e.g. if the original post is a newspaper article, and the later post is an interview, a video, or an infographic.

*Rule 12 - Original sources* 

This is a difficult area, but in general, we prefer that people submit links to original sources, to reward the content creator, rather than websites that predominantly rehost content and copy things, especially without citing, primarily to earn money by serving ads and using Reddit to get traffic - these sites are usually obvious blogspam hosts, and mods will remove such posts, but there are many other sites that are not as blatant or obvious, or who genuinely are trying to collate interesting information for the public. We do have a colour-coded traffic light source quality program, which we will continually update. Please let us know if you have any suggestions about this program. Refer here for more information: https://www.reddit.com/r/futurology/wiki/sourcequality

*Comment Quality* 

We have started to be stricter with removing comments in posts that are too short, of low quality, relate to popular media without any expansion or discussion, short jokes or quips, or anything that may not add to the discussion. In this sub, we have a reasonably high tolerance for profanities, but we will enforce Reddit-wide rules on personal attacks, threats and ex hominem attacks. The automoderator removes a lot of comments for us initially, and if this happens by accident, which can occur, please let the mods know, and we can approve your comment. The automoderator also automatically reports posts that it suspects are problematic, and mods will review these and either remove or approve them. 

As a community, I encourage all of you to report posts or comments that you suspect breach our 13 rules - we have updated the reporting list of options, so the relevant 13 rules are including in the list that you can choose when you report (on the desktop browser).

---

**4. Thank you all!**

Lastly, I want to thank all our subscribers, visitors, lurkers and contributors. All of you make up this community. This week we hit 10 million subscribers - an arbitrary milestone in the end that does not really mean much, but it gives us an idea of the number of people who may potentially visit the sub. The sub itself is only 5 years old, and from a core group of dedicated and committed members, it has grown to its current size, especially since it became a default sub only about 2 years ago. I want to welcome new subscribers, and also acknowledge the old-timers, those who have been with the sub through thick and thin - all of you deserve recognition. There are the regular contributors who post great content on a daily basis so that the rest of us can remain updated.

If you have any suggestions, comments or recommendations, please let us know - we are here to work with you in partnership together.

*In the end, this sub is what the community makes it to be, and we depend on all of you.*

&gt;You go on Quora and you see hundreds of questions about how to be richer, how to be smarter, about being smart, having a high IQ, etc.not questions about how to be better at social justice and stuff like that

and,

&gt; there is evidence that the generation that follows millennials  Generation Z ( (the demographic cohort between the ages of 14 and 23)  may be more socially conservative than millennials and possibly smarter too. 

It has already happened in China.

The Jiulinghou, or Post-90s (born after 1990), mostly accept their lot in the society. They know the scions of party biggies and moguls will be wealthy and will play them as pawns, but rather than getting angry on that, they try to make money and emulate them.

They also do not care too much about communism and other collectivism, and they can't get enough of American pop culture.

The future generation will not rebel, will not disagree with their lot in life, and will accept the status quo and the better of them will try to make more money to increase their lot, and will not try tantrums. I think the losers will quietly fade away in their rooms like Japan's stuck-in-basement crowd, who are not significant in terms of civilization.",8,0,False,self,,,,,

Microsoft, Tesla, Amazon, Facebook, and other are gobbling up renewable energy have are well on their way to being 100% renewable energy.

I just finished watching a video with Sergey Brin a co-founder of google, and he mentioned that he thought college should be free.

So I started to wonder, now that all these companies are more valuable than fossil fuel companies and banks, will they be able to buy Washington to pass laws that coincide with their stated views?

Or will they just become consumed by greed and demand tax breaks?

Or maybe the will just hoard money for their own philanthropy?

Should they even try to lobby congress, are they better solving the problems by themselves?",1,11,False,self,,,,,
