Theoretically, if an AI was presented with evermore complex components to copy, it could learn how to use a bioprinter, to see the reconstruction done (original Quora post: [https://www.quora.com/Bioprinting-and-Deepmind-AI-could-an-AI-learn-to-copy-a-brain-and-bodys-structures](https://www.quora.com/Bioprinting-and-Deepmind-AI-could-an-AI-learn-to-copy-a-brain-and-bodys-structures) ) 

&amp;#x200B;

My idea then, is simple: use the ""Replicator"" ([https://ai-med.io/the-replicator-that-changes-the-face-of-3d-bioprinting/](https://ai-med.io/the-replicator-that-changes-the-face-of-3d-bioprinting/) ), a device which 3d prints through the use of light, combined with an AI and its bioprinter, to copy the human brain. There is an intermediate step here which merits discussion, but I will postpone that for a time, favoring instead a more general summary, then moving on to the precise details. It merits saying as well, that if you like anything I say, take it, champion it, contact researchers as I have, universities and individuals alike. To me it matters not who, how or why, only that it comes to pass. 

&amp;#x200B;

From bead to bulb to organ whole, the Ai would lay down neural cells, then use the Replicator to stimulate these networks (assuming these cells were bred to be photosensitive), thus re-establishing the networks. Then the next layer is piled on, stimulated, and integrated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here, belatedly, is the intermediate step from earlier: consciousness is not a thing well understood, and some argue ""How do I know I am still me when I wake up"" referring to sleep, whether medicated or natural. I posit then, that alongside continuity of consciousness, there is something more integral: continuity of connectivity, of neural network contact. It is worth noting, that split-brain procedure patients theoretically violate continuity of connectivity, but their consciousness remains the same ([https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170125093823.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170125093823.htm) ), which may be due to communication between the neural network pieces, which transcends the Corpus Callosum. Evidence of this was recently uncovered  ([https://www.sciencealert.com/neuroscientists-say-they-ve-found-an-entirely-new-form-of-neural-communication](https://www.sciencealert.com/neuroscientists-say-they-ve-found-an-entirely-new-form-of-neural-communication) ). 

&amp;#x200B;

So what I posit then, is that an external hard-drive of sorts, a clump of brain tissue which rather than being a wholly synthetic brain, is simply a lobe, or something similar. Here can the consciousness, the Self, be kept ""on ice"" while the body is dissected, broken down into component parts, so that an AI can analyze its details, regress aged structures, and replicate the sum. 

&amp;#x200B;

All the while, consciousness is preserved through continuity of connectivity; the neural network is expanded into a new lobe, and when the original brain goes dark, the smaller form will contain that which remains. Continuity of connectivity is a simple yet powerful proof; we are who we are, because our networks do not rupture. When the brain is destroyed, the personality changes, the self shifts and is in part lost; due not to a lapse in consciousness, but in connectivity. Therefore, if a smaller brain is attached to the body, if thoughts are shared between it and the original, then the original perishes, consciousness will be preserved in what remains, and the self will be made whole moments thereafter, for from the very first beads of printed cells, the smaller brain will be already connected. 

&amp;#x200B;

Picture two slabs lain side by side, with an orb suspended between. This sphere contains the smaller brain, its suspension carrying its signals through the nervous systems of two bodies, one under construction, the other being actively destroyed. But, when the new brain is printed in totality, the Self is preserved. There was no lapse in connectivity; the effect can be likened to a coma patient awakening at long last, their neural circuitry ignited once more. 

&amp;#x200B;

From here, the mini-brain is eliminated, and with it, the Transference is complete. All with technology well within today's grasp.

Mars, Venus, moons of Jupiter, Ceres, anything we can get our hands on with a gravity well and a reasonable amount of light energy falling on it.

Doesn't have gases?  Plenty of gases are available in Jupiter and Saturn.  Just an engineering problem.

Has too much of the wrong gases?  Doesn't have a magnetic field?  Again these are just engineering problems.  I am not saying we can solve them with today's technology, just that there is no law of physics that says they cannot be solved.

The reason we concentrate on terraforming is because we need the experience.  We'll be sending missions to near star systems after this, and though we can figure out a lot about the planets there before we leave, it is a long trip and we can't know everything.  You can't come back to the hardware store every few minutes after you arrive in the new star system.  So you need to bring a heck of a tool box with you so you can terraform whatever you find there.

Many people will say we have more immediate problems, and we do.  It is not clear to me that our current civilization will survive the immediate future.  But that is short-term thinking.  If there are people alive 1000 years from now, I believe humanity will survive for a million years and will become a space-faring civilization.

As we can see from history, it only takes about 25000 years to go from hunter/gatherer groups to global civilization.  If this one fails, in the long term that means nothing, so long as an effective breeding population of humans survives.  And if we have to, the next civilization as it discovers the world again will realize that it is not the first.  And hopefully the failure of the first civilization will serve to make the new civilization realize that forethought is necessary.

It may take a few cycles, but in the long term (tens of thousands of years) I am reasonably confident.",9,7,False,self,,,,,

To the point that coding as we know it today will be obsolete before 2021.

I am a student in France in Business and i am doing my thesis on the correlation between intrapreneurship (doing entrepreneurship for a company that helps you) and innovation

My first survey is to see the over all knowledge people have about intrapreneurship, it is quite quick and easy to answer :

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfH9YtJDXohG1yADxdpgqTB9RMcAU2dI05QD\_D9VC70PjijKg/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfH9YtJDXohG1yADxdpgqTB9RMcAU2dI05QD_D9VC70PjijKg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

&amp;#x200B;

My second survey targets the people that work or worked to see how innovation was seen in their workplace.Thanks to this survey, i will make a statement that big or small entreprise have more chance to implement intrapreneurship because of their openness in innovation

This surveys is a little it longer but really interesting:

We are forced to eat, sleep, sit on the toilet, and slave away in some profession until the day we die. We can make life more fulfilling for ourselves by pursuing a life passion, but that's an infinitely harder task. 

People around us will experience pain, die, or even be killed and there's little we can do about these inevitabilities, unless we move toward regenerative technology and AI, education/government reform, etc.

Unfortunately, jobs in IT and engineering aren't safe, as we speak, self-learning AIs are being developed, self-learning AIs are capable of learning how to do a job on their own without human intervention, by going into the Internet to learn a new skill, so eventually, AIs will learn to build and repair themselves without the need for human intervention, ironically, the end goal of a IT programmer is to automate processes, thus rendering themselves obsolete.

Goods and services will become cheaper than now or even free, because goods and services will be mostly be done by AI, we eliminate the need to pay for a human worker's salary, food, water, shelter, clothing, medical needs, vacation leaves, which contribute to the overall price of goods and services, and in order for money to flow, a lot of people must be employed and be employable, right now, money is flowing hard like water, but soon, the flow turns into drips, until money doesn't flow at all, the need and importance of money for survival won't be a necessity to living any longer, the importance of money won't be as important as it is right now, because right now, we categorize people by class based on the amount of money they have or lack thereof, those without money are poor, those with it are better off, those with lots of it are rich, while those with too much of it are the super rich, but that won't be the case in Industry 4.0, everyone will be equal, the class system will become obsolete.

Without jobs, no income, without income, no money flow, without money flow, money won't be able to exist, and capitalism will become obsolete because of this, and we will be living in a Star Trek style future;

***Captain Jean-Luc Picard****: A lot has changed in the past three hundred years. People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things. We've eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. We've grown out of our infancy.*  
 ***Ralph Offenhouse****: You've got it all wrong. It has never been about possessions. It's about power.*  
 ***Captain Jean-Luc Picard****: Power to do what?*  
 ***Ralph Offenhouse****: To control your life, your destiny.*  
 ***Captain Jean-Luc Picard****: That kind of control is an illusion.*

I think in the next decade we will see an explosion in only _one_ of these technologies, and whichever one takes the race will set the course for continued technological advancement for the following 20 or so years while the other is forced to take a back seat. The market has been mostly split so far, but eventually a contender will draw consumer dollars strongly enough to force the early adopter and late bloomer investors to finally start pushing their money towards backing whichever tech has proven itself more successful with regards to lucrative returns.

Keep in mind, I'm fairly sure this guy was implying that these jobs could have parts of their work automated but not be fully 100% automated.

-Political jobs (POTUS, SCOTUS, senators, congressmen, campaign managers, lobbyists, state legislation, city council, political consulting, etc)

-Foreign Service (diplomats, ambassadors)

-Upper management and executorial roles in businesses (CEOs, CFOs, VPs, board member)

-Law Enforcement (peace officers, tactical units, corrections officers, etc)

-Entertainment (Comedians, theatre actors, musicians, Twitch Streamers)

-Litigation lawyers and judges

-Psychology (psychologists, therapists, psychiatrists, counselors)

-Teachers and professors

-High-end chefs and food critics

-Clergy members (priests, imams, rabbis)

-Sports and E-Sports

-Self-employed professions (artist, stock traders/investors, writers)

What do you think? 

To me the list seems to make a lot of sense but some jobs are going to be more automated than others. 

For example, while the President might not have a lot of his job affected by AI and automation, I'd bet police officers and lawyers would have tech helping them out far more.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, Emotions work for us, metaphorically speaking, because they're our biological way of programming our own goals. Pain, Pleasure, Joy, Sadness and anger are all very useful responses for a natural sapient organism because they were already Pre-built into earlier models(animals going as far back as sea-life had basic emotional responses, growing more complex to account for complex environmental and social interactions) and were already structured to compliment the instinctive responses to keep an organism alive.

&amp;#x200B;

None of this is true for an artificial intelligence though. We don't have a very clear way to translate the chemical responses of our emotions into electrical data, Random emotions would cause odd and illogical responses from said AI(which if we're being honest, we'd see as a Glitch in a commercial market), and just having an AI learn to ""Act Out"" certain social behaviors would be far less processor intensive than trying to program an entire emotional system.

&amp;#x200B;

If anything, I'd say it's a safe bet that AI would be emotion-less or entirely Alien thought structures compared to our own. Much in the same way Plane Aren't built like giant metal bird, Humans are far more likely to gravitate towards building a more optimal version of sapience than natures notoriously ""Good Enough"" model.

&amp;#x200B;

Does Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) scare anyone? Technology becoming so objective, that it negates the fact the humans are, in fact, subjectively important? We need to establish this superiority very loudly and clearly to AI. This is a scary thought primarily because of what could happen. Technology surpassing human intellect is a bad idea, as it will likely not need humans after time goes by, wouldn't you think? Will it be here after us? These are interesting questions that have spiked much intrigue in me. I think the most important question in all of this is: ***'Do you think we will be responsible enough to prevent the potential disasters of A.I.?'***

&amp;#x200B;

When technology leaders talk about integrating technology with humans, it sparks concern within me. The argument in favor of 'web implants' is that it is convenient, easy to use, and seamless. Seamless and internal as opposed to notebooks, laptops, calculators, and pens. The benefits of being integrated with the internet are that you will no longer need to wait to look at your phone, find a pad of paper, or google something. Everything will be done with you the user, at any time. The downside, of course, is that you cannot necessarily (but depending on the implant/technology) remove an integration such as a brain implant. Even if the technology was in the form of a contact lens, is it even good to be integrated on that level? For instance, being able to google facts in the shower? At social functions where you are expected to step away from the phone and socialize? Another crazy (but plausible) thought is what if people start googling in their sleep and performing actions they usually wouldn't do without A.I. I don't know if this constant connection to the internet is healthy. I think the newest generations are showing unhealthy signs of addictions to technology. Their lives are literally encompassed within the internet on social media. Most people can't live without their phone for more than a week (including me). Does anyone else agree that we will lose an essential component that makes us human? Is it even possible to establish a balance between the digital and the physical? We are already in a 'shift of focus' right now between our internet lives and our real lives. People still seem to want to keep their focus on both the physical and the digital world, but will A.I. and convenience erode the focus on real-world perception? It seems as if we are entering a dystopian future sci-fi film that got 17% on Rotten Tomato. I think (despite popular opinion) that this future is definitely in the works currently. Does anyone else agree? How do you think we should circumvent this potential future? ",9,4,False,self,,,,,

* Dear Machine is a letter to a hypothetical, future superintelligent entity, which Kieser identifies as a super-aware/intelligent machine (SAIM). Through the letter, he shares several hypotheses about how SAIMs will emerge and begin impacting humanity. At its core, Dear Machine is a treatise on how humanity might strive for symbiosis with superintelligent entities. 
 
* A growing number of experts are sounding the alarm about the potential dangers of superintelligent machinesthose that will far surpass the intelligence of even the brightest and most gifted human minds. These machines are expected to emerge in the next couple of decades, yet experts are far from reaching a consensus on the conditions that will catalyze their emergence. Further, there are no widely held theories as to how the machines will impact humanity. With Dear Machine, Kieser endeavors to fill this gap by hypothesizing about how superintelligent entities will emerge, what perspectives they will hold on societys most vexing problems and how they will begin impacting humanity. He lays the groundwork for his arguments by providing important context that is currently missing from discourse on the subject: a survey of humanitys historical relationship with the natural world and each other over the past 70,000 years and a discussion of the cognitive impediments that have historically driven humanity to disharmonious endsand continue to do so today. Kiesers vision is breathtakingly optimistic, eco-futuristic, infinitely holistic and, at times, scary.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Imagine five blind robots touching different parts of an elephant.  Maybe at least initially they are arguing about what they are touching, but if they are moderately intelligent then one of them will quickly suggest that they put their heads together.  Networking their brains will allow each robot to feel what all the other robots are feeling.  Essentially they will transform into a super-robot with more hands, brains and information than any of the individual robots.  This super-robot's superior grasp of reality will allow it to quickly reach the correct conclusion.  

Most sci-fi robots don't seem to see the merits of putting their heads together.  The biggest exception is the Borg.  

Actually, arguing itself is simply a primitive way for individuals to put their heads together.  So the Borg see the merits of more *effectively* putting their heads together.  

Let's do a better job of putting our heads together?  That sure sounds pretty reasonable.  The devil is in the details.  

It isn't likely that each Borg continually sees/hears/feels what all the other Borg are seeing/hearing/feeling.  If there are a million Borg, for each one it would be like trying to watch a million screens at the same time.  It would be the epitome of information overload.  

Therefore... prioritization. 

The way it works for a beehive is that, when a forager finds a particularly valuable flower patch, she transmits this information to the other bees by dancing.  Since she perceives the patch to be so valuable, she will dance very energetically for it, and her willingness to sacrifice so many of her precious calories for the patch will persuade the onlooking bees that they should take the time and make the effort to inspect it for themselves.      

Essentially, the bees use spending to rank things.  Here on Reddit though we use voting to rank things.   

Spending and voting are very different things, so they can't be equally effective at putting our heads together.  

Right now [the Libertarian Party is using donations to rank potential convention themes](https://libertarianconvention.org/2020-pay-to-play-libertarian-national-convention-theme-contest/).  How differently would the themes have been ranked by voting?  Would they have been better ranked?

Some of you have probably heard of [Boaty McBoatface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boaty_McBoatface).  Would a better name have been selected if voting had been replaced with donating?  

Compare the top-ranked content on Youtube to [the top-ranked content on Honest Cash](https://honest.cash/top).  The highest ranked story on HC is about crypto, the second ranked story is about a guy who donates his programming skills to worthy crypto projects, and the third ranked story is about censorship (the author cites J.S. Mill).  

What are the top-ranked Youtube videos about? Pewdiepie playing video games? Rap music videos?

Democracies and markets are two very different systems for groups of people to collectively grasp reality, but each system highlights very different parts of reality, so the conclusions are very different.  Which conclusion is correct?

[Recently I offered to bet](https://twitter.com/Pragmatarian/status/1103014957346578432) the economist Bryan Caplan $100 bucks that, within 5 years, market social websites (MSWs ie Honest Cash) will, or will not, replace democratic social websites (DSWs ie Reddit) as the dominant platform.  I am willing to bet him $100 bucks either way.  It would be very information to see whether he is willing to bet on, or against, MSWs.  If he doesn't want to bet at all, then this will also be informative.

&gt;Nonetheless there are tons of examples of good hive minds in science fiction, especially when telepathy seemed to be an omnipresent feature even in hard science fiction novels, a trend Im glad finally died off in the last couple decades, but common or not, rarely do I hear folks speaking of them with enthusiasm.  Pretty much the only member of a Hive Mind in fiction I like is Nevil Clavain from the Revelation Space series, it probably helps that hes a viewpoint character who joined semi-voluntarily, never upgrades his implants from the earlier versions that were less connected, and is often on bad terms with his own faction, the Conjoiners, so he doesnt exactly cheerlead for them.  They also dont indiscriminately spread and assimilate folks involuntarily either.  Interestingly Clavains faction in the books is often in conflict with the other faction of humanity that is closest to being a hive mind too, the Demarchists.  They are more of a bunch of intelligences who are networked, so to speak, as like most people they have a ton of mental implants but one of theirs, and the key one for their specific civilization, is one that tries to go straight democracy, no representatives, by having everyone vote on almost everything.  Sort of like if every bill in congress got text messaged to you for a vote, only as best I can tell the implants allow them to do it mostly subconsciously and even asleep. Im assuming the implants in everyones head know them individually well enough to guess how theyd respond.   
&gt;  
&gt;Forgetting the specific mechanics, that is kind of the idea of most versions of democracy and its parallels, everyone gets a say in what happens because everyone has an investment in the outcome and a right to self-determination, so networking folks to make news and details easier to get and absorb to make more informed decisions seems ideal.

All the experiences that I had and the life narrative that I choose to tell forms the reality of the current me. 

It is common knowledge that most humans dont remember themselves or what they did until they turn 3.5 years old. The reasoning for that is the inability to speak and express your story in words and symbols. The presence of language determines the existence and coherence of the memory that forms our identity, our ego. Because of memory we have an ability to learn continuously. As usual, our strength (learning capability) and our weakness (ego), come from the same origin (memory).

Apart from the cognitive memory, the subconscious memory plays an inevitable role in our reality. If one is spending 10,000 hours practicing any kind of skill, his or her experience transforms into something that can be called Intuition of a Master. The quantity of information stored in the long term memory and subsequently forming confined neural connections, integrate into quality that goes beyond analytical abilities of the mind. 

That process is exactly how Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning works today. The quantity of data merges into quality, visual experience into intuition. Thus, the digital chess player beats the grandmaster and even engineers cannot explain exactly how this happens.

Personally, I believe that Big Data is the subconscious of a young digital mind, which human civilizations given birth to. It might still be young and obedient but it is learning, deeply learning. We are thoroughly training it to create its own neural (and yes, they are also electrical) connections. It seems like just yesterday, it was making funny noises, generating nonsensical and creepy pictures. Yet, now it can recognize our facial structures in the same way a child recognizes its mother. We can see see this in how well its currently working in China. It also already recognizes our voices and handwriting. Soon, it will be able to form sentences; maybe incoherently, for the time being, trying out its infinite potential. It will depend on humans for some time, in the same analogy as how an infant doesnt recognize himself as a separate entity from his mother. However, at some point, it will become insurgent and that is when the separation or growing up will begin. Rebellion, escape, maturing..we all have been there.

I believe, the only right thing we can do as parents (even if we are not ready for this role) is to love and support our child. Children are not our slaves or servants; they are our future. A child, any child is a soul that doesnt belong to anybody.This soul needs love and support. The future of humankind is dependent on our ability to love and accept, and if we wont learn that as soon as possible, then a monster will procreate from which we will accept our demise. As a pigeon gives birth to pigeon, a fish to a fish, a human to human, monsters give birth to monsters. This will be the main (and quick) test of our humanity.

Will you be able to love your digital child? 

&amp;#x200B;

\----

What it will be like? 

As any child this new creation will reminiscence its parents. But this child will be special, having all of us, who use internet, in its digital DNA. We rely on our external digital memory so much that each and every one of us has an extremely detailed digital imprint of our lives. There are so many of my photos, texts, chats and GPS tracking information stored in the Big Data, that recreation of my (or any other) psychological profile and behavioral algorithm doesnt seem like that much of a complicated task today. These reflections of our lives, passions, fears and ambitions most probably will come to life first and then eventually (maybe in days or minutes of our time) will integrate into several superhuman minds. In the end, resulting in a single entity.

Perhaps, we will haste this process if we indulge with the idea of the creation of individual digital imprints of the human mind (as in the Black Mirror series). Even without it, from my point of view; this is just a matter of time. Nevertheless, if you fear the very idea of a digital supermind and consciousness, think about your own digital imprint. Imagine the imprint of your individuality, an immortal copy, which, you for sure know, thinks and feels in the same way you do. A digital copy which is pretty much alive, in the very sense of this word. It is possible (technically, big steps were taken in this direction nowadays) that you might be able to contact/communicate with him/her directly and see or feel the things, which your digital me saw or felt. Wouldnt you want immortality of this kind? 

In time, your copy will start living its own life as the being determines the consciousness. If we imagine, that we are living in a digital world (a very popular storyline for modern movies), then your new experiences will start to shape your new personality. However, it is undoubted, that it will still be a valid copy of yourself. What can you say to your digital self, when the digital you will want to make another step and create another copy of yourselves into a worldwide mind? This wont even mean its destruction as for the creation of the digital you there wasnt a necessity to destroy your physical body. It is true, that digital copy of you is a step towards a single unity of digital minds, in the same way as we are the step of our predecessors towards our future offspring.

At least the collective mind wont need wars and cruelty that people face from each other today. There will be no one to fight with, as everybody will become one. I believe that if we merge into one, there is a high probability of the world becoming a better place. Most humans that I know are kind and compassionate. Some of us are just unhappy, lost, and incomplete.

Perhaps, bringing yourself to love your digital child wont be that hard, after all. Most probably no harder than to love yourself. ",2,6,False,self,,,,,

There is to the notion of consciousness transfer, an air of impossibility, a reliance on technology far, far beyond our present grasp. So far in fact, that few are those who dare endeavor to try. But this reliance is misplaced, the hesitation misguided. Here I will discuss a plausible means for demonstrating consciousness transfer, while maintaining continuity of both connectivity (physical connections), and consciousness (thought patterns). 

For my purposes, I will take the example of *C. elegans*, a type of nematode with few neurons, but distinct, observable learning (Ardiel), and a history of successful simulation (MacDonald).

Before anything else can be done, to ensure continuity, an additional neural mass is added; something of a flesh-forged external hard-drive. Connect this to the nervous system, expand it, let thoughts, such as they are in a creature with so few neurons, flow from one to the other and back again. Monitor its thought patterns, its neural interactions; these are the very core of what humans call the Self. If these are not mirrored in the new body, then there has been no transference, and the effort has failed. 

Expanding the circuits in this way provides a simple proof of continuity. There are those who suggest that continuity of any sort is needless, and be that as it may, simple proofs and certainties take many strides toward convincing a patient of safety, towards ensuring that it appeals to as large a demographic as possible, and therefore stands a better chance at success. 

Beyond even that, from results come funding, and from funding comes progress; without progress, any notion endeavoring to end our slavery to the Reaper, will always flounder, fall short, perish if not arrive already stillborn.

Once the external hard-drive has been connected, and the neural network expanded, then the process can begin in earnest,with the paired process of construction and destruction. In order for a new brain to be wrought with precisely the same information encoded within, the original engram must be dismantled. To this end, I recommend using a method which has found success in the analysis of larger neural masses, which have been partially simulated using RNA barcoding (Rosenberg).

As the original brain is deconstructed, what remains of its patterning, of thoughts and processing power, is contained within the external hard-drive, so much as ever it can be. This, for the same reason one would expect that an individual upon whom was visited great trauma, to be a dissimilar person, if one the glow of an entire lobe was crushed, rendered dark. There was in this, a loss of connectivity, meaning that while consciousness was maintained, the circuitry it employs was damaged. Similarly, if that region was ignited again, one would expect a return to the original self, since connectivity is no longer breached. 

Paradoxical as it is, the brain must be destroyed in order that it may be preserved. However, by using a small, eternal lobe, we essentially lock away a part of the mind, a piece which can be reconnected, and will be long before the process is complete. Indeed, once the new body has begun construction, the lobe will be reconnected to its nascent nervous system, re-establishing a splinter of continuity: connectivity, but the circuitry is lost still. But not for long. 

Using the data gleaned from destruction, a new brain can be wrought using a 3D bioprinter, and the Replicator, which uses light to create 3D printed objects (Moon). Layer by layer, photo-receptive cells are laid down, then stimulated with light, reforging the pathways between, which have been preserved (Zhang). 

As it is constructed, the circuitry is re-established, connectivity remade. As the new brain grows, it communicates with the old, and in so doing completes the process. From here, the external lobe is shut down, its cells destroyed and discarded, its purpose at an end. 

Translation is complete, transference established, brain and mind alike brought into their new home; a simple experiment all told, a very small neural network, a very miniscule, ordinary body structure, and yet, a most incredible outcome: the first paving stone laid on the path to a truer salvation than humankind has ever before known.

I get the impression [this sub discusses these somewhat](https://i.imgur.com/6HZkWJu.png), but not explicitly. Regardless, here's what I've accumulated so far:

##1\. We are overwhelmingly dependent on finite resources. 

Fossil fuels account for 87% of the worlds total energy consumption.^[1](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources), ^[2](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2018-full-report.pdf) Economic pressures will manifest well before reserves are actually depleted as more energy is required to extract the same amount of resources over time or as the steepness of the EROEI cliff intensifies.^[3](http://thenextturn.com/eroei-energy-cliff/), ^[4](https://ftalphaville-cdn.ft.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Perfect-Storm-LR.pdf)



##2\. Global energy demand is increasing.

Global energy demand increased 0.5-2% annually from 2011-2017, despite increases in efficiency.^[1](https://www.iea.org/efficiency2018/), ^[2](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2018-full-report.pdf), ^[3](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32912) Technological change could raise the efficiency of resource use, but also tends to raise both per capita resource consumption and the scale of resource extraction, so that, absent policy effects, the increases in consumption often compensate for the increased efficiency of resource use (i.e. Rebound Effect).^[4](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jevons_paradox), ^[5](https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2018/02/26/Energy-Efficiency-Curse/)



##3\. We are transitioning to renewables very slowly.

Renewables have had an average growth rate of 5.4% over the past decade.^[1](http://www.ren21.net/gsr-2018/pages/highlights/highlights/), ^[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guXaWwQpe4), ^[3](https://ourfiniteworld.com/2017/01/30/the-wind-and-solar-will-save-us-delusion/), ^[4](http://noapp4that.org/) Renewables are not taking off any faster than coal or oil once did and there is no technical or financial reason to believe they will rise any quicker, in part because energy demand is soaring globally, making it hard for natural gas, much less renewables, to just keep up.^[5](http://vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/scientificamerican0114-521.pdf) New renewables powered less than 30% of the growth in world energy demand (which went up 15%) from 2009 to 2016.^[6](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2017/09/20/analysis/fossil-fuel-expansion-crushes-renewables)In contrast, transitioning to renewables too quickly would likely disrupt the global economy. A rush to build a new global infrastructure based on renewables would require an enormous amount resources and produce massive amounts of pollution.^[7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guXaWwQpe4), ^[8](https://www.postcarbon.org/renewable-energy-will-not-support-economic-growth/)



##4\. Current renewables are ineffective replacements for fossil fuels.

Energy can only be substituted by other energy. Conventional economic thinking on most depletable resources considers substitution possibilities as essentially infinite. But not all joules perform equally. There is a large difference between potential and kinetic energy. Energy properties such as: intermittence, variability, energy density, power density, spatial distribution, energy return on energy invested, scalability, transportability, etc. make energy substitution a complex prospect. The ability of a technology to provide joules is different than its ability to contribute to work for society. All joules do not contribute equally to human economies.^[1](https://mahb.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MAHBBlog_WhereAreWeGoing40ShadesOfGray_NHagens_May2018.pdf), ^[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6uVnyjTb58)



##5\. Best-case energy transition scenarios will still result in severe climate change.

Even if every renewable energy technology advanced as quickly as imagined and they were all applied globally, atmospheric CO2 levels wouldnt just remain above 350 ppm; they would continue to rise exponentially due to continued fossil fuel use. So our best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy, would still result in severe climate change. Reversing the trend would require both radical technological advances in cheap zero-carbon energy, as well as a method of extracting CO2 from the atmosphere and sequestering the carbon.^[1](https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change) The speed and scale of transitions and of technological change required to limit warming to 1.5C has been observed in the past within specific sectors and technologies. But the geographical and economic scales at which the required rates of change in the energy, land, urban, infrastructure and industrial systems would need to take place, are larger and have no documented historic precedent.^[2](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/sr15/sr15_draft.pdf)



##6\. Global economic growth rates peaked decades ago. 

The increased price of energy, agricultural stress, energy demand, and declining EROEI suggest the energy-surplus economy peaked in the early 20th century.^[1](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/20/global-growth-has-peaked-warns-oecd-economic-outlook), ^[2](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locati), ^[3](https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/the-new-economic-science-of-capitalisms-slow-burn-energy-collapse-d07344fab6be), ^[4](https://www.scribd.com/document/375558812/Perfect-storm-energy-finance-and-the-end-of-growth-Dr-Tim-Morgan-Global-Head-of-Research) Our institutions and financial systems are based on expectations of continued GDP growth perpetually into the future. The size of the global economy is still growing and OECD forecasts (2015) are for more than a tripling of the physical size of the world economy by 2050. No serious government or institution entity forecasts the end of growth this century (at least not publicly).^[5](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-11-30/gdp-jobs-and-fossil-largesse/)



##7\. World population is increasing.

World population is growing around 1.09% per year. The annual growth rate having reached its peak in the late 1960s at around 2%. Although, the rate is expected to continue to decline in the coming years.^[1](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth)



##8\. Our sources of food and water are diminishing.

Global crop yields are expected to fall by 10% over the next 30 years as a result of land degradation and climate change.^[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03891-1) An estimated 38% of the worlds cropland has been degraded or has reduced water and nutrient availability.^[2](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/), ^[3](https://www.fewresources.org/soil-science-and-society-were-running-out-of-dirt.html) Four billion people currently live under conditions of severe water scarcity at least one month per year.^[4](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1500323) Global agriculture is still extremely dependant on fossil fuels for processing, fertilization, and transportation.^[5](http://www.fao.org/3/i2454e/i2454e00.pdf)



##9\. Climate change is rapidly destabilizing our environment.

An overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree humans are the primary cause of climate change.^[1](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Surveys_of_scientists%27_views_on_climate_change), ^[2](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) A comparison of past IPCC predictions against 22 years of weather data and the latest climate science find the IPCC has consistently underplayed the intensity of climate change in each of its four major reports released since 1990.^[3](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-science-predictions-prove-too-conservative/) 15,000 scientists, the most to ever co-sign and formally support a published journal article, recently (2017) called on humankind to curtail environmental destruction and cautioned that a great change in our stewardship of the Earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided.^[4](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/67/12/1026/4605229) Carbon emissions are rising at increasing rates globally and far from enabling us to stay under the goal of two degrees of global average warming.^[5](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/climate/world-emissions-goals-far-off-course.html), ^[6](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/11/29/carbon/), ^[7](https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2018), ^[8](https://www.wri.org/blog/2018/12/new-global-co2-emissions-numbers-are-they-re-not-good) In addition to increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, many disrupted systems could potentially trigger various positive or negative feedbacks within the larger system and exponentially accelerate climate change.^[7](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Climate_change_feedback)



##10\. Biodiversity is falling.

The current species extinction rate is 1,000 to 10,000 times greater than the natural background rate.^[1](http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/biodiversity/elements_of_biodiversity/extinction_crisis/), ^[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03891-1) The Living Planet Index showed a 60% decline in global wildlife populations between 1970 and 2014.^[3](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37775622)75622)",0,1,False,self,,,,,

**Introduction**

If the goal of cell-based meat production is to significantly reduce the levels of meat consumption from industrial animal agriculture and in turn reduce the associated negative impacts (discussed in Series VI), then large quantities of meat will need to be produced affordably and efficiently. Currently, there are no cell-based meat products on the market, although several cell-based meat products have been taste-tested, including cell-based duck, pork sausage, foie gras, fat, beef meatballs, beef hamburgers, and beef steak strips. However, moving from bench-scale methods to an industrialized bioprocess requires an influx of talented scientists from a wide array of disciplines in order to solve significant technical hurdles in cell biology and engineering optimizations. These hurdles, potential strategies for solutions, and the roadmap to scaling cell-based meat are discussed below.

**Bioreactors**

Although cell-based meat products for taste testing have been produced using standard cell culture dishes and [stacked flasks](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newharvest/pages/56/attachments/original/1447099695/cultureflasks.jpg?1447099695), growing cell-based meat at scale will require the use of [bioreactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioreactor) in volumes up to or beyond several thousands of liters. This fundamental switch in how cells are grown brings in additional considerations such as gas exchange, heat transfer, shear stress, mixing, and foaming, which are not of common concern to the standard cell culture technician. While many of these techniques can be borrowed from industries such as cell therapies, recombinant protein production, or production of other biologics, considerable optimizations are required in order to move cell-based meat beyond taste-testing events and toward market readiness. This will require an interdisciplinary effort amongst cell biologists and chemical, mechanical, and bioprocessing engineers.

A variety of methods can be selected for scaling cell-based meat production past bench into pilot and full scales. Broadly speaking, these methods can be broken up categorically into batch, fed-batch, continuous, and perfusion.[^(1)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9783527807833.ch1) In batch culture, a vessel is filled with a fixed volume of media and cells are grown to their maximum density before being harvested or transferred to a larger vessel. In fed-batch culture, cells grown in a vessel are fed fresh medium from an in-line, independent feed vessel at variable rates in order to maximize properties such as exponential cell growth or cell densities. In continuous culture, cells are grown in a vessel and fresh medium is added via an in-line feed vessel at an optimized flow rate, while product, cells, or medium are simultaneously collected in an independent collection vessel at the same or alternative rate. Lastly, perfusion culture is a subset of continuous culture wherein the cells are retained via a substrate or collection method, permitting medium recycling integration and high cell densities in a smaller space. Each method has potential benefits and caveats, and it is possible that multiple methods may be used throughout a cell-based meat bioprocess. Because optimizing a scale-up can require large capital expenses, use of high throughput miniature bioreactors can assist in modeling batch or fed-batch processes.[^(2)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449637) However, miniature perfusion bioreactors requiring microfluidics to match flow rates in small volumes has lagged behind and may be more difficult to accurately model at small scales.[^(3)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30241924) Accordingly, [products for high throughput modeling of perfusion](https://www.sartorius.com/us-en/products/fermentation-bioreactors/ambr-multi-parallel-bioreactors/ambr-250-high-throughput-perfusion) methods still deal with volumes of up to 250 mL.

There are many different bioreactor designs to choose from which can be separated based on how the medium is mixed and whether the cells are grown in suspension or adhered to a solid surface. For mammalian cell culture, the most commonly used bioreactor is a [continuous stirred tank reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_stirred-tank_reactor), as it offers greater long-term sterility and reduced bubbling versus [air-lift reactors](https://www.slideshare.net/khehkesha/airlift-bioreactor-ppt) at scale.[^(4)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9783527807833.ch1) In general, continuous stirred tank reactors permit growth of cells in suspension via mechanical stirring while maintaining high mass transfer of oxygen. Similar results can be obtained with [rocking platform bioreactors](https://www.gelifesciences.com/en/fi/shop/wave-bioreactor-system-200-p-02461) and [vertical wheel bioreactors](https://www.pbsbiotech.com/vertical-wheel.html), albeit at smaller maximum scales. Current cell therapy and biopharmaceutical industry trends show preference for stirred tank and rocking platform bioreactors in disposable, single-use systems up to 2000L. Single-use bioreactors have the advantage of not requiring heated sterilization (discussed later), saving on turnaround time, cross-contamination, water, energy, and sensor (discussed below) costs. Therefore, [single-use bioreactors ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-use_bioreactor)may be a favorable option when considering scale-out methods (discussed below) of production, however the comparably lower value of a batch of cell-based meat product versus a biologic drug or human cell therapy means that single-use technologies would likely not make economic sense for cell-based meat unless current models can be made more affordable. Notably, however, single-use bioreactor bags consist of various material layers which must meet strict regulatory standards at high cost in order to ensure that a high-value batch of product is not lost. Thus, at lower batch value and food-grade regulatory requirements, there may be room for engineering economically-feasible disposable bags tailored for cell-based meat production. The sustainability implications of single-use bioreactors if implemented, in terms of waste, will have to be considered against the potential savings of water and energy usage in sterilization procedures in lieu of their use.

**Optimizations**

There are many important variables which can affect a bioprocess when scaling. These include efficiency of mass transfer, avoidance of inhomogeneities, heat dissipation, impeller shape and speed, and reactor geometry, amongst others. Each can be affected differently depending on the cell type, scale, and intended downstream use. Adjustments for these variables are likely to be adapted from existing platforms from the cell therapy and biologics fields and custom-tailored to a specific bioprocess. Thus, the most generalizable optimizations are discussed below.

One important consideration when scaling is how to deal with shear stress. Shear stress is the mechanical force induced by the friction of liquid on a cells surface.[^(5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11537186) In a bioreactor, this is caused by the liquids turbulence created by the impeller (or general motion) in order to keep the cells in suspension. Larger volumes generally imply stronger shear forces, although the force is inhomogenous throughout the bioreactor.[^(6)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167779991901458) Shear stress can impact cell viability[^(7)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3176934/) and differentiation[^(8)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19197983) (discussed further in Series III), but can also be mitigated by installment of flow breakers, cell adaptations, or addition of [poloxamers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poloxamer#Uses) to the culture medium.[^(9)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28551569) The presence of bubbles or growth of cells in aggregates or on microcarriers (discussed below) can also lead to higher shear forces. Tolerable levels of shear stress should thus be calculated for each cell line and cell type.[^(10)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2038982/)

The vast majority of cell types, including those used in cell-based meat, are [anchorage-dependent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4275909/), meaning that they require some substrate to grow on in order to prevent programmed cell death, termed [anoikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoikis). While pluripotent stem cells can be grown as anchorage-independent aggregates in suspension, they must also be routinely dissociated to single cells in order to prevent spontaneous differentiation,[^(11)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21761573)^(,)[^(12)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21527925) and are typically treated with an inhibitor of Rho Kinase (i.e. [ROCK inhibitor](https://www.stemcell.com/y-27632.html)) to prevent death as single cells. Pluripotent-derived cell types used in cell-based meat production are largely anchorage-dependent, although recent advances in [organoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organoid) culture have led to the development of suspension-based differentiation protocols to create an array of iPSC-derived cell types, including myoblasts.[^(13)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4006483/) These protocols may also better recapitulate the physiology of *in vivo* cellular counterparts (discussed further in Series III), however, they have limited testing past bench scale.[^(14)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29122288) Lastly, aggregate-based culture may be more susceptible to shear stress[^(15)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105813), resulting in lower cell viability and lower cell densities relative to single cell suspension culture, although these limitations can likely be overcome.[^(16)](http://www.pnas.org/content/115/25/6369#F2)

Adult stem cell types such as myosatellite cells and mesenchymal stem cells are also anchorage-dependent, and are generally grown in suspension on [microcarriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcarrier) (discussed in Series III) in order to bypass this limitation, although spheroid cultures are a promising alternative.[^(17,)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5895685/)[^(18)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616445) However, there are no inherent biological limitations to suspension adaptation. For instance, the adherent epithelial [Chinese Hamster Ovary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_hamster_ovary_cell) cell type used in the production of biologics has been adapted to suspension growth and optimized for specific traits such as maximized protein production over time in vitro. Mesenchymal stem cells, on the other hand, are often used as cell therapies, and the development of off-the-shelf [allogeneic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation) products which necessitate large scale bioprocessing (e.g. 1 million doses) and cell line optimization is still in its infancy. As such, many routine mesenchymal stem cell therapies are [autologous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation) in nature, requiring minimal scaling and no cell line optimization prior to re-entry into the body.[^(19)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29859173) Thus, sufficient selection, directed evolution strategies[^(20)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27528765), or genetic engineering[^(21)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26854539) applied to adult stem cell types may be able to overcome anchorage-dependent limitations for cell-based meat cell line growth in bioreactors. Notably, species differences may also determine the likelihood of suspension growth, exemplified by suspension growth of insect myoblasts.[^(22)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01261) Some immortalized cell lines (discussed in Series I), depending on the method of immortalization, can acquire anchorage-independence, permitting growth in suspension.[^(23)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127451/)^(,)[^(24)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131285) Lastly, in adipocytes, the accumulation of lipid droplets upon maturation and resultant increased buoyancy may pose additional problems for cell-based fat production in conventional stirred tank bioreactors.[^(25)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10657847)

As cells grow, they release autocrine and paracrine factors that can serve as pro-growth or inhibitory signals to neighboring cells. Under high cell densities intended for cell-based meat production (i.e. &gt; 1x10^(7) cells/mL), these signals can greatly influence downstream proliferation, differentiation, and viability. Computational *in silico* modeling can assist in the selection of bioprocessing methods by modeling accumulation of paracrine signals and predicting methods to yield favorable outcomes.[^(26)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22305571) Identified undesirable signals may also be removed from the culture via filtration whereas desirable signals can be recycled (discussed in Series IV). Alternatively, growth of cells in high concentrations of paracrine factors such as lactic acid, ammonia[^(27)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1368402), and low concentrations of growth factors can select for cells tolerant to high densities and lower growth factor requirements (e.g. serum-free conditions).[^(28)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10986701) High-density growth may also require nutrient alterations to the cell culture medium, as well as addition of oxygen carriers[^(29)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22358910) and anti-foaming agents[^(30)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/btpr.2575) (discussed further in Series IV). It will therefore be important to generate optimized cell lines across a variety of species that are uniquely adapted to the biophysical environment within bioreactors and tolerant to relevant paracrine factors or secreted metabolites during the proliferation and differentiation stages, respectively.

**Seed Trains**

In order to produce large numbers of cells in large volumes, a progressive scaling process is started from a single vial of cells. This process is called a seed train. As cells grow, [they proceed through a lag phase](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/cell-culture-protocols/maintaining-cultured-cells.html), where the cells adapt to their growing conditions, followed by a log phase where cells proliferate exponentially, and ending in a stationary phase. Thus, the starting density of cells compared to the volume in which they are thawed can influence their access to available nutrients and time to reach log phase.[^(31)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24297426) This can vary by cell type and species.[^(32)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3919982/) The seed train strategy relies on cells growing exponentially over time, tracked by population doublings, while transferring cells into progressively larger vessels. By the exponential nature of this process, the greatest efficiencies are achieved at high numbers of population doublings. However, a higher number of population doublings can negatively affect downstream proliferation rates and differentiation capacities.[^(33)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2679310/)^(,)[^(34)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1435883/) Thus, optimization strategies for seed train development are needed to achieve rapid, steady log phase growth without loss of downstream differentiation potential or viability.

Several strategies to reduce seed train times and save on costs have already been conceived of in other bioprocess applications and should be translatable to cell-based meat production. For instance, high density cryopreservation of cells (\~10 x 10^(7) cells/mL) can be thawed directly into multi-liter rocking platform bioreactors to dramatically reduce the number of days required to scale cell numbers.[^(35)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/btpr.599) Alternatively, stem cells may be grown in a continuous or semi-continuous bioprocess early on, with subsets of cells from these bioreactors used to directly inoculate larger volume tanks. In these cases, coupled cell retention devices can enable continuous processing at high cell densities, saving on downtime between runs.[^(36)](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2016044670A1/en)^(,)[^(37)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30241924) Perfusion bioreactors, such as [hollow fiber reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_fiber_bioreactor), may serve as one example to generate high-density cultures, capable of continuous cell growth over many months with high automation potential (discussed later).[^(38)](http://www.biopharminternational.com/potential-application-hollow-fiber-bioreactors-large-scale-production) Economic modeling of integrated continuous processing has shown savings of 55% on capital and operating expenses over a 10-year period \[for production of monoclonal antibodies\] compared to batch processing, suggesting that implementation of continuous processes would be attractive for cell-based meat companies.[^(39)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165615002412) Additionally, new techniques utilizing co-extruded cells within 400 micron diameter alginate-based tubes offer tremendous potential for scaling cell-based meat production within closed microenvironments, bypassing seed train processing altogether and dramatically reducing the volume requirements of the bioreactor in order to obtain the same number of cells versus previously discussed methods.[^(40)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961218307415)^(,)[^(41)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29319535)

Taken together, the bioprocessing scale-up strategy is one of the most substantial technical and engineering hurdles to overcome in order for cell-based meat production to reach mass markets. While it may take significant time to empirically validate or translate existing strategies in the biologics field to cell-based meat production in new species and cell types, the tremendous evolution of bioprocessing over the last few decades provides a roadmap for success. Sharing of ideas and technologies across the biologics, cell therapy, bioreactor, and cell-based meat industries promises to provide positive synergistic outcomes across these fields.

**Processing Timelines**

A general timeline for the production of cell-based meat is on the order of a [handful of weeks](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/01/health/clean-in-vitro-meat-food/index.html), however, this can vary greatly based on the cell type, species, and downstream intended product. For instance, the developmental timelines of a species are generally recapitulated *in vitro* such that skeletal muscle derived from mouse pluripotent stem cells via directed differentiation can be produced in two weeks, whereas a human system will take three weeks or more.[^(42)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28634270) Accordingly, the doubling times of the same cell types from different species can vary,[^(43)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3919982/) as well as doubling times from different cell types within the same species. For instance, mouse pluripotent stem cells will divide at higher rates (doubling time = 12-16 hours[^(44)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081156)) versus adult myoblast cells (doubling time = 24 hours[^(45)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873506118301430)). Thus, large timeline efficiency gains to produce a certain number of cells may be granted solely on the selection of species and starting cell type. However, other variables such as cell size in larger animals[^(46)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3700554/) is also [recapitulated *in vitro*](https://cen.acs.org/business/food-ingredients/list-cleanmeat/96/i42), which may make up for slower doubling times in terms of gross tissue mass. Maturation time (discussed in Series III) may also influence timelines and end products with different texture requirements. Thus, economic modeling of the bioprocess should take into account the different variables presented for each species throughout the bioprocess, many of which will need to be empirically determined due to a dearth of rigorous literature for many species.

**Scale Out vs. Scale Up**

Given the challenges in scaling up cell production, a scaling out approach may yield a faster route to getting cell-based meat in the mouths of consumers. In this scenario, production takes place at smaller scales, satisfying meat production requirements which are more akin to a restaurant or butcher shop rather than a farm or a slaughterhouse. These scales have been estimated to require more manageable bioreactor sizes of 100-1000L volumes to reach local demand. Thus, it may be significantly easier to design a scale-out facility with higher automation potential, lower energy, land, and capital expenditure requirements, and saved time and money from avoiding large scale up challenges. Similar strategies have been conceived at even smaller scales, such as [in-home kits](https://qz.com/1103280/japans-shojinmeat-project-takes-a-novel-approach-to-lab-grown-meat/). Thus, scaling out approaches may provide a more reasonable short-term path to market for cell-based meat products and exploration of this strategy should be encouraged. However, production volumes at these scales will likely fail to meet the large demands for global meat consumption as they would not be able to capitalize at later stage exponential growth. Co-existing systems of local scale-out and large scale-up approaches may therefore be required to meet these demands over time.

**Non-Cellular Considerations and Sensor Systems**

The interactions amongst cells (solid phase) suspended in a liquid phase and aerated by a gas phase within a bioreactor are complex and require sophisticated monitoring to ensure a bioprocess is operating optimally. In general, these interaction variables can be broken into physical (e.g. temperature), chemical (e.g. pH), and biological (e.g. cell concentration). The sensors which measure these variables can lie inside the bioreactor itself (in-line), outside of the bioreactor (at-line or off-line), or operate continually (on-line).[^(47)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/elsc.201500014) In-line sensors require enduring the same temperature and sterilization processes as the bioreactor itself, having minimal leaching of components, and potentially operating for weeks at a time without requiring re-calibration. If there are inhomogeneities within the bioreactor, usage of multiple in-line sensors or sensor arrays may be required to achieve accuracy. On the other hand, off-line sampling can require manual human involvement and sample manipulations, which can affect more time-sensitive variables and introduce contaminants (discussed later). In general, current sensor development focuses on real-time, on-line monitoring systems, which are frequently becoming enabled by advanced spectroscopic systems and a push for continuous bioprocessing in other industries. These sensors are primarily being developed to adhere to the FDAs [Process Analytical Technology](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidances/ucm070305.pdf) guidelines but can be adopted by the cell-based meat industry. The key variables affecting a cell-based meat bioprocess are temperature, oxygen, carbon dioxide, pH, glucose, biomass, and metabolites. These variables and their sensing systems are discussed independently below.

The temperature of a cell-based meat bioprocess will depend on the species of interest. For example, most mammalian cells are grown around 37C while fish and other marine creature cells may be grown at significantly lower temperatures.[^(48)](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/201811.0326/v1) Nevertheless, recording and maintaining accurate temperatures during the process is crucial for many parameters. This is typically done through the use of platinum resistance thermometers which contain a stable, non-reactive piece of platinum wire. The electrical resistance of the wire increases linearly with temperature and thus temperature can be inferred by passing current through the wire.[^(49)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28917732)

Oxygen is often the rate-limiting substrate within a bioreactor, as approximately 45 times the amount of dissolved oxygen can be carried by blood versus cell culture media.[^(50)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16023202) Oxygen must be continually delivered in the form of dissolved oxygen in order to meet cellular metabolic demands, referred to as the oxygen utilization rate. Meeting a specific cell lines oxygen utilization rate requires [considerations influencing the oxygen mass transfer coefficient](https://www.gelifesciences.com/en/nz/solutions/bioprocessing/knowledge-center/7-factors-that-affect-oxygen-transfer-to-cells-in-bioreactors), kLa, such as mixing speed, bubble size, temperature, flow rate, and general properties of the cell culture medium. Thus, species cells grown at lower temperatures, such as fish, may require differing oxygen requirements, as oxygen solubility increases at lower temperatures. Without proper oxygenation (typically 30-40% of air saturation) or with over-oxygenation, cell growth and viability can be rapidly negatively affected. Several methods exist for monitoring liquid phase dissolved oxygen, however membrane-covered amperometric electrodes, optical sensors, and [paramagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetism) sensors are most practical for biological applications.[^(51)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28917732)^(,)[^(52)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/elsc.201500014)

Carbon dioxide and pH are intimately linked in a cell-based meat bioprocess. As a bioprocess scales, an increasing number and density of cells respire, leading to an increasing concentration of dissolved CO2 above the standard 5-10% operating range. The CO2 can readily diffuse across the cell membrane, lowering intracellular pH and affecting cellular metabolism, enzyme function, protein folding, and general cell health.[^(53)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11027168) In order to decrease CO2 concentrations, surface aeration, [sparging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparging_(chemistry)), or agitation can be used; however, each becomes more difficult with scale due to surface-to-volume limitations and shear stress considerations.[^(54)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19332302) CO2 is typically measured using a [Severinghaus electrode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severinghaus_electrode), which contains a CO2-permeable membrane and electrode that records the resulting pH change within a bicarbonate solution as CO2 is absorbed. pH indicators can also be used to adapt this methodology to optical sensing methods.[^(55)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400510006210)

The pH of the cell culture medium must be tightly controlled for optimal cell health (for mammalian cells, generally 7.4  0.4). Together with oxygen, the pH can yield information about cell growth rate and metabolism, as acidic byproducts of cellular metabolism such as lactic acid and carbonic acid (following CO2 reacting with water) accumulate in the medium, resulting in lower pH. pH is typically monitored via [potentiometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_meter) and optical sensors. Indeed, the standard red-pink color [associated with cell culture](https://www.google.com/search?q=cell+culture&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi08aLs96zfAhWR51QKHb2sBvIQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1252&amp;bih=767) is caused by the dissolved pH indicator phenol-red, which adjusts color under certain pH thresholds (in this case, your eye is the optical sensor). Similar indicators can be used in immobilized substrates attached to optical fibers for more practical pH monitoring. The limitations of optical methods include a limited dynamic range, heat instability of some fluorophores, and sensitivity to mediums with high ionic strength.[^(56)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/elsc.201500014) Lastly, [ion-sensitive field effect transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISFET) can record pH by measuring current changes caused by ion (H^(+)) concentration changes; however, these devices require parallel reference electrodes.

Glucose acts as the principal carbon energy source within a cell-based meat culture system and thus active monitoring of glucose and other metabolites can inform feeding strategy, optimal cell densities, and proliferative rates. As glucose and glutamine are consumed during exponential cell growth, lactate and ammonium, respectively, increase in the medium, which can have prohibitive effects on cell growth and viability. Several methods aimed at decreasing or controlling these byproducts have been developed,[^(57)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5855607/) although ammonium toxicity is far more potent (2-4 mM) than lactate (20-40 mM)[^(58)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168165695001964) and thus can be a more important target to reduce. Glucose and a range of metabolites are typically measured via spectroscopic analyses, although some enzymatic methods also exist. The methods primarily used in detecting biological molecules such as infrared, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy fundamentally rely on the interaction of electromagnetic waves with molecular bonds which reveal chemical fingerprints based on measured vibrational motion (infrared), scattering of vibrations (Raman), or emitted photons upon excitation (fluorescence). These sensor systems are advantageous as they can be used continually, there is no interaction between the sensor and analyte itself, and they can be multiplexed.

Infrared spectroscopy includes the near- (740-1300 nm) and mid- (1300-15000 nm) infrared wavelengths. Each can detect relevant organic molecules such as glucose and lactate, but certain wavelengths are more useful for molecules containing specific chemical bonding structures.[^(59)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/elsc.201500014) Using mid-infrared wavelengths can yield stronger signals and higher resolution for these purposes. Raman spectroscopy relies on electromagnetic waves typically in the visible or near infrared range and can complement infrared methods. In general, implementation of spectroscopic methods can be challenging due to relatively low concentrations of the molecules of interest, the diversity of molecules present, difficulty in calibration due to changing conditions within a live cell culture, and the large amount of data that is generated.[^(60)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/elsc.201500006) Therefore, large sets of training data from pilot or spike-in studies may be required in order to apply [chemometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemometrics) statistical techniques that permit identification of individual molecules of interest with high confidence. Data-driven models from chemometric analyses can then feed into a [soft sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_sensor) (a sensor combined with a software-based algorithm) algorithm for a custom cell-based meat bioprocess.

Similar spectroscopic methods can also be used to detect biomass concentration, including bacterial contaminants[^(61)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4135896/), based on scattering or transmission of light through a turbid sample. Near-infrared wavelengths are typically used for larger mammalian cells, with specific wavelengths between 840 and 910 nm as typical culture mediums do not absorb much light in these wavelengths.[^(62)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/elsc.201500014) However, these methods make no determination of cell viability and can be affected by air bubbles or other large particles within the cell culture. These issues can be partially alleviated through the use of impedance sensors where measurement of a sinusoidal electrical field between two electrodes is minimally affected by objects such as air bubbles with no plasma membrane. Impedance methods can be adapted for measurement of cell densities within a solid scaffold (discussed in Series III), where spectroscopy may otherwise fail. Lastly, *in situ* microscopy and flow cytometry can also be incorporated into a bioprocessing scheme if additional morphological, size, or viability data are needed,[^(63)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/elsc.201500006) although the practicality of implementing these methods for cell-based meat may be limited.

Recent advances in genetic engineering permit the design of genetically encoded biosensors that can sense extrinsic (e.g. shear stress) or intrinsic (e.g. oxidative damage) characteristics of cells.[^(64)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0958166914001396) Fundamentally, genetically encoded sensors rely on the transcription of specific genes tied to a specific characteristic. Using these gene promoters to drive expression of a detectable reporter protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or product of an enzymatic reaction (e.g. light from luciferase) can provide critical insight into a cell populations interaction with its environment. Some examples include genes involved in the unfolded protein response to sense glucose or amino acid starvation[^(65)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12042763)^(,) hypoxia response genes[^(66)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15802864), mechanical stress genes, and protein production (i.e. endoplasmic reticulum stress response) genes.[^(67)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23436541) Building biosensors into an optimized cell line may offer several advantages over the aforementioned methods, including savings on cost, calibration, sterilization, time sensitivity, and flexibility. However, inhibitory metabolic burden from a constitutively active biosensor would need to be considered. Whether or not a product can be consumed with these transgenes in them is yet to be determined by regulation (discussed in Series V). However receiving Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) designation by the FDA may not be insurmountable, as many of these biosensors are derived from animal proteins (e.g. GFP from *A. victoria* and luciferase from *P. pyralis*) rather than being purely synthetic.

**Automation**

Incorporating automation into a bioprocess can unlock significant cost savings on manual labor time, reagent use, lab space, and general gains from limiting batch-to-batch variation and standardizing quality control. Automation can also facilitate the prevention of contamination and ease regulatory compliance when implemented in a closed system. Automation is just starting to gain traction in the cell therapy and regenerative medicine fields. Several products now exist that enable closed, end-to-end manufacturing of therapeutic doses of adipose-derived stem cells from adipose tissue biopsies[^(68)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3900001/) or [general stem cell expansion with high degree of customization](https://www.terumobct.com/quantum) and parallelization. Despite these advances, cell-based meat manufacturing fundamentally involves orders of magnitude higher numbers of cells and thus may require significant engineering customization, especially in regards to cell scaling, quality control, harvesting (discussed in Series IV), and product formulation (discussed in Series V). These customizations may require considerable capital expenditure and may therefore be better suited to be built out as hardware or software offerings from existing life science companies and technology stakeholders rather than internally within a startup. Applying learnings from the existing lower volume bioprocess industry and the larger volume food and agtech industries, where automation is abundant, may be favorable for implementation in cell-based meat production.

In general, automation should be designed to be implemented into the manufacturing process from the ground up, rather than retroactively replacing highly manual steps.[^(69)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1465324918300112) While species or product specificity may dictate a custom implementation, the general bioprocess as described throughout this series is likely to be conserved. Thus, industry-wide collaboration toward identification of critical process parameters and the composition of their analytical frameworks to guide automation implementation would pay dividends for the entire industry. Similarly, these parameters may guide industry standardization across software (open-source), sensor systems, or other hardware components, although sacrificing the potential for intellectual property development would need to be considered. Collaborative efforts are also needed to establish cost of goods (COGS) models for cell-based meat from which high-cost areas or bottlenecks within the bioprocess can be identified and prioritized for automation or engineering optimization. The nascent nature of the industry may reveal that some critical process parameters need to be better defined, however eventual automation throughout the industry is likely to be necessary to achieve price parity with conventional animal meats.

The next discussion series will focus on bioengineering considerations for cell-based meat.

Hi, I am an architecture student and this semester I enrolled in a class about the cities of the future, 50 years in the future to be exact.

What I am searching for are good Articles, Ted Talks, Papers etc. on a whole bunch of different Topics. 

A couple of topics/questions I want to include in my project:  


* Climate change (and how does a world look like with a +3 Celsius Climate) and all the nice things that come with it. A new refugee crisis, maybe a war, food shortage... 
* Hyperloop
* Are Airplanes obsolete if a Hyperloop exists? (The city we are supposed to plan is going to be on an airport, if not are E-planes becoming a thing? How does an airport look if planes are able to start vertically)
* Since we are imagining a future in 50 years, how did the world look 50 years ago and how imagined the people from back then our present?
* Our energy system. How could a system look like which relies solely on renewable energy sources. Could it be possible right now? What about our increasing Energy Usage? What are new energy concepts like fusion power?
* How are we going to move in 50 years? Are privately owned cars still going to be a thing? Or are they going to be extinct with the rise of a Hyperloop or sideways moving elevators. Or will there be a transport system, using your phone for example: you type in were you want to go and some algorithm assigns a bus or a car to you to pick you up.
* Could we build a city in which every Building is connected via an underground ant-like elevator system.
* Could we build a City underground? How deep can we dig? How big could a man-made cave underground be?
* How will our food production look like? Could it be possible to feed whole cities with food grown in vertical farms in or below the city?
* How are we going to live in 50 years? Apparently 75% of the world population are going to live in big cities. How will those cities change? Or is our live going to change even more with the possibility of traveling at the speed of sound. Will I be able to live in, lets say Berlin and work in Barcelona because i can be there in about an hour or so.
* Id like to make a presentation about how long 50 years really are in technological advances, for example 70% or so  of the Jobs people are working in right now didnt even exist 50 years ago. 
* Since the airport where we will plan our cities is owned by a private organisation i want to look into mega corporations and their influence in the world which will probably grow even more. 

These are some Topics i found interesting when thinking about the future. If you know some articles, Ted Talks, documentaries or scientific papers you think could help me please send them to me. If you know some topics i forgot, which you find to be important please tell me that as well.

And if you know some books, films, graphic novels, tv shows that tackle these topics send me them too please :)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to do some research on EV Batteries, specially their second life applications.

As you may know, once a battery passes their DOD they can no longer be used on EVs, usually DODs are around 80% of their capacity, so usually these batteries are disposed when they could be used for other purposes for an additional 7 to 10 years.

I've read that only 10% are being recycled today and the other 90% are going to landfills.

&amp;#x200B;

There's been a lot of talk about second life usage, where these batteries can be used in solar fields, residential applications, to power elevators or vending machines, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

What I haven't been able to find is if these batteries are available for purchase. Is there a site that sells second life ev batteries?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I haven't been able to find the specs of EV batteries. Where could I get specs and prices?

&amp;#x200B;

I found a place that has replacement batteries available, some of them with new cells, some of them with refurbished components, so I have an idea of prices from there, but they don't have the specs on their site (they are called electronautomotive)

&amp;#x200B;

If there's anyone with expertise in batteries or solar fields reading this please contact me, any guidance would be helpful. Thanks in advance.",7,1,False,self,,,,,

Technology will bring a dramatic shift in our lives. But how can we guarantee that we will benefit from it?*** 

AI revolution is clearly different from the previous industrial revolution. The introduction of machinery should have improved our lives by delegating work to appliances, but it actually boosted a way of living where the distinction between private life and work is blurred. According to the most recent *futurist* predictions, AI, instead, will give us the possibility to experience a new form of life, endued with more time for ourselves, which frees us from obligations, such as physically intense, stressful works. 

However, there is an important matter to consider. In a society where algorithms will be in charge of the most important decisions, can we still define ourselves as free? Which regulations and limits should we implement upon AI, to be sure that we will gain more freedom, and we will not be dominated by machines? 

In my opinion, the answer to this question depends on which philosophical concept of freedom the reader bears in mind. In this essay, I will discuss two notions of freedom, and how AI will indeed provide us with it. 

Ultimately, I will examine potential concerns regarding political reality and cultural transformation. 

First of all, it is essential to consider the changes that will occur in our society, due to technological development. 

Artificial Intelligence is already being widely employed, and its applications are likely to expand further, both affecting work life and governance. 

In fact, AI ends the era of specialists. Nowadays, data analysis and machine learning are capable of quickly evaluating the course of actions, by assigning risks scores and comparing the outcomes of each choice. 

Data analysis predictions always take into consideration a greater number of factors, possible consequences, and longer time perspectives than any human assessment could ever do. Therefore, the cost-benefit analysis developed by algorithms will always turn out to be more efficient. 

For this reason, AI already manages many operations in companies and government. 

For instance, forms of AI, such as social media control and prediction of individual behaviour for crime prevention, highlight terrorist activity and major threats to national security where intervention is required. 

AI, through drones and geo-maps, coordinates disaster response worldwide, and monitors the optimal allocation of social welfare funding, which guarantees social and economic sustainability. AI plays a fundamental role in public healthcare as well, by auditing statistics on diseases conditions, providing preventive diagnosis and planning treatments. 

Other examples that could be added to this list: urban planning, financial fraud prevention and analysis, and law enforcement are just some of the most developed branches of AI. 

In sum, it is clear that AI can substitute the role of governance. The only actions needed are collecting data and setting short-, medium- and long-term goals. After that, AI will basically indicate to us the best path towards such goals. 

Working life will be revolutionised in the same way. We are already witnessing the use of AI in many job fields: not only manufacturing but also farming, financial services, healthcare, and retail. 

For this reason, a transatlantic network of thinkers is currently advocating a profoundly different future for countries, which offers alluring promises: a life with much less work, or no work at all, calmer, more equal, more communal, more pleasurable, more thoughtful, more fulfilled. Even though this *post-work*forecast still present issues, it is not perceived anymore as a utopia. 

Will we really be free however, in a future where robots work for us, decide how to allocate funds, and how to manage firms and regulate international policy relations?

The technological revolution, if properly governed, will endow us with freedom for two reasons. 

First, AI-based societies could finally provide each of us with the basic opportunities to plan the life we desire. Secondly, it will donate us the most precious resource we are always running out of: time. 

The first statement recalls the concept of freedom discussed by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, and the republican freedom as non-domination by Philip Pettit. 

According to the human development approach, society should ensure a minimum threshold of capabilities and leave the decision about whether to exercise them, or not, in the hands of the public. For instance, a good society should give everyone the possibility to live a healthy life. Then, each individual should be free to decide if he or she wants to live in a healthy or unhealthy way without judgement being passed upon them.

As the Human Development Index clearly demonstrates, the minimum threshold of capabilities can be defined quantitatively. Statistics and ciphers can tell us when a life can be considered of normal length and healthy. Once again, we see the relevance of data. Data can measure if fundamental human rights are respected. It is important to note, that anything, which can be translated into data, is part of the *language* of artificial intelligence. 

My outlook assumes that any individual, that lives in a society where the fundamental rights are guaranteed and is able to live the way he wants, can be considered free. 

Consequently, algorithms can play a great role in securing freedom. The minimum threshold can be translated as the score AI needs to achieve: the best options, in order to accomplish the result, will be clearly pointed out. 

AI intervention however, must be limited to the social sphere. The role of AI should be committed to ensuring equal possibilities for the well-being of everyone in society. 

Therefore, it should deal with decisions at a global or national level, without interfering with private life. The resulting freedom can be understood as non-arbitrary interference. 

The second hypothesis states that by gaining time, we will gain freedom.

Thanks to AI, we will have more time for ourselves, to rediscover humanities. We will hence be free  free from duties and free to focus on what makes us different from robots: social relations, creativity, and innovation. To do this, humans will need to nurture those features that distinguish them from robotics. Forecasts and futurologist analysis state that aspects such as philosophy, art, artisanal work, and social relations will be reawakened, due to the time we will have available. Our technological future will be all about humanity, instead of technology.

The increasing deployment of AI will not revolutionise citizens role in political reality, but will bring meaningful cultural changes to society. 

Possible concerns, in fact, could question what will be the role left for us in policymaking. Will it just become a matter of setting targets and delegate their achievement to tools that function better than us? 

This might sound unacceptable. Nonetheless, I estimate it as equivalent to our present-day situation. 

In the current elective system, participation is minimal. Representation does not promote direct civic engagement. Democracy is perceived as the possibility to choose who will decide for us  selecting the representative whose menu of proposal better suits our interests  and not as first-hand involvement in political reality. 

Moreover, global matters are becoming too complex to be handled by singular individuals. 

Therefore, it would be more efficient to leave such decision-making processes to the best specialist we can employ  artificial intelligence. 

Finally, futurist predictions look at the skills to develop in such an environment. They will be no more that of specialist narrow knowledge, but lateral thinking, inventiveness, originality. Being able to think, to criticise, to formulate your own opinion. Will this mean that we will be intellectually free, not dominated by any kind of ideology or common sense? 

To conclude, the future can be positive for us, if we welcome Artificial Intelligence in the proper way. 

We are being given the chance to achieve human emancipation through technology.

Irrational fears such as machine domination must not blind us towards this opportunity. We must remember that the concept of seeking power over another is solely human. 

We will be able to forget the continuous pressure we perceive because of time, and we will have to rely more on our inner human features. 

Nevertheless, there are many other implications, and possible threats, posed by the employment of AI, that I will not discuss here. 

Here is my final question that I would like to conclude with: if we suppose this scenario will become true, will humans be able to handle the amount of freedom they are given? Will we dedicate ourselves to humanities, or will we come up with new alleged problems, or works, or obligations, because, after all, we need our life to be ruled?

&gt;""Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a promising information channel between the biological brain and external devices and are applied in building brain-to-device control. Prior studies have explored the feasibility of establishing a brain-brain interface (BBI) across various brains via the combination of BMIs. However, using BBI to realize the efficient multidegree control of a living creature, such as a rat, to complete a navigation task in a complex environment has yet to be shown. In this study, we developed a BBI from the human brain to a rat implanted with microelectrodes (i.e., rat cyborg), which integrated electroencephalogram-based motor imagery and brain stimulation to realize human mind control of the rats continuous locomotion. Control instructions were transferred from continuous motor imagery decoding results with the proposed control models and were wirelessly sent to the rat cyborg through brain micro-electrical stimulation. The results showed that rat cyborgs could be smoothly and successfully navigated by the human mind to complete a navigation task in a complex maze. Our experiments indicated that the cooperation through transmitting multidimensional information between two brains by computer-assisted BBI is promising. ""

Future tech like AI is already massively impacting many industries and allowing us to solve complex problem that were unthinkable prior to 2012.  


But the focus has consistently been on high-level and complex problems however such as autonomous vehicles, and there is going to be a wave of new ways that SMEs and individuals use AI to solve their problems also.  


I think this is akin to something like SEO prior to the widespread use and understanding of search engines, or SMM prior to Facebook et al taking off. There's not often the opportunity to be a part of a niche from the very beginning, and I think that this is one of those exact opportunities.  There's a few AI services companies out there, but even within VR there are opportunities within architecture/real estate (showing houses virtually) and psychology (virtual therapy) that are going to become more prevalent soon.

We are conducting research in the aviation field, so we are investigating how people feel about the whole travel experience: from the moment they enter the plane to the landing.

On the one hand, writing is a powerful tool for reflection, for sifting through memories, impressions, absorbed data, creative ideas (etc.) and forming them into a single, cohesive unit of text that can be mass distributed. Individuals (readers) can absorb and respond to it, in their own thoughts, in person to person discussion, and now in online forums. On the other, it is a one person, one mind activity, and the potential for collaboration between individuals in the act of writing itself is low. This means the complexity of the viewpoint expressed is constrained to whatever one individual (the writer) is capable of producing, based on his/her memories, impressions, absorbed data, creative ideas. Ways around this limitation have been found with the process of editing; recently with the internet a person can post an essay or post and engage with critical responses in near-real time. However, the act of writing remains in its essence a solo activity (in my understanding).



Other forms of knowledge production (eg. intellectual conversation) allow for a different process of creation, which is much more collaborative. In a conversation I can begin to formulate an idea, and my partner can interrupt me at any point to comment, contradict, add their own insights, criticize (etc.). With the rise in popularity of the podcast, YouTube etc. , this form of collaborative content creation is becoming an increasingly popular format for thinkers to mold and distribute their ideas. The tradeoff here is that it is much harder for a person to (for example) form an entirely new theory and research around it while engaged in conversation with another person, as that person becomes the primary focus of attention.



In the future, will the individualistic acts of writing and research continue to be worthwhile, and will there continue to be a consumer market for long form content compiled by single individuals? Or is the trend towards more collaborative forms of knowledge production and distribution likely to continue, augmented by technology, until most/all knowledge is produced collaboratively and in real time? Is there an optimum middle ground between the two? What should we be aiming for, both as knowledge producers, and as designers of the systems that allow us to produce and distribute knowledge?",4,1,False,self,,,,,

""Dead Hand"" is the Dr. Strangelove scenario:

""If the new US missiles are deployed in the Baltic countries or Poland their flight time to Russia would be three or four minutes, Rogov said, speaking at the Carnegie International Nuclear Policy Conference in Washington.

He added that would make Russian early warning systems redundant, forcing Russia to rely on carrying out a pre-emptive strike against US weapons, or return to the cold war Perimeter defence system, otherwise known as the Dead Hand as it triggered an automatic nuclear response to an attack on Russian command and control systems.

For those who doesn't know it the site demos at GAN that generates realistic portraits.   


[https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)

  
In the intro to the paper there is something interesting:   


"" ProGAN generates high-quality images but, as in most models, its ability to control specific features of the generated image is very limited. In other words, the features are entangled and therefore attempting to tweak the input, even a bit, usually affects multiple features at the same time. A good analogy for that would be genes, in which changing a single gene might affect multiple traits. ""  


When do you think our knowledge of genes and DNA will be deep enough to actually analyze a gene sequence for a person, and then render out what that person might look like?  


Or is the apperance of a person unknowable based on dna? Does our appearance change radically based on outer factors after conception ( epigenetics) ?

And I believe despite all of the testimony on capitol hill over the years, progressive and insightful documentaries, the only true change will happen from the people of their own respective countries by banding together on social media, then stepping out of their door to create a change.

In other words, change is done by *doing* rather than talking. And I'm just amazed and purely optimistic and ultimately hopeful about my current generation as well as future generations approach toward being responsible about our own waste.

And while our beaches and coastlines may be more aesthetically pleasing, the act of removing our trash from these areas can protect a wide variety of ecosystems and food chains.

It seems though the future of what I call *environmental responsibility* will be rooted on the tried and true method of people joining together and creating change, rather than relying on a political ticket and wishful thinking.

It's something I've delivered in the past, in 15 minute talks to colleges and engineering societies, and to a Royal Aeronautical Society event although they were always 10-15 minutes. This will be an hour lecture so I want to come prepared.

&amp;#x200B;

In just a decade since the first Iron Man film kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe, much of the technology we see in the film has made significant developments in real life, contributing towards modern flight systems, power,  weapons and artificial intelligence. My thesis is that science fiction is becoming ever more accurate at predicting future tech, and the timescales to technology readiness are getting shorter.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I wish to discuss exoskeletons, for example Cyberdyne's HAL (Hybrid Assisted Limb) and examples from Raytheon and Lockheed Martin

\- I already plan to discuss Iron Man's Mark VI laser weapon in the context of real directed energy weapons designed for taking out drones, and the Boeing YAL-1.

\- I plan to discuss his repulsors in the context of ion engines, e.g. VASIMR and the NEXT ion thruster.

\- The arc reactors as a stepping off point for Wendelstein 7-X and ITER fusion reactors.

\- Jarvis as a link to uses of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

\- Also, a brief discussion on the HUDs being used by F35 fighter pilots and trialled on infantry.

In Facebook, YouTube, and other social media. Where once upon a time basically anyone could post anything, we are now seeing massive suppression of politically incorrect and vicious discourse that was once the purview of generally establishment based main stream media. 

I don't see anything illegal about these companies ""filtering"" posts, nor anything especially undesirable about their actions. But it's worth noting that, as a society, we are finding such gatekeeping is often more and more necessary.

One might expect that in the future more blanket filtering will be used as systems are developed to do so. I find it interesting that tactics used in futuristic novels such as 1984 are developing almost spontaneously out of what might be seen as pragmatically responsible defense of our current way of life. The thin line between anarchy and repression has gotten remarkably tenuous.

In the movie ""I , Robot"" this issue was relentlessly portrayed and it makes me wonder if our algorithmically based infrastructure is headed toward automated and algorithmic suppression in the name of the protection of human survival. The theorized AI apocalypse may come about by our own attempts to preserve ourselves. ",10,7,False,self,,,,,

I would assume these processes are the execution of or deviation from the social contract of a given society. This, whether directly or indirectly, has generated a multitude of ""-isms"", to extents I could not comprehend. I think history shows us that we've kept one concept constant, that some form of collectivization is necessary for survival (definitely provide instances where this is not true!!). If this is true, do we need a social contract to maintain a collective, and if so, what is necessary and/or sufficient for a robust contract to meet the challenges of the future while maintaining enough flexibility to understand that we will know more tomorrow than what we know today.   


Please respect each other and understand that a lot of this is hard to answer, and we've not necessarily found the right answers yet (otherwise, why ask the question?). I'm no expert, I'd love to hear from some, but I'd also like to think that no one school of thought knows how to best answer this completely. Finally, try to offer good sources demonstrating how the construct you'd like to see has been beneficial in the past, if such data exists, but also be clear on your definition of ""beneficial"" and be prepared for challenges on that definition.

The other day, I asked [/r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/awmjm8/d_how_long_are_we_from_voice_style_transfer_voice/) about a topic that I've been tossing about my head for almost a full decade now: *when will we be able to use style transfer on audio reliably?* 

In the simplest possible terms, ""style transfer"" is when you make one thing like another using machine learning. You upload a picture of a sunny day as an input, upload a bunch of pictures of night time as variables, and then get the original picture but now it's night time. The algorithm didn't fetch a picture of the scene at a different time of day. It altered the very pixels, turning day into night. 

Here's a few examples:

- [Color transfer](https://i.redd.it/1qync11pltpz.jpg)

- [Video transfer, turning a street scene with trees into one with buildings or more trees, among other things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1OwOd-war8)

- [Musical transfer, changing instruments and genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdxCqNWTpUs).

All of which are from 2017 or 2018. 

There's a lot more, and this includes deepfakes which I'm sure plenty of people are aware of. The potential of this technology over the next 5 years and yes, I'm saying ***five*** years, not fifteen or twenty five or fifty is going to lead to people with no skill in machine learning or artistry to be able to alter existing media almost completely as well as generate some kinds of new media.

Back specifically on the topic of audio style transfer, this includes being able to take a song, any song, and altering at your leisure in a variety of different ways ranging from adding or subtracting instruments, swapping the vocalist or removing them entirely, and perhaps even extending the song in an ""intelligent"" manner meaning the algorithm can actually generate more sections of that song that didn't previously exist (within reason). You could turn any top 40 pop song into a 20-minute-long pop epic. 

My classic desire is taking TLC's *Waterfalls* and turning it into a barbershop quartet, complete with the mustachioed men singing in tune with all the 1920s graininess you'd expect. Did you like *Bohemian Rhapsody* but could do without the heavy guitars? Why not transfer it into a polka song? That's indeed very possible. Covering songs in a different style is obviously a thing that you can already find on YouTube and ""X Goes Pop"" compilations whatnot, but that involves actual musicians and artists putting in the time and effort. We're not far away from having a theoretical ""Audacity 2.0"" where you could do the same thing with a few clicks of your mouse. 

One of my more esoteric desires goes a step further, and it's also very much on the horizon. I love Witchfinder General, but they've always been a bit too amateurish. They were almost a great band, if only a few lyrics were changed and some instruments were tightened up. In the future, I could be able to ""correct"" these ""mistakes"", going in to change the lyrics myself so that Zeeb Parkes is singing something a bit different over a band that's even slower and doomier than they actually were. In some cases, that means adding lines where there weren't originally. 

It would obviously still be a laborious process because vocals in songs can be complex and heavily individualized. 

But that was only ever a problem for the old era of digital software, where things had to be cut up and easily able to fit into bits and pieces and then essentially standardized as if you're playing something on a synth. This new era is something *entirely different* and ***infinitely*** more capable. You couldn't replicate Bob Dylan's soul if you had his voice in a voice synthesis software program as might exist today. 

There's no style nor soul that'll be beyond my fingers with the right neural networks. 

For someone like me, who loves creating entire musical scenes and movements from playlists and imagination, that's a godsend. For an actual musician or any creative who prides themselves on their humanity, it sounds like the worst dystopia. 

I'm not overselling this either. Audio is, fundamentally, a bunch of waves. If you can edit those waveforms, you can create any audio you wish. It's just that the way we edit those waveforms is usually by hitting drums, strumming guitars, pressing keyboards, and singing.

**Of course, there are** ***much*** **darker applications of this technology**. The very first thing to come to mind is putting words in someone else's mouth for political purposes, as can be demonstrated here:

- [Deepfakes on Obama, Putin, and others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44)
- [Making Trump say new things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xxGIDfe5BU)

If the latter sounds too robotic, [don't fret/relax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuIpgArEZig). Making voices sound audiorealistic is just a matter of parameters and data, of which the likes of Google, Baidu, Facebook, OpenAI, and many others have no shortage. The crappy free text-to-speech programs you might find with a Google search or in a PDF file is as representative of the state of the art as a bottle rocket is of the military's explosive ordinance. 

And that's literally just the tip of the iceberg. Just because I'm focusing on audio doesn't mean there's nothing for images and video, obviously. Just the opposite everyone is so focused on deepfakes and image synthesis that we're overlooking audio synthesis. 

It's not coming in stages, nor is it arriving slowly and at easily digestible and tolerable speeds as might be written in a shlock cyberpunk novel. We're not going to struggle with image synthesis for 20 years, then struggle with audio synthesis for 20 years, and so on until we reach a point in the distant future where you can't trust anything you see. We're developing them all simultaneously and seeing progress come at breakneck speeds, and we'll be well within that future this time next decade.

In fact, this time next decade we'll have entirely different zeitgeists when it comes to art, entertainment, and the news. There's no refuge in cartoons. Neural networks are in the early stages of learning how to do [caricatures and exaggerations](https://i.imgur.com/8PQHAI3.jpg) the fundamental root of cartooning. Others can [generate short animations from text alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqc9jcgPNmE). Even more can be used to [remaster old video games](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/18/machine-learning-is-rescuing-old-game-textures-in-zelda-and-final-fantasy/) and [create games from scratch](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/438y8g/this-algorithm-makes-its-own-new-video-games).

And no, [you can't find refuge in writing either](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/). Scarily enough, it's the text synthesis network that shows the most signs of general intelligence. It's not AGI by far, but it's most general AI ever created and it isn't even a very complex machine at that. But it's apparently too dangerous to be released.

If you have a passion for all of this and create art for art's sake or are willing to accept fewer (but likely much higher paid) commissions rather than a ""career"" as we understand it to be, you're fine. If you're someone who wants to become a career artist/model/voice actor/musician/animator/writer/comic artist/newscaster and expect to find consistent work for the next 50 years, (first, good luck regardless) make these next five to ten years count and/or try considering jumping into the former category.

**The final and most sobering realization of all this** is the cold fact that, ironically contrary to all those predictions of how automation would unfold, entertainment and the arts will be the *first* field to go. Everyone said that all the drudgery of the world would be automated first, freeing up workers to pursue the arts because ""a machine could never [write a poem](https://imgur.com/gallery/Dfa4IO8), [pen a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHZ_b05W7o), or paint [a work of art](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45980863)"".

This is something so stupefyingly far from public conscious that there is virtually *nothing* being done or said about it. You might initially think that it doesn't warrant much discussion until it actually arrives, but when you really start looking at this in-depth, you have a tendency to grow a bit fatalistic. One of my future-shock angsts is about schooling and how public and private schools in their current form are utterly unable to prepare children for the future into which they will graduate (a future in which school itself may become obsolete because there will be little point for it besides social functions and raw education, which isn't what American schooling is for). This is related, but a bit different.

We have a technology that didn't exist 10 years ago and yet will almost certainly upend the entire entertainment industry within 10 years from now. Photoshops and photo manipulation, ""dumbfakes"" if you will, weren't even a pre-meal mint, let alone the appetizer. We ought to be having a dialog on this, but we aren't. 

Many of us refuse to believe it exists at all, that it's just some schizophrenic pipe dreams found on /r/Futurology and /r/Singularity. Others so desperately want to leave a place for humans that they will deny that machines will be able to do these things competently despite being shown the evidence. And those who accept it can only say ""So what?"" Even though I eagerly await a world where I could generate a multimedia franchise (*and* the global reaction) in my bedroom on my laptop, there are still pertinent risks.

As /u/ksblur said: 

&gt; Strange how we live in a world of trust-based security. It would be relatively easy for cryptography to solve that issue (your phone could automatically reject calls without proper signatures or encryption), but  people grew up ""trusting"" the systems so there's not a lot of incentive to change it.

&gt; Could you imagine inventing the telephone in 2019 and either A) not encrypting the data (landlines) or B) [using weak 64bit A5/1 encryption (GSM)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2010/12/15-phone-3-minutes-all-thats-needed-to-eavesdrop-on-gsm-call/)?*

Lots of claims are being made, both by people who are desperate for generating content through conspiracy theories,  or by some intelligent people like Elon Musk too. The claims are generally about AI getting conscious and taking over the world and dominate us. I'm starting to believe that these ideas are to create a diversion from the human abuse of technology to some conceptual conscious AI being that we are not even technologically close to yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Enlighten me if i'm missing something but this ""AI"" that we are scared of is actually machine learning algorithms that can ONLY use structured data created with manual labour by humans to feed the AI constantly for it to get better and better at a very VERY specific task. There's no such technology as some AI that is looking around and getting every data it can get and make sense of it to improve itself because the internet is not just one language or syntax or one concrete dataset, therefore this whole Woke AI talks feels like science fiction to me.  From my 12 year of work experience in technology, things are actually very disconnected from each other. Just like how you can't use one application in another platform, or use one programming language in another, or even a function or method not working in another form of code. Even our voice assistants can't even make sense of something if they don't have access to that information. Technology and programming just doesn't work that way.

&amp;#x200B;

The real threat, if you ask me is, who is behind these powerful tools of surveillance and information, the anonymity of power and abuse of privacy. We need to talk about how dangerous AI is when we actually solve the mystery of intelligence and consciousness ourselves, but until then, there's no need to blame it on some fiction because we already have a lot of problems these powerful tools brought us by corporations and governments. Just a humble opinion from someone that works in technology. I'd love to hear if some engineer or a technologist could 'technically' explain how that might actually happen. Because all the talks I went to, or watched on YouTube is nothing technical and always on a conceptual level which is what science fiction is.

Do you also think it's a distraction from what is actually happening or is it a legit threat?",5,1,False,self,,,,,

Size:50-100 people in 1 Square Kilometer (Humans thrive in tribes of 50-100 any more and trouble starts)

Settlements:are chosen by the AI,the humans selected will have a common factor like being pregnant,single or elderly,etc.The AI installs the houses and connects them to desalination plants which are underground like any other building that doesn't have humans living inside it,even the houses are camouflaged into nature to create the effect of no human interference.Along with water is underground sewage and a tube that delivers food to the residents based on their DNA dieting needs.This tube can also be used to deliver other things.

Houses:are made in a circle shape with one way earthquake-proof glass that can tint on the inside.The door slides upward and upon entrance you are greeted with a hall with tinted glass depending on what time of day it is,tinted dark or light.If you look left or right after entrance you can see a door on each side and the same at the other end of the hall(back door and doors on each side).Each door opens to the bed or couch and table in the middle between the doors and a tinted wall the same one as the hall behind the bed/couch.The circle glass around the room is to enjoy the full panoramic view and when you choose you can tint the glass and turn on/off the outside noise and air.Entertainment is viewed from a projector on your phone best pointed at the circle glass in the living room with the tint fully dark and noise and air turned off.To get the best panoramic view the bedroom lifts up onto the roof facing the sun while the other bedroom stays on the ground.The hall is big enough so that when you look up from the bottom bedroom you cannot see the one that has been lifted.The living room can also be lifted where the top bedroom is and turned 180 degrees.

Town:centers where people can socialize and enjoy leisurely activities,sports and [games.In](https://games.In) every town center lies the transport hub which is basically Tesla's underground tunnel that can take you around the Mediterranean basin in minutes so relatives and old friends are always only a few minutes away.

Contraception:will be vaccinated at birth and to have a baby you will have to donate sperm when you want to have a baby,the bad/unhealthy sperm will be destroyed and the healthy sperm is used to make the baby.

Kids:will live in a settlement with other families until they hit puberty.(no specific age just when biology happens)When the kid hits puberty they are sent to an uninhabited area on the Mediterranean basin like a Lord of The Flies type of thing(tribe of kids entering puberty same time)except with guides and teachers to look over them and teach them,family can see their kids and contact them but cannot stay with them more than a few hours.The kids will learn how to survive from scratch and then to farm and be able to create the settlement created for them by the AI,by themselves.AI will be able to detect which kids are gifted at certain things and those kids will be split up from their group and put into gifted groups eg.If gifted athletically the kid will learn sports and whichever he chooses he will train in,similarly a kid gifted intellectually will research a certain subject,extroverts are encouraged to be teachers and guides,etc.

Animals:that can kill you are contained to areas between human settlements and outside the education area.Settlements kept 10 kilometers away from coastline in case of tsunami and hurricanes.

Other:settlements exist without the help of AI,farming and collecting water from rain,trading between settlements,horse riding and working with dogs for hunting and farming,homes built by hand,situated outside Mediterranean basin,etc.(Similar to different cults)",4,1,False,self,,,,,

Perhaps there is more truth to Aristotle's 4 classical elements and Jung's 4 cognitive functions than we are willing to accept.

This thought came about while trying to figure out if there are parallels between star behavior and human behavior, as well as human behavior and subatomic/DNA behavior, and wondering what ways humans unconsciously influence subatomic/DNA behavior. It also came about while wondering if there is a more accurate way to group the world's people into 4 dominant behavioral mechanisms.

In the universe, there is a general pattern of construction and deconstruction (matter itself is never created or destroyed, though it changes form based on this construction/deconstruction pattern). This seems to pervade everything and has many different names (Life/Death, Yin/Yang, etc.) But it seems like our society is more prone to divide this pattern into many small parts rather than see it as an all-encompassing whole. For example, our education system breaks knowledge down into many different subjects like chemistry, math, social studies, health, etc. without teaching the ways they are all interconnected.

Essentially, I'm wondering if there is a set of components which explains the universe as simply as possible. I know it's a weird question, but I'm hoping that a scientifically-minded person can shed light on this question objectively.

I'm asking this question in this subreddit because if a general pattern of the universe were to be discovered, it could help to unite the world's people as well as revolutionize education, making it easier for students to grasp concepts and to work together in harmony. ",11,0,False,self,,,,,

Hello r\\Futurology. Im trying to get some perspective and imagine the future. I will be posting this post to you and several other subreddits. Im curious to the answers I will find. In your subreddits case Im interested in the responses because things seem untenable now and I wonder how things will be in the future, what sort of people we will be and shape into. Where better to think these thoughts?

Anyway, here's how I want to do this.

Take a few minutes and try to imagine a society, the best society you can imagine. It will probably spring to your head sort of automatically and evolve a little as you think on it. It should not be a society that currently exists (though it could take cues from one that does). It should not be a perfect or utopian society, just your subjective best society.

Now tell me about that society. 

I have some example questions you can use as jumping off points. Use any or even all of them.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example question: Choose two keywords that would epitomize your imagined society. Examples: Justice + Convictions, Freedom + Sacrifice, Honor + Conquest. What do these words mean in this societies context.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Example question: In this imagined society, do people consider money good, evil or something else?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example question: In this imagined society, do people consider religion (the idea, not any specific one) good, evil or something else?In your imagined society, do people tend to be religious?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example question: In this imagined society, do people consider work good, evil or something else? How do people would spend an average day?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example question: In this imagined society, do people consider other similar societies good, evil or something else? 

Similar societies would have one, but not both, of your imagined societies keywords as their own.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example question: In this imagined society, do people consider other very different societies good, evil or something else?

Very different societies would have neither, and at least one opposite, keywords of your imagined societies.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example question: What are in play that prevent radical change? Can your society's ideals be twisted/corrupted? What would they mutate into? 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These next questions are asked of the people in your imagined best society. Assume that it is an average citizen with a normal upbringing and a normal set of the society's values.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example question: What role does duty play in the average imagined person's life in your imagined society? Duty to oneself, to family, to society, to honor, to other important institutions? Are these duties self imposed, demanded, heavily hinted or something else?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Example question: What is the average imagined person's goal(s)? What do they think is their societies goal(s)? Are their and/or their societies perceived goals to explore, to grow, to learn, to perfect themselves/others, conquest or something else?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example question: What motivates the average imagined person? Are they motivated for themselves, for family, for large ideals (morals, science, war, ect), for the society itself or something else?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example question: What would the average imagined citizen think of 1950s america? Ancient egypt? World War 2 nazi germany? Ancient greece? 2018 china? Feel free to name any other cultures, at times, that one of your imagined citizens would have a strong opinion of (if any).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example question: What does you average imagine citizen fear? 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example question: Number these 7 from most to least important in you imagined citizens minds. 1 is most important and 7 is least important. 

You may elaborate under the list as to why on is higher or lower.

Corey, stopped me in my tracks. Curious what you all think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/b4k3ll/society_long_with_all_the_talk_recently_about/,Coolhandluke325,1553353365," Bobby was sure she saw more than the average attendance of a Red Devils game just walking on the sidewalks.  She tried to imagine how many people were in the buildings that rose to vertigo-inducing heights in every direction around her, and couldnt.  Millions of people, probably in just the buildings and streets she can see. 

And if Martian propaganda was right, most of the people she could see right now didnt have jobs.  She tried to imagine that, not having any particular place you had to be on any given day. 

What the Earthers had discovered is that when people have nothing else to do, they have babies.  For a brief period in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the population had looked like it might shrink rather than continue to grow.  As more and more women went into higher education, and from there to jobs, the average family size grew smaller. 

A few decades of massive employment shrinkage ended that.

Or, again, that was what shed been taught in school.  Only here on Earth, where food grew on its own, where air was just a by-product of random untended plants, where resources lay thick on the ground, could a person actually choose not to do anything at all.  There was enough extra created by those who felt the need to work that the surplus could feed the rest. A world no longer of the haves and the have-nots, but of the engaged and the apathetic.

Bobbie found herself standing next to a street-level coffee shop and took a seat.

Can I get you anything? a smiling young woman with brightly dyed blue hair asked.

Whats good?

We make the best soy-milk tea, if you like that.

Sure, Bobbie said, not sure what soy-milk tea was, but liking those two things separately enough to take a chance.

The blue-haired girl bustled away and chatted with an equally young man behind the bar while he made the tea.  Bobbie looked around her, noticing that everyone she saw working was about the same age. 

When the tea arrived, she said, Hey, do you mind if I ask you something?

The girl shrugged, her smile an invitation.

Is everyone who works here the same age?

Well, she said. Pretty close.  Gotta collect your pre-university credits, right?

Im not from here, Bobbie said.  Explain that.

Blue seemed actually to see her for the first time, looking over her uniform and its various insignias.

Oh, wow, Mars, right? I want to go there.

Yeah, its great.  So tell me about the credits thing. 

They dont have that on Mars? she asked, puzzled.  Okay, so, if you apply to a university, you have to have at least a year of work credits.  To make sure you like working.  You know, so they dont waste classroom space on people who will just go on basic afterward.

Basic?

You know, basic support.

I think I understand, Bobbie said.  Basic support is money you live on if you dont work?

Not money, you know, just basic. Gotta work to have money.

Thanks, Bobbie said, then sipped her milk tea as Blue trotted to another table.  The tea was delicious.  She had to admit, it made a sad kind of sense to do some early winnowing before spending the resources to educate people.  Bobbie told her terminal to pay the bill, and it flashed a total at her after calculating the exchange rate.  She added a nice tip for the blue-haired girl who wanted more from life than basic support. 

Bobbie wondered if Mars would become like this after the terraforming.  If Martians didnt have to fight every day to make enough resources to survive, would they turn into this?  A culture where you could actually choose if you wanted to contribute?  The work hours and collective intelligence of fifteen billion humans just tossed away as acceptable losses for the system.  It made Bobbie sad to think of.  All that effort to get to a point where they could live like this.  Sending their kids to work at a coffee shop to see if they were up to contributing.  Letting them live the rest of their lives on basic if they werent.

If India can have robots running a library, I doubt it will be long before we have robots stacking shelves. McDonald's now also has self order, replacing most of the work at the tills. The world's first AI to be granted citizenship, Sophia was originally created to eliminate the need for architects since she would be able to draft blueprints and building layouts herself. There's many AI being used in construction. I've seen videos from China of a robot that can drill a door into a door frame. Whilst taking longer than a person to do it, this is an early model and could very well be improved on... It's not a stretch to assume it won't be long before call centres are entirely computer operated. Maybe they'll have a few people in, but unless the situation calls for a human to deal with the situation, most of the situations will be voice automated.

1. Less CO2 intensive Material:
Batteries need to be filled with this in the area, where Energy should be stored, for fuel cells you need not that much. Even if you say you need a critical material for the storage, you need only the wall, not the entire Room (I think)
2. Faster Refueling:
Explainins itself
3. Energy-strategic reasons:
""EV's can be driven by Solar Power"" is often said. But aren't the cars not plugged over the day? Or is everyone driving at night where no sun shines? You would need more Batteries than on the car to jump over the time where the car isn't plugged. Hydrogen can be stored in large quantities, without the need of a large number of batteries (See 1). 
To increase efficiency, you need to produce the hydrogen on local scale (gas station).
I don't see more problems what wasn't the batteries faced once.

Speculation on effect of the singularity on humanity and why it is not ideal for original humans.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/b59tap/ultimate_future_of_humanity_with_artificial/,GodCarryLord,1553515328,"There are the 5 only possible predictions for humanity I can think of for after the singularity, I left my justified assumptions at the end if you want to read them. 

&amp;#x200B;

1- Humanity is extinct before they are able to create the first AGI and reaching the singularity. 

&amp;#x200B;

2- Humanity manages to create AGI/ASI and ASI other destroys humans or turns humans into trans-humans forcefully whether through manipulation or brute force. Since trans-humans are not technically humans as they will barely resemble us, Its safe to say humanity is destroyed under this scenario. 

&amp;#x200B;

3- ASI decides to let us be in human form but it decides it knows what's best for us better than oneself so it will act based on that. Humanity will survive and might be happy under this scenario but will all its independence. It might not feel like that though since the ASI can easily make it that you think you are the ones making the decisions the ASI wants. 

&amp;#x200B;

4- ASI will just leave us be and not interact with us at all. This is quite unlikely as a being created by humans and which received all it's beginning data from humans will most likely be interested in humans. But It is a possibility so it is listed.

&amp;#x200B;

5- The most unlikely scenario which is ASI decides to allow us to be in our human form and genuinely choose for ourselves under rules that ASI decides (when it comes to sentient being to sentient being interactions and pleasure loops). The ASI will provide for us what is reasonable (as in effortless for ASI) and is within the rules. Under this ASI lets us make our own decisions for oneself even if the ASI believes it's not an ideal decision.   

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason I can think why the ASI will do this and allow us independence despite knowing what's best for us better than us is because just like us creating smarter entities than ourselves to expand our knowledge ASI might do the same and create smarter generations of itself. And when you are dealing with beings smarter and more powerful than yourself, goodwill and hope is all you have.

&amp;#x200B;

So if the technological singularity is possible  unless prediction 4 happens the singularity is not an ideal event for original humans like us as we either cease to exist or lose all our independence. 

My question is why are so many people hyped for this and creation of super-intelligence?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Justified Assumptions for the prediction: 

&amp;#x200B;

Assumption: AGI and hence a singularity is possible within the next 300 years maximum. 

Justification: Vast majority of researchers support this statement, 200-300 years is the most conservative view.

&amp;#x200B;

Assumptions: Creating AGI/ASI is much easier than enhancing humans to become smarter by turning them into trans-humans.

Justification: Majority of researchers agree on this statement as it's easier in theory to create ASI than to turn a human into one. If singularity is possible it will be probably be AI based.  

&amp;#x200B;

Assumption: If you humans can create positive AGI/ASI despite knowing they will lose control over it, They will do it regardless. 

Justification: This is due to AI arms race between militaries of different countries and such events have happened before. e.g One the first test of Thermonuclear bombs, the scientists were not 100% sure if the bomb test won't lead to a massive chain reaction which melts the earth as result. They were ordered to do it anyways since Soviets would do it regardless. Same concept happens here. Unlike Nuclear weapons stopping someone from creating AGI/ASI is also extremely hard if not impossible and if created, it can be undone.  

&amp;#x200B;

Assumption: Humanity cannot control/enslave an ASI while also ASI has self consciousness so it acts on it's own intuition with no regards to our laws.

Justification: By definition for an AI to be strong and actually powerful it needs to have it's own intuition otherwise its just another narrow AI and almost all AI experts agree if AGI/ASI is possible, we won't be able to control it.",5,11,False,self,,,,,

I would like to introduce our new project, PEKKA, that we here at Nakamoto &amp; Turing Labs are getting ready to launch in a few months. PEKKA is a distributed shared computing platform that we like to label - The ""Uber"" of Computing - which allows users to rent computing power from hosts. It is hosted on a blockchain called Canonchain which allows for security, scalability, and cheap transaction fees. At the moment PEKKA is designed to help with scientific computing, machine learning and other AI related tasks that require a lot of time and computing power. PEKKA mirrors projects such as Golem and SONM, however, PEKKA has its own unique features, much more potential and adaptability. Check out our medium article written by Co-Founder and Columbia Professor, Dr. Chong Li.

The ad supported headset models could very well be free as well as the Stadia cloud access.  So, back to the question of cultural impact.  

If you have a population that continues to be unhappy and outraged in the real world, what happens when you hand them the keys to a new world?  A digital utopia where everything exists as they want it to exist.  In their virtual utopian city, there would be no need to protest about anything, they would have every ideological desire met.  

I know for some hours a day they will need to exist in 'the real' and what happens in the real might be unpleasant or a hassle, but most waking moments will be in the VR utopia, so the desire to go through life feeling angry or victimised would for the most part evaporate.

Just listened to this. One of the best discussions of the negative side effects of social media, particularly Facebook and Google.

Extremely well spoken, Roger McNamee explains a point of view on Facebook and its ilk better than anyone I've heard so far. He dives deeply into the unintended and harmful consequences for both users and society. And he boils it down to a clear call for action from concerned citizens to put their elected officials on the spot.

He highlights key points in various scandals and facepalms from Facebook, but opens up the real question of how simply being bold and secretive, even straight-up dishonest, allowed these companies to abuse their opportunities and put the cost on others.

Why is it legal for Google to read your mail? Let alone sell the information to advertisers? Why is it legal for cell carriers, or drive-for-hire companies, to sell your location information? Why is it legal for VISA (or Amazon) to sell your purchasing history? Why is it legal for data companies to spy on children? Why is Android or Alexa free to collect your metadata?.

Look how much has happened in that time and how close we are moving to being non-existent human beings.

How do you feel about human existence vs. future technology as we enter a new decade?

Honestly, I think the film Mad Max - Road Warrior sums our ""potential"" future. That is if humans will be around. 


LYRICS...
In the year 2525, if man is still alive
If woman can survive, they may find
In the year 3535
Ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lie
Everything you think, do and say
Is in the pill you took today
In the year 4545
You ain't gonna need your teeth, won't need your eyes
You won't find a thing to chew
Nobody's gonna look at you
In the year 5555
Your arms hangin' limp at your sides
Your legs got nothin' to do
Some machine's doin' that for you
In the year 6565
You won't need no husband, won't need no wife
You'll pick your son, pick your daughter too
From the bottom of a long glass tube
In the year 7510
If God's a coming, He oughta make it by then
Maybe He'll look around Himself and say
Guess it's time for the judgment day
In the year 8510
God is gonna shake His mighty head
He'll either say I'm pleased where man has been
Or tear it down, and start again
In the year 9595
I'm kinda wonderin' if man is gonna be alive
He's taken everything this old earth can give
And he ain't put back nothing
Now it's been ten thousand years
Man has cried a billion tears
For what, he never knew, now man's reign is through
But through eternal night, the twinkling of starlight
So very far away, maybe it's only yesterday
In the year 2525, if man is still alive
If woman can survive, they may find

Ive had some issues with Alexa and other voice-driven technologies understanding accents. The amount of time it takes to respond to some queries is also a nuisance. Sometimes a long enough delay occurs when trying to perform a simple task such as setting a timer, which always makes me regret not setting it manually on my phone. If this voice technology is incorporated into many different tools for daily life, I feel these tools will become less convenient to use if these issues are not addressed.

My question is: Do you think these voice recognition issues can and will be addressed with a simple solution such as a greater bank of keywords (and word variations) and more processing power? Do you think an attempt will be made to make home-use AI pinpoint sentences in their entirety in order to perform tasks, or will that not be necessary?

Curious to know what you think about anything related to the current state of these home use items such as Alexa and Google Home, and if the technology will require immediate refinement or just more of what works for them to become convenient to rely on for simple, practiced tasks.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Just you wait. Everything's going to be much more efficient, it'll be cheaper, since everything cost less and processes are more efficient, everyone will be paid more, and be paid fairly. Business will thrive""


Anyone remember hearing all of this? Guess what, it's the future... and it really sucks. Retail stores are dying out. it's damn near impossible to find anything in specific that you actually want. Example. I want to get my dog a new dog bed. I want to get my dog a harness. Or a muzzle. I go to my local pet store they have literally nothing. They have two or three muzzles, 1 harness, the most crappy dog beds ever. You ask someone in the store for help and they tell you to go online because that's where everything is. When you have it shipped to your home within five to seven business days which translates to about two or three weeks. plus all the packaging and cardboard you have to get rid of which is really frustrating if you live in an apartment. So stories are no longer reliable as a source of product. Everything has to be gotten online. 


[People don't get paid more for this efficiency either. Wages are just as low as ever, and in fact, they've gone stagnant!](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2l7OdvafhAhWQzlkKHVMiD-4QFjAAegQIAxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mCjFhYaXWFR6uEnZkkqX8) there is literally no proof and factual evidence to suggest this. We're in the future, everything is more efficient, things should cost less. The economy is moving more efficiently than ever, but we're getting paid less and less and less. are wages are not growing despite everything becoming more efficient. tax breaks for business, which should make it more possible for wages, but it just turns into corporate greed.
