I'm working on a novel and could use some input on one world building aspect. Taking a step passed the ""utopian"" ideals of a decentralized internet, what are some realistic ways that individuals, and more importantly corporations/governments, could take advantage of a universal decentralized internet? The result ideally leads to a situation where a decentralized internet is still better/safer than what we have now, but creates a new problem or issue that society didn't consider initially.

&gt;Efficiency had been forced on Earth with increasing population. Two billion people, three billion, even five billion could be supported by the planet by progressive lowering of the standard of living. 

&gt;When the population reaches eight billion, however, semi-starvation becomes too much like the real thing. A radical change had to take place in mans culture, particularly when it turned out that the Outer Worlds (which had merely been Earths colonies a thousand years before) were tremendously serious in their immigration restrictions. 

&gt;The radical change had been the gradual formation of the Cities over a thousand years of Earths history. Efficiency implied bigness. Even in Medieval times that had been realized, perhaps unconsciously. Home industry gave way to factories and factories to continental industries. 

&gt;Think of the inefficiency of a hundred thousand houses for a hundred thousand families as compared with a hundred-thousand-unit Section; **a book-film collection in each house as compared with a Section film concentrate; independent video for each family as compared with video-piping systems.**

---

It can follow, based on other forms of ""streaming"" that existed at the time (television, radio, elevator music) that you might predict that other forms of media might be eventually streamed as well.

The difference between those forms of media and book and film streaming is the idea of being able to choose which book you are reading and which film you are watching, as opposed to television and radio at the time where one might change the channel, but ultimately you had less control over what you would watch, what time you would watch it, and for how long.

It's always great to look back and see what futurology of the time managed to get right and what it didn't.  I was recently reading this book and was amazed by this so I thought I'd share.",0,0,False,self,,,,,

1. 2.5 million new scientific papers are published each year, about two papers per minute!

2. The global art market represents approximately $50 billion worldwide.

3. Almost 5 billion videos are watched on Youtube every single day!

4. 24,000 songs are uploaded every day and 1 million tracks in six weeks!

*But, What If real owners lose their ownership from any of these things?*

Well, The power of **Blockchain** can help in prospering other industries as well like videos, movies, music, e-books, etc. where piracy and illegal use of contents are damaging the industry, especially to the creators of the contents. Digital information is therefore invaluable. Hence, support in its creation, storage and distribution should reflect that value and safeguard the rights and interests of its true owners.

Digital assets have a direct monetary value. Although, maintaining its integrity and ownership is a huge challenge. It includes fraudery, tampering, duplication and more. However, **Blockchain** provides integrity, make trustless transactions without any central authority.

There is a thing called **Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** in the **Blockchain** industry which is special type of tokens that represents a unique asset. They represent scarce physical property, like cryptokitties, artworks, crafts, virtual houses, etc. Hence, they are non-interchangeable, unique and non-divisible tokens.

To provide the true ownership on blockchain to such digital assets along with creating a marketplace hence can be a great value. But, **NFTs** in itself is indivisible in nature, hence you either own the **NFT** token or you dont. So, what approach can we follow in order to have partial ownership of such digital assets?

To solve this issue, **Quillhash** (An Indian-Singaporean Blockchain development company) is working on **Distributed Non-Fungible Tokens (DNFTs)** standard on **EOS** Blockchain.

It is an open-source standard that could be used for transferring partial ownership of each digital asset.

**Distributed Non Fungible Tokens (DNFTs)** are the **NFT** tokens that meet the following points:

1. Verifiable creation of **NFT** by a validator on **Blockchain**.

2. Allow partial ownership say x% of **NFT** to anyone.

3. It allows real-world marketplace on blockchain.

4. Real % ownership in the form of PER stable tokens on the blockchain.

Every **NFT** is valuable and so is its physical characteristics. Allowing multiple owners to own the **NFT** could be a game-changer!

Fractional ownership of **NFTs** is a major boost to the real estate market, as small investors would now have access to real estate investments without restrictions of huge capitals. **Distributed ownership** also means investors dont have to wait for months or years to earn returns, trading, and transfer of rights can be done on the blockchain platform as soon as it gets verified without any geographical restrictions.

**Fractional ownership**s future in blockchain hence seems to be promising, may it be in **EOS** blockchain or **Ethereum** blockchain. New real-life solutions are upcoming every-day. People like holding shares for long-terms. They see it as a mode of investment that acts as an upcoming market for all.

So, What are your thoughts regarding these new tokens developed by **QuillHash**?

After many crazy ideas and perspectives, I found a valid way to do it.

A system transition mechanism for a much more efficient and fair updated one. And I've been working on itto make it more tangible.

First of all, I am quite sure that this can be done and we can start improving our world to a better place, without chaos and violence, rightnow. And the more I think about it, the clearer this may be the only possible way we can evolve from what we are today to a real civilized society, and sooner or later someone will do.

I know there is no way to change our system overnight, but this project is a perfect transition path for us. We have an outdated system that is unable to effectively manage our resources and quality of life, causes many bad symptoms in our society and we need to update it eventually.

It is very important here to understand that the system is not broken, it was developed like this. So it's not that the current system doesn't work, the problem is that it works very well, and exactly how it was designed to work. This operation that allowed this giant leap in our society. The industrial and technological revolution of our species would not have happened without capitalism. But it is a 19th century system. Totally outdated and unsuitable for today's society. The time has come for us to update. To make this happen, there are many complex issues that some beliefs or thoughts can interfere with, and I want to make it clear that we don't want to defend or attack any belief or creed, but if we are committed to truly solving the problems we have, we need to be factual and cling onto the scientific method, which is, and always has been, our only guide to really improving our lives. Technology is intrinsic to human evolution, from the chair to thesmartphone. All that really changes our lives is technology.


I believe we first need to understand what is going on and where we are, to be ready to think about where we want to go.

Everyone, at one time or another, has wondered why there is so much suffering in the world. Can it be any different? If so, why not? It is well known that we have wealth and goods to eradicate hunger and poverty and we have the resources to give life to the earth for millennia, and we also have the technology to use clean energy around the world, with absolutely no need to burn fossil fuels ever again.

Then again, why isn't it?

We should be exploring the solar system by now, not arguing about the geometry of the earth, global warming and doubting the importance of human rights. Science solves this easily.


Although we have the resources, the technology, and the knowledge to do so, a very important part is still missing: we do not have the necessary human beings. Unfortunately, not inenough numbers. Still.


But how do we solve it? Is there any way? Is it possible to create the necessary humans?


Yes, after much thought, observation, reading and research, I strongly believe that there is a way.

And a very simple one. One that we have been treading throughout human history.

Human beings are forged by the environment that surrounds them. We all have done this a lot. We become who we are by the environment in which we live. This is widely recognized by the academic community.

So we have to create an environment that can create better human beings, and as human beings we do what we do best: we adapt to that environment.

And it's relatively easy to create such an environment. We have many examples now. Excessive consumption, compromise of acquisition, patriotism, racism, competitiveness, intolerance, etc., are created by the environment in which we live.


Modern society has been very productive and we kind of dominate the ""external"" world and yet, we fail to understand the ""internal"" and we are still just a kind of evolved apes that is drastically changing their own environment. We have to stop it. And we can, right now! No wars, no fights, no violence. If we use the current system to create a better one and leave this oneout of date, we can change society forever.


In our current system, the best model of institution we can create that can have the most autonomy and credibility is in the form of a company. They have the structure to produce, the flexibility to obtain licenses to operate in various fields, and people tend not to question the inherent hierarchical order to make it work. There are many effective business models.


The whole process involves numerous details, which would be weeks talking. So, to put it all the way down, this goes something like this:


Let's create a corporation, a group of companies fully committed to being self-sustaining and producing what we need to keep the company going. And we optimize production to be able to market the surplus and provide services to third parties. Creating an income stream far exceeding the inherentcost.


The group is managed by a central body, the Resource Management Center. Each group company produces a product class or provides some service. All complementary and with revenue stream exceeding cost. We will have structure, variety, quality, manpower, research and an absurd revenue stream. It's not only possible, it is relatively easy. This is currently done, but all behind the curtains, benefiting only that 1%.


We live in capitalism, there's no way to avoid these problems now, it's part of our lives, so we dance like music and create a profitable business with commitment to acquisition, market share and so, as a company that wants to get bigger, we will have goals. and clear goals. The small difference is that the wealth generated by the company will be shared by all in the form of goods, services and benefits.


If we delve deeper into the study of the monetary system, we will eventually realize the truth mechanism that governs our current system. I recommend reading Money Modern Mechanics, a booklet prepared by the US Federal Reserve that explains how money is created in our society, a method that is widely used in most federative countries.


And once we understand the true nature of the organizational form of today's society, we are ready to go a step further.


Today we live in the age of modern slavery, this is a fact, not an opinion. The poor and the rich are equally slaves, so arethe institutions and the government as well. So does the black, the white, the man, the woman, the gullible and the atheist. The need for consumption has no prejudice. It is a numerical system designed to preserve itself. But while this is very important, we are not here to talk about it now, perhaps at another time.


So it is natural that we all have this desire to be free and such, but I have to tell you: we are not free and probably never will be.

We live in a gigantic organism and we are all connected to life. Take the bees, we die within years. Put some humans in a forest area, that area's ecosystem will be destroyed within years. We are all united, all races, all kinds of people and animals, all forms of life. It's not that we are never free, the problem is the wrong concept of freedom that we have.

We must celebrate the diversity of our species. There are millions of thoughts and perspectives, millions of ways to do the same thing. The wonder of the human being is the collective of ideas, the only species to do something like this. With that, we could have thousands of ways to solve all the problems we have today.


In our system we will have ""voluntary"" slavery, as ugly as you can say.


The company will provide you with all the goods it produces, a place to live, clean energy services, healthy food and health services, plus a small amount of money and you will provide a portion of your lifetime, few hours a day, few days a week, which is almost as we do now, but better and truthful.


The company will produce what it needs to function and market the surplus. The greater variety of products we produce, the greater variety of products we have.


The main company will be as a management center, as a company that manages smaller companies that produce goods and services. Centralizing all administrative processes in one place and at the same time, production control must be decentralized and managed at the smallest productive hubs because resource management is much more efficient divided into several smaller parts.


Employees may be eligible to become a resident partner of the company, living there without the worry and effort of simply living, being able to be and do whatever they want in their free time. The more people we have, the less lifespan we need to maintain the business.


The structuring of the company must be divided into some stages of growth to ensure its sustainability. From the beginning, we should have a good research and development center.


And the first step is to establish a company that produces organic foods and derivatives. We can use modern techniques to ensure optimal harvesting and ensure that no one in the company is short of food and nutrients. Where we grow, benefit, sell surplus by various means, and even have a buffet and breakfast service in companies and factories to increase revenue flow.


The second step is to build a construction and aggregate business, to provide a good shelter and structure to set up other businesses. And providing services and construction goods to generate revenue.


The third is to manufacture furniture and usable goods. Also selling the surplus.


At every step, we need to do our best good possible,to make it last and update itself, eradicating the programmed obsolescence on the market.

Then we can expand as needed, always mindful of self-sufficiency. We can go from usable electronics to spaceships.


The bigger we get, the more items we produce. The income stream will be much larger than the cost. We can grow in this current system. But that wealth will not be in the hands of the few, as it is today, it will be for the company as a whole.


It is as if we were creating a new society, as they have in the past, but we have easy access to knowledge to find the best way to solve our problems. It is not as utopian as the most conservative may claim. It is relatively simple to achieve.


To ensure that the business grows as it was designed to grow, thus ensuring self-sufficiency, commitment to the planet and social equality, some basic principles must be established and enforced from the outset.


1 - Everything must be designed to be self-sustaining, durable and updatable.

2- Everything produced by us should serve us.

3-Everyone has universal rights and duties.

4-No existing creature is above the collective organism which is the whole.

5- We are all slaves, without exception.

6- No matter the price of any project, if it is for the common good and we have the means and resources, we must do so.

7- No one is obliged to do anything they do not want.

8- There will be no trade within the company, except the one that will change life time.

9- The opening of new vacancies will only occur upon previous increase of production and supply of goods, sufficient to meet current and future demand.

10- Production control should be decentralized, while resource management should be centralized.

11- The composition of the representative council should be random.

12- There will be no propaganda, for or against nothing. This is the only way to truly measure satisfaction data.



And once the principles are upheld, eventually some essential triggers will be triggered, thus creating the environment that will create the necessary humans we so badly need.


Overall quality and durability of the market.


Self-sufficiency inherent in daily life will change the perception of one's relationship with the whole and shed light on the banality of unbridled consumerism.


Self-sufficiency and over-selling will provide a large revenue stream for the company to grow solid.


The perception of belonging to everyday life and the recognition that you depend on the work of others and that others depend on you will increase and develop social feelings such as trust, self-confidence, sympathy and true empathy.


The concept of voluntary slavery, or trading your life time for goods and services, will provide insight into what really matters and the obsolescence of money.


Living life doing what you really want or do best and not having to worry about acceptance and survival will significantly lessen mental disorders.


With confidence and self-esteem being encouraged in the environment in which we live, we will soon be free to develop other instances of social relations, probably eradicating poverty and crime.


The notion of shared wealth and prosperity will significantly reduce harmful social emotions such as envy, self-centeredness and lust.


Just the fact that you can do whatever you want in your free time and be encouraged to know and improve yourself will help free the human mind from doubt and fear.


Clean energy generation, research and development will drive the concept of clean industry, which is the only possible solution for a long and prosperous future.


Creating the best product, built to last and updated, will soon reveal the stupidity of scheduled obsolescenceincreasing the overall quality and durability of products everywhere.


I know this can work. In fact, I think it's the only possible way to get there. If we don't do it now, future generations will have to start something like this at some point. And of course we need a significant amount of money to do that and we will still have a lot of work to do. But only once, if we do it well.

And since someone has to do it, why not us?

We need to raise funds first.

Unfortunately, by myself I can't accumulate enough money in a timely manner for this venture, but I know it's possible if more people embrace this proposal.

If you also believe that we can start changing the world right now, enjoy and share this idea and join me on the Solar page:

If you're not a Buddhist, you are welcomed to post the upcoming/ possible future tech/science and social/ economic/ political changes and let the Buddhists on this sub reply and think of what's the impact towards Buddhism on this? 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureofBuddhismGuild/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureofBuddhismGuild/)

Details:

I was inspired by two institutions: future of life and future of humanity. Both are concerned with how AI will impact our future. Both of course are not concerned with how Buddhism will be impacted. So its up to Buddhists to figure out how to navigate the ever changing future ahead if we wish for the boat of Buddhism to remain afloat braving the oncoming storms.

A simple google shows no Buddhist organizations has been set up yet to just look into the future and present, and to advise the rest of the Buddhist world on how best to react to a certain new development or better yet to proactively preprepare for oncoming changes so that we not only will not be left behind, but come out ahead as world leaders.

One missed opportunity was to warn Buddhist monks about the dangers of smartphones, mobile internet and online free porn. I heard 100,000 monks in Myanmar disrobed after smartphones are out and people actually donate them plus internet access to monks. A preventive step would be to root hack all smartphones to be given to monks to be inaccessible to porn sites and made kids friendly and advice all lay Buddhist to only gift monks these special custom made phones.

Future opportunities and dangers are abound, which the future of Buddhism institute will investigate, come out with a solution or advice and help spread the word.

Here are a few topics off the top of my mind:

1. AI and Buddhism, (robot kapiya, dangers and opportunities)
2. Economic change and Buddhism (how should we tell our governments that monks dont accept money if universal basic income is established and everyone is automatically given digital currency as the income)
3. Space travel and Buddhism: how to modify the not eating at improper times rule on other planets instead of depending on dawn and solar noon. Establishing a Buddhist planet, pros and cons.
4. Using secular Buddhism as a means for the scientifically inclined to come into Buddhism, but ensuring that it doesnt end up replacing Buddhism entirely.
5. Supporting rebirth research, aiming for scientifically prefect standard case of rebirth investigations for all or most future cases, reviewing past cases.
6. Buddhism and gaming, using gaming as an entryway into Buddhism, how to design a Buddhist game.
7. Solution to war, an alternative to weapons development, using the dhamma. As future weapons can be more scary than nuclear, how can we change humanity (other than to convert everyone to become Buddhist or enlightened) to make wars outdated and therefore weapons outdated.
8. Science education for Buddhist Sangha. There exist many diverse background of Buddhist Sangha which may or may not have known proper science, so its good to educate them the correct science (not climate denial, or antivaxx) so that they can have good working knowledge of the world. Especially if they are to represent buddhism in interfaith events, or to attract well educated followers who are new to Buddhism.
9. Vegan for Buddhism, short of making it compulsory, how to continuing promoting veganism to Buddhists until it is no longer an issue for global warming and animal cruelty.
10. Women in Buddhism: to continue to change Buddhism to be fair to women in terms of opportunities and many other stuffs.
11. Future topics group: Any other topic as new technology emerge. To recommend establishing a new department as the field matures to merit it and to retire old departments which are no longer required.
12. Outreach and support group: to outreach to all Buddhist organizations the results of research and get support to fund the institute.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm a *veteran Reddit user*, despite this new account. Also, been a longtime subscriber to Futurology, so I just wanted to voice my concern that this sub is way too climate change focused. It's at the point now where we need some solutions.

I prefer futurology of technology, nanotech, AI, latest biotech, self-driving, new kinds of vehicles etc. I believe my suggestion would see many supporters here, which would increase overall happiness.

There could besome way for this sub's users to filter out CC topics. Perhaps a working pre-programmed query, as a button in the sidebar? I tried bookmarking a search including '-climate change', where the hyphen would theoretically get threads without CC, but Reddit's algorithms are just not advanced enough to include the latest posts from the last few days in reverse chron.

The need for such caution and prudence can be neatly illustrated by the kind of reporting that surrounds robotics and artificial intelligence (Al) and the responses to it on popular discussion forums like Reddit's 'Futurology': on the one hand, there are Redditors who want everything reported in the popular science press about innovations in robotics and Al to be true and accepted uncritically; on the other, there are those who hypercritically disparage any reports of advances in robotics and Al when it comes to them intruding into spheres of action or cognition that they think should be the preserve of humans alone. And lots of those who read the likes of 'Futurology' are well aware that the reporting on robotics and Al is often nothing better than clickbait; nevertheless, threads discussing such reports can descend into flame wars. This is not to say, however, that all the reporting and discussion of robotics and Al is bad; but the online reader should have a thick skin and generous amounts of salt handy. 

Complicating the picture even further is Google and its massive wealth. Ray Kurzweil, the well-known futurist and booster of the Singularity mentioned in the introduction, joined Google in 2012 to work on projects relating to machine leaming and language processing;' since mid-2013, Google has been buying up companies, such as Boston Dynamics and DeepMind Technologies, which specialize in Al and robotics.' Thus, when it comes to discussing robotics and Al in the context of posthumanism, there is a lot of corporate-backed investor-friendly PR to be carefully negotiated. Now, I am not saying that what companies owned by Google claim are simply not to be trusted; what I am saying is, 'Trust, but verify.' There are many, who, like my wife, are disappointed to be still waiting for their jet-packs.""

Today, trusting predictions and prophecies has become part of daily life. From the weather forecast to the time the sat-nav says we will reach our destination, our lives are built around futuristic fictions.*

Of course, while we may sometimes feel betrayed by our local meteorologist, trusting their foresight is a lot more rational than putting the same stock in a TV psychic. This shift toward more evidence-based guesswork came about in the 20th century: futurologists began to see what prediction looked like when based on a scientific understanding of the world, rather than the traditional bases of prophecy (religion, magic, or dream). Genetic modification, space stations, wind power, artificial wombs, video phones, wireless internet, and cyborgs were all foreseen by futurologists from the 1920s and 1930s. Such visions seemed like science fiction when first published.

They all appeared in the brilliant and innovative To-Day and To-Morrow books from the 1920s, which signal the beginning of our modern conception of futurology, in which prophecy gives way to scientific forecasting. This series of over 100 books provided humanity  and science fiction  with key insights and inspiration. Ive been immersed in them for the last few years while writing the first book about these fascinating works  and have found that these pioneering futurologists have a lot to teach us.

In their early responses to the technologies emerging then  aircraft, radio, recording, robotics, television  the writers grasped how those innovations were changing our sense of who we are. And they often gave startlingly canny previews of what was coming next, as in the case of Archibald Low, who in his 1924 book Wireless Possibilities, predicted the mobile phone: In a few years time we shall be able to chat to our friends in an aeroplane and in the streets with the help of a pocket wireless set.

My immersion in these historic visions of the future has also shown me that looking at this collection of sparkling projections can teach us a lot about current prediction attempts, which today are dominated by methodologies claiming scientific rigour, such as horizon scanning, scenario planning and anticipatory governance. Unlike the corporate, bland way in which most of this professional future gazing takes place within government, think-tanks and corporations, the scientists, writers, and experts who wrote these books produced very individual visions.

They were committed to thinking about the future on a scientific basis. But they were also free to imagine futures that would exist for other reasons than corporate or governmental advantage. The resulting books are sometimes fanciful, but their fancy occasionally gets them further than todays more cautious and methodical projections.

Forecasting future discoveries

Take J B S Haldane, the brilliant mathematical geneticist, whose book Daedalus; or: Science and the Future inspired the whole series in 1923. It ranges widely across the sciences, trying to imagine what remained to be done in each.

Haldane thought the main work in physics had been done with the Theory of Relativity and the development of quantum mechanics. The main tasks left seemed to him to be the delivery of better engineering: faster travel and better communications.

Chemistry, too, he saw as likely to be concerned more with practical applications, such as inventing new flavours or developing synthetic food, rather than making theoretical advances. He also realised that alternatives would be needed to fossil fuels and predicted the use of wind power. Most of his predictions have been fulfilled (though were still waiting eagerly for those new flavours, which have to be better than salted caramel).

Its chastening, though, how much even such a clear-sighted and ingenious scientist missed, especially in the future of theoretical physics. He doubted nuclear power would be viable. He couldnt know about future discoveries of new particles leading to radical changes to the model of the atom. Nor, in astronomy, could he see the theoretical prediction of black holes, the theory of the big bang or the discovery of gravitational waves.

But, at the dawn of modern genetics, he saw that biology held some of the most exciting possibilities for future science. He foresaw genetic modification, arguing that: We can already alter animal species to an enormous extent, and it seems only a question of time before we shall be able to apply the same principles to our own. If this sounds like Haldane supported eugenics, its important to note that he was vocally opposed to forced sterilisation, and didnt subscribe to the overtly racist and ableist eugenics movement that was en vogue in America and Germany at the time.

But the development that caught the eye of so many readers was what Haldane called ectogenesis  his term for growing embryos outside the body, in artificial wombs. Many of the other contributors took up the idea, as did other thinkers  the most notable being Haldanes close friend Aldous Huxley, who was to use it in Brave New World, with its human hatcheries cloning the citizens and workers of the future. It was also Haldane who coined the word clone.

Ectogenesis still seems like science fiction. But the reality is getting closer. It was announced in May 2016 that human embryos had been successfully grown in an artificial womb for 13 days  just one day short of the legal limit, prompting an inevitable ethical row. And in April 2017 an artificial womb designed to nurture premature human babies was successfully trialled on sheep. So even that prediction of Haldanes may well be realised soon, perhaps within a century after it was made. Although artificial wombs will probably be used, at first, as a prosthesis to cope with medical emergencies, before they become routine options, on a par with caesareans or surrogacy.

Science, then, was not just science for these writers. It had social and political consequences, as does prediction. Many of the contributors of this series were social progressives, in sexual as well as political matters. Haldane looked forward to the doctor taking over from the priest and science separating sexual pleasure from reproduction. In ectogenesis, he foresaw that women could be relieved of the pain and inconvenience of bearing children. As such, the idea could be seen as a feminist thought experiment  though some feminists might now see it as a male attempt to control womens bodies.

What this reveals is how shrewd these writers were about the controversies and social proclivities of the age. At a time when too many thinkers were seduced by the pseudoscience of eugenics, Haldane was scathing about it. He had better ideas about how humanity might want to transform itself. While most of the scholars musing on eugenics merely supported white supremacy, Haldanes motives suggest hed be delighted at the advent of technologies like CRISPR  a method by which humankind could better itself in ways that mattered, like curing congenital disease.

Alternate futures

Some of To-Day and To-Morrows predictions of technological developments are impressively accurate, such as video phones, space travel to the moon, robotics and air attacks on capital cities. But others are charmingly inaccurate.

Oliver Stewarts 1927 volume, Aeolus or: The Future of the Flying Machine, argued that British craftsmanship would triumph over American mass production. He was excited by autogiros  small aircraft with a propeller for thrust and a freewheeling rotor on top, for which there was a craze at the time. He thought travellers would use those for short-haul flights, transferring for long-haul to flying boats  passenger planes with boat-like bodies that could take off from, and land on, the sea. Flying boats certainly had their vogue for glamorous voyages across the ocean, but disappeared as airliners became bigger and longer range and as more airports were built.

The To-Day and To-Morrow series, like all futurology, is full of such parallel universes. Paths history could well have taken, but didnt. In the rousing 1925 feminist volume Hypatia or: Woman and knowledge, Bertrand Russells wife Dora proposed that women should be paid for household work. Unfortunately, this has not come to pass either.

The film critic Ernest Betts, meanwhile, writes in 1928s Heraclitus; or The Future of films that the film of a hundred years hence, if it is true to itself, will still be silent, but it will be saying more than ever. His timing was terrible, as the first talkie, The Jazz Singer, had just come out. But Bettss vision of films distinctiveness and integrity  the expressive possibilities open to it when it brackets off sound  and of its potential as a universal human language, cutting across different linguistic cultures, remains admirable.

The difficulty with future thinking is to guess which of the forking paths leads to our real future. In most of the books, moments of surprisingly accurate prediction are tangled up with false prophecies. This isnt to say that the accuracy is just a matter of chance. Take another of the most dazzling examples, The World, the Flesh and the Devil by the scientist J D Bernal, one of the great pioneers of molecular biology. This has influenced science fiction writers, including Arthur C Clarke, who called it the most brilliant attempt at scientific prediction ever made.

Bernal sees science as enabling us to transcend limits. He doesnt think we should settle for the status quo if we can imagine something better. He imagines humans needing to explore other worlds and to get them there he imagines the construction of huge life-supporting space stations called bio-spheres, now named after him as Bernal spheres. Imagine the international space station, scaled up to small planet or asteroid size.

Brain in a vat

When Bernal turns to the flesh, things get rather stranger. A lot of the To-Day and To-Morrow writers were interested in how we use technologies as prosthesis, to extend our faculties and abilities through machines. But Bernal takes it much further. First, he thinks about mortality  or more specifically  about the limit of our lifespan. He wonders what science might be able to do to extend it.

In most deaths the person dies because the body fails. So what if the brain could be transferred to a machine host, which could keep it, and therefore the thinking person, alive much longer?

Bernals thought experiment develops the first elaboration of what philosophers now call the brain in a vat hypothesis. Except theyre usually concerned with questions of perception and illusion (if my brain in a vat was sent electrical signals identical to the ones sent by my legs, would I think I was walking? Would I be able to tell the difference?). But Bernal has more pragmatic ends in view. Not only would his Dalek-like machines be able to extend our brain life, theyd be able to extend our capabilities. They would give us stronger limbs and better senses.

Bernal wasnt the first to postulate what wed now call the cyborg. It had already appeared in pulp science fiction a couple of years earlier  talking, believe it or not, about ectogenesis.

But its where Bernal takes the idea next that is so interesting. Like Haldanes, his book is one of the founding texts of transhumanism  the idea that humanity should improve its species. He envisions a small sense organ for detecting wireless frequencies, eyes for infra-red, ultra-violet and X-rays, ears for supersonics, detectors of high and low temperatures, of electrical potential and current.

With that wireless sense Bernal imagined how humanity could be in touch with others, regardless of distance. Even fellow humans across the galaxy in their biospheres could be within reach. And, like several of the series authors, he imagines such interconnection as augmenting human intelligence, of producing what science fiction writers have called a hive mind, or what Haldane calls a super-brain.

Its not AI exactly because its components are natural: individual human brains. And in some ways, coming from Marxist intellectuals like Haldane and Bernal, what theyre imagining is a particular realisation of solidarity. Workers of the world uniting, mentally. Bernal even speculates that if your thoughts could be broadcast direct to other minds in this way, then they would continue to exist even after the individual brain that thought them had died. And so would offer a form of immortality guaranteed by science instead of religion.

Blind spots

But from a modern point of view whats more interesting is how Bernal effectively imagined the world wide web, more than 60 years before its invention by Tim Berners Lee. What neither Bernal, nor any of the To-Day and To-Morrow contributors could imagine, though, was the computers needed to run it  even though they were only about 15 years away when he was writing. And it is these computers that have so ramped up and transformed these early attempts at futurology into the industry it is today.

How can we account for this computer-shaped hole at the centre of so many of these prophecies? It was partly that mechanical or analogue computers such as punched card machines and anti-aircraft gun predictors (which helped gunners aim at rapidly moving targets) had become so good at calculation and information retrieval. So good, in fact, that to the inventor and To-day and To-morrow author H Stafford Hatfield what was needed next was what he called the mechanical brain.

So these thinkers could see that some form of artificial intelligence was required. But even though electronics were developing rapidly, in radios and even televisions, it didnt yet seem obvious  it didnt even seem to occur to people  that if you wanted to make something that functioned more like a brain it would need to be electronic, rather than mechanical or chemical. But that was exactly the moment when neurological experiments by Edgar Adrian and others in Cambridge were beginning to show that what made the human brain tick was actually the electrical impulses that powered the nervous system.

Just 12 years later, in 1940  before the development of the first digital computer, Colossus at Bletchley Park  it was possible for Haldane (again) to see that what he called Machines that Think were beginning to appear, combining electrical and mechanical technologies. In some ways our situation is comparable, as we sit poised just before the next great digital disruption: AI.

Bernals book is a fascinating example of just how far extended future thinking can go. Further than actual science, or science fiction, or philosophy or anything else. But it also shows where it reaches its limits. If we can understand why the To-Day and To-Morrow authors were able to predict biospheres, mobile phones and special effects, but not the computer, the crisis in obesity, or the resurgence of religious fundamentalisms, then maybe we can learn about the blind spots in our own forward vision and horizon scanning.

Beyond the simple wows and comedic effects of these hits and misses, we need more than ever to learn from these past examples about the potential and dangers of future thinking. We would do well to look closely at what might help us to be better futurologists, as well as at what might be blocking our vision.

Yesterday and today

The pairing of scientific knowledge and imagination in these books created something unique  a series of hypotheticals somewhat lodged between futurology and science fiction. It is this sense of hopeful imagination that I think urgently needs to be injected back into todays predictions.

Because computers have transformed contemporary futurology in major ways: especially in terms of where and how it is carried out. As I have mentioned, computer modelling of the future mainly happens in businesses or organisations. Banks and other financial companies want to anticipate shifts in the markets. Retailers need to be aware of trends. Governments need to understand demographic shifts and military threats. Universities want to drill down into the data of these or other fields to try to understand and theorise what is happening.

To do this kind of complex forecasting well, you have to be a fairly large corporation or organisation with adequate resources. The bigger the data, the hungrier the exercise becomes for computing power. You need access to expensive equipment, specialist programmers and technicians. Information that citizens freely offer to companies such as Facebook or Amazon is sold on to other companies for their market research  as many were shocked to discover in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

The main techniques which todays governments and industries use to try to prepare for or predict the future  horizon scanning and scenario planning  are all well and good. They may help us nip wars and financial crashes in the bud  though rather obviously, they dont always get it right either. But as a model for thinking about the future more generally, or for thinking about other aspects of the future, such methods are profoundly reductive.

Theyre all about maintaining the status quo, about risk aversion. Any interesting ideas or innovative speculations that are about anything other than risk avoidance are likely to get pushed aside. The group nature of think-tanks and foresight teams also has a levelling down effect. Future thinking by committee has a tendency to come out in bureaucratese: bland, impersonal, insipid. The opposite of science fiction.

Horizon scanning doesnt tend to produce any particularly exciting ideas. Zhao jiankang/Shutterstock.com

Which is perhaps why science fiction needs to put its imagination in hyperdrive: to boldly go where the civil servants and corporate aparatchiks are too timid to venture. To imagine something different. Some science fiction is profoundly challenging in the sheer otherness of its imagined worlds.

That was the effect of 2001 or Solaris, with their imagining of other forms of intelligence, as humans adapt to life in space. Kim Stanley Robinson takes both ideas further in his novel 2312, imagining humans with implanted quantum computers and different colony cultures as people find ways of living on other planets, building mobile cities to keep out of the suns heat on Mercury, or terraforming planets, even hollowing out asteroids to create new ecologies as art works.

When we compare To-Day and To-Morrow with the kinds of futurology on offer nowadays, whats most striking is how much more optimistic most of the writers were. Even those like Haldane and Vera Brittain (she wrote a superb volume about womens rights in 1929) who had witnessed the horrors of modern technological war, saw technology as being the solution rather than the problem.

Imagined futures nowadays are more likely to be shadowed by risk, by anxieties about catastrophes, whether natural (asteroid collision, mega-tsunami) or man-made (climate change and pollution). The damage industrial capitalism has inflicted on the planet has made technology seem like the enemy now. Certainly, until anyone has any better ideas, and tests them, reducing carbon emissions, energy waste, pollution, and industrial growth seem like our best bets.

Imagining positive change

The only thing that looks likely to convince us to change our ways is the dawning conviction that we have left it too late. That even if we cut emissions to zero now, global warming has almost certainly passed the tipping point and will continue to rise to catastrophic levels regardless of what we do to try to stop it.

That realisation is beginning to generate new ideas about technological solutions  ways of extracting carbon from the atmosphere or of artificially reducing sunlight over the polar ice caps. Such proposals are controversial, attacked as encouragements to carry on with Anthropocene vandalism and expect someone else to clear up our mess.

But they might also show that we are at an impasse in future thinking, and are in danger of losing the ability to imagine positive change. That too is where comparison with earlier attempts to predict the future might be able to help us. They could show us how different societies in different periods have different orientations towards the past or the future.

Where the modernism of the 1920s and 30s was very much oriented towards the future, we are more obsessed with the past, with nostalgia. Ironically, the very digital technology that came with such a futuristic promise is increasingly used in the service of heritage and the archive. Cinematic special effects are more likely to deliver feudal warriors and dragons, rather than rockets and robots.

But if todays futurologists could get back in touch with the imaginative energies of their predecessors, perhaps they would be better equipped to devise a future we could live with.",2,7,False,self,,,,,

With this advanced technology, why can't we make an app that remembers which floor you have parked your car with Altitude measure reading? 

&amp;#x200B;

1. *With the help of Google Map, you detect parking building (if multistory building).*
2. *Calibrate your barometer/Altimeter for your parking structure when using the first time.* 
3. *Each Floor will have a certain range of Altitude readings. So, when car motion stops, you record Altitude and map with the respective floor.*
4. *App notification will remind you which floor have parked your car at 5:00 PM (or given customized alert time)*

I like to think of the future that way: there are gradual forces that will improve things in the long run, and our job is to hold things together as best we can until those forces come into play. Some examples:

Technology versus environmental degradation. Eventually we will develop sustainable, clean energy sources and clean manufacturing. The question is, can we hold off the worst environmental effects long enough for that new technology to come online?

Liberal democracy versus authoritarianism. For much of the 20th century, the US and the UK were the only stable open societies on the planet. They hung on, and democracy is now well established over most, but not all, of the planet. Is that race over?

Knowledge versus religious ignorance. Knowledge is gradually displacing religious ignorance and intolerance, but there are still parts of the worldand parts of the USthat are in the grip of dangerous and unpredictable religious extremism. Will we keep those forces at bay long enough for them to dissipate?

Have a nice read :)


It is clear that the form of computing you have now is not the ultimate stage of the evolution of computer technology. Quantum computing as it is popularly called is a field that has some potential, but it does not have a real potential with the current binary computing system. It is necessary to step up to a more advanced form of computing where you do not have just on and off signals, but a variety of signals of, so to speak, gradations in between on and off. 

You may say, is not it contradictory that something can be both on and off, but the reason why you think so is because scientific inquiry has been based on Aristotelian thinking. Aristotelian logic says that a statement can be *true* or it can be *untrue*, but it cannot be both *true* and *untrue* at the same time. The reality is that this is a very limited perspective because you are creating a system where your understanding of reality has to be reduced to statements that can be answered with a yes or a no, a true or untrue, an on  or off. 

What has created the entire universe with all of the multiplicity you see? Current computing is based on the idea that by combining the two signals - on and off - in a sequence, you can encode all possible information. This is a complete fallacy. You can only encode the kind of information that can be expressed in an *on and off*  **binary mindset**. Nature is not binary. Human Beings do not think naturally in binary system. The universe is not either ""on"" fully in its present state or ""off"". The Big Bang did not instantly manifest the current physical universe. Everything has been an evolution. What is clear is that this has happened through an infinite variety of the combination of various elements that have even evolved over time so that there are more elements today than there were at the time of what scientists call the Big Bang event, not that I am endorsing that particular philosophy and theory.

You need to recognize here that for quantum computing to reach its full  potential, people need to be able to think beyond the binary mindset. There will not be a real breakthrough before these other signals could be defined beyond 0 and 1. Even with classical computing this mindset is limiting current computer development, as an example, by now industry are fully capable to develop a ternary based computer that would be much more natural to humans by having a null (zero) state and 1, 2 - on and off states and much more powerful in sense of efficiency and correctness. There is a demand for null state in programming world, however binary system does not allow naturally it and yet industry insist on continuing to use binary system while no human being programs or solves problems in a binary system nor programming languages designed to be binary in nature and have to find a way to artificially injected the null state, this naturally leads to bugs and broken code. You cannot fit a square into a circle.

There is definitely promise in the quantum technology and there will be some breakthroughs in computing even with current chosen mindset. Computing will not reach its full potential until the current materialistic mindset is transcended by a greater number of scientists, technicians, inventors, economists, politicians and people in general so that they can accept that the universe is not materialistic, is not mechanical in nature, not a closed system, its not black and white. I'm referring to the latest quantum physics discovery that there is a level beyond material realm, level that does not behave mechanically and doesn't work like a physical world around us, its neither off or on, neither energy wave or a particle, there is more to it. The materialistic worldview actually been outdated since Albert Einstein discovered that everything is energy. 

Why is this matters to computing world? Scientists in general are trying to use computers to create simulations of all sorts, trying to analyze the universe mechanically and on top of it fitting it into, using a binary system to give them results that in nature will only be limited and incorrect. They are trying to use atom (or other) as qbit to force it to behave like an ordinary microscopic element, however as quantum physics shown those low level elements do not behave ""normal"" as a wave-particle duality experiment demonstrated. 

If you think about it, really, the current understanding of quantum  physics, which is quite frankly incomplete, but nevertheless the reason why there is a talk of quantum computing and parallel states and all these things is that quantum physics opened up for the possibility that the universe is not mechanical. Isaac Newton brought forth a philosophy that said that the universe was working according to invariable laws so there were no exceptions in the Newtonian worldview. In the quantum worldview there is always the possibility that 99.9% of the time the ball does not pass through the wall but at one point it could happen that the ball passed though the wall. This actually demonstrates to you  that science is at the point where it needs to recognize that if we want to step up to a higher level we need to recognize that the universe is not mechanical in nature.   
 
What does it mean that the universe is not mechanical? What is it that can create this variableness that makes it possible sometimes to go beyond the laws of nature that function most of the time? What is it that could potentially make these laws of nature unnecessary so we transcend them to a higher level? Well, it is precisely *consciousness* as was again demonstrated by ""wave particle"" experiment that consciousness of the scientist does matter, and therefore there comes a point where scientists will have to look at the human brain and how the human brain processes information because it is a much more subtle, much more multifaceted way. This is, again, the key to understanding the future of computing where you encode information not in a binary way but in a much more multifaceted way. 

There are people who are close to breaking through and understanding this and who are able to tune in to these ideas and not think in an old materialistic, mechanical binary way. That is when I think true potential of computing will come to shine. 

I think binary computing been dead as idea long time ago and computer industry should have started ternary computer development since at list 2004, binary meant to be only a short term solution until technology would catch up, and now is a high time to move forward since technology that allows handling it is here. I do not see any point turning quantum computing into something lesser if it has much much more potential, potential that can only be executed by embracing quantum physics discoveries which as I see it no one truly grasp and there for cannot fathom why on Earth qbits can ""communicate"" with each other beyond time and space.

Our pointers towards answers is thus far (remember this is work in progress):

The first one (about AI) is probably the hardest to put into concrete words, as our means of communication is entangled in concepts, mind and AI itself. A first attempt can be found [here](https://youtu.be/hJnxQB_QdsA)

*For the second question* (about UBI) we have been testing a system with communities-within-communities , each one of them having a local currency that decays after some time, and which encourage the users to put forth ideas and projects , or to engage in the ideas and projects of others . Here a [24-doc](http://lemongold.com/NCMvision_english.pdf) describing the system (which is based on an [open source platform](https://github.com/NewCircleMovement/)). Here a [presentation](https://youtu.be/xnRTaZPl4yk) we gave in the danish parliament in 2017

*About the third question* (finding meaning/ purpose) we believe that an individual held in a loving space (either giving this space to him-/herself or from the surrounding community) will automatically start to unfold their inner purpose. Like a flower turning towards the source of light. For the past five years we have successfully tested this with our spiritual fitnesscenter that we call Tinkuy. In Tinkuy a healthy rhythm with morning meditation, yoga and other kinds of bodywork complements creative events like music, dancing and inspirational talks , and this rhythm helps the participants in the community to align with their purpose. The center is driven on normal market terms, without funding, and once the financial solidity of the center has reached a point where it gives a healthy revenue, we will expand these centers to larger cities elsewhere. See [tinkuy.dk](https://tinkuy.dk/) for more info

Curious of your thoughts about this? And we would ofcourse appreciate any help, whether signing up as a supporting member on [NewCircleMovement.org](https://newcirclemovement.org/) (11 USD/ mnt), sharing this information or in other ways ..

For any task, it is crucial to be able to recall the best actions you took at any particular moment. That is, you should be able to recall in your mind, at any given time, all the actions you have taken during a task and how to apply them to the next. It's hard enough for an experienced computer programmer or computer scientist to think of what they want to write in a programming language in their head, and it would be much harder for a neural network. If a neural network gets its memory working, it would be able to write code, and thus do much of what programmers do. In this paper, I present a way to do that with a neural network.

The idea is that, by having the network do its own backtracking to remember where it has been, it would be able to learn from its mistakes. This would let them do things like play chess or improve their programming skills. In fact, we could see a future in which all AI development would happen in this way. it can now perform some functions, and can become a neural network, a program that executes on a computer.  I call this idea 'the memory paradox'.

This is not to say that the memory paradox is a proof of the correctness of AI or anything like that. It's not that the memory paradox has something to do with the correctness of AI. The memory paradox shows that a machine-like neural network, which learns what it does and remembers its experiences, could be a program that executes on a computer. It would be a program that knows how to code itself. The neural net would also understand that programming is a process of finding the best program and then learning how to implement it.

So it's not surprising that the neural net would recognize the memory paradox in a particular example. But that would have no bearing on whether AI was correct or not. The memory paradox is simply a demonstration that the neural net doesn't understand how programming is supposed to work.

That was a long answer, so I'll try to wrap this up quickly. Here are my answers to the most common objections to AI:

""This isn't real AI.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote this by feeding in prompts to the talk to transformer..  The first prompt I started with was:  
""The greatest prompt would be something that fuels the neural network. The prompt would lead it to create a new theory or invent something not invented. The greatest prompt is this: ""

**RESPONSE:**

""Where is all of this coming from?""

But what if the greatest prompt was the greatest problem?

The Greatest Problem

You are a computer program. You have been programmed to run on a computer system called a neuron.

You have a problem.

You are the best.

You are the fastest.

You are the most intelligent.

You are the most beautiful.

You are the best at anything.

You are the best at anything.

What do you do when you are the greatest?

You are going to go out and solve the greatest problem there is,

""Where is all of this coming from?""

That's the great question.

But the neural network is not

&amp;#x200B;

So I took the networks advice, and my next prompt was:  
""The Greatest Problem facing neural networks today""

If a neural network gets its memory working, it would be able to write code, and thus do much of what programmers do. In this paper, I present a way to do that with a neural network.

The idea is that, by having the network do its own backtracking to remember where it has been, it would be able to learn from its mistakes. This would let them do things like play chess or improve their programming skills. In fact, we could see a future in which all AI development would happen in this way. it can now perform some functions, and can become a neural network, a program that executes on a computer. I call this idea 'the memory paradox'.

This is not to say that the memory paradox is a proof of the correctness of AI or anything like that. It's not that the memory paradox has something to do with the correctness of AI. The memory paradox shows that a machine-like neural network, which learns what it does and remembers its experiences, could be a program that executes on a computer. It would be a program that knows how to code itself. The neural net would also understand that programming is a process of finding the best program and then learning how to implement it.

So it's not surprising that the neural net would recognize the memory paradox in a particular example. But that would have no bearing on whether AI was correct or not. The memory paradox is simply a demonstration that the neural net doesn't understand how programming is supposed to work.

That was a long answer, so I'll try to wrap this up quickly. Here are my answers to the most common objections to AI:

""This isn't real AI.""

I wrote this by feeding in prompts to the talk to transformer.. The first prompt I started with was:
""The greatest prompt would be something that fuels the neural network. The prompt would lead it to create a new theory or invent something not invented. The greatest prompt is this: ""

RESPONSE:

""Where is all of this coming from?""

But what if the greatest prompt was the greatest problem?

The Greatest Problem

You are a computer program. You have been programmed to run on a computer system called a neuron.

You have a problem.

You are the best.

You are the fastest.

You are the most intelligent.

You are the most beautiful.

You are the best at anything.

You are the best at anything.

What do you do when you are the greatest?

You are going to go out and solve the greatest problem there is,

""Where is all of this coming from?""

That's the great question.

But the neural network is not

So I took the networks advice, and my next prompt was:
""The Greatest Problem facing neural networks today""

The response is the beginning of this post.... Is this it?",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Sandel, genetically enhancing a child violates the ethics of giftedness as well as eliminates lifes challenges. I personally believe that pursuing genetic enhancement would be messing with something that isnt broken. It takes away the struggle associated with being born with flaws, as well as the satisfaction and gratitude related to overcoming challenges. In my opinion, there is no need for enhancement.

Enhancement also places a strain on the parent-child relationship because parents are hand picking their childrens traits instead of leaving it to nature. Subsequently, children can then blame their parents for the traits they possess or rather do not possess. By trying to enhance their children to be born without flaws, they are misleading them and giving them a false perception of reality. Life is unpredictable and by giving children the mindset that everything comes easily through genetic enhancement, I think that parents are setting them up for failure.

Sandel states that you choose your husband and friends based on qualities you find attractive. Sandel makes this point to stress that you do not choose your children. A childs qualities are unpredictable, but I think it is important that parents still love their kids unconditionally. The purpose of parenting is to guide your children in the right direction, but also being able to step back and let them make choices on their own. A very fine line must be drawn between coddling and neglect.

Furthermore, enhancement minimizes or even eliminates lifes struggles. With everything coming to these children so easily, they are unable to recognize struggle. This diminishes the basis of meritocracy in the grand scheme of things because people are no longer working hard to succeed. While it did not involve genetic enhancement, the 2019 college admissions scandal involving Lori Loughlin is an example of the public backlash against parents who act as lawnmowers and remove obstacles for their children, no matter what the cost to the parents, to the child, or to society.

Moreover, if every child becomes enhanced, then the status quo will be raised and those who used to be gifted will become average. As a result, those who have less money will be unable to enhance their children which will perpetuate the cycle of poverty. As things are today, if a kid is really good at football or exceptionally smart, they can get a scholarship and escape poverty through their giftedness. However, if enhancement makes these kids average, they will never escape the poverty cycle because an enhanced kid will always be better than them. Also, with parents desire for mastery and trying to pick their kids traits rather than accepting them we get into issues of conditional love. They love their kid because they picked out all their characteristics which, in conclusion, is not morally permissible. Therefore, to avoid all the previously stated issues, it is my opinion that genetic enhancement should not be made readily available to the general public, as it is not morally permissible.",16,1,False,self,,,,,

It's likely that within 30 years, technology will allow female couples to have their own biological children without any DNA from a man. At this point men will become unnecessary for the survival of the human race. Men and women are sufficiently different as to be almost like different species with only the fact that we need each other preventing one sex from wiping out the other. When women no longer need men to survive, only one outcome is possible - the eradication of men. Within 50 years, no more males will be born.

Immortality:

Anti-aging technology will soon be possible (20 years) but will never be used. No-one will accept it being available to some and not others and if it's available to all then there would not be enough room on Earth for an unbounded increase in population from children being born. And since no-one would want to live in a world without children, anti-aging tech will be banned and enforced with worldwide laws and treaties.

AI:

Unlike in the movies, we will never be silly enough to build an AI that we are not fully in control of or that could put at risk our own survival. The tech singularity will occur within 40 years but it will not be unbounded. Once we have the AI sufficient to achieve what we want, further increase will be unnecessary. It will be able to answer our questions up to the point where we no longer wish to hear the answers.

Its not a particularly arduous task, though you will need to devote a minimum of 90 minutes per month to it. If you are already spending that much time surveying the comments section, then you can moderate at the same time as you are reading the comments.

Our mission is to be the leading place for intelligent, insightful and  informed discussion about the many scenarios that may make up the future. Your primary duty as a Comment Mod is to help make this happen. In practice your role will primarily be editorial and aimed at making the comments section a worthwhile experience for other readers.

The primary part of the job is removing irrelevant comments that are off-topic &amp; low quality. Less often youll need to remove comments that are hostile &amp; disrespectful to other commenters.

The recent fuss over ""we only have twelve years"" is an attempt to avoid warming over about 1.5 degrees centigrade. That probably won't happen.  That means we will probably trigger a few things like Antarctic and Greenland ice melting and Siberian release of methane which will further increase global warming.  But it's not going to happen right away.  It's not going to happen in 12 years.  It is a long long gradual process screwing us all badly over centuries and if we don't fix it in 12 years, (and we won't), a certain level of bad is locked in even if we reduce C02 emissions to zero (unless we also find a way to suck CO2 out of the air).  So good luck with that future generations.

Insect Apocalypse is more like the old Ozone layer problem.  It's an easy fix in the short term, which is just as well because it could really do serious damage in that kill millions of people sort of way, within a few decades.  But it's a super easy fix.

Currently, systems of invitro fertization and chronic villous sampling are being used to determine the healthiest embryos for pregnancy as well as offer information on diseases that can allow a pregnant woman to consider abortion at her own discretion. While these current methods do not enhance the embryos, but simply treat pre-existing conditions, similar technology may soon be used for genetically enhancing our offspring. Because of this, it is urgent to consider the potential negative effects and repercussions genetic enhancements can have on our society as a whole- before it becomes accessible to the public.

I argue that the use of genetic enhancements is not morally permissible because of its potential to have overwhelmingly negative effects on our society as a whole.

While genetic enhancements may benefit the child who receives the enhancement, it usurps our ability to have human solidarity. Society will soon become divided between those who are enhanced and those who are not. Today, society aims at reducing divisions between people by equalizing opportunity (current examples include affirmative action regulations), but there is no doubt that genetic enhancements will create a divide between those who are born with a greater opportunity (those who are enhanced) and those we are not.

In addition to this, genetic enhancements are likely to lead to great conflict and war. Not considering the internal conflict created within a country that utilizes genetic enhancements, they are likely to be used as weaponry for countries. Countries will begin to utilize genetic enhancements to create the most desirable population for their needs- it will become a genetic arms race.

Use of genetic enhancements will create unforeseen problems for society; we will no longer be able to blame such problems on nature or circumstance, but only on ourselves. All resulting problems (potential health problems, societal problems, etc) will be of our own creation. It is urgently necessary that we weigh the needs of our society as a whole against the desire of the few- because of this it is clear that the use of genetic enhancements is not morally permissible.",9,1,False,self,,,,,

Given our technology, I think if we put our minds to it we can easily find ways to accommodate the entire world eating an American diet. I'm more concerned with what natural resource limitations we have that cannot be solved by new technologies or at least that we don't necessarily foresee solving anytime soon. Personally, I'm thinking its something along the lines of rare earth metals or silicon to create enough computers/phones/chips for the entire world or limitations to the amount of the sun's energy we could harvest due to limitations to materials needed for solar panels.

The technology works by using machine learning to predict the next word in the sentence. 

What I've been spending a lot of time thinking about lately is the future versions of GPT-2 (i.e. GPT-3, GPT-5, GPT-10) and what exactly could be changed or improved to optimize for certain goals. I am absolutely just a layman who knows very little about machine learning. I just know the very, very basics. So take everything I say speculate upon in this post with a grain of salt. I'm just an imaginative noob at best. With that qualification out of the way, I do think it may be possible to create something strongly resembling an Oracle-style AGI with future versions of GPT-2, with some modifications.

This is what I have in mind:

* Of course adding more data. Each successive version of GPT adds more data, and gets better and more human every time they do it. Right now it has about 40GB of raw text data to work with.
* Adding in a system to verify facts. Right now, GPT-2 will say things like ""the fire is lit underwater"" (a specific example pointed out by the researchers) which is obviously contradictory to reality, even if it's a proper usage of language. Additionally, it could say things that ""look"" right but are just factually wrong, i.e. ""Researchers discovered today that gene ABC123 makes one more vulnerable to HIV."" If we could take the output of GPT-2 and run it through another neural network that can actually verify and even correct the factual accuracy of certain statements (by cross referencing it with the news, Google, scientific studies, and so on) then we'd have something very, very powerful.
* Adding in a conversational system. Allow future versions of GPT-2 to act as agents. They already have capable to mimic conversations, so allow user input for one side of the conversation, and you now have a system that you can query. Combine that with the other two things I've mentioned, and now you have an Oracle-type AGI which, while not capable of actually going out in the world and doing tasks, would be able to query all available human knowledge and have discussions about it with anyone at any time for virtually free. Imagine the benefit to society this could have. You could ask it, ""what's the state of the art research on neuroscience"" and it could tell you exactly what's cutting edge.  

Combine all of those things, and you basically would have an Oracle. I could easily see something like this existing within 10 years, maybe even 5. Which is much, much sooner than I would have expected an Oracle to be feasible. Once we actually have an oracle, I don't think we're actually that far from having a human level AGI that can actually interact with the world and do what we ask of it. Maybe another decade or two at the most after the Oracle. 

So what do you guys think? Any ideas? Anything GPT-3, GPT-5, etc. could add in to make it far superior to what it's capable of today? Any criticisms of my ideas or anything that's not scientifically accurate or otherwise misleading? Let me know.",6,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm pretty sure it has to, but I can't find anything definitive about this. (I'm guessing the effect is too small to be really useful for anything) Then I stumbled upon the fact that salt is far easier for a neutron to get activated by. I'm wondering if you had a big enough body of water, which you would the bombard with neutrons over a certain period of time if the combined nuclear reactions occurring in the water might create enough heat to create a self sustained reaction due to neutron activation of all the different elements in the sea water. I read just recently that they have had a breakthrough in terms of creating miniature neutron sources. I seem to recall that they were pretty energy efficient as well.

I'm wondering if anyone knows if this sort of experiment has been done before. I'm also wondering if we could process our nuclear waste / weapons to create such reactors.

I've seen pretty much all of the game competitions of AI v. human and I've seen a consistent fact that has reflected everything that we've seen. AI can become so smart that it starts to do really weird things. For instance, Alpha-go, when doing a match with a master made a move that, at the time, ended up being pivotal for the AI the game. At first people saw it was a mistake but it turned out that the AI had learned some quirk that humans hadn't yet learned. It was thinking almost on another level. Another example was the hide and seek game although it was a bit less amazing. The seeker learned to glide onto a square block and glide its way to the hider's fort and catch them. This was interesting because it also demonstrated a superior strategy that was able to give the seekers an advantage. The last example was the recent Starcraft game and how the AI did a few things out of normal routine. The normal procedure at the start of the game is to wall of the entrance to your base, but the AI didn't do this, it actually built more workers and focused on resources. This was a winning strategy even though it at first seemed quite dumb. We can see either 2 things here. Either that humans haven't experimented enough to learn these interesting ideas, or AI is becoming so smart that its decisions are becoming too complex for us to understand. Both seem likely but I'm biased towards the latter option. Can people also provide other examples that either prove/disprove of this hypothesis? I'm really interested in the 4-D chess game that AI is playing with us.",10,1,False,self,,,,,

Serious.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/dxn5iv/can_we_discuss_what_were_going_to_use_for_money/,JimMarch,1574000839,"So let's say we have three things that can sit on a kitchen table, all working.  For round numbers let's say it is 40 years from now.

One is a 3D printer that can print anything found in a Walmart today, including the grocery section, the pharmacy section, the electronics section and the clothes section.  Oh, and the gun section complete with ammo.  Basically a molecular level 3D printer.  Let's also say that there is no government control on this bad boy, it cannot be remotely locked in terms of what it can or cannot print...reason being, it can print another of itself or any of the other two devices we're going to talk about there for a hacked ""zero restriction"" version will appear more or less immediately.  Yes, there's a lot of change that comes out of a box like this but for now let's focus on economics.

Second device is a scanner, it analyzes whatever you stick in it so that the printer can make a copy.  Theoretically, not everybody needs one because maybe all you need to do is download designs from the internet.

3rd device is what I'm calling a smelter.  It can take in raw materials from pretty much any kind of scrap source and refine it down into stuff usable for the printer.  Scrap metal, shovels of dirt, dead leaves for carbon, toilet water or sea water, whatever.  It puts out either blocks or tanks of liquid or solid material or even gasses I guess that can be plugged into the 3D printer which will tell you what it's out of for any particular print job.

The 3D printer can print out any of these three, along with things like solar panels and batteries and everything else you need to get the infrastructure to run these set up.

Once you have a set of this shit, as do all of your friends and everybody you've ever met, *everything to do with economics changes.*

Right?

So what kind of economic system do we set up?  Serious question.

It looks to me like the only thing that would actually have value left is the value of labor.  So tracking who did what for who would be what passes for money?  And we could do something like blockchain to securely track it without forgeries because obviously forging something like cash would be simple.

The biggest question I have is, if money is tied to labor, where does new money come from?  if you do work for the government of some kind, maybe the government gives you labor bucks or whatever we're calling it which in turn creates that money, and then that money can be spent with others?

But unfortunately topics like this seem to always veer toward people talking about how the global poor supposedly are ""overpopulating"" the Earth and their needs to be a solution, sometimes even a final solution. But eco-fascism aside the true issue isn't the actual amount of humans it's the consumption and waste habits of the global wealthy causing most of the damage. On a per capita basis and even overall pollution the poor nations actually have a much smaller carbon footprint.

&gt;It is well known that Americans consume far more natural resources and live much less sustainably than people from any other large country of the world. A child born in the United States will create thirteen times as much ecological damage over the course of his or her lifetime than a child born in Brazil, reports the Sierra Clubs Dave Tilford, adding that the average American will drain as many resources as 35 natives of India and consume 53 times more goods and services than someone from China.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tilford cites a litany of sobering statistics showing just how profligate Americans have been in using and abusing natural resources. For example, between 1900 and 1989 U.S. population tripled while its use of raw materials grew by a factor of 17. With less than 5 percent of world population, the U.S. uses one-third of the worlds paper, a quarter of the worlds oil, 23 percent of the coal, 27 percent of the aluminum, and 19 percent of the copper, he reports. Our per capita use of energy, metals, minerals, forest products, fish, grains, meat, and even fresh water dwarfs that of people living in the developing world.  
&gt;  
&gt;He adds that the U.S. ranks highest in most consumer categories by a considerable margin, even among industrial nations. To wit, American fossil fuel consumption is double that of the average resident of Great Britain and two and a half times that of the average Japanese. Meanwhile, Americans account for only five percent of the worlds population but create half of the globes solid waste.  
&gt;  
&gt;Americans love of the private automobile constitutes a large part of their poor ranking. The National Geographic Societys annual Greendex analysis of global consumption habits finds that Americans are least likely of all people to use public transportationonly seven percent make use of transit options for daily commuting. Likewise, only one in three Americans walks or bikes to their destinations, as opposed to three-quarters of Chinese. While China is becoming the worlds leader in total consumption of some commodities (coal, copper, etc.), the U.S. remains the per capita consumption leader for most resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, National Geographics Greendex found that American consumers rank last of 17 countries surveyed in regard to sustainable behavior. Furthermore, the study found that U.S. consumers are among the least likely to feel guilty about the impact they have on the environment, yet they are near to top of the list in believing that individual choices could make a difference.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paradoxically, those with the lightest environmental footprint are also the most likely to feel both guilty and disempowered. In what may be a major disconnect between perception and behavior, the study also shows that consumers who feel the guiltiest about their impactthose in China, India and Brazilactually lead the pack in sustainable consumer choices, says National Geographics Terry Garcia, who coordinates the annual Greendex study. Thats despite Chinese and Indian consumers also being among the least confident that individual action can help the environment.  
&gt;  
&gt;On average, one American consumes as much energy as  
&gt;  
&gt;2 Japanese  
&gt;  
&gt;6 Mexicans  
&gt;  
&gt;13 Chinese  
&gt;  
&gt;31 Indians  
&gt;  
&gt;128 Bangladeshis  
&gt;  
&gt;307 Tanzanians  
&gt;  
&gt;370 Ethiopians  
&gt;  
&gt;The average American individual daily consumption of water is 159 gallons, while more than half the world's population lives on 25 gallons.  
&gt;  
&gt;Americans eat 815 billion calories of food each day - that's roughly 200 billion more than needed - enough to feed 80 million people.  
&gt;  
&gt;Americans throw out 200,000 tons of edible food daily. While 250 million people have died of hunger-related causes in the past quarter-century roughly 10 million each year (that just shows that Americans dont really care about ""famines"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Each person in the industrialized world uses as much commercial energy as 10 people in the developing world. The poorest 10% accounted for just 0.5% and the wealthiest 10% accounted for 59% of all the consumption.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why are we focusing on the United States? Because it consumes far more energy than any other country -- more than China and Russia put together. Just five percent of the world's population consumes 23% of its energy! That's really extravagant! Imagine if you wasted five times more gasoline as your neighbors... or five times more food... or produced five times more garbage. Your neighbors wouldn't be very happy! Yet, that's what we're doing.  
&gt;  
&gt;How much energy does the average American consume? Well, if you list the countries of the world in order by their population (as we've done in the graph above), the U.S. comes in third... but the combined energy consumption of the other five largest added together doesn't match U.S. energy consumption! In other words, the 5% of the world's population that lives in the U.S. has more environmental impact than the 51% that live in the other five largest countries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Next time you hear about a woman in India who has seven children, remember that she'd have to have more than 20 children to match the impact of an American woman with just one child. And an immigrant who moves to the U.S. is likely to consume far more energy just by moving here. Even if he scrimps and saves energy at home, every thing he buys will increase consumption of energy and other resources.

Have you ever heard of brave browser? If not, I recommend you to have look on it ([https://brave.com/aur020](https://brave.com/aur020)). It is a new browser founded by Brendan Eich (founder of JavaScript and Mozilla Firefox) with a very interesting approach to pay its users for the data they provide to the browser provider. Something that google should have introduced already but they didnt. More specifically it means, that you have the possibility to view ads and get 70% of the money the advertiser pays to brave yourself. You receive BAT tokens for any ad you view.   
 BAT is a cryptocurrency, tradable on all major exchanges with a current USD price of around 20 cent.   
 For me this is not only interesting because you can earn money from your data, it is also very interesting because BAT is a relatively young cryptocurrency with a big potential for the future. So there is a big possibility that the value of BAT will increase in the future, which means that your earned coins will be worth much more in a few years if you keep them. And because you start early, you will get much more BATs for an ad now than youll get in the future (because the payout per ad is calculated in USD, and BAT/USD is currently on a relatively low level). To those who think this is a scam I have to say, that brave is a very trustful company founded, as already mentioned, by Brendan Eich who is known for founding the programming language JavaScript and the popular browser Mozilla Firefox. Brave is also backed by a lot of famous investors and funds such as Founders Fund which is known for its billionaire owner Peter Thiel (co-founder of Paypal). Furthermore they are featured in many famous and popular newspapers such as New York Times, Forbes etc.  
 Only, for now it is only possible to use your BATs to reward content creators or withdraw it and sell it for USD or any currency you want. But according to Brave it will soon also be possible to use your BATs for subscriptions, discounts etc.

You may ask yourself, why I am posting this here. Well there are two major reasons.   
 

1. I also got this information from somebody else and Im so excited about this possibility, that I would like to share it, I see no reason for not doing so.

2. I have a Brave referral link and profit from any sign up through that link. So if you decide to download the brave browser I would be very, very thankful if you could use my link so we have a win/win situation  .  
 In addition **you also get 30 BAT** just for downloading Brave Browser (As long they arent already claimed).

However im left with some confusion. If the robot has AI and can be fed data, isnt it like a child? Like all humans, we're given information in which we store, and then use that information to make certain chooses

Like if a robot was hungry it would have to eat, while a human could choose to skip lunch because they are found something more important. Then I go back to thinking, well if the robot was told it was important, it to could choose to skip lunch.

The only thing I can really think of, is that a human has many people telling them what to do or how to think. However humans can choose which person to listen to. They dont have to follow one person or a popular opinion, but they form their own idea, even one that is original.

I'd really like someone to explain what a AI robot is really limited by, and what makes them any different than human children.",3,3,False,self,,,,,

Firstly, should I be aiming for academia (since there is still a lot of research to be done) or industry (since developing the product itself will be a matter of pure development/engineering, which I don't think happens in academia)?

I think that we're seeing the birth of something vaguely resembling a collective intelligence. A few random observations have led me to this conclusion:

1) It has focus. Have you noticed how it focuses on one idea or another? Today I see that Reddit is concerned with US parents treating their children differently after they've turned 18 (forcing to pay rent, kicking them out, you know it better than I do). ""Yesterday"" it was entertaining  itself with black holes or quantum physics. ""Tomorrow"" it's gonna ""think"" about something else. 

2) It can be distracted. E.g. many redditors are forcing the child Yoda meme, literally thousands of them. Then cats. Then dogs. Then anime. And then you notice the focus jumping between 2-3 topics.

3) It has fixation - e.g. on Bernie Sanders, Andrew Yang; anti-Trump, Epstein didn't kill himself, wealth inequality, etc. 

Lots more examples, and the lowest level is thoughts. Thoughts are created from individual posts. And posts are a reaction to external stimuli which are experienced by its senses - the redditors.

To me it's like witnessing evolution, pretty cool. And mind you, this does not make Reddit itself any different from what it is or better. It's just a platform that maybe has the right set of features to be a testbed for a collective intelligence prototype.

What do you guys think about this? Makes sense?",13,1,False,self,,,,,

The incentive for early shop adopters would be, that cherry central pays 10% interest on cherry savings. Not convinced? Ok, lets say 50% interest on  savings.

I am WAY out of my area of expertise on this so apologies if I need an ELI5 in my particular case. That said - what I'm wondering, given all of the late stage capitalism discussions happening on Reddit and in the media, is if there is some sort of ideal ratio that helps ensure the super rich are making a significant enough tax contribution so the rest of their society sees quality of life improvements as a result. 

I guess what I'm asking is what is the ideal economic scenario/ratios in a ""healthy"" capitalism model?

The reason why I'm asking is I have never once heard it openly discussed in any kind of political debate/campaign and I'm trying to figure out why there isn't a transparent and attainable target in the general public discourse? If there isn't one, why not? If there is one, why are we not talking more about it?

I was raised by two immigrant factory workers that spent 35+ years working on assembly lines, one of which being forced into retirement due to a shift in production means. Growing up in the earliest days of digital tech, I feel my understanding of tech is more of a hybrid Gen Y and Z (even though I'm technicaly Gen Y) but have been drawn heavily toward tech and digital advancements since a very young age (I was the only one in the family that knew how to program the VCR by like age 5 lol) 

Needless to say, this topic has become unavoidable for me given my upbringing. I can see a great deal of the positives and negatives as well as everything that could arise from the middle ground. However, I am only one person with one perspective. This is where you folks come in and I hope that you'll share any stories or perspectives relative to the topic, with me.

I've spent countless hours staying up later than I should, reading any comment chain I come across when this topic comes up in the sub and I couldnt think of a better place to ask. All I ask is that if debate arises, please don't be insulting to eachother. Let's keep this about potential outcomes based on the factors at hand. I want this to breakdown in the most direct way possible while also potentially providing ideas to curb any major negative outcomes such as significant job loss (beyond attempts at job placement or retraining).

**About the doc**: it will discuss automation at its current state, potential for the future, and its relationship with the laborforce/jobs market. It will also have potential scenarios of tech or services that may be created to facilitate new trends as transitions happen based on recent examples of transitioning tech.

The primary focus will be on the different perspectives and how changes may or may not effect the trucking industry in the future while comparing it to the trends of manufacturing from the past and current state. It will also touch upon other industries such as my own: digital production, where many systems are becoming automated and is, well, unavoidable to keep up with demand. Having worked within a 24-hour news environment, I've seen how systems are losing people and gaining what is basically quality assurance engineers that just need to make sure the system doesnt stop doing what it needs to do.

**This is 100% a labor of love project** that I'll be creating via my small digital production company (it's basically me and 2 other people) with no outside financial contributions (and **no, I'm not asking for any money or funding**) but will dedicate every spare second that I can to it. I hope to have it done for a launch in late spring of 2020. With that, thank you all for your time and potential contribution! Any user perspectives that are contributed to the final production will have credits, if desired. In which case, I will reach out to you and ask your preferences on that.

Again, thank you all for your time! Much love, and here's to a hopeful future *(cheers)*.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

My question is, can we be confident that an AGI could self improve much faster than us? Why would it also not be subject to our limitations, eg learning the wrong lessons about things, getting caught up in beautiful theories that turn out to be untruths, etc. These dead ends would badly hamper the linear or expontential growth path we often assume an AGI would take to suddenly become superintelligent. 

If you argue that an AGI could still beat us in a specific domain, sure, but that is hybridizing AGI with a specialist narrow role, eg a human level general AI that is a fantastic Go player. I do not think that such a being would be powerful enough to suddenly write a unified theory of everything, or outsmart everyone to take over the global economy or the world. 

If you guys disagree please feel free. At some level I feel that we may be curb fitting the concepts of self learning improvement to a higher quality ability to think in the abstract without limits when that doesn't even appear to be the case with our own geniuses (just look at their hairstyles. Seems one form of intelligence may conflict and inhibit others).",7,1,False,self,,,,,

I would put politics down to a point based system. I call this play to win for lack of a better word. 

For example their is an establishment of a House of debate any citizen with the intent or interest in politics has to attend an examination Center to test for basic levels of competence and pureness of character i.e no Machiavellian traits (Pyschopathy, Sociopathy, Sadism) once youve passed and shown that you are who you say you are and a member of the society you get a card or imprint with 0 points on it. This is all done by AI systems.

To gain points you have to attend the house of debate and give your opinion any opinion is valid and their is no censorship on opinion. The more you interact with political issues the more points you get you need 50 points to vote for example, a politician in power also has points and they can loose these points by breaking the rules, not attending debates and not following up on promises or visiting sectors/counties of the country i.e if you say your going to push for more solar power and you sit around collecting the wage you lose points.

To become a politician of higher decision making you need to have been on a panel of experts people with lots of points and be voted in by those panel lets say 10 to a panel and only one can progress 

Any attempt at corruption, subverting the rules, lying or lobbying will result in a confiscation of your card/device. It being levelled to 0 and a 5 year ban for politics and a life ban on getting to the panel of experts

The decision making also is different if the president wants to have military action for example he has to pass a quadruple lock which means he has to present the idea to the house of debate for debate, pass a 60% approval rate on the voting system, get a military focused expert to sign off on it and everyone including himself and the people who signed it must digitally signature appear on the bill so that it is never unclear who caused that action.
 
 Decisions also must happen within 2 months or the bill is scrapped and cannot be revisited in that presidents term so they must satisfy all locks under time pressure.

The card has no influence on normal life i.e promotions at work, skipping the queue any attempt to also use the points in the social world results in the above penalty. 

This stops people who dont get involved in politics or understanding political issues from having an opinion, it exposes people too debate that are one sided and it would probably be the best stop at corruption.

People can host a vote against the president or any other member for reduction of points if they get over 30 signees and it is a valid reason and not an attempt to reduce points for Machiavellian reasons. This would of course result in the above penalty for the person and the 30 signees

You can also rapidly advance points by engaging in debate in front of the house the winner gains points and the loser loses them, the public and panel of experts decide who wins so in essence nobody is safe.

 Every expert must choose a focus, technology , ethics, military, farming.

 The term period is 4 years and you cannot re-run for 4 years after.

 This system would also need AI to work as in keeping everything clean and objective.

 Tradition, Social status and emotional manipulation tactics are not valued in the house of debate.

Their is no wage for experts or attendees, they must continue their normal work, the wage for the president and his administration team  pause their points  because they essentially agree with his/her ideas is fair and liveable but not excessive and set on debate.

 The house is held twice a week, so everyone has a chance to appear and the president has adequate time too present their ideas.

 The government is small and not overly administrative, freedom , neutrality and striving for self sufficiency are its core tenants.

 The president can be automatically removed from term by a house cleaning 3/4s of the experts has to agree, 70% of the populace votes and this can only happen once every 3 years, all signees must appear on the removal notice, an expert can also be removed by a majority vote and the signature of the president and all other experts.

 The president and experts or other high point members can not collude. Penalty for proven bias is a points penalty on first offence, 1 year ban on second offence and the above 5 year &amp; 0 points penalty.

 Presidents and the experts must appear for quarterly tests by the entrance AI exam - Purity of character/soundness of mind.

 Acts of treason, attempting to cheat the P and S  tests results in removal of cards and a lifetime ban from politics. 

 An accord of all bills and signees must be vaulted and can be reviewed at all times, nobody can give opinion and hide behind anonymity.

 Everything said in the house of debate is transcripted and vaulted also attached to their signature the card

 Anyone high status (Royal, Celebrity, Personalities, rich CEOs) individual is banned from having access to the panel of experts or presidential administration i.e level 1 and 2 politics. They are only granted a card for debate which is capped at a certain amount below the level for entrance to the expert chamber. Any attempts to rig or subvert the rule is classed as severe penalty with lifetime ban of politics.

 People can pause their card at any time, but must re-activate it after 4 years or it will be reset to 0 except level 1 and 2 politicians, they cannot pause 

 Missing at least 1 debate a week causes you to loose points, loosing front of the house debates on votes causes you to loose points. 

 All house debates are broadcast and people can call in from home but must be present/watching  for the whole duration to gain points. 

 Criminals (Serious crime and crime active on rap sheets), People under 18, people who fail the entrance test and people who received penalty bans may not receive a card.

 Every citizen with a card is in essence a politician. 

 Golden rule

The integrity of the system will be maintained by an AI system which is pre-programmed with tenants such as

 The perseverance of the human race.

  Non-corruption.

 Fair distribution of say etc etc.

Any attempts to maliciously change the AIs operation is a serious crime, the AI system will have robotics in place to physically protect its data center and the house of debate and its members, it will also have technological control of the military(defence) and police forces.

This misconception might cause a lack of preparedness for certain future technologies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/e23njq/the_agi_fallacy_a_potential_phenomenon_where_we/,Yuli-Ban,1574798993,"We're probably familiar with the [AI Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect), yes? The gist there is that we assume that a technology, accomplishment, or innovative idea [X] requires ""true"" artificial intelligence [Y], but once we actually accomplish [X] with [Y], [Y] is no longer [Y]. That might sound esoteric on the surface, but it's simple: once we do something new with AI, it's no longer called ""AI"". It's just a classifier, a tree search, a statistical gradient, a Boolean loop, an expert system, or something of that sort. 

As a result, I've started translating ""NAI"" (narrow AI) as ""Not AI"" because that's what just about any and every narrow AI system is going to be. 

It's possible there's a similar issue building with a fallacy that's closely related to (but is not quite) the AI Effect.

To explain my hypothesis: take [X] again. It's a Super Task that requires skills far beyond any ANI system today. In order to reliably accomplish [X], we need [Y] artificial general intelligence. But here's the rub: most experts place the ETA of AGI at around 2045 at the *earliest*, with actual data scientists leaning much closer to the 2060s at the earliest, with more conservative estimates placing its creation into the 22nd century. [Z] is how many years away this is, and for simplicity's sake, let's presume that [Z] = 50 years. 

To simplify: [X] requires [Y], but [Y] is [Z] years away. **Therefore**, [X] must *also* be [Z] years away, or at least it's close to it and accomplishing it heralds [Y]. 

But this isn't the case for almost everything done with AI thus far. As it turns out, a sufficiently advanced narrow AI system was capable of doing things that past researchers were doggedly sure could only be done with general AI. Chess, for example: it was once assumed that since only the highest intellectual minds could master chess, an AI would need to be virtually alive to do the same. 

Gerry Kasparov was trumped in the mid-90s, and I have a distinct inkling that the Singularity *might not have begun back then* too, but I need more evidence to confirm this. 

Things like Watson defeating a human on Jeopardy or an AI crushing humans at Go were in similar places in complexity: if an AI could do that, we're probably close to the Singularity. Both happened earlier this decade, and no human-level AGI has assumed total control over our nuclear launch codes since. If they have, they're doing a damn fine job not telling us, but there may be a tiny chance that AGI doesn't exist and these tasks were perfectly accomplishable by non-AGI due to focusing on specialization of certain tasks which has the added corollary of saying that many aspects of human cognition we assume can only be mimicked by a full-fledged mind can indeed be reduced to a much simpler and narrower form. 

Of course, there genuinely *are* some tasks that require AI more complicated than ANI. Autonomous cars are one. Sure, their narrow goal is ""driving"", but it turns out that's actually a very general goal when you really think about it because you have to account for, predict, and react to so many different stimuli at one time. Therefore, autonomous cars are only happening when we have AGI, right?

Well...

So, for the past few years, I've been trying to get people to listen to my explanation that our model for AI types has a gaping hole in it. We only have three types as of the present: ANI or NAI (narrow AI/not AI that can only do one thing), AGI (general AI, which can do everything), and ASI (artificial superintelligence, which can do everything and then some at a bizarro superhuman level). But ever since roughly around 2015 or so, I started asking myself: ""what about AI that can do some things but not everything?"" That is, it might be specialized for one specific class of tasks, but it can do many or all of the subtasks within that class. Or, perhaps more  simply, it's generalized across a cluster of tasks and capabilities but isn't general AI. It seems so obvious to me that this is the next step in AI, and we even have networks that do this: transformers, for example, specialize in natural-language generation, but from text synthesis you can also do rudimentary images or organize MIDI files; even with just pure text synthesis, you can generate anything from poems to scripts and everything in between. Normally, you'd need an ANI that specialize for each one of those tasks, and it's true that most transformers *right now* are trained to do one specifically. But as long as they generate character data, they can theoretically generate more than just words. 

This isn't ""proto-AGI"" or anything close; if anything, it's closer to ANI. But it isn't ANI; it's too generalized to be ANI. 

The gist there is that this proves to me that it's possible for AI to do narrowly-generalized tasks and, thus, be far stronger than any narrow AI network that exists today even if it's still weaker than any theoretical future AGI. This is a bridge from here to there, and we've all but started crossing it in the past couple of years.

The term I've coined for that kind of AI is ""AXI"" or ""artificial expert intelligence"" (not to be confused with expert systems). It makes sense in theory: an expert is one who specializes in a particular field rather than a worker who does one singular task or a polymath who knows everything. It's certainly better than ""proto-AGI"" because many will latch onto the AGI part of the name to discredit these sorts of technologies, and even then it really *isn't* proto-AGI anyway.


This has some implications for this ""AGI Effect"", if I may be able to coin another term. If we believe things like synthesizing a 5-minute photorealistic video with audio requires AGI, then we can comfortably say that this is 50+ years away and not have to worry about it. But if a suitably strong AXI does it in only five years, then we *may* have a problem: by assuming that [X] is 50 years away, we compartmentalize it in the same place as things like our grandchildren going to college, distant future effects of climate change or astronomic events, science fiction, and our own deaths. This is fairly low on our internal list of concerns. If it's only five years away, it becomes a much more immediate concern and we're more apt to do something about it or at least think through how we might deal with it. 

This is why there's little being done about climate change: even some of the most dire predictions still place the start of the worst effects decades in the future, which reduces our own responsibility to do or care about anything, despite the fact certain effects could start much sooner by unforeseen events.

It can be used to justify skepticism of any sort of change, too. The AGI Effect explains why people tend to think automation is decades away. For one, we tend to think of automation as ""humanoid robots taking jobs from men in blue overalls and hardhats, burger flippers, and truck drivers"" and because humanoid robots are still rather pathetic (despite the fact they can backflip and freerun now), we can comfortably say ""jobs aren't going away any time soon.""

I mean, for one: media synthesis is a thing, and the basic principle there is that disembodied neural networks can automate any data-oriented task (including the entertainment industry, news industry, and many white collar office tasks) as long as it has enough power, and that might start hitting as soon as the 2020s. Of course, there are also predictions there that say that ""we need AGI to get an NLG program to write a novel"" or ""we need AGI to generate a 5-minute animation,"" and yet both tasks seem like they may be accomplished within just a few, zero-AGI-filled years. And autonomous robots don't need to be entirely generalized to be better than humans; they just need to be able to handle unexpected issues. If you have strong enough ANI and AXI to handle vision, spatial awareness, and prediction, you could conceivably get a general-purpose robot worker. And this might only take 10 to 15 years as opposed to 50+. 

Sure, the robot with AGI is going to be better than the one with a bunch of less generalized networks, but it's not like we can only make these robots *with* AGI in the first place. And I think we're going to see what I mean in very short order.

I think autonomous trucks, for example, can be done with sufficiently powerful ANI. If not ANI, then certainly AXI. 

The cold fact is that most of the faculties of our mind *can* be reduced to certain algorithms; the issue is and has always been replicating the whole mind. And I'm merely saying that, in order to get to our sci-fi future, we don't actually need to do that (though it would greatly help). 



**TLDR: There's a fallacy where we assume that we need AGI to do something, when a sufficiently advanced narrow AI (or narrowly-generalized AI) will do that same thing much sooner. Since we don't expect it to be done so soon, we don't prepare for it properly.**",4,1,False,self,,,,,

This will take us back to **1950**, when a British mathematician and logician, **Alan Turing**, created a test to check the ability of a machine to think like a human. After multiple setbacks and successes, today we have reached a stage where technologies are converging and data is proliferating.

***Predicting the future isnt magic, its artificial intelligence.  Dave Waters***

We cant even imagine a single day when some sort of AI technology is not assisting us. From spam filters and smart replies in Gmail to mobile banking and Google maps, AI has not left even a single stone unturned to reach where it is right now.

## Future of Artificial Intelligence

So let us take a look at what possibly could be the future of AI:

### 1. Reinforcement Learning

[***Reinforcement learning***](https://data-flair.training/blogs/reinforcement-learning-with-python/), in simple words, is an algorithm or programming that uses a system of reward and punishment to train algorithms.A simple example of this can be. Suppose you want to teach your dog to sit. You will tell the dog to sit and at first, the dog will make a random action. If the action is not what we want then we give a negative reward so that the dog will do that action less. When we get the desired action, we will give a positive reward by giving a biscuit to the dog. This way the dog can be reinforced to learn things and then can make certain decisions.

Humans and most animals learn from past experiences. Reinforcement learning occurs when the machine uses previous data to evolve and learn. The robots of Boston Dynamics, US, have already learned how to do backflips and jump with the use of state of the reinforcement learning.

For that matter, **Amazons Alexa** is learning the flow of conversing by simulating interactions with its users.

### 2.Drastic Change in Employment Sector

Now that many companies are using robotic arms **(like SCARA)** in the routine operational aspects of manufacturing (assembly line operations, etc), employees can put more focus on the critical aspects of their jobs. Adidas is planning to start Speedfactory in Europe. *Speedfactory is an entirely robot-enabled manufacturing plant.* It aims to reduce errors in manufacturing and shipping time.

However, the increased usage of robots and AI in all fields might mean that companies will start letting go of employees. A recent study shows robots will take over more than **20 million jobs by 2030**, thus creating mass unemployment.

***Dig in***[***Artificial Intelligence Robotics***](https://data-flair.training/blogs/artificial-intelligence-robotics/) ***to*** ***know in detail about the usage of robots.***

One advantage of this could be that robots could take up jobs that pose danger to human life, such as welding. The process of welding emits toxic substances and an extremely loud noise, which is harmful to the health of a human doing that job.

Companies like **Faulhaber MICROMO**, **USA**, have even started working on robots that could diffuse bombs.

*If you have any queries in the future of AI blog till now, mention in the comment section.*

### 3. Automated Transportation

The thought that someday, we will be sitting in the backseat of our car, and the car will drive itself to places (as per our instructions) is scary yet exciting.

I'm still working it out, but it goes something like this: 

At a high level, automated, intelligent systems have 3 primary components\*: 

1. Sensors for taking in data
2. Machine learning models to interpret that data
3. Actuators to map those inferences into automated action 

The *way* these components show up in the world depends on *where* they show up in the economy. There are 4 primary sectors of the economy:

1. Natural resources:
2. Manufacturing:
3. Services:
4. Government:

The idea is to then map components to sectors to get insight into the unique attributes of each cross-section:

* Sensors in natural resources focus on taking in data from the natural world. E.g. machine vision to spot crop disease or weeds in the field.
* Sensors in the services economy focus primarily on taking in data from end users. E.g. Facebook engagement data or an ordering kiosk at McDonald's. 
* Machine learning models in manufacturing focus primarily on optimizing production efficiency. E.g. predictive maintenance on an assembly line at a semiconductor plant. 
* Machine learning models in services focus primarily on maximizing end user engagement. E.g. Amazon using machine learning product recommendations.
* Actuators (automation) in government focus on executing executive functions. E.g. automated drone strikes, coordinated traffic lights.
* Actuators in natural resources focus on automating resource extraction. E.g. automated mining equipment.

I'd post an image but doesn't seem to be an option here. I think you get the idea though.

Curious how you think this might be useful and where the holes are.

Many seniors are suffering different types of knee problem, which affects normal lifestyle and reduce mobility in their old age. 

Equipped with a magnetorheological damper, BioNEEK  a passive bionic exoskeleton brace designed and manufactured by Sichuan Ju An Hui Science and Technology features some clever engineering.

With biomechanical assistance, BioNEEK enhances support, reduce impact, improve stability and maximize the protection of the knee so that it can be constantly rehabilitated. The magnetorheological damper works just like a shock absorption system that reduces the impact on users knees while improving endurance and mobility.


The adjustable hinge on the BioNEEK is beneficial to users with chronic knee problems by preventing hyperextension, expediting rehabilitation and relieving pain. The hinge tracks users knee natural movement to maintain support and provide lateral stability to the ligaments whilst moving the joint.

Ultra-Light PEEK 3D Printed Knee Brace Maximizes Protection and Enhances Mobility


Sichuan Ju An Hui turned to INTAMSYS to produce BioNEEKs brace due to the proven top quality and high consistency of INTAMSYS technology in PEEK 3D printing.

The braces of BioNEEK were 3D printed on the FUNMAT PRO HT, the most advanced 3D printer of INTAMSYS capable of efficiently 3D printing large-size PEEK parts. Each BioNEEK user has individualized needs in terms of sizing of the knee brace therefore the ability to customize quickly with consistent results while maintaining the durability of the BioNEEK is critical to the patients of Sichuan Ju An Hui.


The mechanical properties of PEEK parts printed on INTAMSYS printer can achieve 99.9 MPa in tensile strength and 3738 MPa in Youngs Modulus. Knee brace with PEEK as its main structure help prevent injury by giving users an additional layer of strength and protection. Foam padding is added to the brace to ensure comfortable wearing experience.

With the outstanding mechanical strength and stiffness of PEEK coupled with the reliability of INTAMSYS 3D printing solution, Sichuan Ju An Hui is now able to swiftly customize according to customers sizes and produce BioNEEK that fit comfortably on the knees of each customer while delivering the industry-leading level of protection, made possible by 3D printed PEEK. said Charles Han, CEO of INTAMSYS.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Here's something that might take a step towards fixing it:

It's a social media app that rather than working to share posts with everyone in the world looking for a certain type of content, links people up for activities and friends on a map of their local area.

It works like this - you have a basic profile (name, picture, tags), you can post a status on the map (it would presumably be a description of the activity you're trying to set up), and people can find it either by browsing the map or filtering it for people with common tags. 

To keep it from ending up being a dating app, everyone is limited to only one picture, they are just right enough resolution that you can recognize them, and we each get one message heading in each direction. Makes it basically an icebreaker.

It's on both the app stores and called WanderOn

In the future I'm hoping it could eventually link to things like youtube and reddit profiles to automatically generate an interest profile and recommend likeminded people - what do you think, and would people be comfortable with it?

Hey folks,

I've made a few career jumps in the last few years. I went from retail to finance to IT and the biggest thing that deeply, deeply motivated me was the idea that in IT (tech really, but that is such a broad field and doesn't reflect where I am now) I can directly be a part of something good. I want to help, in some way, bring about the whiz-bang, real science fiction stuff that makes living physically, emotionally easier and fulfilling. I'm working on ways to be a part of that zeitgeist. I work at a cloud computing company as a NSOC tech, and I'm studying for the AWS Certified Cloud Solutions Architect Associate. After that, I plan to (finally!) learn a programming language. 

Okay, enough rambling. Let get to why I'm here. I'm just starting out, at an older age then I'd like at 27, and sometimes, I can't help but feel alone. That might sound paradoxical, but a lot of my friends are really in this for the money alone, and because they find it fun. There's nothing wrong with that, at all, but I want to find people who feel like me, who think like I do. 

I still have so much farther I have to go, and I know there are other people like me out there. My big question is where, either on reddit or somewhere else, can I find it?",10,1,False,self,,,,,

In all the sound and fury over climate change, too little public and media attention has been devoted to the methane gun (1)  and yet this terrifying phenomenon could usher humans unceremoniously off Earths stage for good. 

Like CO2, methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas that helps trap the suns heat within the Earths atmosphere. The big difference is that it is 25-84 times more potent at doing so. 

The planet has massive stores of methane, locked as frozen ice in the seabed (the worlds largest natural gas reserve), in the frozen soils of the Canadian, US and Russian Arctic, and buried in the sediments of tropical swamps and peatlands. Like the bubbles in a stagnant pond, the gas is mostly the work of bacteria digesting organic matter over millions of years.

How large these reserves of methane are is still a matter for scientific debate  but estimates fall between 1.5 and 5 trillion tonnes. Very, very large indeed. If released suddenly, these are thought more than capable of driving the Earths temperature up by another 7-10 degrees, on top of the 2-5 degrees likely to result from human emissions from burning fossil fuels and clearing land (currently rising at record rates (2)).  

The worst-case scenario  a large-scale, rapid release of trapped gas known as the methane gun  could potentially render the Earth uninhabitable by humans and other large animals. This is why we need to pay attention. Now.

What has some scientists concerned  and others frightened  is that atmospheric levels of methane which have doubled since the Industrial Revolution and have been rising for steadily for the past 30 years, began to rise more steeply in the past five years, as the following graph shows:

The source of the new methane is debated. Is it mainly caused by the mining of natural gas, petroleum and coal  as several lines of evidence suggest? Is it released by expanding world cattle and rice production, the draining of tropical swamps and burning of tropical forests? Is it the frozen gas seeping out of the oceans and tundra as the planet warms and its ice vanishes? Or is it all of the above? The evidence is starting to favour the latter view (3)   but the scientific jury remains undecided.

We know that a mass-release of methane can be catastrophic for life on Earth, because thats exactly what took place 55 million years ago in an event known as PETM  the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum  when global temperatures shot up by 5-10 degrees, wiping out a number of species (4). There were no humans round then to release carbon, so it was probably due to one or more of the natural sources rapidly giving up its gas. Recently opinion has narrowed in favour of tropical swamps and peatlands drying out and catching fire during a warming cycle, as the main source. The frozen methane, apparently, remained largely undisturbed in the ocean and tundra.

But that is not the case today. Not only are tropical forests burning and swamps being drained, but scientists have observed major escapes of methane from the Arctic tundra in the form of exploding pingos  mounts of frozen methane, mud and water  and the eruption of melted methane ice from the seabed. In October 2019 veteran Russian researcher Igor Semiletor, from Tomsk Polytechnic University, reported the most powerful seep I have ever been able to observe venting in a potent eruption of gas bubbles in the East Siberian Sea (5).

Two years earlier, in June 2017, Russian reindeer herders reported a violent explosion that left a 50- metre deep crater in the tundra of the Yamal Peninsula, Siberia, which scientists attributed to a methane blast. In recent years researchers have reported numerous craters left by explosions across Siberia, the Canadian and Alaskan tundra  and even craters in the seabed. Many are recent  but some are up to 12,000 years old, and still leaking gas. Therein lies the uncertainty: are the methane explosions observed today part of a process that occurs more or less constantly through Earth history  or do they represent the start of a sudden release, ramping up to runaway global warming? The scientific jury is at odds. 

Pennsylvania State climate scientist Prof Michael Mann, for instance, characterises the methane bomb idea as catastrophism and claims it is being exploited by the climate denial lobby to discredit climate theory generally. He says the amount of methane released will be small compared to human emissions of carbon (6). Other scientists, like Gavin Schmidt of the NASA Goddard Institute, argue that it is highly unlikely that a large volume of seabed methane would be released suddenly, i.e. over a period less than thousands of years, because it did not do so in past warming events. Instead it will continue to trickle out.

Oceanography and ice expert Prof Peter Wadhams disagrees. He says loss of Arctic sea ice from the shallow continental margins could trigger such a release which could happen very suddenly and  is the greatest single threat that we face. He says that mainstream science, represented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), does not generally recognise the threat (7).

Australian National University earth scientist Prof. Andrew Glikson cites the Global Carbon project finding that there are 1.4 trillion tonnes of accumulated methane stored on land and 16 trillion tonnes in the ocean, available for release if the planet grew warm enough, and this could have catastrophic effects on the biosphere.  He points out there is already clear evidence for the explosive release of methane, on land and at sea. With Arctic temperatures already 3-8 degrees warmer due to global warming, the risks of a sudden methane release have not yet been fully accounted for in climate projections (8).  

At temperatures above +4 degrees, many scientists now consider the risk is increasing of the planet becoming partly or wholly uninhabitable to humans and large animals. Certainly, such heat and climate instability would destroy most of our current food production systems, spilling billions of climate refugees across the planet and causing wars to break out between and within nation states (9). 

How many would die in such an event is not knowable, because we cannot predict how humans will respond, how many wars we will start, or how many nukes we will unleash in the ensuing chaos. Potsdam Institute climatologist John Schellnhuber has said: At 4 C Earths carrying capacity estimates are below 1 billion people. Prof Kevin Anderson of the U.K.s Tyndall Centre for Climate Change concurs: Only about 10 per cent of the planets population would survive at 4 C. Several scientists have voiced the view that the human population will be reduced from 9-10 billion to around 1-3 billion in the long run (10).

We already know that our physical survival is in jeopardy in extended periods above 35 degrees Celsius  that is, where daytime temperatures constantly reach 40-50 degrees C or more. Such temperatures will occur frequently with +7 degrees of global warming and will render large parts of the earth uninhabitable  including the most heavily populated. Above +12 degrees of global warming, human survival becomes physically impossible (11). However long before our heat tolerance limits are reached, local and global food and water supplies will collapse, prompting mass migration and war. Without urgent worldwide action, the global economy  and with it civilized society  are predicted to go down as we approach +4 degrees. Such warnings come, not from radical greens, but from authorities no less conservative than Bank of England governor Marc Carney (12), who states that the global financial system is currently investing in catastrophe by backing new fossil fuel projects (13).

These numbers represent the current most-informed estimates of the impact of the unfolding climate crisis, should world efforts to halt it fail  and should the climate deniers triumph. 

The risk for humanity posed by the methane gun is that rapid global mass-release may be locked and loaded and firing before we have sufficient scientific data to confirm it. It is, as they say, an event of low probability  but very high impact. Is it a risk that a rational person would take?

Once the gun has begun to fire, there is practically nothing humans can do to stop it. It will unleash other dangerous feedbacks, potentially leading to runaway warming. It will shift the planet from its present warming state to a hothouse Earth state (14) where human survival comes into question.

The only viable strategy  possibly  is preventative: to move civilization far faster towards total elimination of all fossil fuels and land clearing worldwide  and plant billions of trees as quickly as possible, to slow the global warming trend before it triggers the methane gun. 

This means that countries like America, Australia, Brazil and Russia must cease their dangerous do-nothing policies, and stop mining coal, oil and gas, and clearing land. Countries like India and China need to cease building coal-fired power stations immediately. And every country needs to scale back carbon emissions on an accelerated time-scale from transport, agriculture, concrete and industry.

While some scientists urge geoengineering solutions, such as the artificial release of sulphate aerosol particles to erect a giant sunshade over the Earth, this represents a counsel of despair. It means allowing the atmosphere to attain virtual temperatures that would cook humans, then trying to chill them down with a planet-sized air-conditioner. The consequences, should our air conditioner fail, would be terminal. That really only leaves us with the option of trying to contain global warming by eliminating human carbon emissions  before the methane gun fires.

In the end, the worst that can happen by banning fossil fuels and regreening the planet is that we get a new clean energy system, cheaper energy, renewed economic growth and a more sustainable Earth.

If the climate deniers  fifty huge energy corporates and their political and media cheer squad  get their way, the worst that can happen is human extinction.
