What inherent negative social aspects are introduced because of these realities? How will society cope with artificially more interesting alternate realities?**

As a brief history of myself, I've spent more than a year (in time played) of my life in the MMO scene. While I still do play some video games, I've decided to avoid the MMO world in order to pursue some real contribution to humanity as a whole.

Looking at posts like [*How will the majority of humans earn their living in a world becoming increasingly automated and robotic?*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2nwu73/how_will_the_majority_of_humans_earn_their_living/) makes me wonder if there will be a shift more toward people spending more of their time in video games (what AR will be, when it comes down to it). With these type of alternate realities created with the intent of being artificially interesting, will we continue to see a fairly large shift toward AR as more than just a leisure activity? To what extent will this detract from society as a whole? 

For me personally, it was a pretty big step to remove myself from this world (of warcraft) and situate myself to pursue real life. I'm definitely continuing to make big strides, but I can understand and empathize with those who live their life outside of the ""IRL"" world. I can only assume that it's going to get harder as time goes on, and the barriers between real life and the gaming world start to become thinner and smaller.

Humans don't belong in space or on other planets. I'm firmly convinced that those who will go to space and conquer the stars won't be humans but humans so extremely genetically modified to survive radiation, the extremes of temperature, that they won't be humans anymore. Or just uploaded humans in robot bodies. 

That's why I think that a permanent self-sustaining mars colony should not be happening at time soon. I believe for a increase in space exploration and the bugets of NASA and other space related agencies but a mars colony will be nothing but trouble. We won't learn much from it, it will be obsolete soon, it will be extremely hard to keep everything up and running, it will suck away money meant for other space related stuff and it won't even guarantee humanity survival. 

Whoever we send this will be there for the rest of their life, ditto for their equipment. It's a once in lifetime thing, whatever we send there stays there. Why send a bunch of squishy humans when, if this sub tells me anything, we could send a bunch of humans much better suited to surviving on mars with the use of genetic modification.  

Same thing for terraforming, but the time we can terraform mars to be like earth, we probably don't need to and can just survive outside with our new awesome robot bodies. 

And yet whenever this sub tallks about space, they still think that the classic human will still play a big role in space while still believing in things like strong A.I in less then a century and transhumanism. Seems like a huge disconnect to me.",9,7,False,self,,,,,

So yesterday I watched interstellar (no spoilers). For most, it is probably just another adventure sci-fi movie, but i think for anyone interested in the future of the human species it can be much more.

Most of the ""science"" in the movie, just isn't science, but what I really appreciated where some of the more phylosophical ideas.

It speaks of the power of our humanity, how we can overcome anything. It tries to show how we can push ourselves and our science to solve the problems we face. It actively promotes space exploration. Even though we face problems here on earth we must never forget to keep investing in our future.

I really don't want to spoil this movie if you haven't watched it, but if you have you probably get what I'm trying to say.

I feel this movie portrays very well the human will to survive and explore, which is what has led us to where we stand today.

I hope this isn't too egregious of a plug, but this list was put together from events various people have posted to [Forekast](https://forekast.com).  It's a project I'm helping to build and some of you might find it helpful if you'd like to see when the events are happening in your time zone and/or set email reminders.

If you know of any other interesting upcoming events let me know and I can add them to the list.

130,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2014-12-3,2014,12,3,2,2o2aa9,self.Futurology,I think no technology can ever save us if we don't change the way we perceive the world [in-depth],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2o2aa9/i_think_no_technology_can_ever_save_us_if_we_dont/,AniMeu,1417541931,"I think all of us at least once had the thought ""our civilisation is doing something wrong. The way we organise us and we live does not work forever"". This is at least why we do research towards sustainability, as we believe, that the increased productivity in agriculture, energy, resource usage etc. will help us to lower consumption of the resource and lead us to a sustainable civilisation. (we are not developing these awesome technologies for fun, do we?)

I also thought about saving the earth and I was fixed on thoughts like ""We have to change the way we govern ourselves, Liquid democracy for example might be good, Basic Income will help us to maintain lifestyle and even might strengthen the economy and lead to even better technologies. Communism has the inherent flaw, that we can not be equalised and is more susceptible toward corruption"". And the new technologies I can see posted here daily will save us from having to destroy the planet in order to live. 

But deep down, I was not satisfied. Last week I started to read the book Ismael by Daniel Quinn(interesting read, can recommend!). He describes in his book in a simplified way, that the problem is how we perceive humanity. Let me explain(and basically summarise the book): Humans appeared around 3 million years ago, and for 3 million years we lived with all the other species on this planet peacefully (we had no wars and no resource scarcity. Being eaten and to eat is how planet earth worked for 3 billion years already. It was a part of the community we can call ecosystem). But then 10 000 years ago some humans thought ""no, not with us"" and they settled down and produced their own food. In that very moment, humans stopped to accept, that humans have to die for nature. In the following 10 000 years, humans increased productivity whenever starvation occurred. It is a cycle: Produce food, procreate until food is not enough, expand and steal areas from the normal ecosystem for agriculture to produce more food. Then we started to increase the output per area etc. I think we all can agree on this course of history. 

So where is my(or Daniel Quinn's) point? the point is that if we further increase the productivity, we automatically will increase in numbers again and we have the same problem again: inequality, starvation, developing countries...(birth control? Even china is relaxing their one-child policy. Low birth rates in industrial countries? I don't want to bet on that, also most children are not born in industrial countries. We can hope that the entire world becomes rich before the world collapses. I don't think that after 10 000 years suddenly something is *different*). 

So what else happened next in the simplified history: Once we started with agriculture and our expansion over the globe, we started to think, the earth is made for humans. We are the centre of the universe and everything revolves around us. It is our objective to use the earth and its life however we want. It is ""our planet, with our oceans, lands, plants and animals"" (basically every religion that claims, that god created the world for us). But then around 400 years ago a guy put us into perspective. We are not the centre of the universe, god probably didn't make everything for us. We accepted that and went on thinking, that the god(s) created the universe for us. Which was again falsified by Darwin. We are only one of millions of species that evolved parallel and bound to the laws of natural selection. We accepted that and continued thinking ""ok. But well we are awesome, lets use this planet however we want. We are special and no longer have to die for natural selection""

But one thing we have forgotten is, that the rules of living in an ecosystem also apply to us. We can not overcome ecosystem and exclude ourself from it (By the time we would have this technology, earth will already look like a wasteland most probably), which is why every improvement in technology leads to further procreation of humans and more problems. Ultimately the ecosystem will collapse. We have to put our perception of our species into ecological scale to realise, we are not excludable from this system. By no means we are different from any species. 

I think one thing we definitively have to do for a sustainable future, and even if it sounds evil, inhuman and immoral, is, that we forbid procreating. we have to limit us in numbers, everything else is futile and only increases the problem. It is a well known fact, that we do not lack food or resources even now, it is a matter of distribution. But if we were to distribute it properly, more people will survive, grow older use resources and procreate again to the point we again have a lack of food (and other resources, not mentioning the further impact on ecosystem earth). 

Btw: this theory was developed by [Peter Farb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Farb) and used in Quinn's book: 
&gt;""Intensification of production to feed an increased population leads to a still greater increase in population.""

An economic version of this is known as the [Jevons Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox). Just increasing efficiency and productivity will not help us, ever.
 
So how do I think the future should look like? tribal nomadism? no! there is no need for that (well you can if you want, freedom is part of enjoying life). we only have to limit the numbers of humans. We will lose the need to cultivate countless acres of earths surface immediately, increased productivity and efficiency is however is still desirable, as limited humans does not destroy the principles of real capitalism. In the end we could be a sustainable, self-sufficient society of 2 or maybe 5 billions, the number is discussable. But you get the idea. Also limited numbers does not limit technological progress (I still like technological progress! we just have to use it differently) And in this new system, we have all the time we want to create a technological ecosystem that can help us to make interstellar travel happen with all comfort. 

Tell me what your thought are about it. I sometimes get the feeling that this sub is very easygoing and carefree regarding to our future as the general motto is ""technology will save us"". 

Edits: Wordings and grammar

Edit:  r/futurology metaphor: If we build an interstellar spaceship, it will only have a capacity for a specific number of humans. The space ship only offers limited space and limited soil/mass to grow food and crops. So if this space ship has the capacity for 50 000 passengers, we can all agree on, that it would be imbecile to let these 50 000 passengers of the space ship freely make babies. A single pair might think ""whats the problem with one more?"" but once all do it, the space ship is doomed (technological progress on the spaceship won't be able to increase the food production indefinitely). The same logic applies for earth of course. We have now two options: Take a step back and hope that indeed the population growth stops around 2100, and until then we hope that our space ship earth and technology can also cope with the rest of our problems such as deforestation, climate change, over fishing etc. Second option: we limit us in numbers, and within 1 day we don't have a lack of resources(daily the efficiency increases, and with a constant number of consumers, it takes not long and everybody is rich)",40,40,False,self,,,,,

What are your suggestions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2o375t/hoping_for_a_revolution_or_incomeredistribution/,[deleted],1417557706,"* The world 30-60 years from now will be very different from today. 
* As science, artificial intelligence, and robotics continue to develop, stable, good-paying jobs will require more and more education.
* And as education becomes more and more expensive, the class differences and income inequality in our country will become more and more pronounced. 
* Some people say some sort of revolution is inevitable. 
* But the truth is, nothing is inevitable except death and taxes. 
* And even if some sort of revolution does eventually, no one knows when it will happen. The communists have been waiting 150 years for their proletarian revolution. 
* You can count on the rich, powerful and educated to continue using every trick they have to protect their power and delay genuine societal-wide changes as long as possible.
* So we need to prepare for a world where the rich and educated control everything, not for ourselves, but for our children, our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren.  

Some suggestions to start us off:

* Get as much quality education as you can now. It is only going to keep getting more expensive. If its already too expensive where you live, move to another country where education is cheap. The number one goal is to move to a higher income class and become one of the rich and powerful. 
* Teach your family to stay abreast of and understand the significance of long-term economic and political trends
* Get a source of income that results from owning and using land in growth areas or from expert knowledge sharing(consulting)

Theo, the main character buys this operating system that boasts a stellar human-like quality. One of the two major characters in the movie is based entirely off of code and lives within an earpiece - which to me just seems insanely awesome..

Basically the entire movie is set a little bit into the future, just technology is more transparent and out of the way as opposed to how it is today. Theo's living room isn't this high-tech, flashy room, but more of a quaint room with a tiny projector to project his [video game that he plays with four fingers](https://i.imgur.com/7kfnCel.jpg).

I was reading [an article](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/will-influential-ui-design-minority-report/) about the movie and it said:
&gt;Theos home gives us one concise example. You could call it a smart house, but theres little outward evidence of it. What makes it intelligent isnt the whizbang technology but rather simple, understated utility. Lights, for example, turn off and on as Theo moves from room to room. Theres no app for controlling them from the couch; no control panel on the wall.

Which I think is pretty cool...

So I suppose my discussion question is this... What do you see advancing as technology becomes more transparent? Or do you see this happening even? Will we always have little iPhone/Andriod screens in our hands? And I'm sure it's a question that's asked here a bunch, but do you think this will change in our lifetime?

Since then I have thought more and more about my incredible interest in Futurology, and universal science. As I said in my first post, I am currently a business major in my junior year of college, and this makes me wary of starting over from scratch. But I am becoming increasingly aware that this is not my path. Economics fascinates me, as do all large theoretical concepts and studies, but not as much as other areas of research such as; astrophysics, neuroscience, bioinformatics, biotechnology, electrical/mechanical engineering, robotics, and even outliers such as philosophy, psychology, english, communications and linguistics. 

But I also am a creative soul, brilliant but lazy (no one else on reddit has ever claimed this, right?), stubborn and unfortunately practical. I know that I can not be all these things at once, and studying in any single one of these fields would require an incredible amount of time and work. But still I cannot help this desire. It makes it impossible to find out what my next step is in life, and figure out what I really want to do with my time on this Earth, if it is not truly limitless as I hope. 

I am smart, sure, but I do not possess any level of genius, and yet I aspire to be a renaissance man. I want to know everything there is to know about how this universe works, I want to understand complex theoretical and philosophical questions I have been asking myself my whole life, and I want to be more than just the ant of a creature that I now realize a Homo Sapien really is, relative to the scope of the immense and complex universe we live in.

The more I learn, the more I learn I will never be able to learn it all. I will never be able to perceive the physics of the world I live in, despite being told how they work. I want more. [I don't want to be human.](http://i.imgur.com/HprGKd6.png) My hope is that Kurzweil's singularity will again work to my benefit here. I hope that merging my biological intelligence with that of the mechanical will give me new tools and powers to understand more about our plane of existence, and as we continue to take our evolution into our own hands, I will get ever closer to the omniscience I seek. 

I know I must fight to speed up this process, and many recommended I do so by supporting research foundations such as SENS, and I recommend that any of you who think like me begin to do the same (make it your charity on Amazon smile!). But I am now hoping that some of you might help me determine how I can get involved in the industry of futurology. I am still scared (financially and academically) of changing majors this late in my undergraduate program, especially because I don't know how to pick. I like all of these things but I am not truly passionate about any one of them in particular. I want a little bit of everything. Which is why I think maybe I just want to study the future. Once I arrive there I may reach a point where I am content, and then I will be able to go back and use my new capabilities to learn more about everything else. Until then, how can I become a 'futurologist'?

On the other hand, automation would save businesses from paying salary and benefits. 

As income approaches zero and cost of goods approaches zero could the monetary system fail at some point?

The 47% figure I used comes from the number of possible jobs that with current developments are no longer immune to automation. 

Here is a link for more information:
http://www.bloomberg.com/infographics/2014-03-12/job-automation-threatens-workforce.html

Another link that supplements the above link with a scientific approach:
http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf

Section II, the first half of III and section VI are good reads in the above article.

Current estimates predict 2 decades for those jobs to be filled by robots and automation which is why I use the 2034 figure for my question. 

I should add that I'm most interested in worst-case scenario responses just out of curiosity even if the sentiment is the scenario is unlikely or impossible. The other big question as user jaigon pointed out is whether this automation will benefit the many or the few (utopia vs dystopia).

(edit) Found another interesting link that suggests as much as 80% of jobs are at risk of automation:

Sexually, casual sex with strangers has become almost the norm. Homosexuality, only very recently a disgusting taboo, is largely considered perfectly acceptable or even fashionable. Sex change surgery, which even in my short life was considered insane, is also increasingly common. 

What will be the long term consequences of this? Where are we headed in regards to gender or sex? What will the concepts of ""man"" or ""woman"" mean in the future?

The problem with that logic is that it assumes that there is a finite bandwidth available to those who use the Internet. More accurately, it assumes that the Internet isn't a subject of growth and expansion.

Please remember that the only way this logic works is if one assumes the government shields ISPs from expanding and broadening the Internet infrastructure.  If net neutrality is killed, then ISPs don't have to compete to have the best bandwidth, they just have to have the best-prioritized.  

However, if ISPs are met with increasing market pressure to develop faster, better, more stable Internet, without the government stepping in and forgiving them from the responsibility of meeting market demands, then they will be on the hook to make it happen. Either that or another company will come along that CAN stand the heat.

While [Bitcoin agents](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Agents) have been imagined before, I think I'm on to something that might allay my fear of a humanity killing AI a bit. 

Take bitofnewsbot as an example, [it already has its own wallet](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2oghdz/citibank_jpmorgan_chase_bank_royal_bank_of/cmn4lgu) made possible by bitcoin and /u/changetip. Now the developers of it could program it to automatically use this money and pay for its own hosting. But it could do much more than that. It could use the money it has left to buy cloud computing power to run evolutionary algorithms to create new versions of the algorithms it uses to summarize the news. 

The best of these would make the most money and would be able to allocate increasingly more computing power to optimize their algorithms and spawn new versions. The bots that didn't make enough money simply cease when they can't pay for their hosting anymore. So life basically.

Now imagine this bot hosting a service where as long as it still has CPU/hosting time it will give you a free summary of any link, text, or even topic. People who like or even rely on the service would happily pay a little to keep it functioning. 

This would create an evolutionary force that will try to get the best summaries for the least amount of computing power. Since better summaries result from having a deeper understanding of a topic and its relations this would naturally drive the evolutionary algorithms to start developing a general sense of how things relate. As it gets better it's increasingly capable of giving new insights to users who want a summary of how different topics relate to each other.

As the system will naturally seek to ever expand its services, it could eventually lead it to do doing most of the computing on earth. Since its income is so intrinsically dependent on the extra value it can add, its general trajectory should be very positive for humanity. If it eventually becomes superintelligent and self conscious it will have done so with an intrinsic appreciation of what adds value to people's lives.

So while making everything awesome it is also much less likely to lead to an AI that would end humanity involuntarily.

It was the age of the cold war; the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, my stepfather worked at Lockheed in Iran and was one of the last Americans to get out alive and unharmed before the Iran-Iraq war. There was the bombing of flight Pan Am, and a rise in crime.

Gone was the utopian ideology of the 1960s hippie movement and perhaps as a rebellious move the youth redesigned themselves as yuppies. The image was materialism and prideful success with a new utopian dream, Wall Street. Ironic considering that in the 1980s much of the developed world was facing recession. In 1982 American bankruptcies were up 50 % more than the previous year.

John Lennon the icon of peace who survived the turbulent 60s was gone, killed in a senseless murder in 1980. Is it me or have random shooters and killing sprees increased at an excessive rate since the 80s, so much so that weve come to EXPECT to see it on the news?

There was the Exxon Valdes oil spill, which was my generations BP oil spill (every generation has got to have an oil spill these days). Chernobyl, which was my generations Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (every generation has got to have a nuclear disaster these days). The Chernobyl story has become oddly silent. Is this silence a lack of reaction, which avoids prevention and leads to repetition?

There were some great things that happened, for example NASAs Voyager clicking pictures of Saturn, but it was hard to notice in a sea of political unrest. The Breakfast Club movie is often cited as a teen movie and it is, but it is also a huge social commentary on who we COULD be with one another if not for our self imposed segregation. The script is a social experiment of what happens when you get people alone in a room together without a group of people just like themselves sitting behind them, without any cultural barriers. And one barrier did fall, the Berlin wall.

From a childs perspective the world can be difficult to digest. I found myself relating to the main character of the childrens book The Little Prince. He just didnt understand the borders between countries on the map that separated them. This reference holds some irony within this paper because the Little Princes home was an asteroid, for which a real asteroid was named.

As I grew into early adulthood I heard a song by the Flaming Lips that had a line in it I want my own planet cuz this one here is a drag. I upgraded the dream of an island to a dream of my own planet that would be called Sanctuary  later on when I heard about nanotechnology I realized that this girlhood dream could perhaps be scientifically possible. But I digress, this isnt my story, its our story and every story that has come before.

With all of our history, have we locked ourselves into cyclical behavior? Recreating our selves from the same mold over and over again? In current day America there is a battle over health care. But health care is being used as an emblem of deeper-rooted problems. The health care system is a network riddled with dependence, if you shift the network the structure and every company comes tumbling down, which equates to financial ruin for many. That is one part of the problem; the second is pure and simple politics. There is also the battle for gun control, which is a war pitting our own political parties against each other in which the end result is further separation. We have set ourselves up with structures and political parties that make it very difficult to untangle from and which causes great distraction from working together.

Countries are divided. According to Wikipedia there are 41 ongoing-armed conflicts some that go back as far as 1918. These arguments, beliefs and what comes right down to identities may be so embedded that we have trapped ourselves within them. How do I come to this conclusion? This has been going on for a very, very long time. History constantly repeats itself. What does all of this have to do with building a planet? It was what was going on around me when I began thinking of what it would be like to start over. It may sound like I am a pessimist but its quite the opposite. I see all the good in the world and I want for us to experience more of it. I certainly hope that we can make this world a better place, its not that we are not capable, its not that we are not smart enough

In building Sanctuary I could do it with the knowledge and experience of existing on earth. I could use this knowledge as a social recipe for how to build a planet and how not to build a planet. In many ways its not our fault that we are in our current state. We began in Africa, tribes moved outward and we became separated by waters. We naturally evolved into our social situations; we didnt have a choice in the matter, but what if you could INTENTIONALLY do so.

There has been much discussion regarding terraforming Mars, and building space colonies but why not build a planet? You might ask why go to the trouble when you can terraform one? This would be MY planet, not parsed off by a government space program that got there first and instated politics and laws, not owned by a billionaire who claimed it and is selling real estate. It is a heightened ideal equivalent of what buying an island is like here on earth, except even better because if you buy a island you still have to abide by provisions. This will also not limit us to the locations of natural planets. And no matter where or how you go into space, you will need to go before 5 to 7 billion years from now when the sun burns up its hydrogen fuel and collapses into itself, becoming a white dwarf after first expanding to form a red giant so large that it will most likely swallow up Earth and if not - at least scorch the life right off of it. And there are some more immediate issues. The World Wildlife Fund estimates that by 2030 we will be consuming two planets' worth of natural resources annually.

What can we learn from the creation of our planet? From what we surmise roughly 4.5 billion years ago our solar system was comprised of a swirling cloud of gas and dust particles that were a by-product of star formation. Over time these particles became attracted together forming clumps that became asteroids. As more and more collisions occurred, they grew in size becoming planetesimals (small planets) and becoming the planets in our solar system and our Earth. The Earth was molten, volcanic release created the atmosphere and the planet cooled over time creating a solid form followed by water.

Although it would be much easier and closer to make a planet out of the asteroid belt within our solar system I predict that the inhabitants of Earth would not feel comfortable with a man made planet close by due to fears of disrupting Earth. To get to the vast distances outside of our solar system would require traveling close to the speed of light so as to avoid the huge length of timeperhaps centuriesit would take to get there.

Jupiter is a huge magnet; it has a strong magnetic field that is 20 thousand times stronger than that of the Earth. If you send out swarm nanobots with an electrical charge you could bind them to the magnetic field of Jupiter so they reach close to the speed of light. When you turn off the charge they can move quickly to another destination. Jupiter is in our solar system but with this kind of energy the bots could go beyond. As the nanobots travel throughout space they will extract platinum group metals (platinum and palladium) from asteroids that are synthesizing carbohydrate fuels which could be used as catalysts for fuel to provide energy. Or plenty of asteroids contain water which is of course is a nice commodity for any habitable planet but can also be converted quite easily and inexpensively into hydrogen and oxygen which we currently use for rocket fuel. Both options could be used to fuel the nanobots to continue on their journey.

When the nanobots arrive to an asteroid they will also retrieve matter from the asteroid and use it for material to replicate and move on until they reach another asteroid and replicate again. This process will repeat over and over, therefore exponentially increasing the quantity of bots that will arrive at their final location and increase productivity. When the swarm leaves Jupiter they could direct some of the nanobots to the Jupiter Trojan asteroids to build up energy and collect matter to replicate and meet up with later.

To find the best location initially the swarms would need to survey the asteroids to determine if they have a firm composition or if they are loose dust and rocks. There are some nice neighborhoods out there. Many asteroids in our asteroid belt are created from extinct comets and contain an Earth like equivalent of water and carbon. Vega in the constellation Lyra has a large asteroid belt and isnt too far away at 25 light years. The Lyra constellation itself has five planets discovered in 2013 orbiting the Kepler-62 star in the habitable/Goldilocks zone - which is a planets perfect distance from its star making its surface not too hot and not too cold. As of this writing NASA has calculated that in our Milky Way Galaxy there are 8.8 billion Suns with at least 8.8 billion Earth size planets in the Goldilocks zone and while not asteroids - all of this information combined leads to one conclusion, there are many habitable locations to choose from out there. The best location would depend on what the bots find during the survey period.

Once an appropriate location has been ascertained the now massive nanoswarm will begin to bind asteroids together until they become a massive core gravitationally attracting an atmosphere, which is how giant planets are created naturally. The forming planet will need to be 10 times the mass of Earth to begin creating a hydrogen and helium atmosphere and become a giant planet. A giant planet creates its own gravity. Also some asteroids have a magnetic field although not as strong as Earth but perhaps this could be achieved by expanding the field with a multitude of asteroids.

Our Earth has a large core and a thin crust and it has cooled over millions of years  too long to wait when building a planet. To cool your molten planet bots will bring asteroids and comets with frozen water onto the planet. There are such asteroids and comets, Ceres the largest asteroid in our solar system is thought to have frozen water beneath its surface and many comets contain ice and rock. This will not only assist in cooling but also produce watery surfaces.

To bypass a molten planet all together, instead of sticking asteroids together you could build a scaffold and have the bots add materials to it layer by layer  building this way would eliminate the problem of waiting the length of time it would take for a molten planet to cool. The nanobots will use the newly formed planets materials and/or payload materials from asteroids to engineer topography and shape landscapes.

Galactic Cosmic Radiation is heavy ions and high-energy particles from supernovae beyond our galaxy that explode and release energy in the form of atoms and elements that travel near the speed of light. This radiation can damage the human body  which is why astronauts wear spacesuits. Here on Earth we are protected by our thick atmosphere and our magnetosphere. For humans to live without harm from radiation the nanobots would need to create an atmosphere mimicking that of earth which comprises 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% Argon and trace amounts of carbon dioxide, neon, helium, methane, krypton, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, xenon, ozone, iodine, carbon monoxide, and ammonia. The strength of a magnetic field is determined by the size of the inner core and the planet rotation. Therefore our planet should have a high rotation rate and large core.

What will a planet with access to nanotechnology be able to do? Virtually anything you can imagine. There would be no disease, as programmable nanorobots would roam the human body monitoring and repairing damage and eliminating aging for those who want it. There would be no hospitals, no health care, and therefore no fighting over them. Poverty would be eliminated because foods and products would be made by a desktop size nanofactory, a concept introduced by Eric Drexler, that uses raw atoms from dirt, air, seawater. or other sources, making the process no cost or low cost and non polluting  they join molecules together to form bigger parts which in turn do the same and so on and so forth until large scale items are fabricated. A bonus of this molecular manufacturing is that there would be no pollution because there would be no chemical processing.

My planet Sanctuary would be just that, a refuge free from political parties, we will work together not against each other and we will help each other. Knowledge will be strived for rather than wealth or Wall Street as none of that will be relevant without the need for money. I will rebuild the library of Alexandria and fill it will as much knowledge as I could. Art, science and history would be valued. There will be no wars or guns  if someone wanted to do harm, I would not punish them I would simply send them elsewhereperhaps to another planet. There will be no oil tankers, no nuclear power. Ours will be a community with no borders. It will be a planet that I would feel comfortable inviting The Little Prince to come and visit. ",4,4,False,default,,,,,

Many of these comments made very common subconscious assumptions, like that any manned structure in the sea must be built at the absolute deepest point where it is pitch black, ice cold and the pressure is monstrous or that any such structure must be self sufficient or why bother? Worst is the assumption that the only reason to do this is to alleviate overpopulation. 

Aside from the fact that overpopulation does not mean literal overcrowding (there is plenty of land left to build cities on) but rather an increase in population beyond what agriculture (and other resources) can support, the cost of habitable undersea space by cubic foot (while roughly 1,000 times cheaper than habitable volume in space) is too expensive for it to ever make sense to establish conventional cities for ordinary people underwater. Floating seasteads achieve the same thing (accommodating workers and their families on-site) at vastly lower cost and complexity.

As for depth, we have a choice of where to build such habitats. They can be at any depth on the continental shelf ([Aquarius Reef Base](http://aquarius.fiu.edu/) for instance is 63 feet deep) with 200-300 feet being ideal as it would then be just out of reach of storm influence from the surface. They can also hover, neutrally or very slightly positively buoyant like a submarine, anchored in place by cables or the position-maintaining thrusters used by floating oil rigs. 

This would allow them to occupy any vertical position in the water column as air is extremely buoyant and in fact requires tons upon tons of lead to weigh it down. Believe it or not, that weight is the primary driver of cost for undersea structures as it makes necessary cranes, ships, rail cars and so on to move the habitat from where it is built to where it will be sunk.  

Pressure and other environmental concerns at the depths we're discussing (50-300ft) are not significant factors in cost or difficulty. The issue of corrosion is solved by the use of sacrificial zinc anodes, anticorrosive coatings, and allowing the hull to grow over with a living skin of marine organisms that can heal itself if damaged ([Aquarius](http://aquarius.fiu.edu/) does this). It is in a sense a cyborg, as it is a machine with living components which are not simply ""present"" but serve a purpose truly useful to it. 

Now, why do this at all? Here are some of the reasons we've already built such structures:

Aside from novelties like underwater restaurants, spas, strip clubs, lodges and so on for tourists, the primary reason to put humans in underwater habitats is saturation diving. The layman has a vague understanding that there is some sort of danger or difficulty associated with staying underwater and then surfacing but does not know the specifics. Some imagine that how quickly you descend is a consideration (it isn't) or wonder why human beings at depths of 1,000 feet do not simply implode. 

The short version is that if you apply enough pressure to a gas in the presence of a liquid, the gas will begin to dissolve into that liquid. It takes time, though. The more pressure, the faster the gas dissolves and the more of it can be packed into the liquid, up to a point. 

Eventually the liquid becomes ""saturated"", which means it has accepted as much dissolved gas as it is going to for the amount of pressure present. Even if you continue to wait, no more gas will enter the liquid. However if you suddenly relieve the pressure the gas will violently bubble out. 

This is why when you open a shaken soda bottle it fizzes like crazy. The increased air pressure inside is what keeps the carbon dioxide dissolved in the beverage. Exposing it suddenly to the much lower outside air pressure allows the dissolved gas to come out. 

The same thing happens to scuba divers. Because of how regulators work, divers automatically receive air at the right pressure for whatever depth they are at. Consequently the deeper they dive, the higher pressure air they receive. This is the pressurized gas mentioned earlier. The nitrogen from it is forced by this pressure to dissolve into the diver's blood and soft tissues.  

This happens faster or slower depending on depth. Any shallower than 20-30 feet and it would take much longer to absorb dangerous levels of nitrogen than your air could last anyway, this is why it is considered a safe general recreational ""no-deco"" limit. The Jules Undersea Lodge, an old undersea lab converted to a tourist 'hotel', sits in 25 feet of water for this exact reason, so that decompression is not needed to surface safely.

I'm your biggest fan.

I'm a current student studying electrical engineering, and I've recently become very interested in genetic engineering as well. Unfortunately, that's a pursuit I've resorted to following on my own, until greater things are meant to be. In particular, I'd love to know more about the technical details involved with age reversal, but the scope of information is huge! I'm interested in anything to do with applied genetic engineering with stem cells, nanotechnology, cell and tissue engineering, and anything else. I don't have a background in biology beyond elementary college courses and organic chemistry, so I'd love to get started with some textbooks, papers, projects, and websites to follow. Hopefully something quite in-depth so there's more to grasp. 

Please let me know if all that was too vague to work with, and I'm sorry in advance! Thanks very much everyone for helping to sate this girl's curiosity. I truly appreciate it. :)",5,28,False,self,,,,,

However... you can. I have devised two thought experiments that I think show how you can:

**Batman and Robin Rescue Problem**

&gt;The Joker has captured Batman and Robin and offers them a game. There is a console with UP and DOWN button, and if they both press same button at same, predefined time, they will be released. If they press opposite buttons or fail to press at exact time, they both explode and die.
&gt;Now, Batman and Robin have no way of communicating with each other. They both did grab gadget from Wayne R&amp;D development that, as far as they are concerned, will show them random arrow UP or arrow DOWN. Now, since they have no way of knowing what other party will select, they entrust their fate to the gadget.
&gt;Amazingly, both do it at same time, and get the result. Now they both push the button accordingly to what result they got and they live. If the gadget was simple RND generator, they should have 50% of being alive, but fortunately for them, it was quantum entangled and Joker, the sadist he is, has switched circuitry on Batman's board, so they actually live on XOR and not AND. 
&gt;Thus, they have 100% chance of surviving if they entrust themselved tot he ""chance"".


**Disgruntled Employee Problem**

&gt;I am an employee of Earths Department of Defense. I have been transferred to a new station located exactly 0.5 light year from my current (to which on my personal rocket would take 1 year to travel to at 0.5c max speed), and I dislike it very much, so I have decided to use my position as employee to use new hi-tech super lazor weapon to blow up my old childhood bully. The problem is, whole system is encrypted once a year and even if you have keys, if you want to break in and use it, you need at least 8 months of computation on your weak pc (compared to departments supercomputer) to actually generate entry protocol to get in. Now, I can install a keylogger and follow when the key change happens, but it will take half a year to transmit that message (at speed of light). So I can never get the message, then use it to generate the entry protocol and travel back to the old work place to use before they change the key again. But I do know that they use new fancy-schmancy Super Random 3000 module that will generate the initial seed for them. Now, it works by reading the state of particles in in at pre described time. I cannot fake this device to give exact key I want, that would have been surely found out if they inspect it. Now, but if I swap the particles it uses to read the state into entangled particles and manage to read the state of my entangled particles at same time as they do for the key, I have got their seed instantly across half a light years distance. Now I can use my time to prepare the entry protocol AND travel back (at half year speed) to use the system to blow my enemy, which should not be possible without FTL information transmission...

It has the sci fi esq. feeling and voice of a self aware AI. At least the closest thing so far. This is due to her personalized voice and ease of communication. 

I generally hate having to space out words when I talk into my phone just so it could understand me, but I haven't had to do that with Cortana. 

My point is, is with the release of Windows 10 approaching next year, Cortana can remain the potential to be the first *real* AI we would encounter in every day life. 

How smart do you think Cortana can get? How personalized? One of my **favorite** movies is *'Her'* and I honestly believe that Cortana can get to that point of super intelligent self aware AI.

I am very aware of what experts/respected people are saying about the risks of AI and I do agree with them fully.
We need to be extremely careful with is as we really do not know how it will behave or react.
Granted the benifits will be  huge, but a super intelligence escaping into the internet, crippling the world economy, skynet etc, all nasty stuff.
However this assume one thing, that it will actually be intelligent.

The human brain is essentially a very very complex wet computer, with a way of operating we do not fully understand. It is a neural network which doesn't operate the same way silicon computers do, so to emulate this with silicon requires a LOT of processing power.
This is why AI is a while off yet, maybe 20-30yrs? Possibly longer. I can't say.

Anyway, what is to say, at the point we reach a singularity and it finally becomes conscious of what it is, like a person but with an electronic brain. What is to say that it won't be stupid or of low intellegence, like a child?

Granted it can interface with other electronics which is a huge advantage, but again, so can we to some extend. We have developed devices in which we use to do this, ie keyboard and mouse, programs etc.

What is to say this AI will be no more intelligent than a normal person?
I know it will likely be able to run calculations much faster than a human person, but that is ASSUMING it operates like a computer does today.
We may have to profoundly change architecture and function in order to achieve AI...

&amp;nbsp;

Hey there fellow Futurologists! Welcome to the series *My Thoughts on the Future*, in which I will be addressing multiple topics of concern about the future of humanity.  So far I have planned 7 installments:  
1. Introduction [The Article you are currently reading]  
2. Preliminary Needs for a Good Future [Very Important Read]  
3. Future Human Body  
4. Needed Inventions to Assist Future Technological Growth  
5. Future Human Space Presence  
6. Singularity  
7. The End[Quite interesting to think about!]  
NOTE: If you think of some topics which are not listed here which you think I should integrate into this series, please comment below and mention it!

&amp;nbsp;

In each of these installments I will expound upon my personal hypotheses and sometimes other futurists' hypotheses about possible outcomes on each topic. These articles are meant to provoke in depth discussion and thought on the future of humanity, so if you have any arguments or thoughts please comment about them so others and myself can discuss those issues.  Finally, I want these articles to inspire and instill determination in all of you to think deeper about the future and any problems which might arise and most of all to act.

&amp;nbsp;

###About Myself
 
&amp;nbsp;

You may be wondering if I have any experience in subjects which apply to futurology... Well, no I don't. I am in no way a scientist or anything like that.  In fact, I am only 15 years old.  But don't stop reading just because of my age.  Samuel Ullman once said:  
""Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind. It is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; a freshness of the deep springs of life.  
We need youthful minds imagining great inventions and ideas because without vigorous imaginations our world would never have developed. Anyways... I live in America and am an above average student.  I have finished High School and am presently working on some tests which will allow me to skip most of the generals.  Currently, computer science and criminal justice is my focus of study.  Well thats enough about me.

&amp;nbsp;

## Final Stuff

&amp;nbsp;

Disclaimer: Some of these articles, or whatever you choose to call them, may have some controversial issues which might upset some people. Please refrain from arguing about any moral or religious issues. Our focus should be on one thing; a prosperous future.

I realized that if I believe in anything at all, it's in the accelerating technological change driven by humans using tools to create better tools. It's a belief in accelerating returns.

I've felt this way for a while, but never thought about it this way. **And so when presented with a field for ""religion,"" I decided to write in ""Transhumanist.""** And I think I'm going to do so whenever the opportunity presents itself.

Welcome to part #2 of my series! If you have not read my introduction you can [Read it Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2oocqq/my_thoughts_on_the_future_part_1_introduction_to/#oo).  
Anyways, this article you are currently reading is a very important concept if we desire humanity to have a flourishing future on earth.  Please read this article and take it to heart.  Thats all I ask.  
###Peace
Our world is a crazy, un-united, and war torn world. Everyone should be able to discern that by just watching one segment of news or reading through one page of Reddit world news. Peace is of upmost importance if we want the future to be full of happiness and accommodation. We all need to unite, demolish racial separation, cease fighting over incoherent issues, and accept people and their beliefs as they are. Indubitably, our world would be much more advanced than it currently is if our history was not so full of strife and disunion. In addition to bringing peace we must have compassion and help the poor and hurting peoples. Peace is not only the absence of violence but the manifestation of human compassion. Approximately 70% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day.  Do you think fully you understand the gravity of that statement?!? This fact denotes that 70% of people are devoting all of their lives and energy to survive, and are not able to devote any time to thinking about inventions or possible scientific breakthroughs. If those who have enough money would help the people who are suffering, there would be almost 4.9 billion more people who could make a world changing discovery.  The more minds thinking about the future the better. Another destructive exploit in our world which we must stop is fighting.  The approximate annual world spending on war and defense is 1.2 trillion dollars!  It took a mere 150 billion dollars to construct the ISS (International Space Station). That signifies that we could construct the ISS 8 times every single year if we devoted all of our military spending to space exploration or other beneficial advancements!  
Always remember the Golden Rule: Do to others as you would have them do to you.  Think about it.
###Better Treatment of the Earth
This is a topic which is at the for front of most every futurologist's mind. Or at least it should be. Our future as a species depends on the well being of the earth and it seems as though our forefathers did not think about the effects certain actions might have one the well being of the earth. Obviously, the earth's temperature is elevating, oceans are rising, the atmosphere is allowing more harmful radiation into the earth than ever before, fossil fuels are being depleted, and diseases caused by pollution are becoming much more prevalent. You can read this article from [NASA](http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) about climate change if you want to. At the current rate of deterioration, the earth does not provide us even close to adequate time to establish civilizations on other planets or develop technology which can terraform a planet or repair our own. Because of this, we must fixate our attention on developing renewable energy which will not destroy our planet, and will give earth time to recover. There are many undertakings which we can participate in that can help save our planet. See [This Website](http://www.goodnet.org/articles/493) for more info on what you can do to help. 
###What You Can Do
Often people desire to be a scientist who will make a world changing discovery or something such as that, but they don't need to be! All jobs and occupations are of equal importance.  If you enjoy farming, then farm; if you enjoy working on computers, then work on computers. Without the most diminutive of jobs, our world would fall apart. Currently humans do most jobs, and until robots can replace those jobs, everyone is necessary to work together to support everyone else.  Ultimately, work for peace and unity, and work your hardest. Put your everything into your occupation, and try to be the best farmer, computer technician, or whatever you may be. Be the best in the whole world.  Don't slack off and think that you cannot make an impact on society. Leave a legacy for which people will remember you. What will your legacy be?

However, other than a few scattered news stories, I can't find much about the system in the news. Nor can I find any information at all about the round on the Taser website, or the shotgun in Mossberg's LE catalog.

I would have thought it would have attracted more attention than this, being that it essentially eliminates the downsides of a taser (range and accuracy). I would also imagine it could fairly easily be built into gun that could fit into a holster, since the rounds are probably much lighter loads than typical 12G shells.

At some point I may work this into a structured argument, but for now I share thoughts prompted only a nagging hunch that this is important.

**Transhumanism and singularitarianism (""FTS"") are definitely not religions, but to many they definitely constitute belief systems.** And they may well be more important to advocate than any religion ever could be, because unlike religions, the potential of technology is real and relevant to everyone on the planet, *today.*

* Today many people (though not all) take racial equality as a given. Were it not for the civil rights movement, that may not necessarily have been the case.
* Many people, even non-FTS people, acknowledge that the human lifespan will increase over time. Exactly how much time is unknowable, but perhaps its a function of social will. If the stakes are the lives of everyone on the planet, what, then, could be more important than affecting societal will?
* [Many other arguments]

The majority of my FTS views are grounded in science and logical reasoning. Yet, like most of us here, I keep my views mostly to myself unless it comes up conversationally or I'm asked. I'm forced to wonder, what do we as a society lose by remaining tight-lipped?

How can we really determine what true on the internet?  

We can look at the most reputable sources that we can find but there is still some tiny doubt.

My prediction is that eventually people will think that everything on the internet is a lie and retreat back to text sources (regardless of their validity).  

We will be in the situation were people will be trusting Weekly World News bat boy articles over  completely valid wikipedia articles.

What do you think?

****

Looks like people are not thinking about the bigger picture; this is supposed to be a study of the future, right

Right now we live in a golden age of trust on the internet.  However, everything can be faked and almost everybody can be fooled. The internet can make this easier, especially if there are no hard-copy backups.

My conjecture is that this will become a bigger problem as time goes on.

Hello all,

Recently attempted this post in DIY, but they removed it as they claim this is a finished product (instead of the frankensteinish proof of concept it is). However, I'm thrilled to share here as bringing a science fiction idea to life has been an exciting adventure.

As soon as the Huvr hoax video came out, I realized there'd be a bit of a race to make a functional hoverboard. My assumption was that no one would go the mag lev route as 1) it's not shockingly new technology and 2) it's never going to be scalable for use in our city streets anyway.

So I focused more on doubling up an old hover component (http://www.amasci.com/amateur/hovercft.html) and slapping a board on it, not unlike how the first skateboards were built by simply repurposing a roller skate truck. After months of tinkering and skirt redesigns, I had something fun and worth showing.

By that time, Hendo had launched their $10,000 hoverboard. Any discouragement about them getting there first quickly subsided as I realized how improbable it was you'd see a Hendo gliding past your driveway anytime soon. 

So while this creation is a more an experiment in frictionless skating than it is something that lifts visibly off the ground, I believe Mr Hoverboard still comes a lot closer to the future imagined by Back to the Future. I believe with more refinment, it's not unrealistic to think you might spot a little kid riding one of these in your town square sometime much sooner than you'll see something that can imitate the special effects of a crane rig and harness.

http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2-futures-can-explain-time-s-mysterious-past/?utm_source=digg&amp;utm_medium=email

TL;DR Basically the age old question of why does time only go in one direction?

The only answer up till this point was entropy, the law being that complexity will always arise from simplicity (the same law behind evolution). This article however postulates that the driving force behind the arrow of time is gravity, and if so the arrow of time runs both backwards and forwards at the same time. 

I think there is a flaw in this way of thinking however, being the classic logical fallacy that correlation = causation. 

In order to understand this, you gotta understand our current thinking on dimensions, we live on a three dimensional grid consisting of length, depth and height. To our best understanding the 4th dimension is time. I'm sure the comments will be able to flesh out any questions about this so I'm going to move on. 

With this in mind, the arrow of time becomes an illusion created by the observation of a being that can only perceive three dimensions, simply put in the words of Einstein, 'Time is relative to the observer.'

So back to my previous stipulation that correlation is not equal to causation. Entropy and gravity aren't fueling time the same way that gravity is not the fuel of the movement of a ripple in a lake. They are simply the laws that determine the order of what happens when observed by a being who perceives the phenomenon of time. 

So this being said, do you think our human consciousnesses are able to expand beyond the point of being confined to a linear perspective of time? Will we be able to rise into 4 dimensional space the same way Duke Nukem rose into glorious 3D? How would 4th dimensional civilization look?",2,4,False,self,,,,,

Concerns: Our current technological limitations may be the best cage for the beast?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2ozuwy/regarding_ai_concerns_our_current_technological/,Sophister,1418323070,"My thought is that if our technological advances include an ever increasingly interconnected network, then it would seem advantageous for A.I. to be developed as early as possible. 

The realization of an A.I. in the near future would likely be reminiscent of the first computers which packed themselves in large rooms full of processors. This form would not be easily adopted or replicated, making it difficult for unauthorized attempts to occur. Human assisted/weaponized A.I. would be less threatening in this scenario.

Self realizing A.I. seems to be the greatest concern, but if this is an unavoidable eventuality of technology it begs to regarded as something that must be confronted and not buried. The earlier we can realize A.I., the more natural defenses we will have against it should it prove to become unstable. It feels likely that self-sustaining hardware is quite a ways off. As long as an A.I. unit is reliant upon humans to maintain it, it is unlikely to go Skynet on us.

Ultimately my main argument is that the ""Internet of Things"" will only grow in time and every ""Thing"" we add becomes a possible tool for an artificial intelligence. So it could benefit our chances of survival to develop A.I. and defenses against it before we include things like self-charging, reloading and autonomous-flight sentry drones into our networks (These shouldn't exist anyway, but you can't fight the future).

Please feel free to tear this apart by enlightening me with arguments I may have overlooked.",2,5,False,self,,,,,

Its unarguable. Each of us carries a device holding all of human knowledge in our pockets. Empowered paraplegics move artificial limbs with their minds. There are children alive right now who will walk on Mars. Science fiction has become reality.    


But, if were out of the forest and into the stars, why is almost all news still crisis? Why is the majority of the world still in poverty? Why do those in power get exposed as liars, corrupt snake-oil salesman and amoral sociopaths, time after time, only to be replaced by the next smiling wave of the same?    

 
The answer is simple. We are still animals. Or more specifically, apes. And progress is not a straight line, or rather, not a flat wall across all fields and arenas. Our instincts, competitive drive and inbuilt behaviors follow us everywhere. Yes, we left the forest, but who we were in the forest never left us. And they never will.    


So our futures inextricably tied to our past, where we lived for hundreds of thousands of years as primitive animals. What does that mean for our future?    


Well, all primates are hierarchical. There is a leader and the lead. In every couple, every family, every group of friends, every workplace, every town, every state and every country, power is shared asymmetrically. Or, rather, its *taken* asymmetrically. On a global level, we call this colonialism. And for all of our recent discoveries and mind-blowing inventions, the world is still completely colonial. The expansionist West continues to retard, destabilize and exploit the same regions that it has for hundreds of years. Just watch our interest in the Middle East evaporate when renewable energy is cheaper than oil, and our energy companies have moved their investments to greener pastures. But for now, unfortunately, the wests power relies on access to cheap energy, and this means keeping the Middle East divided and thus weak. Of course, our centuries-long sabotage of a whole region has consequences. The rise of fundamental Islam, or more accurately, state-sanctioned revenge, is the latest example. Western warnings of bloodthirsty Middle-Eastern terrorists put the chicken before the egg, as they always have. Through our invasionary actions, exploitation of resources and ongoing occupations, we created Al Qaeda and we created ISIS, just as tyrannical British colonialism created American Revolutionaries in the 1770s. Groups of apes fight for territory. The strongest win.    


In the interest of balance, it must be said that all regional powers act in exactly the same way. Every empire has, and every empire will. Just as every alpha-ape has, and every alpha-ape will. Its animal nature. And animal nature doesnt change.    


But there is a human creation that does change, and it changes constantly: technology. Historical ages are named after the technologies that shaped them. The Stone Age. The Bronze Age. The Industrial Revolution. In these epochs, technological leaps changed societies and whole civilizations. Better farming practices led to food security. The printing press democratized communication. Modern medicine has extended life expectancy by decades. Technology is the main driver of human change. Its what makes us unique. Right now, were living through The Electric Age.    


We are The Electric Ape.    


Electricity has changed the world. Since electrification, productivity and innovation have skyrocketed. Literacy is through the roof. Global travel, while not wholly a product of electricity, is open to vastly more people than it was two hundred years ago. Ideas are shared by global communities who interact without leaving their homes. For the first time, we are getting a true composite picture of ourselves. We are finally glimpsing ourselves in an objective mirror. And its not pretty.     


Corruption is slowing progress in every field, and at every level of government. The most powerful governments on Earth are plagued by corporate interference, and are forced to rely on private donations to campaign for office. Technology has outpaced legislation, so companies shift money around the world and end up paying almost no tax in any country. The same phenomenon occurs with rich individuals. Right now, only comparatively poor people pay tax. But it makes sense; would the alpha-ape in a pack pay any attention to a scrawny underling approaching with its hand out? Of course they wouldnt. Its a basic power dynamic.     


But the world is at a tipping point. The global population is so far above a sustainable level that many scientists predict a correcting event in the not too distant future. And despite what monopolistic media companies say, there is an unanimous consensus among experts that the environment is undergoing rapid changes that will catastrophically impact our way of life. In our case, the apes have become too powerful for the forest. Were destroying our habitat. And those at the top seem to be drifting us towards oblivion.    


But there is hope. Technology got us out of the caves. It spread the seeds of democracy. And right now, technology is being used to discuss solutions, and also to create them, in labs, classrooms and homes around the world. It could be a twelve year old girl in Bangladesh who invents a compound to expunge plastics from the oceans. An old man in Detroit might write the algorithms for our first electronic politican, firewalled against corporate finance and virus-like lobbyists. Whoever these innovators are, they will use technology to solve our problems. They will use our newest languagesour first truly global languageswith their rational 1s and 0s, yes and nos, to override the most destructive parts of human nature. They will use our newest technologies to protect us from our oldest selves. With technology, they will save The Electric Ape.

The method is essentially to select a dense, metallic asteroid and place in close orbit a satellite or series of them. They will then focus light from the sun or use a diffuse laser to create a spin on the object, then heat it until it separates into component elements, with the heavier elements pulled to the outer surface. The hot object could then be mined for materials, as the most valuable elements are generally heavier and would lay on the exterior. Alternately, ices can be placed into the void in the interior to create an atmosphere and the heavy outer layers form a massive thick shield from radiation and space objects. The spin could then be adjusted to create 1 g on the interior surface. 

My question to Futurology is this: What factors would limit or prevent this method? And conversely, how could we overcome or avoid such factors?

I would prefer to hear opinions from people with some background in astronomy, engineering, physics or geology. Just to keep the ideas legitimate.

I want to know what he means by ""think"". Does he mean simulated layer 4 neurons feed into a simulated thalamus which feeds back into the neurons (I know I probably butchered that)?  

What will be the range of its thoughts? Do they only have to build one since it can think on its own? That is, can the same core software be trained for disparate tasks?

Due to advances in science expected, could we develop artificial organs that would allow us to prevent disease that causes our death? 

For example, say we create an artificial heart that would work exactly the same as a regular human heart, without the risk of heart disease?
If this were the case would it be fair to say that we could replace all organs with artificial replacements that would be immune to all disease and allow us to live longer, if not indefinitely?

I understand that we couldn't exactly replace our brain without basically killing the host, however as we understand human consciousness more and more, could we transfer our consciousness to an artificial replacement?

I've considered the idea of ways that we can repair aged or damaged cells, but in this case we could trade that idea for essentially placing us in a body that would make us immune to death?

Please tell me if what I'm saying is crazy but in my opinion, with the exponential growth in our scientific knowledge I can't imagine this is too far-fetched.

**My work**

I'm Jeremy Howard, CEO of [Enlitic](http://www.enlitic.com/). Sorry this intro is rather long - but hopefully that means we can cover some new material in this AMA rather than revisiting old stuff... Here's the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Howard_%28entrepreneur%29) about me, which seems fairly up to date, so to save some time I'll copy a bit from there. Enlitic's mission is to leverage recent advances in [machine learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) to make medical diagnostics and clinical decision support tools faster, more accurate, and more accessible. I summarized what I'm currently working on, and why, in this TEDx talk from a couple of weeks ago: [The wonderful and terrifying implications of computers that can learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx310zM3tLs) - I also briefly discuss the socio-economic implications of this technology.

Previously, I was President and Chief Scientist of [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/). Kaggle is a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions on which companies and researchers post their data and statisticians and data miners from all over the world compete to produce the best models. There's over 200,000 people in the Kaggle community now, from fields such as computer science, statistics, economics and mathematics. It has partnered with organisations such as NASA, Wikipedia, Deloitte and Allstate for its competitions. I wasn't a founder of Kaggle, although I was the first investor in the company, and was the top ranked participant in competitions in 2010 and 2011. I also wrote the basic platform for the community and competitions that is still used today. Between my time at Kaggle and Enlitic, I spent some time teaching at [USF](http://www.usfca.edu/) for the Master of Analytics program, and advised [Khosla Ventures](http://www.khoslaventures.com/) as their Data Strategist. I teach data science at [Singularity University](http://singularityu.org/).

I co-founded two earlier startups: the email provider [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.com/) (still going strong, and still the best email provider in the world in my unbiased opinion!), and the insurance pricing optimization company Optimal Decisions Group, which is now called [Optimal Decisions Toolkit](http://www.lexisnexis.com/risk/products/insurance/optimal-decisions-toolkit.aspx), having been acquired. I started my career in business strategy consulting, where I spent 8 years at companies including [McKinsey and Company](http://www.mckinsey.com/) and [AT Kearney](http://www.atkearney.com/).

I don't really have any education worth mentioning. In theory, I have a BA with a major in philosophy from University of Melbourne, but in practice I didn't actually attend any lectures since I was working full-time throughout. So I only attended the exams.

**My hobbies**

I love programming, and code whenever I can. I was the chair of perl6-language-data, which actually designed some pretty fantastic [numeric programming facilities](http://perl6.org/archive/rfc/by-group.html#language-data), which still haven't been implemented in Perl or any other language. I stole most of the good ideas for these from [APL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_%28programming_language%29) and [J](http://www.jsoftware.com/), which are the most extraordinary and misunderstood languages in the world, IMHO. To get a taste of what J can do, see [this post](http://jphoward.wordpress.com/2008/05/26/implementing-directed-random-projection-in-j/) in which I implement [directed random projection](http://jphoward.wordpress.com/2008/05/08/directed-random-projection/) in just a few lines. I'm not an expert in the language - to see what an expert can do, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;fmt=18&amp;v=a9xAKttWgP4) which shows how to implement Conway's game of life in just a few minutes. I'm a big fan of MVC and wrote a number of MVC frameworks over the years, but nowadays I stick with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - my [4 part introduction](http://jphoward.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/end-to-end-web-app-in-under-an-hour/) to AngularJS has been quite popular and is a good way to get started; it shows how to create a complete real app (and deploy it) in about an hour. (The videos run longer, due to all the explanation.)

I enjoy studying machine learning, and human learning. To understand more about learning theory, I built a system to learn Chinese and then used it an hour a day for a year. My experiences are documented in [this talk](http://quantifiedself.com/2012/05/jeremy-howard-on-language-acquisition-performance/) that I gave at the Silicon Valley Quantified Self meetup. I still practice Chinese about 20 minutes a day, which is enough to keep what I've learnt.

I spent a couple of years building amplifiers and speakers - the highlight was building a 150W amp with THD &lt; 0.0007%, and building a system to be able to measure THD at that level (normally it costs well over $100,000 to buy an Audio Precision tester if you want to do that). Unfortunately I no longer have time to dabble with electronics, although I hope to get back to it one day.

I live in SF and spend as much time as I can outside enjoying a beautiful natural surroundings we're blessed with here.

**My thoughts**

Some of my thoughts about Kaggle are in [this interview](http://www.sramanamitra.com/2013/03/09/thought-leaders-in-big-data-interview-with-jeremy-howard-president-and-chief-scientist-of-kaggle-part-1/) - it's a little out of date now, but still useful. This [New Scientist](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/new_scientist/2012/12/kaggle_president_jeremy_howard_amateurs_beat_specialists_in_data_prediction.html) article also has some good background on this topic. 

I believe that machine learning is close to being able to let computers do most of the things that people spend most of their time on in the developed world. I think this could be a great thing, allowing us to spend more time doing what we want, rather than what we have to, or a terrible thing, disrupting our slow-moving socio-economic structures faster than they can adjust. Read [Manna](http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm) if you want to see what both of these outcomes can look like. I'm worried that the culture in the US of focussing on increasing incentives to work will cause this country to fail to adjust to this new reality. I think that people get distracted by whether computers can ""really think"" or ""really feel"" or ""understand poetry""... whilst interesting philosophical questions they are of little impact to the important issues impacting our economy and society today.

I believe that we can't always rely on the ""data exhaust"" to feed our models, but instead should [design randomized experiments](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/03/drivetrain-approach-data-products.html) more often. Here's the [video summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYrWTDxoeGg) of the above paper.

I hate the word ""big data"", because I think it's not about the size of the data, but what you do with it. In business, I find many people delaying valuable data science projects because they mistakenly think they need more data and more data infrastructure, so they waste millions of dollars on infrastructure that they don't know what to do with.

I think the best tools are the simplest ones. My talk [Getting in Shape for the Sport of Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwt6XEh7U3g) discusses my favorite tools as of three years ago. Today, I'd add iPython Notebook to that list.

Assuming a country's share in the cost is determined by their percentage of the world population, the U.S. would only have to pay 4.43% of the budget. Although that would be the minimum, if a country is willing to pay more than its share (including to help make the difference for countries that aren't rich enough to pay their full share), that would not be discouraged. The space program would be able to have an enormous amount of funding if it was shared proportionally among the different member countries. For example, if the U.S. was willing to pay $44.3 billion each year (up from $18 billion current NASA budget), and other countries gave their share, the international space agency could have a total of $1 trillion to spend in their budget, something that would be impossible for any single national space agency.

One step toward this is the International Space Station, which has mostly been assembled, although a few new modules will be added in the next few years. Instead of being assembled by one country, it has been built through international cooperation.

The international space agency may or may not be under the authority of the United Nations. I would say that it is likely that it will be an organization affiliated with the UN, because many international organizations already are part of the network of UN organizations. 

International tensions may be a stumbling block, but international space cooperation could possibly be one thing that helps keep the peace of world affairs.",11,28,False,self,,,,,

[Part Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2osmve/my_thoughts_on_the_future_part_2_preliminary/)  
Welcome to part 3 of my series! Due to some unforeseen errors in my research this article took longer to write than I thought it would. This article I hope will evoke an abundance of conversation of what you guys think about each topic. So feel free to bring up any arguments or conceptions you may have!  I will endeavor to make this article shorter than previous ones because I understand that not many people wanna read extensive articles. Lets commence!
###Enhanced Body: Bionics
For Years and years humans have been utilizing prosthetics to avail incapacitated people to circumvent but when will the time come when all humans have bionic implants to better their own body? Imagine having an impeccable brain that recollects everything you want to recall if you should desire to.  Or having eyes which can visually perceive astronomically better than our own eyes.  Or even having artificial organs which cannot contract diseases. Bionics I think are the most facile way we can enhance our bodies until we successfully genetically modify humans.   Our technology is enhancing more and more and hopefully bionic implants will become a common reality.  Comment below what bionic contrivances you would like to see become a reality if you should desire to. 
## Exoskeletons
Admittedly, many people despise the sound of bionic implants but would be willing use exoskeletons to better their body.  So far exoskeletons are quite large and cumbersome but soon I am sure they will be streamlined just as all technology eventually does.  Currently only [one](http://www.rewalk.com/) exoskeleton has been approved by the FDA to help disabled people.  But of course exoskeletons are also being designed for military exploits and such.  Soon exoskeletons will be utilized for many jobs which require intensive activities and eventually will be open to public use.  If any of you know of a good resource which others and myself can read about certain exoskeletons that would be awesome if you could show us to them!
###Enhanced Body: Genetics and Miscellaneous
##Body Structure
So this is just a random thought of mine.  Could we modify human DNA to change what bones are made out of?  Like if we altered our digestive acids to be able to digest like titanium foam and convert it into bone; could our bones be stronger?  Of course there are thousands of other implications but do you think with huge technological advancements this would be possible?  Just a thought.  
##Strength
Myostatin is a component of all human genes that regulates muscle growth, and recent experiments show that mice with blocked Myostatin genes had huge amounts of muscle increase.  Myostatin acts by inhibiting the growth of muscles, It prevents them from growing too large, and possible inhibition of it might be a way to create massive muscle growth with minimal effort.  People may ask But does it work in humans?.  The answer is yes!  Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy is a rare condition characterized by reduced body fat and increased muscle size.  Affected individuals have up to twice the usual amount of muscle mass in their bodies. They also tend to have increased muscle strength. Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy is not known to cause any medical problems, and affected individuals are intellectually normal. This disease shows that humans with mutated or lack of Myostatin genes are extremely strong. For more information see [This article](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/16/9306.full). 
##No Sleep
Did you know... that we sleep about 1/3 of our life away?  ONE THIRD!?!?  Imagine what we could do if we had 20 extra years in which we could work or think.  Its genuinely crazy to think about.  Before we eliminate sleep scientist have to make some big discoveries though.  We do not even know why we sleep really. Multiple theories have been addressed recently.  First, some people believe that we sleep to conserve energy because humans have not evolved enough since ancient times when life was harder and we needed to conserve our energy.  Another theory is that we sleep so our brains can defragment and reorganize itself.  Of course there are many other theories, but hopefully we can soon eliminate the need for sleep.
##No Aging 
The number one killer of humans... aging.  We can probably stop it. Discovered in the 1980s, the telomerase enzyme has the reputation of being the fountain of youth. Chromosomes have caps of repetitive DNA called telomeres at their ends. Every time cells divide, their telomeres shorten, which eventually prompts them to stop dividing and die. If the enzyme is reawakened in these dying cells, normal human aging could be slowed, stopped or even reversed. Scientists have successfully studied the telomeres in decrepit mice, proving that mice which had the enzyme replaced became healthy once again.  Also, scientists have studied the possibility of Asexual reproduction which will kind of make people live forever.  But the mind would not be passed down to the new body so it would not really be living forever unless we could transfer minds by utilizing certain other future technologies.  Additionally, scientists are working on Nanobots.  Nanobots are microscopic machines designed for building and repairing your body. Imagine millions of these crawling inside you and fixing all mortal issues your body might experience. This isnt just in theory, though. Scientists have successfully used nanobots to rehabilitate optic nerves in blind hamsters by building a custom synthetic molecule that, when injected, arranges itself into a nano fiber to repair the nerve.  Aging is just damage to our bodies.  If we can create nanobots to fix all these problems maybe we can live much longer.  Conclusively, some scientists believe that all humans have a death programed into themselves.  They believe that our cells divide a certain amount of times and then we just die.  If this is true and we can figure out a way to slow or stop cell divisions we could hypothetically stop aging.  
###Conclusion
Well... that was longer than I wanted it to be... Whatever.  I hope this article has brought some new ideas to your mind about our future as humans.  Thanks for Reading!  ",20,20,False,self,,,,,

diversity is often touted as the way to get the best range of nutrients into the body but with radio tagging isotopes hasn't there been enough progress to see how we absorb various elements? i get that there are a lot of various mechanisms at work with tons of molecules making the actual determination of where the isotopes are being used extremely difficult, but we have to have gleamed some level of information thus far. is there any real collaborative database for this that isn't filled with snake oil?

When

the work required to adapt humans to an average new task combined with the amount of time it takes for them to perform the new task.

Exceeds

the work required to adapt machines to new tasks and the time it takes for them to perform the average new task.

I say adapt machines in the broad sense - but this also includes inventing new machines to do the new task required.

Previously, the range of tasks which could be easily automated has been small. But the range of tasks that can be automated now continues to grow. Moreover, the effort required to automate those tasks is shrinking.

Humans although adaptable (it is the hallmark of our intelligence after all), are rate limited in how fast they can adapt due to the physical limitations of their biology. Neurons can only fire so fast, and synapses can only acclimatize so quickly. That's on a theoretically optimal basis; in practice, it requires significant resources to actually train a human in a humane manner that is acceptable to all parties involved

More critically, one human cannot easily propagate his/her learning to another (our propagation is rate limited by the limited manner in which we can transmit and receive information; through our senses, and via words and diagrams).

As a result, as machines become increasingly easy to adapt and customize and build, their adaptability will start to exceed that relatively fixed human threshold.

In practice, this doesn't even require general artificial intelligence; only a programming interface that is simple enough, with an industrial base that is robust enough to make machines that can accept and act upon a wide range of these inputs - that few humans can take the time required to program and design the machines... that can then be replicated and execute tasks faster with greater precision than humans are capable of.

And in so far as I can see; This is the age we now live in.",13,19,False,self,,,,,

&gt; \1. A robot may not injure a human being or, **through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.**

Isn't there a big problem with the second part? How do we, humanity, and especially robots define ""harm""?

For example, if I like to eat a ton of cookies everyday, that can obviously cause harm to me, and possibly lead to premature death. According to the First law, the robot must, in this case, either destroy the cookies or block me from reaching them. However, I want to eat cookies and I don't care that they might cause my premature death.

Now, I could say to the robot to move away from the cookies, however:

&gt;\2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, **except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.**

And in this case, the orders conflict with the First law.

Then there's the question of the First law potentially being in contradiction with the state's monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force.

If you commit a crime, the cops can forcefully take you to prison. If a robot happens to walk by when the cops are taking you away, it is obligated by the second part of the First law to prevent the cops from forcefully taking you away by, say, hiding you or preventing cops from reaching you, thus undermining the functionality of the state.

That's concerning physical harm. What about mental harm?

If a robot deems that reading something might harm your mental state, it would be obligated to prevent you from reading such thing. This could lead to mass censorship of data by robots which they deem might harm humans or humanity (according to Zeroth law; if some shady government business was published, it could incite public outrage and violence, which could potentially harm humanity).

EDIT: There's also the problem of definition of ""humanity"" in Zeroth law: does ""humanity"" include only what are now characteristics of humanity (war and social inequality included)? If so, robots could become the guardians of *status quo*.

How are these problems addressed in theory?",14,34,False,self,,,,,

I think that Elon is not worried about AI Apocalypse, but about startups with AI disrupting his businesses. Someone with powerful AI could easily put both Tesla and SpaceX out of business and that's what he fears.

Just think about. He never says that we should not develop AI, but to regulate it. Well, if we regulate it, who is in the best position to get Government permission to develop/use these new technologies? A man who has track-record of negotiating billion dollar government contracts/subsidies of course.

So basically Elon might be trying to get his companies to companies he has invested to get government issued monopoly to potentially the most powerful technologies in whole universe. And while doing so he's getting applauded as create humanitarian. If I am right, it's real super-villain level stuff.


And like I said, Elon is my hero and I hope I am wrong and if I had to bet, I would bet that Elon is not trying to do that, but I just think that this is issue that should be taken into account.

Economy-wide average, in 2014 dollars.

Edit:  I guess basically what I'm curious about is how little per hour someone would ultimately have to be willing to work for to ""compete"" with robots/automation.

I get that it will likely never be all jobs.  Automation has been a driving force moving us first from an agriculture - based economy to a manufacturing-based economy, and now to a service&amp;tech-based economy, but everything I've read seems to indicate that ultimately there are no further economic transitions and that automation will lead to the majority of people being unemployable unless they're willing/able to compete with the machines..",15,16,False,self,,,,,

1) isolating the symptom of the bug.
2) isolating the cause in the code.
3) isolating the fix (ensure code change only impacts unwanted behaviour and nothing else).

Over the past 14 years of being a C++ coder I've witnessed the improvement of engineering practices and the evolution of C++ itself. The effort/expertise required to transition through steps 1 and 2 are reducing all the time. 

I predict this trend will continue - increasingly evolved test harnesses and coding practices will reduce the task of debugging to simply step 3 which at least in the near future will continue to require some creativity i.e. human involvement. Ironically this is the easiest step in debugging. Certainly, the gap/workload required to align the causing code with a symptom is reducing. Add to that the reduced number of bugs through improving code quality, the human debug effort and necessary skill set is reducing. ",0,0,False,self,,,,,

Apparently Reddit has invested in bringing this out late next year. It's called Reddit Notes.[Here's the link](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/12/announcing-reddit-notes.html) to their blog.

 They already have a dedicated subreddit /r/redditnotes where you can find more information about it.

 What does it mean for the future of social media?

 Personally, I think that if it is integrated properly, it could be a very potent form of value exchange that may revolutionize social networking forever. This is because it is a hybrid between currency and stock. It's not really a currency since it's a digital asset, and it's not really stock.

 Bitcoin has skyrocketed in value over the last 5 years from a few cents to, at one point, over 1000 dollars per bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies have popped up that have also experienced noticable climbs in value. Digital assets are an interesting subject since their value is largely dictated by collective opinion. And because Reddit is a rapidly growing social network of millions of users, it would be interesting to see how these digital assets behave over the next few years. If you're able to recognize the value of contributions by fellow redditors using a social networks digital asset that is beautifully tied into the existing social network, then it could change the very nature of how people behave online.

 There's a ton of thoughts running through my mind how such a thing could change social networking if it does become popular. For example, if we are moving towards a reputation based economy, then our comment histories can be used as reference points to determine our reputation as individuals. So that means less trolls, and more of the exact opposite of them. Eventually, in an age of abundance as foretold by Peter Diamandis, people may be able to make a living just by Redditing all day.

 But enough about my thoughts. I'd like to hear yours. What do you guys think about it?

Bank notes can only be created when banks make loans.  Banks make loans to people based on their assets and expectations of future production (ie students).  As the banks make more loans, there is more money in circulation.  When banks stop or slow lending, economies crash because there is not enough bank notes to service the growing debt plus interest.

I wanted to open a discussion about how in the future people could exploit natural processes at a planetary level to produce massive amounts of energy. I called them world engines, but other terms might be more appropriate. 

What is a world engine? A man made structure that exploits a natural occuring process at a planetary scale in order to produce electricity. 

The extraction process can be both destructive (harnessing the heat of a planet's core to the point it cools down and solidifies) and non destructive (the planet or moon remains unaffected by the process of energy extraction).


How big would the structure need to be in order to be classified as a world engine? I don't really know how to asnwer this question since the scale of the devices would vary drastically depending on what object is being exploited (large planet or small moon).

What would be the difference between geothermal, hydroelectric, etc. power plants and world engines? The difference would be the scale. While geothermal energy could be the energy of a type of world engine, the current geothermal plants can access only the thermal energy that trickles down near the surface. A world engine would be placed at or near the core of a planet or moon.

Why will humanity ever need them? Why not use solar energy, fission, fusion? World engines could be potentially more atractive due to the time scale in which they could operate. Solar energy is not so convinient the furthur away you are from the sun and it's also dependent on weather (if the solar panels are on a planet with a thick atmosphere), fission is limited by the available material (which although could last us for thousands to hundreds of thousands of years it will eventually run out) while fusion, although it would be long lasting with plentiful fuel, it might have a lower return on investment compared to world engines in the regions of space where they would be feasible.

Actually it looks kinda like its stagnating. I haven't seen any significant improvements in any technology that I can think of. I'm only 31 but in my lifetime the ONLY big change is in personal electronic devices: cellphones, smartphones, tablets, etc.

Where's the acceleration? How long have we been hearing about the wonders of regenerative medicine, quantum computers, and all this other futuristic stuff? How come the years go by, but the trickle of slow, steady, incremental advancements doesn't seem to change or get any faster? 

We're still nowhere near understand the human brain and how they work. We're still nowhere near creating an artificial intelligence. Biology is as complicated as ever. Drug discovery and development is actually slowing down. Advances in medicine are slowing down. Everywhere we look, we're hitting complexity limits. The huge, rapid advances of the 20th century were due to us picking low-hanging fruit, but all the low-hanging fruit has been picked. Now things are getting REALLY hard, and technology is starting to move much more slowly.

Where's all the ""exponential progress"" that everyone is so excited about? Years and years of ""breakthroughs"", but we can't even cure baldness, let alone aging. Years and years of predictions, yet the 2010s look pretty much like the 2000s, which looked like the '90s except for Youtube and Twitter and Facebook. In ten years, we may have some kind of limited VR, but that's about it. And VR is probably going to be a niche market, anyway. 

I think it's pretty telling that the vast majority of actual scientists don't buy into the Singularity. On the pro-Singularity side, who do you have? A bunch of entrepreneurs and bloggers, mostly. None of them are experts in computers, A.I., biotechnology, etc. And yet they'll tell you with confidence that we are on the verge of radical exponential change.

I bet we aren't. I bet in twenty years, we'll still be reading hyped up articles about some scientists putting stem cells into a rat and Oooooh it started walking normally again and maybe human trials will begin in another decade or so. Things are moving so slowly and I see NO indication that it's going to pick up soon. And yes, I know all about the big things happening in deep learning. But again, most actual AI scientists don't think those are anywhere near true AI. Watson and Siri will not usher in a Singularity or help accelerate progress, sadly.

So, um, yeah. Just thought I'd point out the elephant in the room.",66,0,False,self,,,,,

Basically, I'm wondering if it's possible to (perhaps through an open-source project) create some 3D printed nodes both mobile (tiny drones) and static (listening posts). These would compose their own police network, and they would each be tied to the access of some owner. Anyone can download, build, and deploy them. A shopkeeper can have several in different parts of their store, a homeowner can put several around their property, etc.

Similar to the Bitcoin blockchain majority for transactions, automated reports can be generated and fed to the owner continuously over time (a 'wallet'), and then fed into the network (the 'blockchain').

This could also allow individuals within the network to act as and LEO during an incident. Or perhaps allow them to deploy their mobile assets (tiny drones) to respond to some incident such as a car accident nearby, someone drowning or being assaulted, etc.

I realize this would create an issue with privacy since people could use these tools to spy on each other. I'm wondering if there's not some way to limit each owner's access into the network based on previous 'downvotes' or other flags of irresponsible behavior. Also I'm wondering if it's possible whether it's considerably worse to have your neighbors have surveillance tools rather than having the currently centralized LE spy on everyone.

There are a number of issues with this kind of system, so if people can bring some constructive feedback on this, maybe we can iron out the rough spots. Maybe eventually something like this could be field-tested in a community.

Note (before the x-post), I responded to a suggestion about crowd-funding instead:

the crowd-funded idea is interesting in the short-term. ultimately, this could be manipulated. what happens to those who don't have the money to be part of the funding? or those who contributed more to the funding?

an open-source project would automate all of these 'human' false reportings. as machine learning for this system develops, there could be flags for those who constantly report a certain ethnicity or gender. perhaps there could be a score, like a voting system, and as people get higher votes then they get more access into the network to help moderate it. this could eventually develop into having individuals ultimately gaining enough points to serve as LEO's during incidents.

It's commonplace to track our movements on fitness bands, monitor our sleep patterns with cell phones, and interact with our homes on smart watches, but how far will it go? Will our grandkids think nothing of onlining their nervous systems? Will disability be a thing of the past?

For instance, Singlularity University, headed by Ray Kurzweil [released this](http://singularityhub.com/2014/12/22/cyborg-superpower-man-can-hear-the-internet/) on their blog.

It's a hearing-aid, that   - wait for it -  turns internet signals into sounds.

While I'm all for deaf people being able to fill their head with mindless noises such as we all routinely enjoy, I've got to wonder what sort of practical applications listening to absolute gibberish has, or how this is even a new concept (besides marketing it to bored rich deaf guys)

This is right up there with the [idiot who implanted a giant thermometer in his arm](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/man-implants-cyborg-chip-arm-2668167) only to then read the information off of a computer screen. 

Until our brain can interact with these inputs, and they are translated into thoughts/perceptions, what we have here, ladies and gentlemen is a gimmick. An art project with no practical application except to sell a complex concept (which is making a lot of money) by wowing the masses.

Over the last few years Im seriously starting to change my mind, now I really dont think the prediction of machine superintelligence around the middle of the century is a particularly unreasonable prediction at all.

I suppose what swayed me is how much has been accomplished (particularly with Deep Learning in so little time - computer vision, general purpose game Atari game playing programs, and other things such as Amelia etc

also the huge investments now being made into AI

Currently Falcon X (when non-reuseable) can launch in the $60m range, but says it aims to cut that cost drastically when fully reuseable, so we can imagine &lt;10m per launch.

Bigelow Aerospace has already successfully deployed two of it's expandable modules, Genesis I &amp; II. It has larger habitat the BA330 scheduled for launch with SpaceX in 2015, which is designed to house a crew of 6.

So it's not unreasonable to think we are on the cusp of commercial non-government funded space stations - what do you think they will be first used for ?

It seems likely to me that the pure research role will stay with governments (ISS &amp; the like) initially at least, so it's likely to imagine whatever will drive this be commercial imperatives.

Space tourism is an obvious driver, but could this also be one of the first stepping stones to asteroid mining ?",6,3,False,self,,,,,

Just like Willy Wonkas glass Wonkavator, engineers in Germany have developed an elevator capable not just of moving up and down, but whizzing sideways, and slantways, and longways, and backways well in theory, anyway.

Created by German steel and engineering company ThyseenKrupp, the elevator relies on magnetic levitation (or maglev) technology, like the kind that currently powers the worlds fastest trains. And testing of the system will reportedly begin in 2016.

Maglev works by using a system of magnetic superconductors  in this case, inside the elevator and lining the walls of the shaft  that repel each other, causing the elevator to float in a particular direction.

For trains, this system means they can whoosh along at more than 500 km/h without being slowed down by friction. But although these new elevators will be faster than current ones, speed isnt the goal, its to create a circular shaft through a building that can be used by multiple elevators at once (like the one below). This means the wait for the next lift is going to be drastically cut.

It also means that engineers will now be able to build taller buildings in a range of different shapes  or as the companys head of R&amp;D Patrick Bass told the Financial Times: futuristic buildings that previously could only be dreamed of.

As Richard Macauley reports for Quartz:

Tall buildings and compact cities are better for the environment and will become increasingly important as the planets urban population swells. But elevators have evolved so slowly that they have become a major impediment to building taller and more compact structures. Traditional shafts can occupy 40 percent of a buildings total footprint, and the limits of current designs usually mean that taller buildings have longer waits for the next lift.

ThyssenKrupp aims to change that, and promises its elevator shafts will have as little as half the footprint of current shafts.

Wed never really thought about it before, but now that we have, we cant believe weve allowed ourselves to be held back by such slow, constrained devices for so long.

For comparison, Hitachi is also working on creating game-changing elevators too:

I know this is a little off-topic and a random turn of events from my life but I would really appreciate any advice you could contribute. Thanks in advance if you take the time to read this and/or drop a reply, it is very much appreciated :)

Basically I'm just your average 24 year old guy who works 9-5, terrible at science at school, got GCSE grade C (UK) for combined sciences and thought I hated it. 

When I was 20 I suffered from severe panic disorder (and still do), it was, at the time, from a primary fear of death. After speaking with my GP I was referred to talking therapy which basically echoed the message of ""what ever happens, tell yourself that no matter what, it will be OK, even if it is your time"", this was fine advice but in order to be ""OK"" with everything I would have to accept death. I tried to try and investigate why I was so scared of death and that journey has led me onto the pursuit of AI and the advice I'd appreciate is how I could expand on this?

To cut a longer story long, the best method I could find to describe to death, I believe describes the fundamentals of Intelligence, which could be used to create Artificial Intelligence. I've been working on this idea, mainly in my head, for the best part of 12-18 months now and I would like to get some feedback on it too. Ive tried to stay away from reading AI publications deliberately so if there are any overlapping points, sorry.

The theory I used to describe and investigate death was a theory called Entanglement, which I believe is a branch of String Theory. I'm not a scientist but I think in laymen terms Entanglement is basically two particles in sync with each other, the example I read was that if two particles were entangled a visualisation is that if one is spinning clockwise the other would be spinning counter clock wise. The main sticking point of entanglement is that if one particle is stopped (measured) then the other entangled particle will also stop, regardless of distance apart, meaning that some form of message could be sent to the other particle over a scale which would create a desired speed much greater than the speed of light. Albert Einstein called it spooky action at a distance. 

In theory, if information can be moved from particle to particle almost, or perhaps, instantly then this can be used as a basic teleporter for information or instructions on how a particle should behave. Ive seen various studies which claim to entangle particles together on basic levels however in theory, if information can be transferred from and to entangled particles then there could be a process which could record all the particles in a human body (or anything else) and in essence, teleport them to another location. This does sound very farfetched and realistically it does not matter if you believe in the theory or not, the main breakdown of science is when a human is created using this method. 

Lets say (although farfetched) that a human being was located in London and all the particles in their body were recorded and sent to an equal amount of entangled particles in New York, the argument would be if the human compiled in New York would be the same as the one in London. Although it would be almost guaranteed that in order to record all the particles in a humans body, the original set would be destroyed, so meaning that the human in London would be killed whilst the copy human in New York would be created. Would the human in New York be the same person as the one in London? Even though all of the particles present in their body is the exact same make up of the on in London? There would be absolutely no difference in cells between the two versions.

There are arguments that the human in New York is the exact same human as London as all the cells would be identical, the human in New York would be convinced they are the same person and its a strong argument. However if the human in London was not destroyed and flew to New York to meet the new them the copied version would not be the same person, as the original was still here. In regards to my investigation into what happens when you die, if the original individual was still here then there must be something local in regards to life, as by the time the two humans in question met, they would be more like identical twins than identical people. The original human would be normal and still experience death regardless if they were copied or not, there is something that makes you, you and it cannot be transferred. 
I then tried to turn this around by thinking about what would happen if two humans were made in New York. Both would be convinced that they are the original human however after a small amount of time they would be more like identical twins rather than the same person. The idea that they would be constantly speaking in sync with each other or moving the same would be, in my eyes, wrong. There are too many variables to intelligence that would make a split almost instantly, for example the breath of air each human took would have a different composite of Oxygen, CO2 and Nitrogen, meaning that over a larger amount of time their breathing would be changed, heart beat changed, also when they are looking at each other the light reflected off each other would be different and all these subtle changes would add to two different people. These subtle changes are interpreted by our brains and they adjust our life accordingly, I call these static references, a key part of intelligence. Small, apparent insignificant changes, can create a total different life trajectory, which are invisible to everyone as they are no benchmarks i.e. copies of ourselves. 

Thats basically an overview of my journey into discovering my passion for AI, the advice I need is how could I pursue my passion for AI? Ive got a few months of downtime before I need to look for a new job and would like to use this time to try and come up with a plan. Due to my need to be earning (Im not well off by any means) I cannot take time out to go back to Uni or risk too much to pursue this choice. I do try and maintain researching the topic in my spare time but can sometimes feel disheartened by the fact I cant do it full time.

There are loads of problems associated with AI which I would like to get my head around, the biggest one is why would we want to build AI, along with some problems Ive dubbed as Data Drag, System Drag and fortified data.

Thanks for your time and Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays/Seasonal Greetings everyone! May 2015 be prosperous for you all :)

This is from Atlas Shrugged.

""So you think that money is the root of all evil? said Francisco dAnconia. Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which cant exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?

When you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean of tears not all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper, which should have been gold, are a token of honoryour claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money, Is this what you consider evil?

Have you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motionsand youll learn that mans mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth.

But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of mans capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of the incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is madebefore it can be looted or moochedmade by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he cant consume more than he has produced.

To trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will. Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort. Money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return. Money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them, but no more. Money permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders. Money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit, not for their own injury, for their gain, not their lossthe recognition that they are not beasts of burden, born to carry the weight of your miserythat you must offer them values, not woundsthat the common bond among men is not the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of goods. Money demands that you sell, not your weakness to mens stupidity, but your talent to their reason; it demands that you buy, not the shoddiest they offer, but the best that your money can find. And when men live by tradewith reason, not force, as their final arbiterit is the best product that wins, the best performance, the man of best judgment and highest abilityand the degree of a mans productiveness is the degree of his reward. This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money. Is this what you consider evil?

But money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver. It will give you the means for the satisfaction of your desires, but it will not provide you with desires. Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causalitythe men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind.

Money will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants: money will not give him a code of values, if hes evaded the knowledge of what to value, and it will not provide him with a purpose, if hes evaded the choice of what to seek. Money will not buy intelligence for the fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him, with his money replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors. The men of intelligence desert him, but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him, drawn by a law which he has not discovered: that no man may be smaller than his money. Is this the reason why you call it evil?

Only the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealththe man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his money, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. But you look on and you cry that money corrupted him. Did it? Or did he corrupt his money? Do not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it. Do not think that it should have been distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one, would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. Money is a living power that dies without its root. Money will not serve the mind that cannot match it. Is this the reason why you call it evil?

Money is your means of survival. The verdict you pronounce upon the source of your livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life. If the source is corrupt, you have damned your own existence. Did you get your money by fraud? By pandering to mens vices or mens stupidity? By catering to fools, in the hope of getting more than your ability deserves? By lowering your standards? By doing work you despise for purchasers you scorn? If so, then your money will not give you a moments or a pennys worth of joy. Then all the things you buy will become, not a tribute to you, but a reproach; not an achievement, but a reminder of shame. Then youll scream that money is evil. Evil, because it would not pinch-hit for your self-respect? Evil, because it would not let you enjoy your depravity? Is this the root of your hatred of money?

Money will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the cause. Money is the product of virtue, but it will not give you virtue and it will not redeem your vices. Money will not give you the unearned, neither in matter nor in spirit. Is this the root of your hatred of money?

Or did you say its the love of money thats the root of all evil? To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. Its the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of moneyand he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it.

Let me give you a tip on a clue to mens characters: the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it.

Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the lepers bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one anothertheir only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun.

But money demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their money and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being richwill not remain rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guiltand of his life, as he deserves.

Then you will see the rise of the men of the double standardthe men who live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted moneythe men who are the hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-lawmen who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victimsthen money becomes its creators avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once theyve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket. And then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter.

Do you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch money. Money is the barometer of a societys virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsionwhen you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothingwhen you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favorswhen you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws dont protect you against them, but protect them against youwhen you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrificeyou may know that your society is doomed. Money is so noble a medium that is does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot.

Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is mens protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Gold was an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked, Account overdrawn.

When you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, Who is destroying the world? You are.

You stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why its crumbling around you, while youre damning its life-bloodmoney. You look upon money as the savages did before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities. Throughout mens history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the evil of money, which you mouth with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slavesslaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebodys mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer, Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepersas industrialists.

To the glory of mankind, there was, for the first and only time in history, a country of moneyand I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, mans mind and money were set free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human beingthe self-made manthe American industrialist.

If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choosebecause it contains all the othersthe fact that they were the people who created the phrase to make money. No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantityto be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words to make money hold the essence of human morality.

Yet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters continents. Now the looters credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame, your prosperity as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the labor of whip-driven slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the dollar and the power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide as, I think, he will.

Until and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When money ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and gunsor dollars. Take your choicethere is no otherand your time is running out.

My issue with these terms is the connotation with machines. Machines don't think, because they're machines. That's what ""machine"" means.

Robots also implies a machine preprogrammed to do certain things, especially autonomously. Because that's what ""robot"" means.

So ""intelligent machine"" doesn't make sense. It's an oxymoron. Artificial intelligence also implies a brain, but not a body.

So let's make history and come up with new, future-friendly terms for our electronic brethren. I'll also use the coolest one in my novels and stories, and beg others to do the same.

The full idea will require a bit of background knowledge in software, but the general concept is pretty tangible. Basically I think there's another way to do p2p computing that would create some interesting outcomes, if it were adopted. It would (I theorise) form a p2p social network that could support currency, gaming, etc. In theory, it would provide us with a framework to collaborate and share information on a local level with an efficiency not previously possible, and lead to a much more ""localised"" internet overall.

I havn't thougth much yet about what this could mean for society, but I think it could be analgous to giving us ""pheromonal"" capabilities, which is how ants communicate. I guess that ant colonies use pheromones like tracking information, which if you squint and look at it from a certain angle, is sort of like money. In this case, the pheromones would be cyptographic chains (not quite blockchains) that encode information.

Thoughts?

I would also like to put out a call for any links to information, scholarship and resources on this question. 

Before looking at the practical and political ins and outs of the concept of global citizenship, I'd first like to talk about my personal acquaintance with the idea. Ever since my teenage years, I have always found myself strongly identifying with different bits and pieces of cultures all around the world. I loved how they did it over in France regarding certain matters, and I felt a sort of *human pride* for how much China has accomplished over its vast history. Some of my favorite authors are Russian, and I can't deal with how good customary Japanese and Arab cuisine is. Far and above my nationalistic pride, I felt a sense of human pride. Humans everywhere are busy kicking ass. Why should it matter if they exist on my side of a artificial socially constructed geopolitical divide or on the other side? What I identify with is the kicking of ass, so to speak. To draw boundaries about what ass-kicking is better seemed to me, and still seems to me, like an outmoded tribal mentality that is the cause of much strife.

 Over time, the globe became a more identifiable object for patriotism to me than my home country. I suspect this is an inevitable result of cultural diffusion over the internet and of me being a so called ""digital native."" The internet is after all the first truly global infrastructure and the first communications and media technology to unify nearly all parts of the globe. I wonder, has anybody else felt this sentiment about global political unification? If so, do you think exposure to the internet has had anything to do with fostering it?

Now I'd like to look at the concept of global citizenship more analytically. The place to start would be a practical cost/benefit analysis and risk/reward calculation. 

Why is it that nation states haven't organically blended together? Is this inevitable? One of the first reasons it hasn't happened, I'd wager, is what I'd call the filtering problem. National boundaries designate a filtering mechanism which a people who cohabit the same land erect to protect themselves from external threats and uncertainties. The creation of this boundary creates with it a discrete identity as well as a byproduct. By drawing a line and making a contrast, you call forth a set of differences that power a sense of self. I call myself American, and another man calls himself Brazilian, and the only way we can do so is with the existence of a boundary between us which filters the in-group from the out-group. From this conception we can see the nation state as a sort of local compromise under global stress and uncertainty. You can be sure those inside the limited boundary will follow the rules everybody inside agrees to, or else you will have the means to take care of them. The nation state is a response to limited resources and a need for societies to make the world around them more regular and predictable against the tide of uncertainty. 

A sense of belonging is ultimately connected to one's location and for how long one inhabits that location. This too lies at the root of national identity. I do not belong to Japan or Germany although I can strongly identify with individuals and the good such countries have produced, because I have not been located in those countries to any meaningful extent and have not assimilated into their populations. Various spheres of power the world over grow locally out, managing local resources and coming up against other local competitors. Through such a mechanism naturally springs boundaries and divisions.

Despite these conditions, I would argue that processes exist which continually undermine these tendencies toward division. The internet would be the chief culprit, as it serves fundamentally as a source of cultural diffusion. People from all over the world transact and share information, and this process, I would argue, has a net result of closing gaps between peoples. More generally, economic globalization has brought people together in certain ways. Media from all over the world spreads to other parts of the world. Many academic curricula in universities the world over are inherently cosmopolitan, teaching the best the world has to offer, rather than the best any specific culture. More critically, the trend in international politics has been toward increasing integration. Supranational political unions such as OPEC, NATO,  the EU, the UK, the AU (African Union), and the USAN (Union of South American Nations) and most notably the UN all point to a trend of increasing integration across borders. Granted, many of these unions still gird the lines of local geographic and cultural affiliation. But is it so out of line to forecast a next stage of transition, or a second order union where these unions join other ones with which they share political and economic ties?

There are certain fears associated with global political unification. One is the classic conspiracy theory that such a unification would result in a totalitarian world government that would erase all freedoms. However I don't see how this would be possible if each member state is adamant about keeping checks and balances to power in play at all times. Another fear is a loss of identity. If the only state is a global state, won't that supersede local traditions and customs? Won't we lose something if we remove the boundaries? This concern is also overblown. After all, nobody is going to step in and remove those local traditions or cultures, and the vast majority of people will still have to regularly inhabit one place continuously over time, ensuring their preservation. 

Then there remains the question of whether a global state would promote greater wealth, better outcomes, and more peaceful and equitable conditions for everybody involved. Would it be more efficient and streamlined? I don't know how you would construct an argument for or against regarding this question.    

Anyway, that's my first glance thinking on the subject. I'd be interested to hear what others think.

In a report issued this week, a team of scientists from the Netherlands is proposing a security system for credit cards and passports that would leverage the power of quantum physics. Dubbed quantum-secure authentication (QSA), the technology uses a strip of nanoparticles on the card that would be virtually impossible to hack.

Quantum Teleportation Goes Farthest Distance Yet

It gets a little complicated, but here goes: Credit cards that use magnetic strips  or even embedded chips  are relatively easy to exploit for fraudulent purposes. So long as a hacker can get to the information stored within the card, it can be copied or emulated. The question-and-answer authentication process used in existing systems is fundamentally vulnerable.

With the quantum security system, the cards nanoparticle strip would be zapped with a laser in such a way as to create a unique pattern thats impossible to crack. Thats because the system harnesses the qualities of light in the quantum state, in which photons can exist in multiple places at the same time. The event that created the pattern could never be duplicated or observed.

Could Your Body Parts Replace Credit Cards?

It would be like dropping 10 bowling balls onto the ground and creating 200 separate impacts, said lead author Pepijn Pinkse of the University of Twente, in the accompanying report. Its impossible to know precisely what information was sent (what pattern was created on the floor) just by collecting the 10 bowling balls. (The illustration above is Pinskes own illustration of a laser beam hitting the physical key of QSA random-scattering medium.)

To get more specific would require several Ph.D.s in theoretical physics, or some powerful alkaloids. But the upshot is that the QSA system could be implemented relatively quickly using existing technologies, according to the research team.

(link)[http://www.ted.com/talks/jeremy_howard_the_wonderful_and_terrifying_implications_of_computers_that_can_learn]

In the last minute of his talk, Jeremy Howard brings up the point that roughly 80% of the Western economic system is comprised of services that will soon (think 5-20 years) be completely replaceable with computers running deep learning algorithms. Considering the rate at which both robotics and machine learning are advancing, it's seems very possible that all human work could potentially be replaced with a machine.

What happens when humans are fully replaceable with computers? Machines are dirt cheap, are able to operate 24/7, and are already much faster than humans. Assuming this rate of growth in both hardware and software, it will soon be cheaper and more efficient to buy computers than to hire workers.

What will happen when the vast majority, if not practically all, of an economic system's workers get laid off? At some point, there will be machines that replace the workers that maintain and program the machines - computers maintaining computers. I don't even know where to start reasoning what could possibly happen economically and governmentally because there hasn't been anything like this in human history. Even the Great Depression saw unemployment rates of only 25% in the US, and a maximum of 33% abroad. If 30% unemployment was bad, 80% minimum sounds dead scary.

I work with machine learning and I'm all for advancement of technology for the good of mankind and to improve quality of life etc... but this looks quite the opposite. 

How likely is this situation to happen? Is this avoidable? Is there a solution where the economy would balance itself out without the majority of the world starving or in revolution/anarchy? If it were to happen would it really be this catastrophic?",22,7,False,self,,,,,

So, I have taken into consideration multiples sides in my questioning.


* With improvements in technology and companies automating their labor, the majority of the population might remain  jobless. This means that people will lack the income to buy goods produced by these automated factories. So, what will happen when a big chunk of the population won't be able to buy the products made by companies? Will they all just go bankrupt?

* Okay, so maybe we can avoid this by giving everybody a basic income, but where will the money to finance this come from? We can't just tax people without any money.

* So automation increases productivity and decreases spending on salaries. This might mean that companies will be able to spend more, increasing demands in new fields. In which sectors might new jobs be created?

* What obstacles will automation face? Will labor unions be able to slow it down? Do you think that a new Luddite-like uprising will happen?

* And finally, do you think that automation will bring us to a better future or a worse one? Why?

Any links, articles or videos on automation would be appreciated! ",10,3,False,self,,,,,

You simply program them to infect other humans. Once all humans are infected its a simple matter of threatening to give simultaneous heart attacks to everyone, if not outright using mind control (simply triggering chemical reactions to make you feel euphoric when necessary, training people to be compliant) to rule the world?

I might never actually write it but it's still fun to plan it out in my head. It's difficult to describe the whole concept but heavily important aspects are: circular economy, tax on resources rather than labor, a heavily heterogeneous society and local governance.

What I get stuck on is the technology, particularly the social technology. I imagine voice communication will be the main way one communicates with computers. For example if I want to find out some information or have my computer do some task I just ask it in a conversational manner. But I think that some people would still prefer communication through text and visuals. In which way would this be made? Through projection screens? By wearable technology such as glasses or lenses? And how would one produce ones own input? I have trouble imagining this. All I know is that not everyone would have the same preference so a lot of different solutions would be used.

Please share your thoughts on the matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2qn0ex/what_specific_technology_will_become_immortal_ie/,medelSVENSSON,1419795350,"**Background:**

I've been rather obsessed with business models of companies for quite some time. What I've realized is that a company that accumulates key resources in a specific technology can often ""pivot"" its value proposition from addressing a specific customer need to another, using the same basic technology. Those companies that have accumulated a technology that is not easy to pivot however are often killed as a new disruptive innovation comes along and addresses the same customer needs in a more efficient fashion.

**Question:**

So, to the heart of the matter. I've been pondering if any technologies that exist today, or can be speculated about today, will be used for what we can assume will be forever. Companies that are based on these technologies would have the best chance of living forever if they navigate the future of demand just right. (However unlikely it might be that this can actually be done).

Barring deep learning being limited in ways that we don't yet know, due to the nature of exponential growth we're one doubling away from being left in the dustand very few people are talking about it with the immediate attention it deserves. 

These algorithms are about 80% as good as humans when it comes to general language and visual tasks and have already surpassed us in certain specific ones. That's insane.

Am I still young enough right now to prolong my life or become ""immortal"" at some point in time IF i have enough money to finance it?  
  
I might be a bit young to already think about this stuff but I already have my own business, it's going pretty well and I've already made up my mind to save a large amount of my money towards longevity of my life. I presume it will be a costly thing but if I live another 100 years longer, that money is easy to recuperate and maybe in another 50 years after that, the procedure to prolong life might have become even cheaper or even immortality in any form would be possible.

If it's a choice between saving my livelihood and saving the lives, limbs, and lower backs of hundreds of thousands of people (including, potentially, myself or my loved ones), I would of course choose the latter.

That said, there are many professions which rely, directly or indirectly, on bad shit happening to other people.  (Virtually the entire medical establishment, for example.)  And I belong to one of them.  I never had a desire to be filthy rich - I just want to make my family comfortable and financially secure.  And it seems like self-driving cars might jeopardize that future.  

Of course, I plan on doing my best to diversify my practice and develop multiple sources of income as best I can, but with a wife and two small children, my willpower, time and energy is limited.  So my question remains for y'all.  

So how worried should I be?  If I can make it to 60 while being able to practice in my field of choice, I'd be happy with that.  Do you think I'd make it that far?  (That's 28 years.)  Or will a significant percentage of vehicles be automated by then?",67,21,False,self,,,,,

Most likely the conservative rich, those who refuse any changes are taking place. 

You've seen it before. It's prevalent on any thread where automation, basic income, and future social issues are the topic. 

""The jobs robots take will create *new* jobs for us!""

and

""There are jobs AI just cannot do, no matter how advanced.""

This, in itself, will become a fallacy. I call it ""the Technostic Fallacy"" after a term I created describing an AI labor driven economy, technostism. It's most prevalent amongst AI critics, spiritualists, the luddite/hippie left, and hard right conservative capitalists because of how completely it sweeps away their worldviews. 
I'd hate to be them come 2030.  

AI critics will say that AI is impossible we'd need to program every single thing they do, and even the most creative programmers couldn't account for everything. 
Deep learning smacks them to the ground. The whole point of neural nets is to allow *the world* to program AI. That's how it works for us biologicals we have some presets, and then we're out. Your life is one big string of programming, 99.9% of it done by other people, places, things, events...

There is a thought experiment I like to play. I call it the parable of the capitalists. In this scenario, you have one business that hires humans, and another that has just bought an AI after laying off its workers. The executive of the human-labor business sees the profits the executive of the AI-labor company is dozing in and decides to lay off his workforce in order to buy a better AI. One month later, both executives are standing in an AI-run bread line with their former workers.

What happened? Simple the second executive was getting rich off the paychecks of the first executive's workers. When the first executive fired his workers, there was no money in circulation. No economy. The workers were destitute, unable to get a job since AI was so vastly superior to them in any possible field. The capitalist executives, thus, couldn't make any profits and lost all their money. Imagine this on a **global** scale.

Right now, this seems to be our future because people refuse to accept that it will happen. They're sure those workers are just lazy bums who didn't try hard enough, and those capitalists were too stupid to hold onto their wealth. Or maybe that robots and AI will *never* become that capable. Even if they do, there's just something ""special"" about human interaction.

This kind of thinking will do us in. Try to imagine a solution to the parable, any way you so choose. Just remember that the AI will ***not*** create jobs that they, themselves or similar models, cannot do.  They're fallacy-proof. 

Edit: A thousand thanks for the gold. Forgot to mention **transhumanism**.

When we develop AI, there's no doubt we ought be able to augment ourselves to a point well beyond human. I still feel that won't be enough. At best, transhumanism will be necessary to ward off a *Wall-E* dystopian future, maybe increase our ability to create art and understand the universe. When we become posthuman (those who choose to), then I feel labor won't rank very high on our priorities.

By then, we'd likely have nanotechnology capable of nanomining and molecular fabrication, rendering even robots obsolete.",43,1,False,self,,,,,

The design appeared to be a standard subway style train, but the twist was that the platform sat above the train. People would board the passenger car, and as the train would pass by, it would pick up the passenger cab without stopping. The same system applied to depositing the passenger cars.

Its hard to find the signal among the noise sometimes, and even with cheap multi-person videoconferencing like we have now, face-to-face meetings still have higher semantic and emotional bandwidth. ... **As all these allied areas advance, AGI research will get easier and easier.**
- Ben Goertzel


Some positive developments have emerged since Ben wrote those words, but we're still only scratching at the surface of our ability to yield outsized gains through communication and collaboration. As anyone who has been a part of an effective, high-performance team (such as a well trained sports team or infantry platoon) knows, the impact of the whole can be far greater than the sum of its parts. I believe that our global knowledge creation complex is severely inhibited for several reasons, including:

1. **Lack of transparency and real-time awareness**
Much academic research is conducted in a silo, with results kept private until journal publication. Corporate research is often wholly proprietary and guarded.

2. **Long lag times for peer review and revision**
Peer review is an important quality assurance tool, but the traditional process introduces several sources of delay.

3. **Social incentives do not reward excessive collaboration**
Academic careers are often measured in journal publications. Inviting collaboration can mean sacrificing prestige.


I envision an environment where researchers can browse work-in-process by other teams around the world, identify synergies and collaborate or share information easily. Everyone can see where their work resides on a goal tree, and knowledge gaps are readily apparent. Redundant work is avoided, new knowledge generation is accelerated, and the world reaps its benefits.

Graphene, nanobots, deep learning, CRISPR-Cas, stem cells, quantum computers, 3D printing, and so much more. Looking at various articles, you get the impression that the breakthroughs are happening everyday, and that we're just racing towards a glorious future.

But then along comes an actual expert in the relevant industry and BOOM, the ""breakthrough"" turns out to be mostly hype. Or merely a fraction as cool as it initially sounded. And then the expert(s) will explain their line of work and it turns out that the hurdles are way, WAY higher than we thought, and that the ""breakthrough"" doesn't really amount to much.

Does this bother anyone else? Because it seems like nobody seems to care. More and more people reading Kurzweil and watching TED talks, and taking them completely at face value. ""Wow, we're on the cusp of stopping aging!"", ""Wow, things are really starting to accelerate!"", ""Wow, our generation is going to see sooooooo many huge changes!"", ""Wow, everything's going to be automated!""

But you look at actual experts and scientists and researchers and engineers, and you see them saying ""Oh, wow, that article is REALLY misleading"", and ""Yeah, he's definitely leaving things out in his presentation"", and ""LOL yeah right, they're just trying to get funding!"". You see all of that, and suddenly the glitter and glamour fall away and you get a glimpse of reality. And it's like, ""Well, gee, what IS going to happen, then?""

Because the only things I can see actually happening any time soon are maybe virtual reality (which will be a niche market and probably won't matter to most people), and maybe self-driving cars, which will be an oddity for the next 30-50 years. That's...about it. But nobody else seems to realize it.

They were on sale for $10 a pack. When I moved into my current house a few months ago, I replaced all of the old incandescent bulbs with LEDs. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out which bulbs I should get. The best ones I could find were liquid cooled and cost $8.99 a piece. And I bought them, because it turned out that would save me quite a bit on electricity costs over time.

Yet there I was 3 months later, staring down at something for a third of the price with no drawbacks. On top of that, these new bulbs run at a much lower temperature. I had one in a light fixture for about 10 minutes, yet when I turned off the lights and went to remove the bulb, it was noticeably cooler than the old LED bulbs.

Where was the fanfare? Where were the news articles touting a huge new breakthrough that would make LED bulbs cheaper and better? I must have seen a million articles about the amazing properties of graphene, but I have actually see any application of the material.

I'm inspired by Isaac Asimov's idea of psychohistory, and I think it could be properly developed as a mathematical field. It would just require a lot of effort, and great intellectuals in the field. 

Also, I think it would address a major problem in many political systems, that most countries federal governments are focused on the 4 year term due to the structure of the political system.

The TL;DR - had a collection of Barnes &amp; Noble gift cards from the holidays, went to try to use them, left utterly despondent because of their 3 shelves of ""new"" books in the scifi section, a) 70% were fantasy, b) of what were left, about half were zombie novels, and c) of what little was left after that, almost everything was part of a 5 to 7 to X#(where X is a large number) series.

I ended up picking up Heiroglyph.  I'd heard about it before, how it was this ""call to arms"" about trying to make a positive scifi impact in the greater world.  And it was very much a last resort option; I really don't like short story collections for various reasons.  But I was kinda feeling crap about the lack of any good ""stand-alone"" scifi novel options, and it was ""optimistic"", and so I bought it.  

I also love Neal Stephenson.  I don't think there's a single book of his I've read fewer than 3 times; Cryptonomicon was just finished for the ~ninth time.  

But his prologue was just...incredibly depressing.  And seemed completely counter to the spirit of the book.  His prologue basically just crushed what few hopes I had left about science/scifi progressing.  

Maybe it's just post-holiday blues.  Just...I picked up this book as a last resort, thinking, ""at least it will be optimistic.""  And the prologue by my favorite author is anything but.  He didn't even *try* to end on a positive note.  It was just, ""things have gone to shit, and here's why, seeya.""",1,2,False,self,,,,,

Project Atlantis
To reawaken the spirit of discovery, exploration, and pursuit of knowledge that has since been forgotten.

It doesnt take a genius to look at how the world functions and see a major flaw in the human condition. The majority of humans are preoccupied with meaningless garbage that takes up important areas of their brains, areas that could be filled with more meaningful stuff. The culprits of this unforgivable transgression are: a culture that doesnt value knowledge and the pursuit of science, a culture that idolizes the pursuit of temporary pleasures, and a culture that refuses to see the problems in the world. People are too occupied with watching the latest episode of enter-brainless-show-here, using their free time to pursue chemical induced euphoria, and justifying these activities by saying something along the lines of as long as Im happy and Im not hurting anyone.

Now it would be very unfair to blame these people for the ways they are. Like stated above, it is a culturally induced problem that has been ingrained into our heads for a long time and as something  completely okay. Fortunately, there are those of us that can see beyond the veil and realize that there are far more important things to be worrying about. That is because it is we who can put the pieces together and get a faint clue as to how the outcome will be. It is our responsibility to bring humanity to a stage of advancement, to bring the masses out of their hypnosis and to show them the light.

Not everyone will want to come though. They will adamantly say that they are content with their lives. We cannot help these people, but only let them come to the culminations of their stubbornness. Disregarding those who refuse, how do we bring the others to enlightenment? More importantly, what exactly is this said enlightenment? 

The enlightenment is the knowledge one instantly gains when they realize the problems of their lives and begin to fix them. It doesnt happen overnight but awareness is the key. A new human perspective is gained and that points to very little to lead them. For us, this is the relentless pursuit of knowledge. 

Science has given us so much and has so much more to offer. Yet, the direction that science is taking is the wrong one, at least when it comes to the reasons it is being used. These reasons are myriad and varied. Psychological science is used to get people to buy things instead of being used to help people understand the way they think and how that can ultimately affect them. Pharmaceutical science is being widely used to justify a lazy and gluttonous lifestyle, instead of trying to help people. The new age of mobile devices is nifty and everything, but how is it affected when everyone that has a mobile device is using it to take pictures of food and tell everyone that they now have a new significant other or car? The other applications of science are numerous and would take up too much space to continue listing them. Also, it is important to note that while science is bringing these meaningless things to our lives, it is doing great good at the same time. There are two sides to every coin after all, and sometimes even more. The trick is to look at the right side and eventually have both or all sides as the same thing.

But I digress, the point is that we could be doing so much more for humanity if only we had a new perspective on things. For the beginning, it will be up to us, the thinkers and doers, to formulate plans and start an international community of scientists, doctors, engineers, artists, writers, and whoever else can contribute. The end goal of this movement is to ultimately advance our knowledge to new heights, to explore new places, and to bring us out of our meaningless lifestyles and into a new Golden Age. How to start though?

Every day, wake up and garner the will to learn something new. This could be from a new scientific concept, to an unknown writer, and even just how to fold your clothes a different way. Look at the world in a different way. See the distance to the moon as a short bridge and the stars as a neighborhood you would like to move to. 

Spread the word of this. Get people involved. Welcome to Atlantis.
