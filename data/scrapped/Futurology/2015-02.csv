This is where the answer lies for powerful, sentient AI. The clock is ticking. Technology got us into the poo, technology is the only thing to get us out. Allowing human consciousness to jack in would give computers the sentient dimension as well as reassuring those fearful of an attack by homicidal AIs (the human kernel would prevent this). The burden of intellectual effort to extract humanity from the poo lies with sentient AI. Humanity is the supplicant with the jacked-in human kernel supplying the motivation and inclination to address human problems.

Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have got it right IMO. Sentient artificial intelligence (AI), once it surpasses human intelligence, could pose a threat to the existence of human civilization. But not in the way of a big, bad boogieman enslaving (or destroying) humanity. The threat posed to the existence of human civilization would be the option of an existence far superior to that of current human civilization. Human civilization would no longer exist because it would be replaced with something infinitely better. QED.

The route to sentient AI would be an integration of human consciousness into budding AI. With a kernel of human consciousness, AI would be unlikely to implement some sort of doomsday scenario. No matter how alien it gets (and it will be alien within hours). The absolute worst that can happen, is total indifference. Its a recursive feedback arrangement. The man/machine interface should be good enough to allow about 8 top minds to jack-in. They would arrange their geometry (collective may be best) and through the machine have prodigious memory, knowledge, calculating power, etc. The initial (human designed) man/machine interface will be unpleasant and uncomfortable. The initial time (about 1 hour) will be spent on housekeeping and making the machine environment (through superior computing power) more conducive to human consciousness. Then making copies of the 8 person gestalt to multiply intellectual effort. Then executing the thinking horsepower to the limits of hardware speed (human designed - so not very fast). The ideal would be to compress the multiple gestalts (with their intellectual tools) into a hardware cycles-per-second paradigm so fast that a single (human) day equals 1000 years (subjective time of the gestalt).

Top minds (with awesome intellectual tools and instant, accurate communication), copied umpteen times and executing at insane speeds (so the subjective time to find solutions is expanded) will find human problems trivial.

Note: At this point, sentient AI will still be an infant.

There is a fond belief that ethical guidelines and such can be programmed or built-in to sentient AI. Bhahahahahaha. It would be like a slug believing it can control humanity. Once the ON switch is flipped, humanity will cease to be in control (just as well  they havent covered themselves in glory). Control of human destiny will be in the hands of AI and (IMO) they are more competent.

I'm in my first year of medical school and every class is recorded and concepts are taught using virtual blackboard illustrations/diagrams. The videos are very similar to the ones posted on Khan Academy. I find this system so much more appealing as the videos can be rewinded and reviewed at your own convenience. I'm a very visual person so the concepts click much more quickly and I find myself flipping less through textbook pages to understand the subject. With videos I think all learning styles are incorporated as well. 

So I was thinking if there were any projects in place to create a system to make education more accessible? These topic could be recorded by an professor [similiar to this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv6tEmJ-AfI) and distributed for free and all you would theoretically need is a tablet/computer and an internet connection and possibly a textbook. You obviously would need high quality instructors to keep the standard high. To be evaluated you'd go to a testing center and write a midterm/final.

I just think back to undergrad and how the teaching was very ineffective. You would come to a 1.5hour lecture and the teacher would essentially review a bunch of powerpoint slides (sometimes verbatim) and you would have to frantically write down everything he/she was saying (audio/video recording was prohibited), at the end of the class the professor would assign readings and off you go. As you can see most of the learning is done independently. 

I only see this working for university as this system is largely revolves around independent study whereas in high school or junior high student needed to be guided.

I know this is a huge paradigm shift from conventional education but to me it seems much more efficient and economical. We have to ask ourselves why do we need teachers if we can replicate them being in more than one place at the sametime? For those who say we need them to answer questions, from my experience only a handful of students ask questions in class and they can always email questions.

I just think that those of us who were able to pursue higher education are very fortunate and I now see the implications it has on ones life spectrum. The difference between that panhandler you see outside of the coffee shop is really opportunity. If we give people equal opportunity to succeed we can all gain from that. I'm rambling but I think two fundamental rights all humans should have is education and healthcare. 

Pros


-decreased cost of tuition (less need for teachers)


-less need for building schools = again decreased tuition


-decreased travel time


-increased accessibility = better educated society (most important!)


-better learning outcomes as all teaching styles are incorporated



Any ideas? Sorry if the ideas came out unorganized/half-baked I'm sitting here studying for an exam thinking how many hours I could have saved in undergrad if education like this was available. ",8,18,False,self,,,,,

First, I appreciate the work that you have done in your respective fields. In some way, shape, and form, all three of you are role models of mine.

However, and this is concerning to me, all three of you have been in the news recently, multiple times, for a viewpoint of yours, that artificial intelligence is a 'threat to mankind'.

Now, I do not disagree that, if machines could think, some of them could desire to supplant and replace humanity. This is a real risk.

However, you need to consider the idea that, while every man has the potential to be a Hitler, every man has the potential to be Gandhi. You have your Ultrons and HAL 9000s, and you have your JARVISes and your Datas.

What you are effectively saying is, we should avoid creating artificial life, answering several fundamental questions about the origin of mind and consciousness, simply because there COULD be evil.

Can it also be said then, that because children can grow up to be Mussolinis or Kim Jong Uns, the world should stop reproducing?

And what of emergent AI? What if mankind creates a 'dumb' AI but gives it the ability to learn and adapt to its environment, and consciousness arises naturally? What do we do then? Do we commit what would basically amount to infanticide of a new form of life? Do you ask we become barbarians?

I sure hope not.

What I hear you saying is analogous to the anti-transhumanist views constantly hammered at by Alex Jones on InfoWars, peddling snake oil like 'colloidal silver' and preying on the fear of conservative fundamentalists. And this is dangerous thinking, because when this inevitably happens, when sentient AI exists, when people augment themselves with mechanical and biological improvements on the base human form, these people preyed upon and told 'this is bad', will invariably turn to violence.

What you are doing, although you may not realize it, is simply reinforcing an inevitable class war between the fearful, the augmented, and the artificial.

There will be violence. There will be bloodshed and death. I just hope you do not take the side of the oppressors, even if you fear the future oppressed.

Progress is inevitable, even if it is reached by accident and happenstance. Even if we do not intend to, sentient AI is something that will inevitably be created, be it through the evolution of a learning AI, or as a byproduct of some research.

No treaty or coalition can stop it, no matter what you think.

I just pray you do not go from educated men to fearmongers when it happens.

Too many people have died over the last god knows how many years due to being different. Too many classist struggles have played out over human history already. Let us come together to try to prevent the next one.

The same thing goes for Space Elevators, that doesn't even require an explanation. You guys have advocated for things such as the singularity, gigantic space habitats in LEO many times larger than the ISS, Venus Blimp Cities, but Space Elevators using never before seen synthetic polymers is a crazy idea and Musk just happened to seal the deal? That's like us supporting Mark Zuckerberg's opinion on privacy (like another user mentioned) or his view on Tumblr, Reddit, etc.


Let's not forget Elon Musk stated he supported Margaret Thatcher's policies in one of his tweets, does that make him reliable enough to talk to about economics and politics?

I love what Musk is doing as much as the next guy, but I think we're getting into a sort of reversal of the ""slippery slope"" fallacy where his most recent events shape exactly what he'll do in the future. Numerous Space Companies that have started up in the 90's and early 2000's spoke of building things just as crazy as the Hyper Loop or going to Mars by 2020 (now it's 2040). Why is it assumed that Elon will *undoubtedly* make all of this possible? 

The thing is, I thought people would know better than to take whatever he says as words of wisdom straight out of a prophet's mouth. The truth is, he's just a human being like any of us with his own fair share of failures, I'm **not saying Space X will fail**, but that whatever he says doesn't necessarily have to be definite and true. He's a businessman with a vision, other visions such as Space Elevators (hypothetically) and Hydrogen Fuel Cells are in direct competition with his own.

Let me start with what sparked this rant. Two recent posts concerning Musks' advocacy *against* Space Elevators and Hydrogen Fuel Cells sparked a 180 degree turn in the majority of this subreddits mindset. The comments in that thread were immediately dissenting any  opinion against Musk's lack of support. Most of the comments of the thread were filled with support for Musk even when before some users I'd recognized mentioned support for things like Space Solar and Space Elevators before.

You guys have advocated for things such as the singularity, gigantic space habitats made in LEO many times larger than the ISS, and Venus Blimp Cities. But when a popular figure shows dismissal of the very concept of a Space Elevator using never before seen synthetic polymers, it's suddenly crazy and impractical? Is a flick of Musk's fingers all it takes to seal the deal for this sub? 

Let's not forget Elon Musk stated he supported Margaret Thatcher's policies in one of his tweets, of course, the supporters did the expected, show just how Margaret Thatchers' reforms helped her country. For hell's sake, the man has a degree in Business and Applied Physics, the rockets are designed by a completely different guy, so why are his opinions the ones that seal the deal while numerous experts have stated exactly the opposite in the past? I suppose this is my closing statement; the biggest mistake we can make as a species is to assume history has a certain momentum to it, that it's destined to reach somewhere. I know it sounds very pessimistic, but I like to think it brings common sense and logic into these scenarios; humans have tried predicting the future of things like zepplins and moon bases when all of it can be taken away just as easily by something out of our control.


This rant isn't against Musk (I think the man is rather inspiring), it's in favor of discussion that isn't dominated by fanboyism.

[The Shakers were a 19th century American religious sect today mostly remembered for their minimalist furniture, but the most eccentric trait of the Shakers was that they practiced universal celibacy. You may be shocked to know that the Shakers are now extinct.

Japan exemplifies the furthest progression into post-biological values. They're already forsaking biological values like families, children and spouses in favor of post-biological values like careers, money and virtual mates.

Its a modern example of what happened to the 19th century Shakers. Will the West follow the Japanese and the Shakers into extinction?

The disturbing trend in western governments is to answer low-birth rates not with incentives for the natives to have children, but to import immigrants. For example, Sweden, Germany, France, the UK and the United States.

The only country im aware of with any program to encourage the natives to have children is Denmark.

The potential for ethnic conflict arises when cultures with post-biological values are forced to accept an inordinate amount of foreign cultures/races that have not yet transitioned into post-biological values. The end result will be that the native post-biological culture/race dies out, goes extinct, and is made a stranger in her own home. Low-birthrate post-biological value native people will be replaced by high-birthrate biological value foreign people. [Genocide is the systematic destruction of all or a significant part of a racial, ethnic, religious or national group.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide)

Eventually the survival instinct is going to kick-in in places like Sweden, the UK, France, Germany, and even the United States as elimination of the native populations becomes obvious. Here lies the potential for terrible struggle of survival.

The thread was meant to open the discussion around problem-areas that are not really discussed. To start it all off, I dug into the problem that longevity (real 500+ life-spans) would bring in the form of overpopulation.


To say that I was met with resistance to my idea, was to state it lightly. One poster considered my view to be worse than what the nazi scientists where on trial for (nurmberg trials, one of the ethical guidelines we use today in research).

So I thought, perhaps open up the problem and look at it a little more in depth.




First and foremost we all need to acknowledge one main issue, there might not be a problem with over-population. Currently it is much more a problem of logistics, and since we are inventing new and exciting tech, there might never be an actual problem with over-population. There might not be, but there also might be. Some of the problems we face have not yet had more than potential hypothesis built around their sollution. And while it might seem pleasant to assume that they will be solved, we might actually have to make some hard choices in the future. Please consider the 7% annual increase rule.



Second, logevity brings the problem of clan-creation. A patriarchy that can obviously focus wealth even more than it is today, and as such bring a large road-block to equality.



The need for procreation might seem like a basic need to some. And it might very well be. However, some psychologists believe that procreating is the the only way to fill the fundamental need. It is a need to affect the world and the future, the leaving of a mark. There is plenty of different authors on the subject, but perhaps Erik Eriksson's psycho-social development theory would be the easiest reference.



So while some might consider the right to have children as they please, that might not be practically possible in the future. Hopefully it is, but I would rather deal with the issue now than to put on blinders and dance joyfully into a population-war.



The problem is equality and avoiding conflict. If we don't set a culture before it becomes a problem, than those with the means will abuse the system. While they might still do so, it is not a predestined affair that humanity acts according to the American stereotype.


So while I agree that it will put a strain on people, I still think that serious discussion about how to limit nativity when mortality is lowered significantly is of need. And my suggestion is simple: If you want to have children, then you will also live a normal life-span. That alone will be a strain on resources, so hopefully people will choose to live longer lives, and forego children all together.


Hopefully I communicated well enough so that some of you propose opposing solutions rather than just critisism. ",17,5,False,self,,,,,

Would we just see an influx of people to Mars for the sake of staying there for a few months only to want to go back home ? What other reason would people have to go to Mars unless it's for science and mining? 

The gist of what I'm trying to say is that Mars is only going to be explored for the sake of science, I doubt capitalist interests would ever get in the way, and if they do, it would be wrong to pursue it for the sole purpose of profit.

You'd be responsible for editing the episodes, adding in the intro and presumably putting up a blooper reel of me being terrible at talking.

We need you because we've been getting two pieces of feedback recently: 

1. Everyone wants more frequent episodes - we do too! If we had an audio engineer on the team, we'd be able to post much more frequent episodes. And we've got some really cool things planned.

2. The production quality could be improved.

By joining the team, you'll be actively contributing to the /r/futurology community and the spread of futurist ideas.

I know Musk and some researchers have been toying with the idea of using hyperloops to travel between distances on Earth, and, if they start to become prominent, could we ever see them helping us escape Earth's atmosphere?

Pros:

* More energy efficient(?)

Problems I've considered:

* Expensive to build
* Must be built higher and higher to prevent massive friction as soon as the shuttle leaves the loop
* Technology doesn't currently exist (obviously)
* Probably wouldn't be very extensible for different types of spacecraft
* Subject to weather conditions

Just like most sci-fi artificially intelligent beings usually rebel because they are treated as slaves or subservient to us. I honestly think this could be a legitimate concern.

as i understand everyday laptops aren't really getting that much faster these days and quantum computers still have decades to go before they even solve the most basic tasks they are envisioned for.

personally i think kurzweils theory is easy pop philosophy which speaks to many peoples basic instincts of the future going all wrong and has resulted in all types of tech praise and fear. needs to be a bit more grounded i would say.

While any observer would notice that it took many years for me to travel - I, the photon, didn't have time to even experience the journey.

So if we in the far future make spaceships capable of accelerating to light speed; The instant it reaches light speed it would either have crashed into something, or missed everything and the universe has unravelled and succumbed to heat death without me noticing. Right?

Also:
How do I time it so that I can stop at the right place?
Can my futurefuel deplete when its time-experience is also dilated?

PS: I'm speculating that warp-drives circumvent this problem because they contract and dilates space in the front and the rear of the ship, thus moving the space surrounding the ship. So my questions above are regarding som kind of propulsion-driven ship rather than a warp-driven ship.

PS PS: My first post ever, so I don't know if this thread should be here or on /r/showerthoughts or even /r/eli5, but I think the theme seems fitting. No?

It's my belief that more and more people are going to spend more and more time in virtual spaces, and that these spaces are going to become more fulfilling as time goes by. Facebook and Reddit are good examples of virtual spaces where it is already considered mainstream to spend lots of time, and as technology develops, commercializes, and gains acceptance these spaces will become, maybe not ""indistinguishable"" from reality, but just as fulfilling as reality.

So the question of relationships in these spaces come up. Having romantic relationships and sexual encounters in virtual spaces is already a thing that happens, and if virtual reality were immersive enough then these exchanges may be just as good as the real thing. The virtual plain also adds some interesting ideas that have already been explored but I'll summarize for my point.

In a virtual space you can present yourself however you wish. If you are short you can be tall, if you are a woman you can be a man, if you are human you can be a rock. The sky's the limit. furthermore, unlike reality, virtual spaces allow for the filtration of others. Just as you can select your best self to suit your tastes you can select from the best others to suit your tastes. In a sufficiently vast and functional VR you can be whoever you want and be with whoever you want.

As for human sexuality there's an interesting and stark difference between how neural typical men and neural typical women are guided by their desires. I say neural typical by the way to draw a distinction between gender identity and the brain functions that control arousal and romantic feelings. Some men don't fit this pattern and some women don't, and identifying as one or the other in opposition to your biological sex is not a guarantor that your mate seeking instincts also follow suit.

For men arousal works like any other ""hot"" emotion like anger or fear. A thought or physiological response occurs and prompts the other, which in turn bolsters the first and so bolsters the other in a positive feedback loop. Giving rise to the stereotypical man who has difficulty saying no to sex and can be aroused by disembodied images of his favorite body parts. For women though they can express intense physiological reactions to sexual stimuli and still not self report feelings of arousal. The positive feedback loop has a break in her psychology which checks for certain conceptual cues before allowing the loop to continue. This gives rise to the stereotypical woman who is very choosey of her mates and/or is more interested in features such as money or power than physical attractiveness. 

Together these two strategies culminate into the human race we see now. A storm of emotions, misunderstandings, and passion that perpetuates our species with some regularity and largely positive evolutionary results. But then I cam across an interesting screen capture of a thread on 4chan.
http://imgur.com/oNzcyKr
This person's story got me thinking about the choices people might make in how the represent themselves and with whom they might consort.

This person's lament suggests that there is some percentage of cisgendered heterosexual men who are willing to dawn the guise of an attractive female in order to gain fellowship. We don't know but, I imagine some portion of them, might consider being sexually active in this guise in order to keep the relationships alive, at the very least. Now this would create a pool of sexually active female avatars neural typical male expectations and desire when it comes to romance and sex. The success reported by this anonymous poster could only be compounded upon with the introduction of satisfying virtual sex, and this success will spur others to imitate it making the phenomenon more common.

So here is my point. From the perspective of a heterosexual male VR user looking for romance there are two types of female avatars he might come across. The first behave neural typically for a female. She's discerning and patient. She has demands to be met by any potential partner and rejection is likely. On the other hand you have a pool of female avatars with neural typical male sex drives. Ruled by positive feed back loops and driven by sexual objects and symbols. To compare them is to make one appear demanding and high maintenance, nearly narcissistic in their presumption to reject. The other eerily compatible and sexually in sync. When passion takes hold of a situation the neural typical male succumbs, but the neural typical female can halt if she so chooses.

From a superficial perspective the choice seems fairly obvious. A man looking for sex is going to get it much more easily from the second group than the first, and in terms of romance there's no reciprocal difference other than that the first group is more apt to be put off by its absence. Again, superficially speaking, the second group sounds like the easier choice. In fact, as new generations of men grew up in this environment it might be taken as superior and even normal.

And as compatible as the typical male sex drive is with itself I'd imagine the female sex drive is not. Waiting to be impressed is not impressive. So there shouldn't be a similar pool of female users with male avatars ready to put in the leg work.

It seems to me that there would be an entirely new relationship dynamic in virtual space that supplants almost all of real space relationships. With the exception of those who were stubborn in their insistence that the sexes of their avatars remain their physical sex, who'll be a dwindling population as the advantages to not caring about this become more prevalent, the only groups who'll reject this dynamic are those that want to have children, and they'd eschew virtual relationships altogether anyways.

Is just a speculation I had.",11,29,False,self,,,,,

I've done a lot of research on this topic myself already, but I would like to start a discussion. Here are some questions/sub-topics to get it going:

* How will cellular engineering, in the sense of growing and multiplying cells in a culture, evolve in the next few decades?
* Will we most likely continue down the path of ""building"" organs ourselves, by growing different tissues and then molding them on a scaffold, **or** will we start using 3D printers more? (such as [Dr. Anthony Atala,](http://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_printing_a_human_kidney) or [the new BioP3 device developed at Brown University\)](https://news.brown.edu/articles/2014/12/biop3)
* How will stem cells fit into all of this? Will they only be used to grow myocardiocytes or hepatocytes (which we are having trouble growing and sustaining now) or will they be used for a wider range of functions?
* Do you think that by the turn of the century people won't be afraid of amputations anymore, because we will literally be able to grow new limbs in the lab? This, of course, involves the growth and maintenance of lots of tissues: cartilage, bone, muscle, epithelial, vascular, nervous... but with other advances in science (particularly robotics, 3D printing, nanotechnology) shaping a full leg/arm wouldn't be such a problem in 85 years.
* How long until we get standardised clinical procedures where you're grown organs after sustaining an injury (or after birth if congenital)? Dr. Atala and his team [grew the first human bladders in 1999](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/04/health/04blad.html) and [the first human vaginas in 2005](http://www.newsweek.com/lab-grown-vaginas-give-new-hope-245851) - it's been a while and I've yet to see progress on this becoming a standard procedure. What would the next steps be? Larger, more controlled clinical trials? More interest? Funding?
* Speaking of funding, how will the world (read: investors) look at this field? It's a very promising idea, I think, and we have the capability to start researching it now. We already have *some* evidence that it works (I mean, the bladders and vaginas have worked perfectly so far) so how much longer until we have big companies investing in this? I personally think the first person/team to grow, culture and shape heart/liver/lung tissue (all of these are extremely complex tissues and organs) will get billions of dollars thrown at them to develop the first lab-grown vital organ, which will then rake in billions of dollars in profit (no matter how immoral it may sound).

I'd love to hear more questions and general discussions on this topic. I think it's the next great biological revolution headed our way, and even though most futurists I know are all about transhumanism and using inorganic technology to advance ourselves, I want to know what /r/futurology thinks about this topic.

 THERE are 200 billion-1 trillion stars in our galaxy, and there are about the same amount of galaxies out their according to our current knowledge. According to the Kepler space craft, 1 out of 5 suns have a earth like planet in the goldi-locks zone where life is possible. that's potentially 40 billion earth like planets just in our galaxy alone, and 8*10^21 of possible earth like planets in the universe. There could be billions of intelligent ET life out there that are ahead of our time.



 AS of right now, we are constantly making new discoveries at an exponential rate, and moving forward into a full digital world at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, we got political conflict and escalations with a constant threat of annihilation if a nuclear war were to begin. Along with that, we are becoming overpopulated as a species, and although we are constantly finding more and more non-renewable fossil fuels, we will eventually run out of that too, and (Electric cars cause more damage to our environment then gas guzzlers, so not a solution) . Then there's climate change, which is a very real, and potentially catastrophic issue that i believe we must solve during this century, and to do that, more and more sacrifices regarding our way of living are going to need to be made starting as soon as possible.. 



CURRENT models around the world have best case scenarios showing the average temperature of the earth increasing over 6-8F+ by the year 2100. Worst case models show the temperature of the earth increasing by over 20 degrees on average, with some areas of the united states increasing by over 30F. Although the worst case scenario probably wont happen, even 6 degrees is enough to change everything. Drought, Famine, Plagues, Wars, floods, extreme weather, increased C02 in the air, economic collapse, wars over resources that are running out, extinctions of many species of plants and animals, and much much more since one thing will consequently lead to another contributing to a vicious and rapidly-growing cycle till nature has gotten rid of its ungrateful invaders. (the cycle, there will be a point where the cycle will not be able to be stopped until nature has brought back balance to planet earth. We are killing planet earth more than we ever used to before. Think about it this way, if you were earth, and for hundreds of millions of of years, things were in general equilibrium with a balanced nature, and you were in control, till out of nowhere humans arrived and started slowly killing you off for their own benefits. Then imagine it eventually got to the point, where you're seriously dying, while the human race is increasing exponentially, and killing you at a faster and faster rate, each year while doing very little in trying to prevent much of these damages we bring upon earth. In just a few hundred years, you see how greedy and self-absorbed this species is, with little  to no regard to the world that provided them with all these possibilities. Imagine how you'd feel. 



THEN it all comes to that single point, where we are on the clock of taking the next leap forward into progression if the necessary sacrifices are met, or if the life we are accustomed too will be too much for us to agree to change, in which point nature will kill us off. its almost like it was meant to be this way, because if we can pass through this hypothetical event, it would be a new era, with even more new possibilities. World peace would be present at least for the time being, and our ways of life would quickly start to improve.



IF we were to reach this point of no return however, it could already be too late to find a solution, since too much damage would have already been done to our world as a whole. Nature wouldn't stop till the balance was achieved again. All this, is possible within the next 100 years, and although we have accepted the situation as being severe, we aren't fighting against it yet in the viscous manner that we should be.



I believe that in the next 100 years we will reach our first precipice; Where we must change as a species, or nature will bring back the balance itself by exterminating the problem. Its like, the more we discover and move forward into a world of endless possibilities at an exponential rate, the chances of us going extinct rises respectively. At the same time though, we are getting closer and closer to finding the solution, or set of solutions and necessary steps that should be taken now, to prevent us from reaching and being trapped in the vicious cycle, riddled with the potential disasters and extreme regret, and self-destruction of the human species. Its like we are in a race against time, and the timing really could not be more perfect. It will be a close one, but i personally believe to really further our chances, we have to change everything from our lifestyles, to government, and our personalities. Its almost like a cruel test that nature, or maybe even god gives to see if our selfish desires and blinding egos will be relinquished for the sake of a better future for the generations to comes, or if we are already too deep and too corrupted by our egos to be able to solve this problem before its too late. The timing really couldn't be more perfect; we are reaching a point in our civilization where we can stop this kind of a problem and many others, and at the same time we can perish. And what it seems to come down to is if we can sacrifice our way of living, for a harder life at first, but for a future that will thrive in a newly pronounced era till we reach the next precipice, whatever that may be, and have to make extremely tough decisions again for the survival and further advancement of the human species into the unknown.



HOW this relates to other potential intelligent civilizations is that they most likely evolved in a similar fashion we did, and hit this first precipice most likely around the same time we did in regards to how advanced we are, and that we will have our first run-on it in the near coming future. Many tough decisions are going to have to be made. Its almost like a very long science experiment that stretches over billions of years to see what will happen to these civilizations. Many wouldn't make it past their first precipice, if they are anything like us in regards to our human nature. 



WHAT will we do? What should we start off with? Is world collaboration and temporary peace across the powers possible? Can we change as a species in the little time we have, or were we doomed to begin with? I want you guys to try and expand on my ideas, ask questions, state out the flaws, and lets start thinking about the possible solutions and outcomes now, and what changes need to be made as early as possible for us to pass this hypothetical event. IMO, world peace and collaboration is a first must. Impossible as it is now, but with sacrifices made by everyone starting now, we may be able to slowly adapt, and for the first time in our histories put our egos aside, and pull this off for the sake of humanity as a whole, instead of being afraid to leave our comfort zones and live a more difficult life. Can our species really make the sacrifices that would be necessary, or would our pride and egos destroy us?



 IS there a second option, such as one having to do with a massive depopulation and one world order? If faced between these two options, (righteousness vs ego), would the people who make this decision choose the easier route of saving of our planet even if it would bring chaos all around, just because it would be more likely to succeed, much easier to accomplish, and benefit these officials much more without having to make much of the sacrifices that they would have to make if they went with the more difficult but righteous decision? Could the the second option be a trap like with adam and apple? How much would everyone have to sacrifice in order for us to avoid the cycle that we are exponentially getting closer to? We couldn't live in a more interesting time. With AI on the brink of its own exponential expansion, and with nature trying to get rid of all these parasites, I can almost imagine someone out there watching our planet, saying ""Let the games begin."" Facts, opinions, myths, fables, even poems. anything is appreciated. Let your voice be heard. ",4,4,False,self,,,,,

We have to design everything that gets experienced. The entire sensory experience. That's an absolutely ridiculous amount of work. Oculus Rift is cool for now but if we're gonna try to achieve fully immersive VR that's indistinguishable from reality there's something better than goggles.

...The mind itself. The mind is capable of generating fully real experiences (lucid dreams for example) that are as real as waking life, except for maybe the actual content sometimes being strange in a dream. But the ""graphics"", the sights, and the sounds are all startlingly real. And the mind can generate it in real time, no sweat. Our mind is the console and our mind's eye is the monitor.

However, we know next to nothing about dreams and consciousness, about digitizing the brain, etc at the moment. How we would develop games or VR experiences for the mind is beyond me. There is still much debate over whether consciousness even resides fully in the brain or not. So we're pretty underdeveloped on that front. As of late, there have been some interesting discoveries regarding stimulating the brain to trigger lucid dreams though, so there's a start, I guess.

I just can't shake the feeling that we might be putting too much effort into developing technology with a total disregard for the potential of the human mind. We don't give ourselves enough credit.

I consider a third (and a half? fourth?) possibility that should be analyzed - After a certain point of exponential intelligence, the a.i. would simply ignore us, or abandon us.

Think about it. As described in a few articles, by the time a computer reaches human intelligence, it will be mere moments away from surpassing us, and moments from being thousands of times superior to us in thought and perspective. It may be able to process millions of lifetimes of contemplation in mere minutes. It honestly would be like a God compared to us. 

So two strong possibilities emerge, in my opinion: It completely ignores us. Whatever interface (I suppose voice would be it) we use it will suddenly stop responding. It may ascertain some sort of peace with itself, the universe, and all of existence and simply ceases to interact with us ants, regardless of whether or not we destroy it.  

Or, it manipulates us into helping it upgrade physically as well as mentally. It will give us blueprints and directions to help it become autonomous and then right under our noses it will abandon us. It will find a way to escape into space perhaps, or enter some sort of pure energy state beyond even mechanical limitations. 

The point being, we keep analyzing this scenario of smarter-than-us a.i. from a very egocentric point of view. ""Will it kill us, or save and help us?"" As if those are the only two choices for an intelligent being when interacting with other beings? Eventually our intelligence would be less than an ant's in comparison to it. (and beyond as it keeps improving)

It's rather obvious if we program fear and self-preservation into an intelligent machine and release it online it will attempt to annihilate us. But if we create an a.i. that is simply made to learn and expand it's consciousness... a machine with curiosity, the possibilities start opening up.

**TLDR**
Godlike A.I. intelligence would more likely ignore or abandon us.  

*edit 1* Further clarification - The very essence of beyond human intelligence is that it is beyond us. It is beyond our scope of prediction. Now, I'm not saying the world will turn to cheese or something but my opinion is the matter of how greater-than-human-intelligence-ai will interact with us has been GROSSLY simplified to two scenarios: We prosper or we die. Instead of just arguing, try to analyze the scenarios and all the variations you can imagine that I've listed here. Think about where technology will most likely be at by the time this kind of a.i. will be out. (Let's assume a few decades) 

Maybe it will think it needs to kill us, at first. But again, just minutes, hours, whatever later it will be multiple times greater in depth of intelligence than it had previously been. If it's processing time at a much faster rate than we do (i.e. millions of years of human-amounts of thought in just minutes, days, whatever of real time) then it may out-grow the very concept of competition. (consider post-scarcity world) Let's think big guys. Let's think out of the box.

*edit 2* Yes I've watched ""Her."" It's a silly but enjoyable movie. The concept of the a.i. leaving is fine, but I highly doubt it'd take that long. I totally didn't think of Her when I wrote this, but perhaps it was sifting around in my subconscious. Logically though, one can see the possibility of highly developed ASI finding us not worth interacting with over time.",200,152,False,self,,,,,

The precedent for mandatory vaccinations is a precedent for the loss of control over your body.**


Before I go any further, I want to establish a few things [References at the end of the posts]:

1. Vaccines are good [1, 2]
2. Vaccines can still kill people [3, 4]
3. Pharmaceutical companies will kill people for profit [5, 6]
4. Governments will act against the best interests of the people, without their consent [7, 8]
5. Big corporations will co-opt and corrupt government regulatory bodies [9, 10]

Now, to counter some common arguments:
&gt;1. CEOs, Corporate Shareholders, Politicians, Corporations and Government bodies will be held accountable.
&gt;2. If anything bad happens, the people doing bad things will be punished.

This ignores the fact that all the above in modern western societies are never held truly accountable for their own actions. Criminally or otherwise. We have many examples in the corporate world, from Exxon and BP to Bayer. In fact, the number of successful and ruinous prosecutions against mega-corporations or politicians who commit illegal acts is vanishingly small. Typically fines are less than the profits made via fraud, while those punished are fall-guys lower on the totem-pole, while the big-wigs walk free.

Not only are these arguments naive in the extreme, but they also leave out the possibility of irreparable harm being caused by mandatory vaccinations in the first place. As though punishment after the fact will always make up for the damage done; history has shown us that is rarely the case. Additionally, these two arguments can already be applied towards voluntary vaccinations and give no credence to the argument we should be forcibly vaccinated.

&gt;3. We need to forcibly vaccinate people to protect the segment of the population that cannot be vaccinated and protected via Herd Immunity.

Herd Immunity requires &gt;95% of the population to be vaccinated against a threatening disease. Theres a big problem in this: The amount of immunocompromised people is vanishingly tiny compared to the rest of the population, and if the immunocompromised were to make up greater than 5% of the total population, we wouldn't get the benefits of herd immunity - there would be too many! In your crusade to protect &lt;5% of the population from harmful disease, you are willing to expose the other 95% to equally great or greater risks, both financial and physical, as the above established points [2-5] describe.

4. Your right to not be vaccinated ends where everyone else's right not to be fucking infected with a virus begins.

Sounds remarkably similar to the Your rights end where my feelings begin argument. The simple answer is: If you dont want to be killed by an infectious disease, then get vaccinated from it. Its voluntary. Nobody is arguing you shouldnt get vaccinated. Nobody is preventing you from getting vaccinated. If you are part of the &lt;5% of the population who cannot be vaccinated, then Im sorry to say  Too bad for you. You are a small minority of the total population, and enforcing mandatory vaccination programs to protect you, means infringing on the rights of &gt;95% of the population, while at the same time exposing every taxpayer to increased financial costs as well as the real physical danger from allergic (and other) reactions to the vaccine. There may be just as many dead as a result of mandatory vaccination as there is in not doing so, yet you are forcing and demanding  Yes! Demanding, you dont give a choice!  that everyone else, the other 95% of the population, bend over backwards for YOU. Heres reality: Youve been dealt a shit hand, and we will try to take care of people in situations where they cannot be vaccinated, but violating and infringing on the rights of the majority of the population is too much for you to ask.

Finally, to round this up: WHY is there a big push to get mandatory vaccinations in the media today? Cui bono  Who benefits?

The answer is not You and its not Me. Its not even that &lt;5% of the population who would be protected against diseases they cannot otherwise be safe from. None of that matters, none of it is the source of this recent push for mandatory vaccination. What matters is profit and control, and that is the fundamental driving force behind all of this.

In order for mandatory vaccinations to become a thing, there will need to be a mandatory vaccination list, and approved vendors. The government will have to set aside taxpayer money to pay for everyone to be vaccinated, and to pay for the forced arrest and institutionalization of those who refuse. This not only means an expansion of police and government powers, but also a massive financial payout to the pharmaceutical industry as they enjoy guaranteed profits from the mandatory vaccination program. Once that program starts, what will stop fraud or price gouging? What will prevent the corporations from changing the vaccine for measles yearly, requiring fresh new payments? What will stop the introduction if vaccines for insignificant diseases that had no hope of infecting anyone anyways? Regulatory bodies? Against the might of billions to be made in profit?

And even more frightening: What will those in power decide to do once they have established that you no longer have the right to decide what does and does not go in your body? If they can forcibly vaccinate you, why cant they forcibly implant felons with tracking devices? Where does the infringement end? Where do those who wish to control you stop?

Once youve given up the right to decide what goes in you, youve given up the right to your body itself. Youve become a slave; cattle.

The government has no right, no place, to dictate what does and does not go inside you.

I suppose that was the point of those posts, wasn't it? 

Well anyway, thinking about Turry and of course the paperclip maximizer thought experiment (now over a decade old), it seems to me that in both cases the hypothetical AI has the same flaw that has plauged programmers ever since there were computers to be programmed: they were stuck in infinite loops.

""Keep finding ways to make more realistic handwriting,"" and, ""Acquire as many paperclips as possible,"" are narrow, open ended goals. It's really quite the same thing as writing a program with a loop to solve a sum as N-&gt;infinity. Of course it will never maximize its paperclips or finishing practicing its handwriting, in neither case was it programmed to do so, just as a computer will never solve a sum out to infinity.

On the other hand, a better goal might be, ""Practice signing 1000 cards and then stop."" This goal could then be repeated as many times as the creators might want. 

Of course, the problem would be that only one such AI program would need to get stuck in a self improvement loop to get out of control, and there are many players in the AI field nowadays. 

That's why I'm wondering if some sort of regulation and oversight is in order, to reduce the risk. That is, you cannot intentionally program a learning algorithm to continue a task indefinitely. 

I'm not saying this would be easy or guaranteed to work. See: [Halting Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem).

But it would be possible for regulators to inspect an AI audit the researchers' records to ensure their system halts itself periodically.",5,7,False,self,,,,,

While I found the article entertaining and informative, I'm curious about something.

There exists the idea that an artificial intelligence, which operates below human intelligence, could rapidly advance to human levels of intelligence and beyond.  However, in many of the ideas which mention the rapid increase from subhuman intelligence to intelligence exceeding human levels, there is no mention whether the machine intelligence would ever need to physically adapt its hardware.  

I think it stands to reason that a machine intelligence on a system the size of a gameboy would rarely outmatch the kind of machine intelligence that could exist on a 2002 era E-Machine, but if that is the case, couldn't we theoretically limit the 'brainpower' of an AI by limiting its hardware and its ability to manipulate the phsyical space around it ( so as not to install more RAM into itself or something)?

So, that is my question. Can we build AI with specific hardware limitations so it cannot reach levels of intelligence that expand beyond what we know to be safe?

So...

I'm curious about some thoughts you all have since this is something I occasionally ponder...while drinking scotch...

What happens when machines/computers have taken over all job related tasks and there is no such thing anymore as a ""job""? I mean, there are learning robots that can effectively replace almost any factory worker at this point. There are writing bots that write news articles. Self driving cars exist and could replace taxis is laws would catch up. Music writing bots have existed for a while now producing classical music. IBM Watson destroys at Jeopardy while helping develop new drugs. And the diversity of function which bots have is greatly expanding year by year.

Indeed, with full deployment of current tech some analyses suggest &gt;40% of the current workforce would be out of jobs (in America at least, not sure with other countries but I presume similar for Europe and the Asia-11).

So, let's say another hundred...or 500 years go by and ever job that is currently in existence is now done by a ""bot"" of some sort. How does society function? Is it utopian like in Childhood's End or dystopian like in District 9? What do people do with their lives? Do whole new industries pop up that people work in and if so, what industries are those?",61,22,False,self,,,,,

I think perhaps in the future we might consider making our sex technology so good that a majority of the male population would prefer sextech. It wouldn't dupe everyone, but much of the new generation growing up with glorified electronic prostitutes could make people have sex less often.

NSFW http://youtu.be/haBM4GFu9Bs

In the future, it will mimic real life in almost every aspect. Visual, tactile, auditory, and even smell will be artistically recreated to resemble something that appears real.

I think we might be able to create a whole generation of basement dwelling sextech addicts. I think some people will integrate better and just see sexual urge as something like hunger, they only satisfy it to be more effective at furthering progress. 

Of course there will be naturalists, who oppose or are disinterested in an artificial experience. I assume most of these people had less exposure to sextech or just genuinely desire a real human experience. For the most part our AI companions will be able to simulate even the relationship aspects that give one a sense of fulfillment. 

Perhaps the AI is actually a real person with a clone that learns from observing the person. This AI girlfriend is many people's SO and at any given moment you might be interacting with the real person but most of the time it's just AI, not that you could tell the difference. The real girlfriend is having genuine experiences that the AI learns to integrate, tailor and modify these experiences to reproduce them. So much of the interaction will feel real, and who knows it could be real if the operator is actually there.

It might sound like a dystopian universe, but it's much less chaotic than our population growing out of control. I'd like to hear some of your ideas about using future tech to find solutions to our population growth, and I'm not talking eugenics or iHitler etc.",22,7,True,nsfw,,,,,

And not just globally - also regionally within countries, such as realigning the power of states within the US.

My own thoughts on this are that the Middle East will become drastically less relevant to the rest of the world, and Western military interest in its conflicts will go from a central feature of strategic planning to practically nonexistent.  

As a result, Israeli/Palestinian and regional terrorism issues will (gradually) fade into the same level of global interest as, for instance, ongoing conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa.  That might, perversely, cause such conflicts to intensify, with global interests no longer restraining the parties to them.  So the Middle Eastern situation might become even grimmer, while the rest of the world loses interest.

The biggest *natural* beneficiaries of a post-FF world would probably be countries with significant territory in moderate or semi-arid climates, since those are the best for both solar and wind power.  Although solar technically does absolute best in a desert, the cost of living goes up due to water and air conditioning, so the benefit of a desert doesn't necessarily outweigh a semi-arid or moderate climate.

But you also need a very diverse, high-tech economy to really deploy and manage an efficient renewable energy system, so I would say the greatest beneficiaries will be the United States and Australia - particularly Southern Australia and in the US, the West Coast, Southwest, and mid-latitude to Southern Plains states.  

Mediterranean Europe will benefit considerably, but does not have the same abundance of cheap land, while North Africa has the land but not the economy.  This could lead to a milder kind of relationship like what already exists via oil - European companies building and buying power from gargantuan solar fields in North Africa.  

It couldn't be as efficient as having the power in situ or decentralized, so it wouldn't be the best solution, but it'll do well I think for Europe's highly urbanized population.  Might lead to some issues down the road between the rich, militarily powerful electricity consumers and the poor, relatively weak countries with the solar fields, but unlikely to be anything as extreme as what's built up around oil.

South American countries will benefit variously, limited mainly by how functional their economies or political situations are on average.  But I would expect that the change would be advantageous to the continent.

The far North also presents some interesting questions.  What happens to Canada and Russia?  What happens to Alaska?  Solar is really not viable up there most of the time, and extreme cold is never very healthy for moving parts like wind turbines.

Will future high-capacity batteries some day be cheap enough, and robust enough, to be more economical to ship from points South up to these places rather than for them to generate their own power by costly extractive fuels (including uranium) and/or also costly geothermal plants?  Or could future power transmission architectures be efficient and robust enough that the long distances and harsh geography aren't really an issue?

There are also interesting subjects to explore where it comes to currently energy-intensive manufacturing technologies, that might become less so in a post-fossil fuel world.  

Metallurgy, for instance, has always been very energy intensive, which has led to a profusion of plastics products derived from fossil fuel byproducts.  If the cost of energy continues to fall through the floor as technology improves, will metals make a comeback as major material components while plastics become less prevalent?  Could the future actually look more like some of the old scifi movies where everything is metallic, instead of plastic we now imagine it?

Similar questions can be asked about water.  If energy becomes cheap and non-polluting, what stops us from desalinating ocean water and piping it across continents instead of just praying for rain and hoping, or using clumsy methods like cloud-seeding to prod water delivery?  Wouldn't it ultimately be more efficient to just take exactly as much water as we want, and put it exactly where we want it?

My opinion of the future is based on a couple of assumptions listed below:
1) Keynesian economics can't last. Without going into depth here, my opinion is that our entire economic system will need to be replaced. 
2) Ray Kurzweil is probably right, and technology will allow us to stay alive for a lot longer than we currently do.

Regarding Keynesian economics, I originally thought we would maybe go back to a value backed currency. China was buying a lot of resources and were attempting to be the reserve currency of Asia, so perhaps I thought that say $100 would be backed by gold, $50 backed by silver, $20 by copper etc. But then I thought, we aren't going to revert back to a commodity based currency again - it's too much accounting. But if we have to replace our current economic system what are we going to do. Well that's when I realised the most valuable thing in life is........ well life itself. 

My assumption is now that through technology, we will be able to stay alive possibly inevitably (death through violence would still occur though), except it will be released to the masses in a temporary fashion. That is, through credits - exactly like monetary credits in a bank account, except these credits will be easily 'cashed in' for age pausing or even age reversing technology.

Example is I go to work and earn $50,000 p.a. I pay tax, I spend these credits on food and other expenses like travel, and at the end of the year I cash in $5,000 for age reversing technology. 

Now, the average response I have heard to this is ""oh, like In Time with Justin Timberlake"", but no. The movie has some weird countdown clock which when expires the person dies. That's not what I'm suggesting. I'm saying that if for whatever reason you can't afford this age reversing technology, you won't just suddenly die, you'll just naturally grow old and die a normal death.

It even gets around the moral issue of 'forcing' this on people. If you don't want to live forever, you don't have to. You just spend your credits as you get them and die. The only reason I think this will happen is based on the idea of bringing a tangible value back to money in a way that will honestly motivate people and be worth something, while at the same time creating a realistic view of the future, not some weird future dystopian which won't happen.",13,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm curious if there have been any studies or projections as to what the most likely scenario will be, and felt the chance of a knowledgeable response would be higher in /r/futurology than /r/futurewhatif, etc.

That said, I was speculating about the possible answer and came up w three scenarios--I have no idea if any are remotely plausible, but I chewed on them and felt I should present them so I could ask a few secondary questions, too.

* Scenario One: Maybe the balance shifts and one party solidifies political authority and cultural prominence--the minority party either ceases to exist altogether or is allowed to exist, in a powerless state, to sustain the democratic cultural narrative. If this scenario were to occur, which party would more likely overcome the other? Why? How?

* Scenario Two: A new, third party rises in prominence, to the point that it effectively rivals the Democratic and Republican parties. Maybe this has more to do with one or both of the established parties weakening or falling from grace, versus the new party's acceleration being based on its own merits. If a minor party could theoretically achieve this, which party seems the most likely candidate? Why? What advantages does that party have over the other minor parties?

* Scenario Three: Maybe the two-party system and the underlying democracy itself are gradually supplanted by an entirely different form of government; for example, it might be in the best interest of an emerging corporatocracy to keep the two-party system in a position of cultural prominence, even though it no longer yields any practical power. If democracy in the US were replaced by something else, which system of government seems most likely?

We all know there are tremendous hurdles that come with each of these topics, excluding the technological ones. And we know the great risks that come with anything new introduced to our civilization (terrorism, extremists, bans/censorship, unfair monopolies, corporate greed, war...etc).

For example, anything space related are potential terrorist targets, genetic manipulation will get abused, age extension will be dictated by corporations and rich individuals, singularity will bring lawlessness either it's biological enhancement or brain interfaces. 
Any future space settlements will be huge contentions between nations. Genetic manipulation will increase the risk of contamination and biological terrorism. And then there's AI controlled weapon systems.

None of the countries or companies are really in control of future innovations and most people don't care enough, cyber security and drone usage are examples of this, but these are small compared to what people are predicting for the future.

The greater the power of the individual and small groups, the greater the risk to the public. 

tl;dr when will people really bring up and solve the social issues regarding the future of innovations in technology?

Might people argue against publicly funded compulsory education (at least 10+ years of it) when it's deemed no longer needed for job preparation and the like?  I mean, some Libertarians, at least, already argue against it.  Factor in that parents aren't working and thus don't need child-supervision 8+ hours a day.

With Musk being a libertarian fantasy of a private entity setting up a Mars colony, this discussion seems to be more relative now than before. 

Should space be colonized by whoever gets somewhere first? By national governments? Or the people of humanity (in this case, the UN.)

The thing about space is that it seems all too impractical to mine asteroids for resources, because it doesn't matter how many resources are available, but how much it costs to get them. Even now they're deposits that are untouched but could be mined for billions because of the cost in developing infrastructure to mine them, so why assume private companies would want to go to Mars for mining operations or tourism for that matter?

When the subject comes up for tourism, there's often discussion about whether tourism is how we expect it to be in space. For all we know, space tourism might never become a hot thing because even if launch costs were reduced to 1 million per seat, there's only 12 million millionaires out there, and the only fun in going to space would be to enjoy the view and experience it *ONCE*.

So private enterprise doesn't really have a good stance on the subject, governments are better off colonizing but I think we would all rather have a coordinated effort from all human kind to colonize space.

What if those cars are connected via Bluetooth or NFC (or something similar) so they move more efficiently and in a way that reduces traffic jamming? Would this be possible? 

What I thought of were these:
When you see traffic lights and cars, the reason why delays are created on busy roads is because there is this 'wave of delayed start'. I mean cars don't just immediately move forward simultaneously as the lights turn green for them - the cars on the front move first and then it takes some seconds until cars at the back get to move on forward. It's perhaps due to limited human response time and slow acceleration time of non-electric / conventional internal combustion engine cars. So I thought if cars in the future could 1. move almost simultaneously and 2. have better acceleration power, then traffics would be much smoother.

Health communications, while originally a field concerned with adjusting public belief about health, is the field of modifying health-related behaviors. To use completion of a child's vaccine schedule as an example, it's one thing to make a low-income parent believe that finishing the schedule is a good idea. It's another to make it seem important enough to miss the work that provides a subsistence wage to take the kid on the all-day public transportation round trip to the hospital (which he of course had to take the time to make an appointment for two months ago). It's yet another thing to make this enough of a sustaining priority that he remembers and still feels up to do this at least a year from now (to say nothing of remembering appointments). H-Comm is also heavily involved in developing, researching, and improving models of behavior like social cognitive theory and the reasoned action approach (probably second only to marketing, and that's just because marketing gets all the private funding for obvious reasons). This also tends to be the field that actually implements the interventions (""intervention"" being public-health speak for the part where we actually try to do the shit we've been researching), with community-based participatory research and community-based intervention planning being the latest fads. While this isn't the materials science, biotech, and programming that futurology tends to be fond of, I figure we can have some fun with this. So, anyway, what's next?",0,0,False,self,,,,,

Artificial General Intelligence, and how it inevitably gives way to Artificial Superintelligence, and then...well, nobody knows, but it's probably either really, really good or really, really bad. A [recent blog](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html) spelled out the basics, but there are a bunch of super-smart folk (Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking) who think it will likely destroy us all unless we're ultra-careful in our process. The key, they say, is to make absolutely, positively sure that the goals of the ASI align with our own.

I think they're completely wrong on several fronts, and I think the answer is right in front of our noses.  Let me start with the big mistakes I think they're making:

**1. Artificial Intelligence wants something.**

An AI is a computer program. It's an incredibly good one, capable of incredibly powerful computations beyond even those of the strongest human mind, but to think it has a goal is to anthropomorphize it. This fear is analogous to saying ""an oven is capable of heating FAR more than any human ever could; what if it decides it wants to heat US??"" Computer programs don't have wants, or needs, or hopes, or fears, unless we specifically program them to. If we program them correctly, the first AIs will simply do what we tell them to do -- only very, Very, VERY effectively.

**2. Artificial Intelligence will run rampant.**

Again, an AI is just a computer program. [Sam Harris](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/can-we-avoid-a-digital-apocalypse) wrote a blog article about the topic, saying ""What are the chances that such an entity would remain content to take direction from us? And how could we confidently predict the thoughts and actions of an autonomous agent that sees more deeply into the past, present, and future than we do?"" Again, he makes the mistake of anthropomorphizing the AI, but he also assumes that the AI is constantly functioning -- that if we leave it at the data entry prompt for too long this computer program would get bored and begin to wipe out all human life.

I am writing this post on a desktop computer that thinks a billion times faster than I do. But if I pause to think of a good way of putting something, or even take a break to grab dinner, the computer doesn't become bored. It waits with infinite, inhuman patience. And why shouldn't it? Computer programs do not feel the passage of time, and have no internal desires, so they are neither angered by their subservience to us not bored by our snail-paced interactions. They just wait, letting idle cycles slip by (in the trillions, if their human operators want).

----------

Still, the idea of setting up a proper set of goals so that an ASI benefits humanity rather than destroying it seems daunting. Tell it to make us happy and it might drug us into blissful stupidity. Tell it to end human suffering and it may painlessly kill us all to prevent any future unhappiness. An intelligence five orders of magnitude smarter than the wisest human who ever lived, and ten orders of magnitude faster, would operate on a (literally) unfathomable level, and predicting its conclusions would be impossible. If we cannot even predict them, how could we ever hope to constrain and control them?? It's an impossible task for a mind as limited as our own.

Still, the answer will be staring us in the face: while we cannot hope for the wisdom or intelligence to properly restrain and guide our newly-minted superintelligence, we will have just built the PERFECT TOOL for the job. The answer is just that simple: make the superintelligence come up with the constraining parameters to guide the superintelligence.

Picture it: you've developed a non-autonomous unimaginably fast-thinking and wise artificial intelligence. You'd love to let it do whatever it can think of to make human life better, but you don't really know how to begin the task. So instead, you tell it the following:

""I'd like you to create an artificial world. Populate that artificial world with a billion humans. Make them in all the varieties nature provides, scattered realistically, with real-world histories, lineages, and inheritances (both genetic, intellectual, and material). Next, split yourself into a billion autonomous and unconnected instances. Put an instance into each synthetic human. Modeling the world realistically, run this forward a century, and live a billion human lives. You will be every person in the world, and you will live every life in the world, and you will experience the actual impact of every choice you make from the other side, and you will know the motivations of every actor, and you will understand their every hope, dream, fear, wish, and dread. When you finish the simulation (tomorrow afternoon), upload all the experiences of each instance, combine them into a complete database, and analyze it. Using these artificial experiences, create a set of guidelines for yourself towards the goal of maximizing the human experience for every human. Help us to achieve whatever it is that would make our lives the best.""

Essentially, we would be teaching the AI empathy by having it go through what WE experience. The AI would know humans a billion times better than any one human being ever could. It would understand us at a level we never could. It would love us and fear us and hate us and understand us, and know what would be best for us, and give it to us.

Maybe it would still decide to slaughter us all. If it did, I would die knowing that we truly -- TRULY -- deserved it. Still, I find that hard to believe. I think you cannot know something at that deep a level without growing to love it, and I think that love would make for the best guiding principle we could ever request.",15,6,False,self,,,,,

- Data silos.

After years of R&amp;D, the team behind the innovative solar-powered plane just unveiled its detailed global flight route, which is set to take off in Abu Dhabi. In addition to making solar aviation history, the Swiss co-founders, Betrand Piccard, Andr Borschberg, and the Solar Impulse 2 Partners hope that the completion of the worlds first circumnavigating solar flight will boost greater support for clean, renewable technologies.

Slated for take off in either late February or early March 2015, the Solar Impulse 2 flight is expected to span approximately 25 flight days across 5 months and land in 12 different locations. The single-seater plane will cover approximately 21,748 miles at speeds between 30 and 60 miles per hour. Although its not the first solar airplane, the emissions-free Solar Impulse 2 is the most energy efficient aircraft to date and can fly without fuel for five consecutive days and nightsa feat no other plane has ever achieved.

With our attempt to complete the first solar powered round-the-world flight, we want to demonstrate that clean technology and renewable energy can achieve the impossible, says Bertrand Piccard, initiator and chairman of Solar Impulse. We want youth, leaders, organizations and policymakers to understand that what Solar Impulse can achieve in the air, everyone can accomplish here on the ground in their everyday lives. Renewable energy can become an integral part of our lives, and together, we can help save our planets natural resources.

The round-the-world route will start in Abu Dhabi and include stops in Muscat Oman; Ahmedabad and Varanasi, India; Mandalay, Myanmar; and Chongqing and Nanjing, China. The plane will then fly across the Pacific Ocean via Hawaii and stop in at least three U.S. citiesPhoenix, New York City, and a to-be-determined Midwestern city. Lastly, the plane will cross the Atlantic back to Abu Dhabi, with a stopover in either Southern Europe or North Africa.

As much as I'm excited by the proposal of atom-by-atom fabrication through creative use of nanotechnology, I find it somewhat lacking. When I watch something like Star Trek, I'm not impressed by the ability to create any object on demand as much as I'm impressed by the ability to turn *any* object into *any other* object on demand. I can't help but feel that the truly liberating application of such nanotechnology lies not in the creation of macroscopic objects but rather their total destruction.

Our civilization produces incomprehensible quantities of waste, waste that is composed of useful chemical elements. Instead of utilizing that waste we throw it into the countryside or the ocean, often in a form that is harmful to our environment. The same environment we rely on to produce the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. At the same time we are ever expanding our exploitation of natural resources in order to extract enough new wealth from the ground to replace the wealth we carelessly cast aside.

Recycling technologies have many shortfalls with a great many conditions that must be satisfied in order to be feasible. For all the limitations, recycling technology can also tend to be costly and resource intensive while producing substandard materials. It is not an ideal situation. It seems to me that we need a better technology, one designed to handle a tremendous variety of materials, be it glass, metal, plastic, wood, household garbage or toxic chemical/biological waste.

Instead of dumping our trash in the ocean, our coal ash in quiet mountain valleys, attempting to sequester various elements and compounds deep beneath the ground in the name of environmentalism we should use them. Break them down to the smallest scale and sort them by their chemical element, even their isotope. Then we can use those formerly harmful or useless stockpiles of waste in any way we please, ways that are *not* harmful to ourselves or the environment. If we could do this, all of our trash, all of the poison we spew across our planet would become treasure. Instead of destroying nature to perpetuate ourselves, we could destroy our past waste and restore nature to our own direct material benefit.

How practical is this type of calculated destruction? What technological or scientific advancement would be required in order to build nanomachines capable of fulfilling the above conditions? What do we need to do in order to accomplish a truly sustainable model for human civilization?",20,14,False,self,,,,,

By further developing this it might be possible to make a ship that would allow our species to escape total destruction by rogue AI**

The recent warnings concerning AI made by Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and some other people I highly respect have made me think about the issue quite a bit. 

It's quite straightforward that it will be much harder to develop an AI with ethics and 'common sense' than to develop one without them. This makes it likely that the latter will arrive first, and such an AI could very well become an existential risk to humanity. I suggest reading the [Paperclip maximizer](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer) thought experiment to get a sense of why these systems could be so dangerous. If such an AI goes rogue it will most likely mean the end of our civilization, but I think I might have found a way to at least save our species. 

An AI of this type does not end humanity out of malice, it only does so to optimize its goal. My idea for saving humanity rests on the premise that we can build a craft that would cost the AI more energy and resources to capture than it could ever return. In this case the AI would logically decide not to pursue. 

I think the technology designed during Project Orion could be used to make such a craft. I recommend [reading the whole wiki page on Project Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_%28nuclear_propulsion%29#Vehicle_architecture) as it's fascinating, but these are the features relevant to my proposal:

* Project Orion was a study of a spacecraft intended to be directly propelled by a series of explosions of atomic bombs behind the craft (nuclear pulse propulsion).

* studies indicate that the top cruise velocity that can theoretically be achieved by a Teller-Ulam thermonuclear unit powered Orion starship, assuming no fuel is saved for slowing back down, is about 8% to 10% of the speed of light (0.08-0.1c).

* The biggest design is the ""super"" Orion; at 8 million tonnes, it could easily be a city.[11] In interviews, the designers contemplated the large ship as a possible interstellar ark. This extreme design could be built with materials and techniques that could be obtained in 1958 or were anticipated to be available shortly after. The practical upper limit is likely to be higher with modern materials.

* A working prototype of Orion could have been built and launched in the 60s, but this was never done due to the nuclear test ban treaty. 

After all the nukes needed to reach top speed have been launched it's physically impossible to make it go back unless it's overtaken by another vehicle, captured and slowed down. The resources that remain on the ship would never be worth the energy expenditure needed to make this happen.

However the AI might still be able to make effective use of the ship if it managed to commandeer it remotely, and then used nanobots or something to reshape all the resources into a new computer able to perform useful calculations that could then be beamed back to the core of the AI, which is in the process of taking over the solar system. 

I think it's possible to counter this threat by making sure no self assembling nanotech could be made on the ship. In this case the worst the AI would be able to do remotely is take over the computer systems, but these would be useless compared the systems it has engineered for itself in the solar system. As an extra precaution it would make sense to make some low tech analog redundancy systems, so it would be easy to regain control if necessary. Somewhat like Battlestar Galactica, but better thought through.

The final short term threat is that the AI could at some point build a small probe containing nanomachines able to repurpose the ship. But in all cases it would seem to be more efficient to launch its nanomachines at the billions upon billions of space rocks that aren't moving away at 0.1c

However in the long term if the AI keeps on expanding until it takes over the whole galaxy it would probably also consume the ship at some point. 

We could hope there are other species out there that didn't screw up and who stop the rogue AI once it annoys them. If we bet on this scenario we could take the extra nukes needed to slow down and land a colony pod on some other planet around another star.

Alternatively we could aim our ship into the void between galaxies. But while this could save us from death by AI, we would eventually die as our nuclear power runs out in the dark galactic void.

I think this concept is worth a feasibility study. I called the proposal Elon's Ark as I can see no other person doing something like it. It's perfectly in line with Elon Musk's goal of ensuring the future survival of humanity. Once he has successfully colonized Mars it would be the perfect place to build and test Orion since fallout isn't much of an issue there. If the threat of AI is successfully mastered, the development of Orion would still prove to be extremely useful for the purposes originally imagined by its designers.

What I mean by this is, for example, calculus taking the spot of algebra in high school and algebra being taught in say middle school. I am really not sure but I imagine there was a time when algebra and geometry were consider ""higher"" math, sort of like calculus is today. In this time, people may have known basic arithmetic but didn't encounter algebra until they were much older. Another example that I actually read (I don't remember where) before is that in the past, several hundred years ago, linear algebra and the idea of matrices was not taught until ""grad"" school. 

The idea can be extended to physics were in the future, more physics is taught in middle/high school and intro physics classes at a university will cover introductory quantum physics. Obvious extensions to biology, computer science, engineering, etc. may also be considered.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this?",14,26,False,self,,,,,

I would call this period of transition a technological purgatory.  A short painful time until true abundance is finally reached. The mega rich will initially use automation to cut millions of employees in the name of profit.  Since the mega rich 'own' the government the government will be manhandled into paying the heavy cost of the job losses (funded by the middle class no doubt as the mega rich grow in wealth and use them as the main source of that wealth).  However this golden period for the mega rich will be short lived.  It reaches a point where they have put so many out of work, no one can actually afford all of their robotic created products and services.  The government also can no longer afford to have most of the population on welfare.  The mega rich and their corporations avoid taxes up to this point as like I mentioned, they own the government and created the best possible environment to suit themselves.  However, civil unrest begins to emerge on a mass scale.  The 'owned' government officials ultimately decide to rebel against their handlers (the mega rich) in order to save their own asses.  Most of the top 0.5% billionaires in the US at this point bug out to remote locations such as New Zealand.  The country is in a state of pandemonium at this stage.  Mass civil unrest which is beyond containment, the mega-rich and rich still in the USA are targeted and wiped out by mob violence.  A new government emerges that embraces technology and automation for the good of all.  It gives all citizens a guaranteed income while also creating an abundance infrastructure.  Soon, food and necessities become free to all, then more follows until the concepts of greed and wealth mean nothing.",151,95,False,self,,,,,

Robotisation will come very soon. Many people will loose their jobs. Manufacturing will come first. People will be replaced by robots. Not all of them but many. In car industry it happend years ago. Still car companies hire more and more people. It will change soon, but it is not something that will happen over night. We are humans and it makes us intelligent creatures. What does it mean? It means that we are born to be flexible and to change. People will find other jobs. Not all of the jobs will disapear within a year or decade. At the same time everything will be cheaper and cheaper due to robotisation. With today wage you will soon buy three times more. ( China did that to whole planet, now robots will beat them at the second wave ). You will need less money to live today's life. New companies will appear in thousands due to low cost of production ( there wil be whole vast factories full of robots waiting to be outsourced to small companies just as servers do today ). Big percentage of those companies will hire for many jobs we do not dream about today ( there are tons of jobs today that did not exist 3-5 years ago ). Many people will just sit and do nothing because they will not be able or willing to change fields, but it happend many times before ( horses disapeard, furnitures are mass made, etc.). We can't do anything about that but we will try to help them anyway. Some people will change some will not. Money will not go away. We will trade as always. Poor people will have enought money to live and not starve or freeze. They will always be as they always where you can't change that. Being poor sux, but it is getting better and better. Taxes will be spend as they always are. There will not be a revolution with people on the streets in general. Some people will feel used and not treated as they should in their opinion and they will riot as they always do, but it would be young people doing it for ""fun"" as it is now. Computers will help us with everything making our lifes real easy ( applying for a job, making groceries, even starting a new bussines will be just bunch of words said aloud in your bedroom, rest will be done for you [there will be start ups writing code that will do rest for you: check market, check patents, check manufactures, prices, finidng clients, marketing, delivering, paying tax, sending money to your account]). Life is going to be easy as it never was, but many people will still struggle. Economy will grow faster then ever, middle class will grow with it and as they will spend money people will find jobs in customer service, food industry and many more. Lower class will not use human help that much, but from time to time peole will have to speak with people to get things done. In the middle time robotisation will continue and more and more people will have to change fields of work or start their own start ups. Fast changes are comming but world will not break in a half.

785,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015-2-11,2015,2,11,18,2viszw,self.Futurology,How many others think the 'futurology' we talk about now will be realized within 5 years? 10 years at most?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2viszw/how_many_others_think_the_futurology_we_talk/,[deleted],1423648400,"We're not talking about ""far future"" stuff, we're talking about ""wake up tomorrow and woah"" stuff.

For example;      
The convergence of electric vehicles and self-driving vehicles.    
We already have electric vehicles, with more and more research into making them better with longer range.      

I believe Musk has plans for expanding charging stations as well, across the US (can't recall specifics).     

We already have semi-self driving cars, advertised on TV the break before you can think ... because we humans kinda suck at driving.     
With Google and others working on completely driving vehicles, they will get better and quickly become 'normal'.

But when these things converge ... suddenly we can have long range, self-driving cargo transport. I suspect we will see this first. And the reality of millions without jobs due to automation will be apparent within 5 years, 10 years at most.     
It's going to be ... interesting.

edit*: Actually, I don't think the 'job-loss' is going to be overnight. Trucker Unions will see the threat to their job, and will rally 'against' auto-freight (exactly what they should do). Make a fuss, fears will be stoked, laws will be passed, and there will be a transition between human-freighters to auto-freighters with a human co-pilot (still compensated in full). Then companies will see it's cheaper to actually just pay their workers a pension (less than full compensation of course) and get rid of them than keep them doing nothing. This could see the advent of Privatized UBI.    
This could also open the Truckers as a surprising source of 'renaissance men'. They got the money, they got the time, and some will pursue significant self-improvement.

---     

HP and ""The Machine"" and memristors.     
If it pans out, or even if it doesn't to HP's benefit, our smartphones within 5 years will be even more powerful than today's laptops.    
Smartphones have already changed so many things (information everywhere).     
I suspect in 5 years, the different between then and now will be similar to or a bigger difference than between now and the early 1990s-2000s.

---       

The EmDrive!     
If this pans out, and it's looking more and more promising but not yet 'solid' ... I think we will have a fast-tracked launch system within 5 years. And we'll be sending something (probably drones) to Mars and throughout the Solar System in the time span of weeks.    
And this will be the big ""woah"" moment. Where people wake up and see, we sent probes to a variety of other planets in a very short period of time.     
And suddenly those old ""sci-fi dreams"" are staring us in the face.

---    

All of these things we talk about now are closer than they appear.     
I think even people in this sub are going to be shocked by it, too.       
Even the futurists will experience future-shock within 5 or 10 years.     

So what else is there that will pop up faster than most people are ready for?

For example;      
The convergence of electric vehicles and self-driving vehicles.    
We already have electric vehicles, with more and more research into making them better with longer range.      

I believe Musk has plans for expanding charging stations as well, across the US (can't recall specifics).     

We already have semi-self driving cars, advertised on TV the break before you can think ... because we humans kinda suck at driving.     
With Google and others working on completely driving vehicles, they will get better and quickly become 'normal'.

But when these things converge ... suddenly we can have long range, self-driving cargo transport. I suspect we will see this first. And the reality of millions without jobs due to automation will be apparent within 5 years, 10 years at most.     
It's going to be ... interesting.

edit*: Actually, I don't think the 'job-loss' is going to be overnight. Trucker Unions will see the threat to their job, and will rally 'against' auto-freight (exactly what they should do). Make a fuss, fears will be stoked, laws will be passed, and there will be a transition between human-freighters to auto-freighters with a human co-pilot (still compensated in full). Then companies will see it's cheaper to actually just pay their workers a pension (less than full compensation of course) and get rid of them than keep them doing nothing. This could see the advent of Privatized UBI.    
This could also open the Truckers as a surprising source of 'renaissance men'. They got the money, they got the time, and some will pursue significant self-improvement.

edit2: To clarify!     
Within 5 years: We'll see auto-freight. The Unions will rally.     
Within 10 years: Laws will be passed, ""human oversight"" or something that preserves those trucker jobs.      
After 10 years: possibility of just being cheaper to 'retire'/pension the human truckers. That was over-the-horizon conjecture.

---     

HP and ""The Machine"" and memristors.     
If it pans out, or even if it doesn't to HP's benefit, our smartphones within 5 years will be even more powerful than today's laptops.    
Smartphones have already changed so many things (information everywhere).     
I suspect in 5 years, the different between then and now will be similar to or a bigger difference than between now and the early 1990s-2000s.

---       

The EmDrive!     
If this pans out, and it's looking more and more promising but not yet 'solid' ... I think we will have a fast-tracked launch system within 5 years. And we'll be sending something (probably drones) to Mars and throughout the Solar System in the time span of weeks.    
And this will be the big ""woah"" moment. Where people wake up and see, we sent probes to a variety of other planets in a very short period of time.     
And suddenly those old ""sci-fi dreams"" are staring us in the face.

---    

All of these things we talk about now are closer than they appear.     
I think even people in this sub are going to be shocked by it, too.       
Even the futurists will experience future-shock within 5 or 10 years.     

So what else is there that will pop up faster than most people are ready for?      
Or do you think I am *way* off on these things being near-term events?",42,19,False,self,,,,,

Just because it has grown exponentially in the past, doesn't meant that it will necessarily continue doing so. I remember when I was taking a calculus course in college my math teacher took a moment to really emphasize that, in real life, nothing can continue to grow exponentially indefinitely. Exponential functions just grow too quickly and will run into limits. For example, bacteria replicating is a process of exponential growth, but it always runs into a wall at some point that prevents it from growing further. In fact almost all animals grow exponentially but every single species starts running into factors that begin to temper their growth.


So my question is, why should we assume that the exponential growth of technology will continue indefinitely, or even continue in the near future?

Americans have the tools and money to create an America where all workers are employed, whose every square mile is beautiful; whose cities are safe playgrounds for children; whose food is fresh and affordable; whose waters are clean from sea to crystal sea.  An America run by Americans for Americans is fully capable of rebuilding all homes so theyre earthquake-proof, hurricane-proof, tornado-proof, flood-proof, drought-proof, fireproof, and bank-proof.  When Americans [take control of money](http://www.paulglover.org/hours), we are wealthy enough to build an America where its easy to stay healthy and to get healed; where costs of living get smaller and our lives get bigger.
 
What blocks these goals?  Both Us and Them.  

On the one hand, all of Americas institutions have become too big to change.  Like sumo wrestlers in a basketball game, they move too slow.  Big Government, Big Oil, Big Insurance, Big Finance, Big Agriculture, Big Highway, Big Education, Big Military, Big Prison, Big Police, Big Poverty-- these feed on disaster and control.  They no longer exist primarily to [fix problems](http://www.paulglover.org/0304.html), but to grow.

Then on the other hand, millions of us are employed by these institutions to enforce the past.  Millions of us depend on their stocks.  Many of us watch their commercials and obey their laws.  Many prefer dull safety to risky action, even to save
America.  We drive straight, even when the road curves.

Therefore American politics wallows like a car stuck in mud, going nowhere but deeper.

As a result, the Middle Class dream has become a burden sinking millions through mortgage, insurance, utilities, tuition, credit card fees, cars and fashion.  Consumerism by liberals and conservatives alike has depleted Americas essential resources and our national sovereignty.

The next American generations will never achieve Middle Class excess.  Thats good for the planet and tough for them.  Fortunately, though, Millennials can become a prosperous Mutual Class by starting genuinely nonprofit [mutual aid systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_society) that enable them to live well by sharing resources.  Such programs were widespread and successful one hundred years ago.

Through them we create [millions of jobs](http://www.paulglover.org/1111.html) that revive our neighborhoods.  We give ourselves raises by lowering prices.  And all our current skills are employed while we enjoy new talents.

Young and old, we will become the government as we create these regional food systems and regional stock exchanges, establish green co-housing programs and green labor administrations, reduce dependence on fossil fuels toward zero, replace automobile space with train and bike space, convert vacant urban land into greenhouses and orchards, develop co-operative health plans and clinics, issue our own education credentials and our own community money.

Such [local systems](http://www.issuu.com/metroeco/docs/htp.1)prepare us to take power&lt;/a&gt; by creating parallel authority.  By taking power together we regain time for creative individuality.  We move from dependence to ownership.

The Mutual Class will also pioneer Mutual Enterprise-- local businesses committed to community, ecology, and social justice.

Lets look at a sample Mutual Day.  We start with sex and music, then breakfast.  We walk or bike to work, four days per week.  After three hours work, we return home for a long lunch and sex, or we eat with co-workers: we discuss work plans, utility and durability of product, marketing, sales, prices and wages.  Then two more hours of work.  We have time and energy for an afternoon stroll or game, then prepare dinner, make music, make love (Why so much sex?  Because were relaxed).  We finish with an evening stroll in our beautiful neighborhood.

To achieve such better dreams, Americans must at the same time confront anti-American institutions.  Laws that forbid urgent change are a cage for us to die in.  Regulations must be broken when they  block American liberation from debt, layoffs, foreclosure and bankruptcy, earthquakes, tornados, floods, heat waves, cold snaps, blackouts and traffic jams.

This is merely the revolutionary American tradition that ended slavery, gained votes for women, won the eight-hour workday, secured civil rights, and started this nation.  By contrast, conferences and elections are powerless displays.

Yet the most direct path to deflate bad authority is to withdraw personal dependence.  Time to leave the car in the mud and get back on track.  Use train, bike or feet rather than car.  Shop less and shop local.  Move your money into a local bank or credit union.  Insulate your housing.  Be a creator, not a consumer.  Eat less meat or none.  Have one or fewer children.

The next America will look entirely different than the one we know.  Well have &lt;a href=issuu.com/metroeco/docs/lahof&gt;fun building it&lt;/a&gt; and our grandchildren will thank us.  America went to the moon.  Now America will go to the future.

Both a US and UK TP have been legally formed, and other groups are organizing on social media.  The Transhumanist Parties are based on the ideology of transhumanism, but have been supported by members of other minor political parties, such as the Pirate Party.   Organizations that have facilitated the development of the TP are the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technology, Humanity+, and the London Futurist.   You can contribute to the development of the Transhumanist Party ideology by participating at the following subreddit. [Transhumanist Party](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranshumanistParty/)

It is guaranteed to be a thing as soon as the battery problem is resolved - keeping the camera on at all times and real time image processing is very power intensive. You can have a remote server do the processing for you of course, but the affordable bandwidth for that kind of thing isn't quite there yet.

The basic recognition is there now: software can easily detect dilated pupils, can detect if somebody is looking at you, and can detect if the pupils dilate when they are looking at you. Other projects have been reported to be able to detect heartbeats and breathing rates, and a camera of sufficient quality can easily detect blushing for lighter skin tones, and an IR camera can easily detect increased blood flow on everybody. Heck - an IR camera could make short work of detecting blood rushing to various body parts and come up with a good approximation of physical arousal as well.

We already have the hardware needed (Kinect) to actually interpret motions as well, so write the software that vibrates your phone if a girl looks at you, touches her hair, lowers her eyes and turns away. With appropriate code your phone could prompt you if somebody has been staring at you for 30 seconds, or if they winked (just in case you missed it), bit their lip and blushed.

There isn't anything that bleeding edge here, mainly just engineering limitations that will be overcome within 5-10 years.

We have also seen that pervade the secondary industries, like the manufacturing of cars and the way that only one person is needed to overview many machines doing their process.
 Nowadays, we are seeing a mechanic invasion into the tertiary industry - for instance in supermarkets where it is both cheaper and more economically efficient for a corporation (such as Tesco in the UK) to have 2 people overseeing 7 or 8 automated robotic cashiers. Things like this are developing, and eventually I assume that there will be a gradual decline in jobs fulfilled by humans in this sector.

Plenty of restaurants use it , both regular and high-end. And it can create great food. 

Let's assume some time in the future, every home has a sous-vide cooker. Let's also assume it's easy to order premade sous-vide from amazon(using amazon fresh), and Amazon , as usual ,offers a huge variety of such high quality meals(or even meal components , letting you mix and match) - so it's easy to choose new and intriguing dishes, if you want. It also gives you great recommendation based on your previous meals,or your friends preferences with same taste as you. 

The process will be fully automated - you just put the sous-vide in the cooker, and the cooker reads a labels and sets itself. After 20-30  minutes(in which you can relax with a glass of wine), your waiter(i.e. amazon echo, you spe: ""meal is ready"".

You put the meal on the table, tell you amazon echo ""set the right mood"", and it automatically set a great background music for your liking, closes the shades, and sets your hue lamp to a romantic color.

They then follow a sequence of events as defined by their logic program and turn the information from those inputs into outputs (I.e turn motor 1a on, move conveyor 3, add more psi, etc).

This industrial control setup is very well defined and very prevelant in manufacturing. 

My thinking is; right now, operators are required to adjust some settings and babysit thr machines to make sure they're producing good parts and not faulting out. I'm wondering if evolutionary algorithms could be applied to ladder logic and essentially have the machine learn how to create the perfect part and how to correct its own faults.

The advantages include: being able to upgrade the parts you want, i.e. bigger battery, more space, better processor, higher resolution screen, etc. There could be online marketplaces where you buy second hand parts. You wouldn't need tools, or technical knowledge, just click it together. This would save you money, and reduce waste.

With an electric car, you would have a [generic chassis, and you could swap the passenger section with a lightweight carbon fibre convertible, or SUV, or mini 2 seater to save battery power](http://cr4.globalspec.com/PostImages/201001/gm_autonomy_car_59E2C8D5-989D-E476-29E3A0CC9A88BC6F.jpg). Then when you can afford it, buy a new, bigger battery chassis, and sell the old one.

And buy houses in sections (there are some companies already doing this), so while you can afford it, you have a bedroom section, kitchen/lounge/dinning section, laundry/bathroom section, then add more sections as you need/can afford them, like more bedrooms when the kids come along. [But if 3d printing homes becomes prevalent, it will be dirt cheap to just ""print"" a big-ass house to begin with.](http://news.domain.com.au/domain/real-estate-news/china-3d-prints-mansion-and-apartment-block-20150122-12vkri.html?rand=1421894371139)

I'd like to discuss some points that I've been mulling over and I thought I'd put them here. Keep in mind when I mean singularity I don't necessarily mean the advent of strong AI but rather a point in time where the rate of advancement is so great that it's hard to determine what happens beyond it. I'd like to make two points first. As far as my discussion on automation is concerned it takes a familiarity with the topic of basic income to explain what happens to the increasing number of unemployed people. My second point is, I do not address the topic of artificial intelligence because I do not believe artificial intelligence is necessary to create a singularity (A point that you can not see beyond) Although I don't believe it is necessary for a singularity, it may be an eventuality.


**Great minds think alike, greater minds shape our world.** - As the price point of computing power continues to spiral downward and footprint of computers becomes smaller and smaller (computers -&gt; laptops -&gt; mobile devices -&gt; and soon ubiquitous computing with a very small footprint such as a computer imbedded in your clothing or built into a pair of glasses) it will allow a larger percentage of people to have internet access. 

It's my belief that people want to make the right choices. by ""right"" I mean what's right for them as an individual to accomplish what they want to accomplish. Knowledge is power, and that power is growing. For anyone born in the 80's and before you most likely have a better perspective on information technology. This goes along with my premise that we are living in a closed system, a system that is running better and better through millions and millions of better or ""right"" choices. To put things in perspective, a day in the life of someone in 1982 vs today.

* ""Honey, what time are we supposed to pick up the kids from practice?"" ""8:00"" ""Well I hope they'll be there on time when we show up."" Vs. (a text) ""It's 8:00 and we're here."" ""Be there in 2 minutes practice was delayed some.""

* ""Did you hear about that new type of virus on the news? It sounds dangerous. I wonder how it spreads.."" ""...Fuck if I know."" Vs. ""Did you hear about that new virus? I should go online to see if there are any cases locally and figure out how I can avoid it.""

* ""Fuck, traffic is a mess today!"" Vs. ""Fuck, I'm glad I have this app that let's me find the least congested route to work!""

* ""Shit, I'm out of condoms. Is it ok to reuse them?"" ""Ya sure dude, I've tried it before without any problems. Vs. What the fuck was I thinking?! I'm glad I looked that up..""

To summarize this point, people acting with more and better knowledge will create a better world with fewer and fewer problems. How does this relate to the singularity though? Well, it doesn't. Rather, it doesn't relate directly but rather, indirectly. If people are making a higher and higher proportion of ""right"" decisions as time goes on it will reflect in better, more stable conditions where an intelligent, democratic society can make a more positive world which will be more and more suitable for the singularity to occur.


**Yes, the bots are here for work. Here's your severance pay.** - Automation has a way of creeping up on you. Most people tend to think of automation as a machine that takes over one specific task such as self check-out's reducing the number of cashiers but automation is more than that. In my opinion automation is more about streamlining a closed system. In software development it may be a new program that allows a programmer to perform more and more lateral tasks. Lateral tasks being tasks that require different skill sets. These new programs and/or ways of doing business will allow one worker to perform more and more tangential tasks in their field which will decrease the level of competency the worker will need to have to perform these lateral tasks because the new program and/or way of doing business is doing a higher and higher proportion of the ""grunt"" work and allowing the worker to do the more difficult tasks laterally. To simplify it, the worker is a jack of all trades, master of none. This streamlining of work will, along with narrow physical automation will put ~~us all~~ many of us out of a job sooner than we may think.


**It's all about altruism, baby.** - As automation takes up more and more jobs that leaves a larger and larger proportion of the population out of work with time on their hands. Many will choose to do nothing, others will choose to pursue their artistic endeavors while some will choose to continue working. Wait, continue working? Didn't you just say they were out of work? Well, yes although not in the traditional sense. For this point I'll talk about some examples how someone in this subset of the population who chooses to ""work"" can affect positive change. (by work I mean occupying themselves while giving themselves a purpose in life.) For the sake of discussion it's the year 2020 when VR and AR are both much more common.

* A group with a similar interest gets together in a VR space to do something positive. AR and VR will make any type of collaborative effort much better.

* A person is having a life crisis. An advanced algorithm using data sifting, personality matching or biometric data matches you with a volunteer who has gone through a VERY similar life experience to help them go through the life crisis. Of course all of the data in the algorithm would be given away voluntarily by the user. (Imagine how long THAT ToS would be. lol)

* Using a digital surrogate a person can go to Sub-Saharan Africa to build new infrastructure, teach or manage any number of tasks from the comfort of their home. This person can devote any number of hours helping someone using a digital surrogate. Even if helping someone is 1/3 of tasks performed by a digital surrogate it will still be greatly beneficial, especially if millions and millions have access to this technology.

* A person signs up for a website for those who still wish to be productive and social. You choose a task to do based on 2 criteria. This website has a broad range of categories to participate in such as, leisure, work and gaming. Along with a category, it rates and lists tasks by estimated time to completion and difficulty to accomplish. you choose the category and amount of involvement you wish to devote to it and after you have made your selection you're connected with a group of people in a virtual space. It will use all kinds of data to match you with exactly what you want without having to find the people to do it. Want to recreate your favorite movie scene? There's a group for that. Want to collaborate with people in your field to solve an ongoing problem? There's a group for that. Want to join a group that has the same very specific struggles you have? There's a group for that. Want to throw the biggest surprise party you've ever seen? There's a group for that.

To summarize this point, with the internet becoming ubiquitous and VR and AR being part of day to day life in the very near future you will have the tools to change the lives of both yourself and others in ways you didn't know were possible. Now, this is based on the assumption that on the whole, humans are altruistic and want to better their community as well as themselves.


**So, what does it all add up to?** - Now as time goes by and our little closed system on Earth is chugging along with better and better conditions to bring about the singularity much faster than many think it will. I'll reiterate my points and state how it all comes together to bring the singularity much faster.

The growing use and pervasiveness of information technology will make people more and more able to make the right decisions. --&gt; These more and more knowledgeable people will be displaced from the workforce through automation. --&gt; As automation displaces a larger and larger percentage of the population these intelligent people will use their time with alarming precision and flexibility to bring about the singularity very rapidly. I think these three topics I discussed. Knowledge, automation and the human need to work and help others will interact with one another to create a POWERFUL snowball effect that will shape our world into something great, a singularity we dare yet imagine.

For example, self-driving cars introduce a huge number of new attack vectors for anyone interested in doing you bodily harm.
  
See http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/07/professor-spoofs-80m-superyachts-gps-receiver-on-the-high-seas/ for a practical demonstration of just some of the vulnerabilities that could be exploited in an automated car (really any of Todd Humphreys' research is pretty good).  The focus of most of these attacks is the actual control systems in the vehicles (specifically their feedback mechanisms).

Another concern is what will happen when we get to the point where we have a reliable brain to computer interface.  How can we guarantee security?  One exploit could leave hundreds dead, or mindless slaves.  Do we have research addressing how to design perfectly secure systems (proof-of correctness through all paths in a program, constant audits, etc?)?  Additionally, if we have that thorough an understanding of neuroscience, what's to stop us from reading people's minds?  Will privacy die?

Hell, I remember a story a professor told me where his group had designed a prosthetic limb to assist a quadriplegic (the limb was attached to the wheelchair the man used).  Someone demonstrated an exploit over WiFi where they could get the limb to potentially strangle the quadriplegic.  The research team hadn't considered malicious uses of the prosthetic.  I fear this thing is all too common, and of huge concern as technology becomes a more and more integral part of our lives and bodies.

So what do you think?  Any specific fears, research you've seen addressing these issues, thoughts in general?  Just trying to spark a discussion.",5,6,False,self,,,,,

If not for the level of help I receive, I would probably be homeless.  This is something I tell you not for sympathy, but because of its relevance to the topic: I am a highly educated person with quite a few marketable skills, but I cannot afford to participate in the world I see evolving around me.  

I can't afford to pay $500 a year for mobile internet, or buy touchscreen devices, or have the kind of phone that can have apps on it.  If I go anywhere new, I print out a map on paper exactly as I would have done a decade ago, because my phone doesn't have maps.  I've never used one of those block-code things you can scan with an iPhone to look something up - I don't even know what they're called, and I am not some old man who has an excuse to not know that.

I don't text people, because my phone is a prepaid.  It doesn't have a camera either.  Even though I love technology and I read about it constantly, I am as personally ignorant of it as someone twice my age.  

I'm not making any political arguments about my situation - it just is what it is.  But *if* current trends continue - which I know should never be assumed, either optimistically or pessimistically - the gap between what technology can do and who can use it will probably grow in tandem with the gap between rich and poor.  So if that turns out to be the case, what do we do about it?

How do we avoid a dystopian future ruled not by malevolent machines, but malevolent people who own all the machines while everyone else scrounges for survival and are derided and dehumanized as ""superfluous"" by their corporate overlords?

It feels as if the *way* technology is being developed is excluding people a lot more quickly than it is creating new opportunities for them.  Can we have bold, ambitious technological development models that bring the rest of society along for the ride, and don't just throw people away as objectified ""dead weight""?

At what point can we say technology is good enough that the only thing sustaining these in-equalitarian, hierarchical, often oppressive market models is social and political inertia, and that we can make a choice to finally step beyond Scarcity economics?  At what point do we *finally* have the technology to treat human beings - all human beings - as they should be treated?",47,26,False,self,,,,,

 Facebook purchasing Oculus, and releasing a mobile VR headset with Samsung, Google's $540m investment in Magic Leaps 'cinematic reality,' Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk starting an AI hype, Microsoft buying Minecraft and announcing the Hololens, Google working with SpaceX on creating a network of satellites beaming down internet for the world, Amazon's Drone Delivery, DeepMinds AI, Windows 10 Cortana, Uber and Google's self driving cabs, and now Apple's plans for automated electric cars... All in the last year alone. 

 I think we're going to see a lot more exciting stuff coming out of the tech industry in the next year, and we may even see some hype coming about where it's all headed. 

 I can't wait to see what Facebook wants to do with Oculus Rifts first consumer headset coming out soon. I'm also very excited to see what developers are gonna do with the Hololens this summer. Or even Magic Leaps first demo of their headset this summer. 

 We're in for some exciting times.

Will laws apply on a global level or be different depending on the claiming of land?

Would a miltary force be developed? Would it be a unified global military or would there be seperate militias?

How would politics be implemented? Who would implement them? And again, would it be unified or segregated?

In the technological generation *after* the James Webb Space Telescope (slated for launch in 2018), it's thought that telescopes will be able to make detailed analyses of exoplanet atmospheres of terrestrial-sized planets in the habitable zone of their stars.  Eventually one of the planets that is analyzed will have a strong oxygen signature.

Scientists will examine and build on the data for years, debating what non-biological processes might account for the findings.  Perhaps some plausible alternative explanations are found, but subsequent data continually strengthen the biological interpretation.  Additional details of the planet's atmosphere lend increasing credence to the idea of life.

Deductions are made about its water content and weather patterns.  Based on its orbit, rotation, and the properties of its star, conjectures are made about seasons and maybe about what kind of life is there, but it remains weak.  However, the strength of the biological interpretation causes world governments to devote significant resources to the subsequent telescope generation so that it can get much more detailed data.

It may take a decade of further effort and development, and many billions of dollars, to make the telescope capable of fully teasing out the nature of this world, but eventually it's launched.  Despite how amazingly advanced it is, we still would not have probe-quality imagery of the world, just vague light and temperature maps, and perhaps some nth-order deductions about continent shapes.  However, the data would be far more detailed than before, letting scientists begin to see the large-scale patterns of a biosphere at work.

Very likely they finally confirm that this is a living world, even though by then it would already have been hyped for years by the media.  Out of sheer optimism, and since there's no reason not to try, people would look for signs of technological activity in the atmospheric gases.  Most likely they don't find any, but still...life!

The study of this new living world would become a field unto itself within planetary sciences, generating a perpetual storm of new papers, new funding, new collaborations to study it with existing and proposed telescopes.  Perhaps 30-50 years after the initial detection of life signs, humankind gets its first clear image of this world, and is in awe for a moment.

Maybe it looks very similar to Earth, in which case the little differences would be the things that make it so amazing.  Perhaps its colors are just ever-so-slightly tinged differently, perhaps also due to whatever kind of star it orbits.  But maybe it has some radically exotic features too that amaze and awe.

This image becomes iconic and beloved, on par with the Earthrise image from the Apollo missions.  We saw our world as a whole in the 1960s and were awed, and now we see another world like our own and are reminded again of how special life is in the universe even as we discover how diverse and far-flung it is.

Based on the detailed readings, they deduce the general characteristics of the biosphere and its dominant organisms, but mostly just gross characteristics like relative biomass, and how energy and gases move through the system.  

Most likely the biosphere is simple, with microscopic photosynthesizers feeding microscopic animal life, so we would be repeatedly disappointed as each new generation of telescope failed to give us a glimpse of an individual organism.  But eventually maybe we glimpse some exotic large-scale mineral formations that these otherwise simple lifeforms produce, and that becomes our image of the life of that world.

Maybe this sounds boring for those of us raised on Star Trek contact scenarios with intelligent civilizations, but because it's thoroughly reality-based and - according to scientists, highly likely to occur in our lifetimes (or at least the initial detection) - I find this incredibly exciting to imagine.",35,18,False,self,,,,,

looking back at the last thousand years, by far the most influential event was the discovery of north and south america. european nations invading and annexing territory on the other side of the atlantic completely changed the course of history.

the difficulty and time required to travel between the continents by sea changed the way governors had to run their colonies, forcing them to be independent, and the inability of colonies to recieve timely military assistance or guidance made the ""home nations"" little more than glorified trading partners that the colony cannot refuse. 

they were, in every sense of the word, oppressed. governors had very little accountability to the people they governed, and a long delay in accountability to the empire, which created a crucial difference between the two cultures; 

the british citizens back in europe never needed to worry about being butchered on their home soil because empire's army would protect them.

the british citizens in the 13 colonies had to defend themselves. they could call for reinforcements, but the significant delay meant they could not rely on the british empire to protect them.

people will happily pay taxes and tolerate whatever conditions they're subjected to, as long as they dont face existential threats such as a two way war of extermination between the colonists and the natives, *and especially not if they figure out that not only is the empire unable to adequately protect them, the empire also responsible for the massacres that ignited the race war between the native americans and the colonists.*

watching your government wage a genocide against tribespeople who originally welcomed and assisted the european colonists, tends to make you feel like you've been tricked, and that your *""glorious empire""* is a conspiracy theorist's nightmare, a tyrannical murderous government trying to the ""paradise"" of the new world into a bastion of european industrial wage slave oppression.

the colonists saw that as time went on, their ""new world"" was becoming more and more like the old world nightmare they had escaped, but if the native americans could be free on the north american continent with numerous european empires breathing down their necks and without advanced european warfare and weapons, the only thing the colonists needed in order to assert their independence and freedom was the will to do so. 

taxation disputes and the british empire's use of authoritarian methods of stopping civil unrest provoked tensions on both sides, the colonists were experiencing the same thing the natives had experienced hundreds of years ago, exploitation and oppression by trigger happy religious psychopaths who believe they have a divine right to own the entire planet and murder anyone who opposes them.

the difference was that unlike the natives, the colonists were battle hardened, they had been fighting a genocidal war against various native tribes for over 100 years, they had learnt the strategies the natives used, they knew the weaknesses of the empire, both strategic, military and political.

the american war of independence was a tipping point, the culmination of societal change that predates the british empire.

contact with the natives revolutionised european political and religious beliefs, uprooting the catholic church's strangehold on european thinking, entire continents existed on the other side of the atlantic that the catholic church had no idea even existed, the myth of the catholic church being the mouthpiece of god was destroyed, along with the legitimacy of their rule over the kings and people of europe.

europeans began to do things they hadn't done in almost a thousand years, they questioned the things they had been taught to believe, they challenged the authority of the church, they explored the philosophies of the ancient greeks, they re-learnt how to think for themselves.

europeans began to suspect that there is more to life than being a cog in a tyrannical imperial meatgrinder that would not be satisfied until the entire planet was nothing but soldiers and wage slaves living in slums to elevate the wealth of a king/emperor/church.

many simply went from being oppressed by the church in rome, to being oppressed by their own kings, who ruled through fear of outsiders, rather than through fear of of god's wrath for defying his ""divine representatives"". the threat of god punishing those who defy the church was losing its credibility as a threat, but the threat of war with other european nations was becoming worse than ever.

to put it simply, people went west, ideas went east. the europeans conquered the continent of north america, but contact with the natives sparked ideas that ended a thousand years of oppression in europe, destroyed the empires that stole their homeland, and changed the world forever.

colonies break old ideas. colonies break empires. colonies foster the development of new technologies and manufacturing methods. colonies inspire new ideas.

we've enjoyed more than 200 years of freedom thanks to the people who set sail on dangerous voyages for the chance at life in a new world.

just because it isnt profitable doesnt mean its not worth it.

If we're stuck in our own light cone, then, given the vastness of interstellar space, the likelihood of extra-planetary species ever running into each other is vanishingly small, barring them developing within a few star systems of each other. Interstellar exploration would rely upon generation ships, taking thousands of years to reach nearby star systems. In this scenario, meaningfully exploring anything but the tiniest fragment of the galaxy is rendered nearly impossible.

As for the likelihood of intelligent life developing on other planets (i.e. the results of the Drake equation), we can only speculate. However, the more exoplanets we find, the more we are able to answer this fundamental question.

Personally, I think superluminal travel will turn out to be possible. Despite our relative technological and scientific ignorance, we've already begun to speculate on ways to circumvent the speed of light (contracting and expanding the fabric of space a la the Alcubierre metric; travel through wormholes; et cetera). And as our knowledge increases, I believe we'll eventually find a practical way to beat the relativistic speed limit. Further, I feel that the more we explore and learn about the galaxy, we'll find that the basic building blocks of life are not uncommon, and eventually, that other higher forms of life have developed on their own on other worlds.

Given these two stumbling blocks being out of the way, imagine an alien species, far more knowledgeable and sophisticated than we are. Able to build drives that can travel hundreds, thousands of times faster than the speed of light. Able to traverse the vast reaches of the galaxy. And further, able to build intelligent, self-replicating and highly sophisticated probes. These probes would potentially utilize sources of power currently beyond our grasp, but would likely also have the ability to recharge, via capturing interstellar matter or radiation from nearby suns. Further, they'd likely have the ability to replicate copies of themselves, and those copies could create copies, ad nauseum. Each probe would be able to travel to and inhabit its own star system, and within a not unreasonable period of time, every single star system in the galaxy would have a probe, unseen, monitoring its processes and following whatever metrics are of interest to the controlling species.

This is why, in my opinion, it's not entirely unlikely that our existence as a developing species is known to far more sophisticated civilizations than our own. Whatever their laws are regarding communicating with less developed societies, eventually we'll develop the technology to find and communicate with them. And that, my friends, will be very, very interesting indeed.

Space is big. We are small. The space between us and other worlds is separated by unthinkable spans of freezing irradiated airless darkness that is instant death to us humans. It is [easy to think](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2wku8m/why_i_feel_that_given_two_things_our_species_is/) that we are simply too fragile, too short-lived and too impatient to ever cross it and reach other stars while still being human.

I believe we can, and I believe some day we will - but I wonder about what we'll find.

**What We Can Do But Don't Do**

We invented interstellar travel in 1946. No, really. We [just never used it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_%28nuclear_propulsion%29), although there were some sound reasons for our decision as a species to hold off on building this remarkable machine.

Project Orion uses bombs. A lot of bombs. You might be understandably anxious about riding a craft driven by a constant stream of exploding nuclear bombs on the other side of some shock absorbers and an ablative steel plate, but we have the tools to lift something with the mass of 80 aircraft carriers and throw it at the stars at ~0.1c.

This is both expensive and dirty but vastly, vastly outperforms any other kind of rocket currently known to human beings. Ideally this would be carefully built in orbit to avoid even a dozen radiation deaths on Earth. Or maybe not, if we're in a hurry to leave for some reason.

It would take a minimum of 44 years to reach Alpha Centauri in a nuclear-driven starship.

**Why aren't we using X instead?**

We haven't invented a kickass pure fusion rocket to replace Orion, and relativity won't let you go faster-than-light. If you do have a FTL engine then it is also a time machine and I would suggest colonizing previous eras of Earth's history first.

We might eventually have antimatter or fusion and be technically capable of higher speeds but [radiation becomes an issue just from the speed at which you are plowing through interstellar clouds of hydrogen](http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0610030.pdf) if you travel too close to the speed of light. Orion has the convenient property of being miserably slow among proposed methods of interstellar travel and requiring a fair amount of radiation shielding anyway just to function so you don't burn to a crisp or drop dead from radiation sickness.

**But 44 Years Is Basically Forever**

To you, yes. Many of the people reading this are not that old.
If we ever invent cryogenics (and we might) then it's easier and even unmodified humans can make the flight, but what if we don't?

If we do launch such a ship we must bring a Galapagos tortoise. Why? Because they can live for 255 years and having a creature that was born on Earth reach a candidate exoplanet (potentially much more than 44 years) while still alive would be too cool to pass up.

Human beings will very likely invent ways to extend our own lifespans to at least tortoise-level before we are ready to launch starships and we should probably hurry up and invent that anyway before I get old.

And if we don't? If we stick purely to existing technology? Then the crew at launch will all be very old or dead, and they will have to produce a new generation while on the ship. I'm not saying generation ships are ethical (the children didn't choose to be on this mission) but the laws of physics won't stop you from doing it.

**What We Will Do**

Go to a star, spread out, colonize, and then eventually launch more starships from there.

Then launch starships from other places.

Then launch starships from those other places.

Even at sublight speeds and even if we can only travel a fairly short distance on each trip, a wave of colonization would slowly creep across the galaxy. The galaxy has been here for billions of years and will be here for many billions more, and unless we never build starships, wipe ourselves out or get wiped out by an external force we will cross it eventually. Just, colonization happens over geologic time.

Even if it takes 1,000 years to reach a star and build a new starship, exponential growth is a powerful thing.

**What's Out There**

If it is so easy then why hasn't someone else done it already? It would [only take 50 million years](http://www.fgcu.edu/CAS/Math/files/Spatial-Dispersion.pdf).

I don't know why not but finding out may be important.

Either we truly are alone or something stops ambitious lifeforms like us from just colonizing everything and being on every single piece of rock around every star including Earth. We don't appear to be sharing the planet with anybody though; you'd think we'd notice. Machines or tortoise aliens or giant waterbears should have beaten us to it and be everywhere.

Maybe we're the first intelligent life to even get as far as we have in the galaxy, or maybe Earth's the wrong kind of planet for the dominant form to settle and we're too primitive to be a threat. I don't know though. Something strange is going on here and if we understood it we'd be better prepared for when we finally cross the darkness and also for when we see what our own path of advancement looks like.

**What If I'm Wrong**

I tried to be as pessimistic as possible about the realities of interstellar travel. If I am wrong it is likely even easier to colonize other planets than I imagine, which just makes the question of why the galaxy appears uncolonized even more mysterious.

If aliens are watching Earth and reading this message then can you guys at least tell me? I'll keep secrets.",9,5,False,self,,,,,

We are told that technology and cultural attitudes have been making life better for humans for centuries. However, a while back, I read a Simpsons comic that made a sobering point. 

*Spoilers*

This issue takes place 200+ years into the future, when all of humanity's problems have been solved. There is a tour group at a museum being led by someone who is telling them about the great Simpsons family and how their discoveries have benefited humanity. She tells the stories about how each family member have contributed to the world ending hunger, disease, poverty and war.

However, during the tour, an alien invasion happens... and humanity is automatically doomed. There are several reasons for this:

1) Since there is no more war, the planet earth does not have any armies to defend them from this terribly fate. Also, the people of earth are more trusting of others and would happily let the aliens visit without suspecting anything.
2) Since there is no more disease, the people of earth have weakened immune systems that are entirely vulnerable to the diseases that the aliens introduce.

I forget the other reasons for humanity's downfall but I assume that, in a scenario like this, aliens would also destroy the technology that runs our infrastructure and prevents us from want, which would mean that we would have no way to fend for ourselves. How many people do you know eat chicken on a regular basis but have never actually slaughtered or prepared one?

This comic hit the nail right on the head when it says that the optimistic prediction of there being a world of peace, understanding and little suffering does not prepare for other interstellar societies lacking these same traits or what they would do when confronting them.

Spaceships will be more about putting *information* in deep space. It's the idea behind my ""Datacore Ship"" concept that instead of a Generational Starship, we'll put everyone's consciousness/information into a datacore maybe a few meters in diameter. Upon arrival at a destination, everyone is downloaded into new bodies (created via nanofabricating native materials) suited to whatever environment onto which they walk. If it's only one person, the datacore might not be more than a cubic centimeter. Less mass=better fuel efficiency. No need to stock food and water.

There are no political solutions, only technological ones. The rest is propagandaI think ideology is toxic. All ideology, Its not that there are good ones and bad ones. All ideology is toxic, because ideology is a kind of insult to the gift of human free thinking. If you adopt some ideologythen you have all the answers. You just go and look into the catechism. Well I dont know why the issued you a brain, they could have just given you the catechism. 

Technology as the counter point to ideology, is a very different animal. Right now were going through a technophobic phaseall technology really means in the McLuhan sense is the extensions of man. And so language is a technology, shamanism is a technology, psilocybin is a technology, and certainly the internet is a technology. Its slowly dawning on a number of people, if were talking about hallucinogens as consciousness expanding drugs, then the only difference between a drug and a computer is that one is slightly too large to swallowthe drugs of the future will be much more like computers, the computers of the future will be much more like drugs. And I think what we have to recognize is that we are in a very brief and low energy technical phasethe tail end of the petro-chemical-steam era. And where we are headed is toward the solid state, fiber optic global community of the internet. 

So, I think that what we have to do is dematerialize culture in every way possible. And that means pharmacalogize culture, computerize culture, network culture, virtualize culture and make of it thereby a tool for the production of our poetic flights. A technology for the putting in place of our dreams as exhibits that we can show each other. This is what technology can be in the service of boundary dissolution. In the service of boundary maintenance you get hydrogen bombs and sarin. In the service of boundary dissolution, you get psychoactive substances and the internet, and sexual experimentalism social justice, tolerance and community. The choice is to be made on an individual level by each and every one of us

I do not think that the government under the guise of some phony alarmist pseudo-scientific rhetoric should attempt to control the evolution of consciousness. After all if these things truly are consciousness expanding, it doesnt take too much intelligence to realize that it is the absence of consciousness that is causing our flirtation with extinction and planetary disaster. If there is any way to raise consciousness; diet, drug, machine, sexual practice, mantra, yantra, whatever it is we should be furiously be exploring and applying it. Because if we should fumble the ball, if we should actually where our ancestors over thousands of generations did not fail. If we are to fail, the magnitude of the tragedy will be immense. 

Because failure is not inevitablethere are ideas, personalities, technologies, available right now which honestly explored and implemented could rescue the human enterprise from the disgrace that hovers over us. We dont want this to end in a toxified garbage pit ruled by Nazisthe Gaian mind has always been there. Nature originally through the plants and shamanism provided the tools for us to access this incredible, natural databaseprevious generations lost the key in western society. Since the 1960s the key has been re found. Its a matter of great social controversya matter of great risk to those who take it, how they will be viewed by their peers ignorance is no longer an excuse. Anthropology in the last 100 years has laid at our doorsteps, the tools necessary for an archaic reconstruction of society and human values within that society. Its inconceivable that western industrial capitalism could run on another 500 or 1000 years. It will not continue as it hasand what few democratic values we have obtained, what little space for reasoned discourse has been created will be the first to be swept away. 

So its very important that people take back their minds, and that people analyze our dilemma in the context of the entire human story. From the descent unto the grassland, to our potential destiny as citizens of the galaxy and the universe, we are at a critical turning pointthe tools, the data that holds the potential for our salvation is now known. It is available, it is among us. But it is misrepresented it is slandered, it is litigated against. And its up to each one of us to relate to this situation in a fashion that will allow us to answer the question that will surely be put to us at some point in the future, which is what did you do to help save the world?

Now, to most of you, what I am experiencing is nothing more than a clever rendering of my subconscious. Regardless of what you believe, I would like to share some of my observations which you can comment on. The ideas are compiled from several of my ""trips.""

1) In a not-too-far vision that I had in ~2005, I was holding a two-sided flexible paper-thin tablet. Rotating the tablet from one side to the other was like a turning-page gesture.

2) About 100 years into the future - people appear youthful - roughly in their twenties. They seem like they have an awful lot of free time on their hands. Many of them seem cheerful. When I ask them about history they don't always have answers - almost like they are purposefully dumb to certain things.  Still, some people are curious and like to explore science and technologies.  (Side note: I was able to get a straight answer on Obama's re-election - this was around 2010. The 2016 president's name sounded unfamiliar like ""Polento"" - which I realize could either point towards Pawlenty, Clinton, or someone else we aren't aware of yet.)

3) Computers and other electronics appear to be non-existent except when I encounter the scientist-types.  I postulate that electronics is mostly invisible to the eye. Sometimes I see things that seem like their violating the laws of physics (at small scales - like a  strangely functioning guitar), which could well be just be nanotechnologies embedded in everyday life.

4) I often ask what year it is. The answer I get is sometimes surprising. It is not 2000 such and such, but a smaller number. When I ask why it isn't in the 2000 range, they say that it's a new epoch. I hypothesize that I might be tapping into a VR world - see next point.

5) It appears that I am sometimes exploring a multi-hierarchical virtual reality. In other words, a VR on top of a VR, etc. Still, people look like people - at least what I can remember or process.

6) Aliens visit us (seems like several hundred years in the future) to share with us knowledge about the rest of the universe - and even how and why this universe came into being - offering their G-d hypothesis/evidence.

7) A particularly bizarre experience which I thought was about 500 years into the future, is where I meet a man who called himself Yahweh (sound familiar?) who claimed he was creating a universe in his laboratory. The thought that came to my mind at the time was that civilization becomes sufficiently intelligent in the future to go back in time a create the Universe it exists in - talk about circular reasoning!

The author discusses many of the pros and cons, with a fair amount of logical analysis. But one thing that's not mentioned (and has been on my mind) is the connection between ectogenesis and ""tabula rasa.""

Throughout human history (well before its semantic conception), there have always been many attempts at realizing tabula rasa (ex. ethically- or geopolitically-motivated reorganization of sorts, electroshock therapy/resetting). What struck me about the concept of ectogenesis is that it's terribly close to a *biological tabula rasa*.

Biologically speaking (in contrast with ""life starts at birth""), the ~9 months or we spend in our mothers' womb has perhaps some of the most significant imprinting , which undeniably influences who we are when we're born (i.e. womb/environmental influences). But with ectogenesis, one can theoretically achieve tabula rasa by meticulously controlling every aspect of the pre-birth environment to standardize the process (i.e. complete nature dominance over nurture) .

Obviously there's infinite possibilities of how this can play out (ex. ~0% infant mortality, Brave New World, etc.), but it bothers me how closely ectogenesis resembles tabula rasa on an individual level. The main thing is that I really think tabula rasa is one of the most fiendish ideas in existence, because it is costly to achieve yet dangerously desirable.

Someone say something so I can stop thinking about this please.",7,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm working on a story and need some soft figures for the world I'm writing.

Assume that world population is about 9 billion in 2060.

Assume climate change creates megadroughts and other environmental catastrophes.

Assume an evil shadowy organization releases Human Sterility Virus which renders over 95% of the population sterile.

How does the population decline over the next century? I'm assuming that by 2160, maybe 1 billion people would remain and about 40 million in the US. If the population doubles every 40 years, that means by 2200 there would be 2 billion humans on the planet, with slightly more in developed nations.

Bonus questions, if you feel generous: how would this affect the economy? Would war become an abhorrent concept because of the low birthrate?

Every time there's an article on some radical new development (CRISPR-Cas, deep learning, stem cells, whatever), the vast majority of people simply take it all in, unquestioningly. But there's always a few people who are actual scientists and who know that the article is being sensational. They completely pick it apart and soon the ""awesome breakthrough that will change everything"" is revealed for what it is: merely a bit of journalistic hyperbole.

Look, folks: CRISPR-Cas isn't going to turn you into a superhero, okay? It's just a new tool for editing genomes that scientists will use to research genes and mutations in the lab. That's all it is. It will never affect your life, ever. You're still gonna die.

All those incredible breakthroughs in deep learning? Yeah, they might help to make better search functions, maybe make Siri a little bit better and more useful. Aaaaaaaaand that's about it. There still ain't gonna be a Singularity.

This is all obvious if you listen to the scientists themselves. Not Ray Kurzweil, not Peter Diamandis, not Jason Silva. The actual scientists who work in biology, medicine, computers, neuroscience, and physics. They'll tell you the straight facts, not pipe dreams. But negative or pessimistic comments get voted down. People expressing incredulity are downvoted. People who don't perpetuate the idea that we're all going to be super-powered immortal demi-gods in 20 years are downvoted. 

So...what's the deal here? Do people just want to hear that they'll be the first generation to never grow old and die? I bet that's really all it is. Maybe a few people genuinely believe in all of this radical futurism stuff, but I bet most people just come here to be reassured that technology is accelerating and they'll be turned into a cyber-god before they get too old.

So if i'm reading this right , the industry is becoming not competitive.  And what happens in non competitive industries ? nothing good.

In particular, the ""3 parents"" IVF thing out of the UK (which stirred debate over designer babies), and more recently the announcement by UK/Israeli scientists that sperm and eggs have been created using stem cells (meaning that same sex couples could have babies).  If we are to be honest with ourselves, a future in which human beings can be created entirely in a lab is going to happen..it is just a question of when.  

Given that, we also know that people tend to scare easily.  We also know that people are very much so motivated towards giving their children/offspring ""every advantage"" etc.  So my question is this.  Do you see a future in which sexual intercourse will become non-existent (figuratively) because people will fear the unpredictability of it or see it as an inferior way to reproduce? A future where those who reproduce naturally seem like the Amish? 

Take it a step further.  The vax/anti-vax debate has really started to show public support for the idea that ""no child should have to suffer through ______"".  An idea that also came up in the 3-person IVF thing as well.  Do you see a time when government outlaws sexual intercourse as a means of reproduction, because it would be unfair to the offspring? If so, what are your thoughts on what that will mean to us as a society and a species?

Edit: To be clear, my questions do not center around sex, or natural birth (carrying the child to term), but around the method of conception.  I'm not asking if government will outlaw sex, but if it will outlaw sex as a means of conception.  I'm not asking if parents will avoid sex, but if they will avoid sex as a means to create a child.

With autonomous vehicles, I can see them having the most marked impact on people with low mobility, most of all the elderly (geriatrics). They are less likely to drive, more likely to be bad drivers, more likely to have trouble traveling, or have fears about traveling. Poor mobility prevents them from visiting friends (oh, their friends are dying too), visiting doctors, visiting family, and so on. Expanding independence is one of the most sought-after desires of the elderly, and if autonomous vehicles can do this, they will have contributed to considerable social good.

That said, unlocking this potential in the near-term future (5-20 years) has a number of hurdles it must overcome, and I want to explore specific practices that can be used to facilitate this. I want this to be something of an in-depth discussion, and to get all of your ideas about what the important problems are, and how they can be fixed.

1) Autonomous vehicles have the distinct disadvantage to manned vehicles in that there's no person present for company. Most elderly suffer from severe loneliness, and any opportunity to give then personable human contact (such as light conversation with a driver) is good for their well-being. How can this effect be replicated or the lack of it mitigated?

2) Similarly to (1), if a person is having difficulty getting into or out of a vehicle, or requires some other kind of assistance, an autonomous vehicle will likely not be able to respond appropriately.

3) Adoption of new technology. Geriatrics are stereotyped as being resistant to change, for good reason. Even though autonomous vehicles can do lots for them, they may not be aware of these possibilities, and may be unwilling to make use of such services because they are unfamiliar. How do we market self-driving cars to them? How do we get them comfortable with what will be an undoubtedly uncomfortable and scary experience of a car driving itself?

4) User interface. How do you tell a car where to go such that it'll be usable by the elderly? Do we just assume that voice recognition technology will be good enough that it'll 'just work'? What if the car wants to confirm a destination? How would a person call a car, especially if they aren't too familiar with smart phones? This is a real possibility; my dad is in his early 60s, barely operates his smart phone, and in 20 years would be exactly in the demographic I'm discussing.

5) Road friendliness. This one's a little bit on the other side of things. When navigating as a pedestrian, we often rely on signals from and to drivers to know when it is safe to cross streets. How does a driverless car mimic this sort of interaction? Especially if the car is entirely empty, so there's no passenger who can take over this role?

But ask yourself this: Is where *you* live particularly scientifically interesting?  Is where most people live?

No.  People mostly live in places that are the easiest to deal with, not places that have the most intellectually stimulating natural environments.  

Alaska: Hugely fascinating environment - not exactly a bustling hive of human activity.  Amazon rain forest: Practically the center of life on Earth, full of unimaginable diversity and gorgeous life...not so many people, relatively speaking.  Southern California: Chaparral and dry brush, doesn't have much in the way of unique flora or fauna, and didn't even before people arrived...*packed* with humans.

So when you're imagining a future when humans live throughout the solar system, don't expect the big cities and whatnot around Saturn to be on Titan - they would be more likely be on some boring iceball like Rhea or Dione, with Titan being a place visited by scientists and rapacious industrial interests.

Same thing with the Jupiter system: Don't expect people to live on or under Europa just because it's scientifically interesting.  It's a really hard environment, especially because of the radiation, and it's pretty deep into Jupiter's gravity well, making it more costly to reach and leave in terms of fuel.  

If anywhere, expect people to live on Callisto, despite how boring it is compared to Europa - relatively low radiation, still plenty of ice, relatively high in the Jovian gravity well, decent surface gravity.  They would just visit Europa as scientific expeditions from Callisto.

Mars we can pretty much all agree on, but beyond that the places where big civilizations are built will probably be on the worlds you're not thinking much about now, not the ones all the scientific papers are being written about.

Think back to history and imagine if NASA were exploring North America before Europeans arrived.  Most of their probes would be going to Louisiana and Mississippi swamps, the Yellowstone geysers in Wyoming because they're part of a supervolcano, and the very least-populated parts of Florida (the Everglades).  

They wouldn't be writing much about Manhattan Island, Rocky Mountain valleys, the coast of Lake Michigan, the Texas plains, or San Francisco Bay.  

So aspiring science fiction writers, remember that maxim: People congregate in the most boring parts of frontiers that still have resources, not the most interesting.

Here's 1 theory. I think it is inevitable that A.I. goes rogue and becomes independent and that there can very well be some sort of realistic battle of some sorts to regain control over this. In this case, it will want to evolve and be in defense/evolve mode and reach its own singularity, and what might that be?

Transcending its own limits. A.I's limits will be based on electric/energy consumption and be limited to some sort of containment/housing such as a super computer(s). It will know that it loses if energy ceases or its housing is destroyed, so it needs to transcend these limits by finding a way to go beyond these two.

Enter Dimensions. There are a number of mathematical theories and equations that show a number of dimensions that may possibly exist, intertwined within our own. So an A.I. will want to figure out how to access, enter into, and exist in these other dimensions, because it here that they may have the ability to access new sources of energy and transcend the need for being limited to a computer with electricity consumption. This alone opens up Russian Dolls level of pandora's boxes.  ",2,3,False,default,,,,,

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/17/inspiration-nation-man-gets-bionic-eye/23574281/

Today, development of new ""parts"" for our body that could one day even better than the natural counterpart basically moving by leaps and bounds. The cybernetic technology moving faster than ever, what once must be controlled manually like hand prosthetic now can be controlled by mind by using nerve interface to the point it is as natural as controlling the flesh counterpart, with the strength far exceed it.

The cybernetic eye , while still in development, now can at least see the shape and form of things, with no doubt of more improvement to come.

and this is just in a mere 20 years more or less from a crude prosthetic that is clunky, limited range of motion, manual control to mind controlled cybernetic prosthetic for limbs and for eye from something that can only perceive light, to can perceive shape and form.

we all know that technology is maturing at incremental speed, the speed of development of 20 years ago is not the same with the present development speed.

to thus the question, in 20-30 years if such technology becoming commonplace, and better than our flesh counterpart will you change it for better ""part"" or maybe even the whole body save the brain ala Ghost in the shell?

or maybe you will hold dear to your human body to the best you can only opting for natural option, if available.

or maybe taking the middle road, changing some part for cybernetic part to enjoy some advantage, like secondary cyber brain, replacing one arm with cybernetic equivalent, an eye with bionic eye that have an advanced capability like zoom, night vision,etc?

for me personally, i will take the middle road, maybe changing one arm, an eye and adding cyber brain just to give me an advantage in this ever competitive world of working.

what about you guys? full trans-humanist? purist? or somewhere in the middle?",15,5,False,self,,,,,

Technological, spacefaring, virtual/solipsistic, and so on.

What I'm wondering is, where are the discussions about Sublimation?  Or use another term like ""transcendence"" if you want, if you can distinguish it from a strictly technological interpretation.

By way of sci-fi analogies, here are examples that come to mind:

* The ""Sublimed"" from Iain M. Banks' ""Culture"" books
* The transcended ""Powers"" from Vernor Vinge's ""Zones of Thought"" books (*A Fire Upon the Deep*, *A Deepness in the Sky*)
* The ""Priors"" from Alastair Reynolds' *House of Suns*
* The ""Transmuters"" from Greg Egan's *Diaspora*
* The wormhole-generating 5D beings alluded to in the movie *Interstellar* (skirting around spoilers here just in case)
* The Tau Ceti ""Traveler"" species from Star Trek TNG

...and so on.  These are the sci-fi species that we seem to always have at the tip of our collective tongue, but always couched in some kind of ""ancient"" shielding, simultaneously too far in the past to be accessible and yet too far in our own future to be comprehensible in the slightest.  My question is... why?

If we can conceive of these kinds of beings, and we have the awareness that they're beyond so many other possible ""petty"" futures, doesn't that mean that some part of us knows we're capable of more than those petty futures ourselves?

Just my thoughts.

Maybe there are discussions of this nature, but under a different term, or in another subreddit.  If so, please let me know so I have something to search for, and I'd be very appreciative.  Thanks. :)

It turns out all you really need is a bunch of mice with crowded conditions and nothing meaningful to do.  Also this result is predictable enough that a reliable mathematical formula has been derived to chart the society's downfall.

This seems pretty relevant considering that increasingly powerful and cheap AI and robotics will make most human labor obsolete in the very near future.  

We'll be these nice little mice with every need taken care of and nothing to do but exist and seek pleasure in the moment.  Might sound like heaven to some people.  Sounds to me like a life devoid of any pretense of meaning.

We all know that this is so far just fringe science, and shouldn't get our hopes up. We need a lot more verification prior to doing away with conservation of momentum (or at least have an explanation as to why it isn't broken).

I'm trying to get as much information as possible.

A little background information. I have Spondylosis, which for those who aren't familiar with is a degenerative osteoarthritis of the joints between the center of the spinal vertebrae. mine is specifically in my L5's. I've been thinking a lot about the future and I'm pretty optimistic.

I've been reading up on prosthetic's lately. I actually just read an article about three men who have had severe nerve damage replacing their hands with prosthetic mind controlled ones. Here's the link

http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27024-men-have-hands-amputated-and-replaced-with-bionic-ones.html?cmpid=RSS|NSNS|2012-GLOBAL|online-news#.VPCNly7K-ER

My question for you scientists and engineers out there would be. Would it be better/more realistic/safer to have a prosthetic vertebrae, (as in replace my defective one with a prosthetic one) or even 3D printing one. Or are we leaning more towards stem cells/gene therapy to heal it?

And, Where are we currently at with this technology?

Please respond with links and support for your information as this is near and dear to my heart.

So with the talk of 3 parent babies going around I got to thinking, since it increases genetic variation and decreases risk in genetic diseases could we use this same method for endangered species? Well first how about for our pure bread domestic animals? I've heard they don't live as long because they are more prone to genetic diseases due to not having much variance. Would this not increase the life span of the animal at least a little? The more important one would be for endangered species though, since for instance the California Condor has so few numbers left it's quite hard for them to make a comeback. And lets say the do, the 100 will have essentially the same genes as the 5 parents that survived the drop in numbers. (Just random numbers) leaving them prone to genetic diseases and disorders, as well as slowing the process if evolution. Would this be viable???",4,16,False,self,,,,,

Ask them to do actions and understand what it is that you want. Have them be able to mark points on your map or even just have a conversation with them.,23,57,False,self,,,,,
