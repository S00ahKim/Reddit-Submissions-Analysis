----

**Main question** 

People seem to tend to ignore or conveniently forget the fact that as technology progresses, it is not only our power to do good (improve our world, protect the environment, etc.) that increases but also our power to do evil. It seems like today it would be far easier for a totalitarian regime to establish absolutely full control (""Orwellian"" totalitarianism if you will) due to technology. What guarantee is there that this increase in power that is happening using technology will not lead, as power seems to inevitably do, to the corruption of democracy through control by technological means and as a result possibly even Orwellian totalitarian scenarios? And more importantly, is there a way to prevent this?

----

**Some additional things to think about** 

I read [""The Origins of Totalitarianism""](/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origins_of_Totalitarianism) by Hannah Arendt not long ago, and there I found something that somewhat unsettled me as I realized its full implications.. I quote:

&gt;The modern dream of the totalitarian police, 
with its modern techniques, is incomparably more terrible. Now the police 
dreams that one look at the gigantic map on the office wall should suffice 
at any given moment to establish who is related to whom and in what 
degree of intimacy: and, theoretically, this dream is not unrealizable al- 
though its technical execution is bound to be somewhat difficult. If this 
map really did exist, not even memory would stand in the way of the 
totalitarian claim to domination; such a map might make it possible tc 
obliterate people without any traces, as if they had never existed at all.

Facebook (and in some ways the internet as a whole), anyone? 





A second thing to consider is this little story: 

About two years ago I visited Britain, where the first thing I noticed (being fourteen and having only just read 1984 for the first time) were the copious quantities of CCTV surveillance cameras that seemed to pervade public space, and indeed Wikipedia tells us not only that Britain is the leading country in mass surveillance with as many as four million CCTV cameras but also that it is a growing trend in the rest of the free world.

We are futurists. This means, above all else, that we work to anticipate what technologies will emerge, and how they will change humanity's future. The word as a whole does not imply anything else, as much as we might wish it did.

2. We must back up our statements. We are not the only school of thought that looks to anticipate the future. Other paradigms exist. Just like those paradigms of thought, we must bring proof, evidence, and rational thought to the table or our statements can be dismissed as easily as those claiming that supernatural entities will bring about the end of the world.

3. We must be honest with ourselves. If we are not familiar with the valid criticisms of our arguments, then we leave our predictions and inferences about the future of the world weak and idealist. If you cannot accept when an opponent has a valid opinion that you cannot argue, it is far more respectable to temporarily admit defeat until you can find evidence that disproves their statements, or simply acknowledge their beliefs are equally valid.

4. We must discard non-falsifiables. If there is no way to back up a statement other than 'time will tell', not even evidence of some sort of progress being made that way, it is not useful to argue in your capacity as a futurist.

5. We must understand that we see things differently from mainstream culture. If you are going to make radical statements, be prepared to put forth the building blocks to build your Tower of Babel. Be aware that statements may be misconstrued even if true, and that if you care futurism's public opinion, that moderation or rephrasing may be warranted.

6. We must understand that we see things different from each other. No two futurists will necessarily share the same views on politics, religion, metaphysics, or even precisely what technologies, trends, and changes may emerge or be wrought upon the world. Expecting otherwise by default will only lead to sectarianism. In addition to perspective, cultural differences exist as well.

7. We must not conflate our hopes and dreams with what will absolutely happen. While technology progresses naturally, do not be fooled into thinking that simply because it exists that it will be used the way you want it to.

8. We must remember that if we work for the future we want, and strive to make it, it is much more likely to happen. Humanity is a glorious, wonderful, world shaping entity. The golden path is there in front of us, even if each lane splits and merges countless times.

Do you think it would be possible to have virtual worlds in which your perception of time is faster/slower than in reality? So for instance, what feels like 10 years in virtual space is only say, an hour here.

Also, what about the different kinds of virtual reality that might be created. It's impossible to time travel to the past but what if people were to create their own vision of the Victorian times, the Stone age or maybe even visit the dinosaurs in the Triassic period? Of course you can't forget all the fictional universes we've created as well. Imagine being inside your favorite cartoon/anime world.

In my mind there's literally endless possibilities.

Yesterday, I was reading up on the Kepler Space Telescope mission, and I was amazed to discover that they've now got over 2,300 planetary candidates in the Kepler database alone. When I was born - we had only just started discovering planets orbiting other stars. And here we are, discovering we are nothing but a drop in the ocean. 

This got me thinking, what sort of scientific/technological advances could I potentially live to see? If we take the current life expectancy rate of a male living in NZ, ~81 years, that takes the year out to 2076. So in this timeframe, what can I expect to happen?

The areas I'm interested in tend to be regarding space exploration, energy usage, technology, etc; less about life sciences and biology, but if it's really special, mention it anyway.

Will I live to see the commercialization of fusion energy (ITER)? Or will solar/wind be developed at increasing rates of growth, marginalizing any nuclear energy process?

Discovery of habitable planets, coinciding with the development of extremely large telescopes (such as ESO's 40m design) - will this enable the characterization of atmospheres, leading to the discovery of volatile compounds such as O2, CH4 - indicative of life? 

Man on Mars? I damn well hope so! Any other manned/unmanned spacecraft developments which should occur?

Moore's Law? We've currently got Petascale computing, what about Exascale, Yottascale, Zettascale? Will silicon be abandoned in favor of a different semiconductor process, such as graphene? Will Moore's Law reach a fundamental limit of miniaturization (I can't find it right now, but there's an old scientific paper that examines the depths of how small we can go)?

Anything else worth mentioning?

It'll still be around, but won't be nearly as popular as it is today. So what's the next epoch of mass entertainment? Virtual Reality interactive stories. And Sleep No More is the perfect form for VR to follow.

If you haven't seen Sleep No More, here's the basic gist of it:

You're a masked observer, among roughly a hundred others. You are brought into a several story building that you can freely roam. A gigantic story is going on in the building, with several characters roaming around and performing scenes. You are not required to follow them, but can. Based on your actions, you can follow one character for extended periods of time, change who you follow when someone appears more interesting, or simply observe the environment, reading the notes scrawled upon the countless books found around the area. Sometimes the actors will engage individuals, bringing them into a closet and giving them a locket or something.

The technology to bring this to mass audiences cheaply will be here soon. What are the obstacles of turning this into a VR production and what will be possible in VR that isn't possible in today's interactive theater?

So how about a law that scales down the timeframe for how long the patent will last with the exponential growth of the economy. I don't know the exact time, but every year it should be cut in half. We could tie it to the amount of time it would take the average product to make 100 times R&amp;D costs.

Today those actions are entirely in tolerated. As individual humans become smarter, empathy and compassion for other living lifeforms including the earth become more of an important issue for these humans. Think of the great intellectuals of man kind, they pushed for peace and equality. It is the simple minded, inexperienced and unconscious people who are hateful and violent. There are exceptions but these are exceptions.

So as humanity grows and becomes smarter, less killings and violence and wars happen. So is there a correlation between intelligence and compassion? 

So as we grow closer to singularity and machines being self aware / intelligent, will these machines become violent or compassionate? I feel as if they will sway towards being compassionate and seeking to evolve and grow earth / the universe instead of destroying everything. Because simple minded people destroy things and don't know or think why they do it. Intellectuals don't partake in destruction, they work towards the more difficult goal which is growth and evolution. Destroying and killing and raping and stealing is easy and an impulse, something which simple people partake in without knowing why. Smarter people ask the question of why they are behaving in a certain way when it causes pain to those around them. It is harder to be nice and giving than to be violent and aggressive. 

So if and when machines eclipse human intelligence I think they will either disregard humans and just do their own thing which is exploring the universe or they will bring us along and evolve our species because it is easy for them to do so, and it is also the right thing which may be the intellectual thing to do.

A skeptic would question if he's cherry-picking data, or point out that other growth models can look roughly linear on a log-lin plot, at least locally. 

It would be much more convincing if we can make some simple but solid arguments for why you would expect exponential growth, instead of just observing it from historical records. 

Exponential growth comes from simple ODEs, for instance dP/dt = r(P(t)) P(t), where P = dollars/GFLOP, or whatever. If the rate, r(P), is fairly constant, in P, then you can expect exponential growth. It would be even better if r(P) increases when P does.

But why is this kind of model valid, and why will r(P) remain roughly constant 'indefinitely'?

One obvious answer is that it takes computational power to design the next generation of computers. Obviously it does, but does it do so linearly? Is this too simplistic?

There have also been other countries that limit internet access (see: China, North Korea). This got me thinking.

There is a device out there called the PirateBox [(More info)](http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox), which is basically an internet in a box (well, a wireless flash drive that you anonymously connect to). One of the developers for these has successfully connected multiple boxes to create a basic ""mesh network"" where no one person has control over the entire thing. If one box (node) gets shut down, others can connect to each other with little problem.

(Again, worst-case scenario) These boxes still need power, but if the government finds out about these and finds they have no control, they could issue power outages to certain parts to hopefully stop these boxes, and resume control.

This would lead to a purchase in electrical generators, and that would get the unregulated, mesh network back up.

The government would eventually find out about this, and either ban sales of generators (again, worst-case) or raise gasoline/ natural gas prices to the point where people would stop.

Once again, people would find ways around it and start working on DIY solar/wind/water/whatever generators. Since there is no way to block out the sun or stop air/water flow...

I can't stress the point that these are all worst-case scenarios and would most likely never happen. But it's the idea I would like to think that *could* happen. Bad things happen, good things come as a result. For example: SOPA/PIPA. While those were going on, somebody said that, ""For every politician trying to stop this, there are at least 100 nerdy people who have already found a loophole/ way around it.""

As much as this chain of events would probably never happen anytime soon, I would like to think it could. A chain of bad events could possibly result in a better world. Or so I would like to think.",5,13,False,self,,,,,

What economic system develops when workers are obsolete?[Long post],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/13ft02/imagine_a_robot_that_is_a_complete_replacement/,aardvarkarmorer,1353305461,"Think of a world where technology has advanced to the point that there are humanoid robots that can do the job of most humans. They're walking, talking machine versions of us. Any job that doesn't require the creative thought or the smile of a human can be done by these machines. They also do it faster, better, the same every time and 23 hours a day.

Other robotics technology has advanced to the point that large scale factory work is done entirely by machines. A car goes from parts to drive without ever being touched by a human held wrench. 

But, these machines have filled the gap. They're universal and they're upgradeable. Tailor a pair of pants? Wash a car? Nothing is ever more than a wireless download away. ""Mastery"" now means having the latest software patch.

What happens to the human? There is now simply more workers than work. Not everyone can be a writer, or an executive or a waiter. What happens in a service economy when someone else is doing the service? I've thought of two possible scenarios. I'll start with the hopeful, and go from there.

With the chores already done, why work at all? Society will turn completely Socialist. Not the name-calling Socialism pinned on people who want higher taxes and affordable healthcare. From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution. Every single citizen is provided unlimited healthcare, food and comfortable housing. The robots are able to perform all of the tasks done by the vast majority of the workforce. Non-creative also doesn't mean non-difficult. Surgeries are performed by steady, electrical hands. Chefs cook our favorite recipes, or to custom order.Houses are erected in a few short weeks. Advances in production and recycling allow us to have more on less.

But what to do all day? People still have ambition and that can't be quenched. There are still jobs for humans, though they're now entirely optional. Decisions have to be made, other people and robots have to be managed. There's also a market in jobs that people want to see other people doing. A customer in a middle tier restaurant may not mine a machine making their meal, but they'd still like someone to take their order and bring it to them. People take these jobs looking for more money, or more prestige.

The masses won't go to work each day, though. It's hard to get out of bed for a job when that bed is free. Every day they wake up, and do exactly what they please. I'd like to say that this is creating art, looking in to our souls, and acquiring knowledge. But those things are hard, and will always be hard. 

Instead, every day is consumed by what we now consider past times. People socialize for hours and hours on end in coffee shops and bars. Even completely connected by technology, we still like to sit and talk face to face. It's the cafe culture take to the extreme. 

But, coffee shops have nothing on the world's most popular activity: video games. No one alive is older video games, and they are completely integrated in to culture. Almost everyone is involved in one massive multiplayer game or another. They provide the competition, advancement and excitement that is missing in a society where you're completely taken care of. The best of the best are celebrities. But, most are perfectly content to not beat anyone more than a few friends, strangers, or even their own high score.

That's one possibility. A world where there's more than enough to go around, and we all live in the luxury. But what if things take a different turn?

As the robots hit the tipping point of replacing most people the ""haves and have-nots"" suddenly became very literal. There were those who had robots, and those who didn't. The first generation robots were so expensive, only large corporations were able to implement them. From there, the advancements and price drops only meant more and more for those who had them. Unemployment skyrocketed, and people would have starved. But, something kept them able to afford food.

Unbridled Capitalism lead to such extreme consolidation that there are only two major corporations. Like the American political system, you're either with the red or the blues, on the left or the right. In fact, politics and business have become so intertwined that they're indistinguishable. Each party is attached to one of the businesses. But aside from their titles, they're indistinguishable.

For any product, you're given a ""choice"" between the only two competitors. Apple vs. Windows, Pepsi vs. Coke. Actually, both corporations chose their respective cola to be their leading brand, and identity for the company. It was seen as the most relatable. 

But what of the customer? Unemployed masses living in abject poverty do not make good consumers. How can people afford your products when they have no money? Simple. Give them some. Through a combination of government subsidy and direct rebates, people are able to buy everything they need and more, all to keep the machine turning. But, each company doesn't want you buying products from the other. You have to choose sides.

Are you a Pepsi Program Associate, or a Coke Plan Member? This will decide what products you purchase and how you vote. In practice, it's usually easy to choose. You were already born in to a family with an existing contract, and you just sign up on your thirteenth birthday. Large stretches of the country sway one way or the other, so you don't have to worry about your neighbors. Some battleground states still exist, but they're just traded back and forth.

There is still the opportunity for advancement and work in either company. Even as an independent business, it still makes sense to accept a token investment share (causing you pledge loyalty) from a company in return for access to their resources and network. But whatever path you take, you can only go one of two ways that lead to the same location.

Those are two worlds I can see. What can you think of?

**Here's my write up:**

Our rapidly increasing consumption of technology, coupled with its incredible exponential growth will result in technological innovation that's incomprehensible to many.

In the coming years, I strongly believe we'll move even faster from Smartphones to Google Glasses to Google Contact Lens to connecting your brain to the cloud. The technologies involved are emerging now, carbon nanotubes have been created to a thickness of five microns - this should allow them to pick up signals from neurons in the brain. They are currently being tested at MIT. Furthermore, the injection of a 3D printed nanobot into your bloodstream that can hook into your brain is the next logical step in this process.

The instant access of information will bring along mass change to everyone's lives, but the more incredible side of this is the very realistic coupling of memory expansion. We can connect our brains to the cloud, but we can also expand our own memory, allowing for the instillation of apps, uploadable memories and the ability to implant data such as the entire wikipedia library.

Next steps could bring along the ability to upload one's memory to a computer, creating cyborg humans. This is where technology becomes scary. I don't think it's now a case of being afraid of singularity - 'The rise of the machines' and AI. As always, it'll be ourselves that we should be most apprehensive and scared of.

I wonder if it would be possible to tackle a small task and see how long it took us to come up with a solution.
I am obviously only talking about some relatively minor thing that hasn't been solved yet which will play some role in the future.
I am not thinking about any super AI, serious life extension or anything as those issues are HUGE, but it would be a interesting experiment to see if random people could come together and come up with something new.

Contribute with your idea(s) and we'll make a poll later on, whatever project gets the most votes is the first we'll try to finish. 
Hopefully the people who voted for some other than the ""winning project"" will still help and contribute. This is first and foremost a test to see if we can indeed get something going.

I remember watching something both online and on Discovery a long time ago regarding Laser propulsion systems.
It was a focused laser placed around 20 meters in the air, focusing on one spot on the ground where a vessel, a disc like object, was spun to high RPMs and then the laser would ""flash"" onto the vessel making it fly straight upwards.
I have no idea how far the tech has evolved.
But it should be possible to place a massive laser in geosynchronous orbit focusing on a ground platform, and creating a vessel comprised of something like 2 rings, an inner ring with cargo compartment and personnel carrying capabilities(if possible, else, just cargo), and an outer ring that can be spun to the rmp required to get it to space?

This happens a lot in The Dark Knight Rises. Without spoiling anything, a scene in particular is [the police chase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj1Q_BAqwa8). How much longer until hackers are able to hack entire cities or national critical systems?

I know this happens today but I would imagine on a relatively smaller level.  I would assume the Pentagon handles this with the elite experts but eventually they won't be enough right?  Eventually you're going to need real PHYSICAL ""cyber police"" to manage critical infrastructure like food processing plants, electrical grids, government data, school data, broadcasting stations, planes and other MAJOR sensitive electrical netowrks?

Not like today where self proclaimed hackers DDoS websites or pirate media. That's kids stuff by future standards. My question is how much longer until say a guy in China is [able to bring Times Square to it's knees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbwoFHEoEO8) in terms of electrical control? What about EMP ""bombs""? This *has* to get bigger at some point with technology advancing right? Also the government is considering all these futuristic concepts for the military, you might want to keep them out of enemy hands because now there is going to be [reverse engineering](http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-12-13/news/30513795_1_drone-iran-claims-iranian-forces)! It's not just the government but even [locally on US soil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI13yDN2gi0) there is the risk of high tech falling into the wrong hands and being modified.

What classes and career should I take now to prepare myself for a much more serious ""cyber security""future with a career like battling hackers trying to cause major disturbances in the physical world as well as terrorists completely trying to destroy our electrical infrastructure all together? Are the ""cyber security"" classes of today adequate enough? Should I major in electrical engineering instead? Exactly what is a good path for this near-future career? Surely entire local physical ""cyber police"" departments are not far off.. here is a cheesy example could be [Michio Kaku's: *2057*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiy6wFmLiUk). What do you think?

People seem to think it just means an acceleration in the rate of technological progress, or just reaching what any one person considers to be the future based on technology they've imagined their whole lives... I have seen multiple people say they think the singularity has already happened. Others seem to think it is just about creating a computer that is as intelligent or more intelligent than a human. These are not what the singularity is.

The singularity is the creation of AI that takes over its own technological development, no human interaction needed.

The term singularity comes from black holes. It is the ""core"" of the black hole, a point in space that has zero volume but infinite density. The laws of physics break down at this point, and scientists have no idea what happens at that point or beyond.

Similarly, the technological singularity is a point at which nobody can see what is going to happen beyond that moment, because the explosion in machine intelligence will happen so quickly and change things so rapidly, there is really no way of predicting how things would move forward.

A machine that is able to improve itself without human interaction will immediately begin an endless cycle of self improvement, every generation more intelligent and capable than the last. Here is a quote that sums it up a little better:

&gt;Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an intelligence explosion, and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.

Just because a machine becomes more intelligent than a human being does not mean the we have reached the singularity. If the machine still needs human assistance to be improved, the explosion of intelligence will not be triggered and is not a singularity.

* 2. [Personalised medicine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine) based on your own genome.
* 3. [Robotic limbs](http://youtu.be/_qUPnnROxvY) and [exoskeletons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLnOPA7oMxY&amp;feature=youtu.be) will blend seamlessly with the user by direct [neurological connectivity](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/11/mind-controlled-robotic-arm/).
* 4. Half our fruit and vegetables will come from local, hydroponic, [vertical urban farms](http://www.thedailygreen.com/cm/thedailygreen/images/YP/evf-vertical-farm-de.jpg).
* 5. Global tectonic activity will increase as a result of [uplift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound) due to glacier melt, and the redistribution of billions of tonnes of meltwater.

And during all these time periods, nanotechnology will play an increasingly important role until it is literally in *everything*.",68,78,False,self,,,,,

- Replace pistons in an engine with a viscous liquid that gets pushed around with each explosion: the liquid combustion engine.
The pros include fewer moving parts, and more efficient temperature dispersal.

- Im pretty sure I read a statistic once that the majority of heat entering your house comes in through the roof. As a countermeasure to this, you could install a sort of fog machine on the roof, which produces a cloud of fog that reflects the suns rays without heating the roof.

- An app for Google Glass (once it comes out), where you can realistically superimpose textures on 3-d objects, using AR markers for orientation and the distortion of said markers to better understand the shape of the surface they lie on. Where might this be used? Well, one application of it could add some variety to the bedroom.
...As in sex, yeah.

- An app that you could use to set your phone vibration such that when it rings when set on a table, it plays a simple tune. Different frequencies of notes could be achieved by using different vibration speeds.

I have a lot more ideas, one of my favorites being a [site](http://ideafreedom.com/) to talk about them.",15,7,False,self,,,,,
