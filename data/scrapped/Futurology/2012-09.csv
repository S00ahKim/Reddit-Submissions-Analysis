As it stands, we are currently solving our population and ""space"" issues horizontally. Urban and sub-urban areas are all very ""wide"" in that we take up hundreds of square miles of space in order to house the growing populations. This seems incredibly unsustainable to me, especially as we continue to grow as a species. Furthermore, it's not environmentally friendly in any way because horizontal growth means mass destruction of potential agri- and horticultural area.

My question to all of you is whether you think a transition to vertical communities will occur in the future. I'm talking 1000+ story communal cities, much like those seen on Coruscant in Star Wars. The difference being that Coruscant is entirely covered in populated urban cities, while our Earth would be covered in many horizontally small, yet tall cities, while the rest of the planet would be wildlife/nature reserves and agricultural areas.",7,6,False,self,,,,,

Should it be for everyone? Should it be for only the ten wealthiest men? Personally I think both those possibilities are rubbish, but that's what discussions are for, to lay out possibilities and find out which are the best. So let us hear what you have to say, and see whether there's something we can agree on.

I'll start with some thoughts I've had on the topic myself:  
Two of the main problem that seems to be mentioned are overpopulation (or rather, the lack of resources created by it) and the fear of immortal Hitlers. To deal with those, I suggest three restrictions on becoming immortal:
 
* You need to pass a test to prove you aren't insane
* You need to pass a test to prove you are rational and can recognise and avoid the most dangerous cognitive biases
* You need to agree to only/mainly get your energy/resources from sustainable sources  
The mentioned sustainable sources would have to be certified by some official body governing the use of immortality technology, and the test would likewise be designed same.

Let me try to explain my reasoning:  
The first restriction should be obvious; insane immortals is a bad thing, and requiring people to be sane should weed out the worst.  
The second restriction is in place, because I don't believe the first one is enough. Even if you aren't insane, you can still make some bad decisions. An example is WWII: most of the country willingly, or even gladly, supported Hitler's direction and the beginning of the war, but almost none of those people were insane. It could as well have happened in any other country. If all those people had learned about rationality and cognitive biases, and knew how to apply it, it would never have gone that bad, because they would recognise the faulty logic.  
The first two restrictions would thus only allow people with ability to take a step back and properly think through their actions, which should make immortals a quite sensible bunch. The restriction of rationality would only allow very small part of the current population to become immortal, but at least it is a skill you can learn without necessarily having a high IQ. Also because of that restriction, the rate of people becoming immortal would be far lower, since only people who care enough to take their time to learn how to be rational would become immortal. The problem of overpopulation would diminish a bit as well.  
The final restriction is in order to lower the problem of scarce resources, by forcing people to use their money on sustainable technologies like solar power.

Let me hear what you think. If we get a proper discussion going, I'll try update with prevalent ideas and opinions.

**Edit:** Most seem to hold the opinion that immortality should be freely available, and any problems should be solved in other ways. After reading through people's arguments below, they've started to convince me.

But please, keep the discussion going. Let's try to learn as much as we can.",68,16,False,self,,,,,

I would like to ask your views on the matter of the so called 'self-driving' vehicles regarding the effect of such tecnology will cause once applied widely in transportation. As I found, there is a lot of speak about such transportation of people (safety, efficiency) but I think the most profound use of this tech is *transportation of goods*. As of when these changes will happen estimations diverse, but one thing is clear, it *will* happen, and it will happen *fast*: the first companies to apply this new tech will have definite advantage. For instance road transport happens on an established path, mainly on highways - thus the perfect use of self-driving cars, and I don't see much hardship why wouldn't it happen in the next 10 years. Now 10 years is hardly enough for the workforce to adjust.

My question is, all things considered, what will happen to millions of drivers world wide, when they lose their job? *I am aware* that the mechanization of manual labor causes job loss, but I'd argue that is a *gradual* process while the aformentioned changes seem to happen in an *accelerated* manner.

I believe that IAs can exist without emotions. Because they're technically math and they're programmable to reach a goal. That makes them the most efficient creatures. In the process, they learn and act upon the new things they encounter. But that is only based on reason and not emotions; in fact, the AI doesn't even need emotions.

My friends think that any being (organic or none organic) needs emotions to self sustain or that emotions would be a sort of side effect as a result of the algorithmic mental complexion in which self sustainability is achieved. For a being to be able to counter problems in the similar way that humans do, it would need to have a range of (significant) emotions such as curiosity, fear, satisfaction and many others. Essentially, my friends believe that humans are a build up of millions and millions if not billions of organic ""yes or no"" calculators (almost simliar to the core buildup of computers); and for an AI to be able to self sustain, it would need to be built in a complex manner that the incorporation of feelings would be inevitable.

Debate!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/z83ua/accelerating_returns_vs_diminishing_returns_which/,[deleted],1346578865,"**Accelerating Returns**
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change]

&gt;In his 1999 book The Age of Spiritual Machines Kurzweil proposed ""The Law of Accelerating Returns"", according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including but not limited to the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially. He gave further focus to this issue in a 2001 essay entitled ""The Law of Accelerating Returns"" which argued for extending Moore's Law to describe exponential growth of diverse forms of technological progress. Whenever a technology approaches some kind of a barrier, according to Kurzweil, a new technology will be invented to allow us to cross that barrier. He cites numerous past examples of this to substantiate his assertions. He predicts that such paradigm shifts have and will continue to become increasingly common, leading to ""technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history."" He believes the Law of Accelerating Returns implies that a technological singularity will occur before the end of the 21st century, in 2045. The essay begins:

&gt;An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense 'intuitive linear' view. So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st centuryit will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today's rate). The 'returns,' such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness, also increase exponentially. There's even exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth. Within a few decades, machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to the Singularitytechnological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history. The implications include the merger of biological and nonbiological intelligence, immortal software-based humans, and ultra-high levels of intelligence that expand outward in the universe at the speed of light.

**Diminishing returns**
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter#Diminishing_returns]

&gt;Tainter begins by categorizing and examining the often inconsistent explanations that have been offered for collapse in the literature. In Tainter's view, while invasions, crop failures, disease or environmental degradation may be the apparent causes of societal collapse, the ultimate cause is an economic one, inherent in the structure of society rather than in external shocks which may batter them: diminishing returns on investments in social complexity.

&gt;Tainter musters modern statistics to show that marginal returns on investments in energy, education and technological innovation are diminishing today. The globalised modern world is subject to many of the same stresses that brought older societies to ruin.

&gt;However, Tainter is not entirely apocalyptic: ""When some new input to an economic system is brought on line, whether a technical innovation or an energy subsidy, it will often have the potential at least temporarily to raise marginal productivity"" (p. 124). Thus, barring continual conquest of your neighbors (which is always subject to diminishing returns), innovation that increases productivity is  in the long run  the only way out of the dismal science dilemma of declining marginal returns on added investments in complexity.

&gt;His paper Complexity, Problem Solving, and Sustainable Societies (1996) focuses on the energy cost of problem solving, and the energy-complexity relation in manmade systems.

The falcon heavy will reportedly be able to reach 2500$/lb and its looking like that number will only decrease as the years go by, either by building better and better rockets or developing a completely different type of space flight.

The two space industries that I can think of besides scientific endeavors would be tourism and asteroid mining. For 1000$/lb it's not hard to imagine a company offering flights in LEO possibly even putting up something similar to the space station for guest to stay in. I'm not sure how the asteroid mining industry would fair with such prices but I'm sure investors would begin taking it more seriously.

The Daily Mail (1900) predicted that electric energy would transport and heating of the home. They even predicted that electricity would power even trivial things such as curling tongs and cigarette lighters. They also predicted the channel tunnel (95 years before it was opened) 

A Journey in Other Worlds by John Jacob Astor (1894) predicted Rocket Powered space-ships, solar power, and a worldwide phone system.


Another Interesting Prediction:

The Daily Mail (1928) predicted that Cooking at home will be performed with a machine that radiates heat at four different settings, ringing a bell when food is cooked.

These two are confirmed:

We invent this ""power cell""; a pocket sized battery with everything from usb and headphone ports to plug sockets, that are charged either by solar, wind, or kinetic energy.
Accompanying this, would be hydroponic/aeroponic green-pods for growing various vegetables, fruits and other edible plants; which would also have their own uv lights that run on power cells, so that these green-pods can be stored anywhere despite the lighting and still function.
These power cells could be used to power various machines including cars and other transport.

It would still be a long time for everyone else, so space colonisation would be potentially heartbreaking and/or psychologically hurt for the colonists, not to mention theyd have little chance of aid from their homeworld, theyd need everything in each individual voyage.

""Planes traveling at five times the speed of sound and passenger aircraft flying in formation could be a reality before the end of the century.... a report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IME) has said.""

Looking towards 2075 and beyond, the report talked of:

:: ""Scramjet"" planes able to fly at around five times the speed of sound (around 4,000mph).

:: Commercial aircraft flying in a V-shaped formation to save power by taking advantage of the airflow generated by the plane in front.

:: The ""aircraft carrier"" system in which a large aircraft carries individual units that can be released over a destination and float down to the designated area where the passenger needs to go. [click here for video](http://youtu.be/KFD0Pr7NYjs?hd=1)

:: A ""flying wing"" design, where the plane's fuselage, wings and engine are blended together.

:: A ""flying fuel station"" so future planes do not have to take off with full tanks.

Everyone that has money also owns the energy harvested on it by the sun. Banks could store our money in large structures that capture the suns energy with our money. Money could be transacted digitally. Imagine if the energy harvested on your money was enough for all of your electricity bills to be completly free. Your electric car's fuel might be free, your house's electricity might be free, you might not have to work as much in the future because of solar powered money. my name is chase hove check out my website where i post my ideas at treasureaeon.com

idea 2.A MOBILE HOLOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY that can be worn like clothing or as something like a nametag that would let the user display HOLOGRAPHIC images/media from a projecter that they WEAR as clothing. Some things it could be used for are: mobile advertisements and getting paid for being an advertiser, advertising your own website or products, advertising or displaying your art and much much more. Mobile holographic technology could also be used as a platform for new kinds of entertainment such as: new kinds of video games, new kinds of musical entertainment with mobile speakers as a possibility too, new kinds of art possibly and more. Hovercrafts, houses, skyscrapers, buildings, robots, aircrafts and more could also use this technology and could also sell advertising space.

I had a conversation with my dad today about the rise of artificial intelligence. I was telling him my vision of a future where all physical labor is done by robots, and all mundane mental tasks by computers. I then went on to explain how eventually, as we improve these computers more and more, they would become conscious, just like us. He agrees that computers and robots will become better and perform more tasks, but doesn't seem to agree with the idea that a robot will eventually be able to think the way we do. He believes at the end of the day, they are just programs, incapable of doing anything outside this programming. We talked about it for a good hour or so, and it came down to this. If the human mind is itself just a bunch of complex programs (scripts), then yes, computers can achieve consciousness. If, however, the human mind is, at its core, different than computer programming, then it would take more than a faster version of today's computers for true AI to evolve.

It's in a post-singularity world, where humanity has been fractured into thousands of new species, given all the new technology they now have access to. All these fractured layers are known as 'the strata', hence the title. A group of 'original' biological humans study and track these species, much like anthropology today. They call themselves stratigraphers. I thought, given all the high technology in the book, it might be fun to write up a scale of intelligence from simple systems to god like consciousness.

The Paris Scale

Reproduced in excerpt by the kind courtesy of Last Stop University, California, Erde, Stratigraphics division, Dr. Katy Paris (March 3rd 2102 to December 22nd 2170), originally published in On the Categorization of Intellectual Capacities in Naturalistic Systems and Exotic Stratic Life, retrieved from Syndicate communiqu 1221 and archived in the Bucephalia State Central Library on the 18th of Saltzman, 893rdth Exurbic year.

Tier Red  A naturalistic system completely devoid of intelligent synthesis that displays rudimentary computational ability. Ex: Weather systems, ecologies, tectonics.

Tier Orange  A naturalistic system of protein exchange, based on low level coding and displaying potential for higher level computational ability. Ex: DNA, RNA and binary,

Tier Yellow  A non-sentient organic system displaying considerable computational ability. Intelligence in this sytem is derived from parasympathetic reactions, genetic conditioning and functions inherent in the form of the organism. Ex: The central nervous system, cellular regeneration, fat storage mechanisms, the adrenal response.

Tier Green  A high-level computational system capable of complex problem solving and basic non-linguistic reasoning. Intellectual ability is derived usually from an organ specifically devoted to manipulation of the environment, typically brains. Low-level sentience  debatably not self-aware - usually found in mammalian species, usually domesticated. Ex: Kanines, chimpanzees,

Tier Blue  Self-awareness, sentience and a system that displays sophisticated intellectual capacity. Levels of this intellect will always develop out of a central organ devoted to reasoning, logic, the acquirement of sustinence, sexual reproduction and self-preservation. Capable of high-level symbolic thought and metaphor manipulation. Often emotionally driven and conditioned through Darwinian evolution to favour impulse over reasonable action. Highly dependant on neurochemical reward systems. Ex: Homosapiens and genetically altered species of Bonobo ape.

Tier Indigo - Characterized by non-linguistic communication, typically conversing through direct thought transference of sense data and mental notions. Usually an organism devoid of primal impulses, or one that at least exerts considerable control over them. In rare instances, artificial, but fleeting post-stratic biological candidates for Tier Indigo have been sighted in the Russian epicforests. They probably use an advanced system of mental apparatus to directly convey thought and intention. Ex: The Vidinski Sentience Machine of Brazil (now thought destroyed by the gasjack hordes) and Species 1H/03 of the Russian epicforests.

Tier Violet  A presence that transcends biological or synthetic form. Ideally: matter infused with intelligence, computing on an atomic or subatomic scale. Displays incalculable capacity for computation and unlikely to be a species analogous to any form of life we are familiar with. The intentions of such a presence are beyond imagining and it could presumably move freely about the cosmos until it had become the cosmos itself by volition alone.",2,6,False,self,,,,,

As crazy as it may sound, I actually disagree with this. I believe the most perfect political community is one in which there is no classification in which to find ourselves ""in the middle,"" ""at the top,"" or ""on the bottom."" I don't want to be the guy at the top who constantly worries about losing it all. I don't want to be the guy at the bottom with nothing. Most of all, I don't want to be the guy in the middle asked to choose who I support and who I don't. I'm just so tired of being expected to accept this as ""just the way it is."" Sometimes the thing that keeps me mostly sane is this silly belief of mine that some just think is absurd.

But I have to keep hoping a day will come where no person will find themselves inferior to any other in one's quality of life, to inherit such a quality by being born into it, to earn such a quality through servitude, or to be denied of such a quality by misfortune. Striving for anything less than that is the greatest possible waste of our lives and the sacrifices of so many who came before us, who through their beliefs and resolve empowered all of us to be alive in this time, at this hour, to achieve something they could not even imagine possible. What do we have to show for it? Seriously, ask yourself. We still live in a society that incentivizes corruption, rewards greed, empowers the few, and divides us all along ideological lines that don't even benefit the majority of us left wanting for more.

In spite of ourselves, we have collectively managed to discover, explore, and innovate technological possibilities that, when applied in an intelligent way, change the world in ways that make the way we live now qualify as a Dark Age. These obsessions with money, political party, business, ""what's in it for me,"" and all the crap that genuinely stops us from realizing our greater potential as a civilization and species, when these things are gone we'll have a perfect political community. There is a way for these things to be gone, we just have to let them all go. We achieve the impossible because we never accept that it's impossible. I see none of our leaders striving for the impossible. Somewhere in all the mayhem of politics, our leaders decided only to pursue what is possible, measurable, or predictable.

I was surfing some ""Illuminati"" and ""New World Order"" videos this morning, when I started thinking, what have I really done with my life?

Yes, I know it's weird to start thinking about this while watching videos about a secret organization comprised of politicians and celebrities (and reptiles!), but think about it, if this super secret organization exists, NONE OF US HAVE A PURPOSE. The only people who truly mean anything in this world are these tyrants and puppeteers who are pulling the strings. Everything I ever thought was fun is secretly trying to kill me and the same with the somewhat popular music and food.

That's not the part that irks me though. The thing is that the right wing nutjobs that believe this off the wall theories won't do anything about. They don't protest, they don't riot, they don't take action. They simply shrug it off, and say that they'll walk with the hand of their god.

But what keeps me going, when I know these things. What keeps me going when I know that all the people I've looked up to, all the politicians who have been an inspiration to me, and celebrities, and directors, and musicians, that they are all trying to control me, that have all betrayed me, that ME, a common teenager with a dream, that if I accomplish my goal of being a popular musician and guitarist, that I will simply be brainwashed in to joining this organization of traitors and liars, and nobody will do anything about it?

I'll tell you what keeps me going, it's the people like Tom Morello, and Henry Rollins, and Jon Stewart, who use their fame for good and change.

It's the bands like Anti-Flag, NOFX and Rage Against the Machine.

And the scientists, like Bill Nye, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Michio Kaku, who continue to educate people for the greater good.

That's what keeps me going.

And those intellects and activists, they're the ones who let me know that change is coming soon, but it will not be at the hands of the tyrants.

It will come with the actions of the people.

They will bring us a new era of peace, better air, cleaner water, solar power, organic food and the power of the people and groups like the occupy movement and anonymous assure me of this.

Maybe the change will come in the form of anarchism.

Maybe it will come as libertarianism.

Maybe it will come as communism.

Or maybe it will come as a true system of free market capitalism.

So yes, I believe the conspiracy theories being rambled by the likes of Alex Jones and Jesse Ventura that there will be a New World Order, but it will not be satanic and evil.

It will be a clean, beautiful utopia where good will prevail, and evil will perish.

Where the lives of young men and women will not be lost due to corporate greed.

Where the rights of some will not be diminished by the religious and partisan bias of majority.

It will be a perfect world.

And it's coming soon.",15,11,False,self,,,,,

Of course, lots of things could happen to derail scientific progress, from wars to natural disasters alike. So we should try to insulate ourselves from those possibilities.

The idea of a micro-state is nothing new, you can look up Sealand et. al. I am aware that they rarely last and have a poor track record so far. However, there are certain advantages that arise from having your own sovereign land to work with.

It is a bit of an extreme measure, sure - but let me explain my reasoning and you can decide if you agree or not.

Firstly, government a huge block for scientific progress. ""But the government funds so much research!"" you might argue. Firstly, they only fund the research that they choose, and the military is usually the first in line for new funds. Therefore, most of the government-funded advanced research done in the USA at least, is likely to have some sort of military focus. As a scientist, this does not interest me. 

Secondly, whether you don't like warfare or welfare, the government also takes away money from you and redistributes it according to the whims of the crowd. Some of this goes towards bombing other countries. Parts will go to subsidize corn farmers. Some will just end up missing, as part of ""normal"" graft and embezzlement. 

Lastly, research as well as commercialization of said research can run into red tape and state-caused stumbling blocks. I'm not talking about laws that refer to ethical research standards, like informed consent law. I am talking about all the government rubber-stamping needed in order to move research forward. Whether it's FDA approval for a new medicine (which drug companies can pay large sums to speed up the process) or pesky patent laws that cover almost every novel idea under the sun, to the FCC which decides who gets to broadcast on what part of the EM spectrum at what time.

Of course, government has its purpose. However better technology is making many of those purposes irrelevant. All I am trying to say is that there are certain advantages to not having to answer to a group of mostly businesspeople and lawyers that want to tax you in order to help their friends.

Therefore, I think a new technology-focused microstate would be a good idea. Here's a quick outline of what I have in mind:

1. No IP laws - no patent system, no trademarks, no copyright. Some might argue that this would be bad for innovation. On the contrary, I hypothesize that any country to do this would actually see a boom in innovation and research, as people are free to build off eachother's ideas without worrying about a team of well-paid patent attorneys breathing down their neck. 

2. Freedom of Thought - no need to police speech, writing, internet access, etc. Not only will it save us money, but set the state apart from many others, which are becoming increasingly authoritarian in nature.

3. No trade restrictions - not only is it futile to try and police everything coming in and out of the 'country', it's silly to refuse to trade with some countries just because some legislator deems that sanctions are the best way to force their hand.

4. No taxes! Probably the most radical idea, but having a government that is funded entirely voluntarily would in my opinion, have much more legitimacy than one imposed by force. Note that I don't think there should be no government - but it should be run by volunteer time and money.

5. Neutral Foreign Policy - no sense in taking sides in an increasingly complex world scene. Citizens are free to visit whatever countries they choose.

With all that said, what exactly could we do with our own country? Well, here's a few ideas that could get it off the ground and start generating economic growth:

Primary sector
- Fishing
- Agriculture
- Energy / Mining

Services
- Health care
- Engineering 
- Education 

Manufacturing
- Electronics
- Recycling
- Robots

You no longer need giant factories to start producing high value-added products. A garage-sized space is enough to start with these days. With a few square miles of land and a bunch of smart people working together, some serious progress could be made. 

Goals? 

- Biotech research, focusing on longevity, regenerative medicine, curing diseases, etc. 
- Some sort of bunker / vault type deal to keep everyone safe in case of an unforeseen nuclear or especially pathogen release event. 
- Robotics, automation, advanced manufacturing and other export-ready technologies that are proven to increase productivity 
- Nuclear energy (just kidding, I don't want us to get invaded)

I think something along these lines will emerge. The Catholics have Vatican City, the Muslims have Mecca, etc. Why shouldn't hardcore atheist scientists have their own country?

It's still in the preliminary stages, but since I can't seem to find a lot of information on this particular topic, I thought I'd share the idea and see what happens. This is a bit more psychology/sociology oriented than usual for a futurology rant, but bear with me on this one.

The argument I essentially want to make is that people are getting better and better at adapting with change on an unprecedented scale. There's a certain stigma surrounding people in general, especially based off age, that people generally don't change. They may learn more about certain things, they may change their habits, lifestyle, values, and goals, but deep down they essentially stay the same type of person. In exploring this thought, I became a bit confused, as there seems to be a bit of truth in there, but if virtually anything can change about a person, what is it that always stays the same?

I'm entertaining the idea that people in fact do change on a regular basis, that the structure of our society and our social status, and most importantly, the people we keep around us, are responsible for this perceived stagnancy in character.

For most of history, people lived their entire lifespans in essentially the same area around the same people doing the same profession until the day they died. Since for the most part, their access to information and opportunities were limited, the way we approached the psychology of people was inside a framework that determined that the people themselves don't inherently change. Special cases not included.

The malleability of human personality aside, I did find some interesting trends, particularly the [increasing turnover rates](http://www.hr.com/en/app/blog/2012/09/turnover-rates-inching-up_h77lxc11.html) and unemployment rates in general in conjunction with rising levels of civil unrest concerning wealth disparity. Correlation does not imply causation, and this may be selective reasoning, but all around me I see trends that seem to imply that the rise in access to information and opportunity does have a correlation of some kind with economic instability and chaos in the social order.

One video that helped trigger this correlation was about the sudden shift of interest in [changing our education paradigms](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U), an interesting video in its own right, but presents two thoughts worth considering, one being that many of our institutions, and education in particular, are remnants from the Enlightenment and the industrial age in particular that had an explicit interest in essentially manufacturing the education of populations to keep up with production demands. The video also seems to imply that people have a naturally high capacity for lateral and creative thinking, that gets stifled primarily through being processed by our social institutions.

Back to the psychology, if people are so good at change, why don't they? I think for the most part, there's a negative feedback loop that's responsible for this in that if the people around us expect specific behaviors from us, we tend to fulfill those behaviors in the interest of reducing conflict. Without that social pressure, especially in light of the internet, one could make a compelling argument that people are ultimately defined by their interests and ideologies, things that can and often do change considerably through people's life-times, and even on a moment-by-moment basis.

The thing is, while technology and access to information becomes more and more widely available, the social structures in place are still becoming increasingly outdated, which ultimately stifles '*potential individuality*'. This term is useful in context when you look at history at all social rights movements, that what is acceptable and not acceptable is mostly due to, well, awareness, knowledge, and ultimately consideration. But in order for a behavior to be considered, it first has to be conveyed, and I see us living in a social climate that actively discourages breaks from the norm on a regular basis, feeding into people's insecurities and limiting the scope of this potential individuality across the global spectrum. What we have essentially is 7 billion self-contained worlds, and only bits and pieces leak out slowly over a long period of time to join the collective world, so to speak.

In the end, the message I'm trying to convey is pretty simple: the most noble thing anyone could possibly do is to be themselves. On a larger scale though, I think we need to put some serious consideration into reforming our social institutions to be less critical of people for their performance towards some perceived ideal, and instead empower people for who they are and allow them to reach their goals more efficiently by providing free-form social structures and the knowledge to use them.

In the end, while rapid technological change is re-opening these doors of how we perceive self-actualization, if we don't fix the way we behave towards each other, all the potential in the world that these new advancements bring could very well be useless. Systemic change comes from within'. Or something like that.",0,6,False,self,,,,,

We have systems like Kickstarter and indiegogo to crowd-fund projects, but we don't really have systems for crowd-development of purpose-driven projects, with a bit of inspiration from Reddit's AskScience, StackOverflow, and G+. I've been thinking about what it would take to develop such a system that could address the problems humanity is facing and drawing on the expertise of people who have a great deal of knowledge in the subjects to solve them and continually improve the solutions. 

To iron out the details of such a plan would take the expertise of thousands of people though. When I saw the 2045 social network concept [which creates contacts between managers, businesses, scientists and developers] it looks like it could be the ideal platform for implementation but I've been considering setting up a website in the near future that's basically a kind of ""Bug-tracker"" for humanity; basically allow users to submit problems they foresee in the near future of humanity, Specify the fields of study and experience they think will be needed to solve these problems, then have the user base of people in fields related to the problem vote up to prioritize the problem based on severity, or down if they feel it's a minor problem, or null if they don't consider the problem realistic at all [ each of which would require an explanation that would be attached to that problem's discussion thread. ]

Potential solutions could then be added to the main problem's ""thread"" and reviewed by experts in the field, who would then rank the solutions in the same way the problems were ranked, or submit Problems with the solution, as well as amendments to fix those problems, and the ""tree"" structure could be repeated down a few levels to create a network to track problems and potential solutions for them and constantly improve them; with the best and most immediate solutions moving on to things like the 2045 social network for open innovation, Kickstarter/Indiegogo, or to be implemented by different NGOs, corporations, companies, and activist groups locally at varying scales. 


Users on the site would register as you do on any site, but would have the option of submitting documentation [in the form of published papers, Degrees, etc] of their expertise on a subject, which would add ""tags"" to their accounts for those subjects and cause problems related to their fields of expertise to rank higher on their interface, and allow them to cast votes in regard to problems. 

Each ""Problem"" would have a few important sections:
[fields] - The fields of expertise needed to solve this problem
[Problem] - A short title for the Problem name
[Elaboration] - A summary of the net effect of the subproblems that make up this problem
[Causes/Subproblems] - a list of problems which contribute to this problem, ranked by magnitude of effect. Because most problems are related to other problems, Each item here is a link to the existing Thread for the Subproblem [which can be an independent problem in its own thread].
[Contributes to] - A list of Problems which this main problem is a subproblem to. Like the causes section, this provides linkbacks to each of the problems the main problem contributes to. 
[Votes +] - Votes denoting that experts consider this an important problem. Accompanied by commentary on reasoning for the vote.
[Votes - ] - Votes denoting that experts consider this a minor or already solved problem. Accompanied by commentary on reasoning for the vote.
[Votes X ] - Votes indicating that experts consider this problem to be inherently flawed in nature, is not a problem at all, or is severely misrepresented. Accompanied by commentary on reasoning for the vote.

Each Solution to a problem at any level would have:
[Fields] - List of Fields of expertise of the original poster, as well as of any expert whose amendment to the solution was ratified
[Solution to] - Indicates which subproblem(s) this solution addresses (with links, as this solution will also appear as a direct post on the subproblem's own page/entry)
[Proposition] - A short title for the solution.
[Implementation] - one or more conceivable ways in which this solution could be implemented in a real-world scenario
[Effects]: The effects of implementation
[Primary constraints]: Legal, monetary, Material, or political obstacles to implementation of this solution

In this way, rather than just having a social network for people to ""crowd-fund"" or see a proposed project, the actual userbase of the public could contribute actively to finding solutions to products which can then be picked up by other groups whose expertise it is to implement ideas and make them reality, Allowing people to brainstorm, review each other's ideas, and refine solutions in realtime prior to implementation or deployment, reducing the human error in individual projects to solve these problems and creating a database which can be used by Ideologically-motivated corporations, Politicians, Non-government organizations, startups, or even individuals to help fix the problems facing the world. 

Thank you for your time, and in the spirit of openness, I'd ask that anyone with suggestions/additions/improvements of this model make their voice heard in the comments. I am actually planning on creating this at some time in the near future and it'd be great to hammer out some of the kinks before going public.

What will it mean to be human in a trans/post-human world? After the Singularity or something anywhere near it in terms of impact? I often catch myself wondering about the arts.

What happens to the struggle to create art of any kind and how that may impact a final piece?
Essentially I wonder how much will we still find quiet time to reflect within an ""old-fashioned"" human mind on the undoubtedly seismic changes happening around us. I worry about a loss of something, I don't know what else to call it but quiet. Quiet of the mind. Mindfulness. Something distinctly human and not machine. I'm rambling don't be harsh.

Let me be clear:I am talking about the industrialized world, not the whole world. In the developed world, gender roles have been continually revised at much faster rate than ever before in human history. I do not necessarily think this is bad or good, but as gender equality is reached, and even when we can do very advanced body modification, wont the children who grow up in that world not see gender as clearly as people now or 150 years ago? It is my belief that the generation of people born between 2050 and 2070 will have little to no concept of gender, and thus be sexually attracted to people of both or either based on innate emotional connections. Modern homosexuality movements will eventually meld into this idea, and night clubs and raves will be filled with men and women who are all seeking both, since we have no more than abolished the idea of sex only for procreation.As of now, kids can grow up talking to people online and would have no idea whether they were a boy or girl. This development at an early age instills the ability to see people for what they directly say, no appearance, no body movement, no voice. What does everyone here think?

The possibilities for humanity are astounding. Having one machine that can give abundance to the world where so many lack even basic necessities is mind-blowing, and that fact that it is open-source and self-replicating makes it even better.  

RepRap has a ways to go, but with the recent [announcement](http://www.wired.com/design/2012/09/how-makerbots-replicator2-will-launch-era-of-desktop-manufacturing/) from [MakerBot](http://www.makerbot.com), 3D printing now has the potential to seriously hit the mainstream and get people thinking about our material world in a different way. 

So when the day comes when RepRap achieves 100% replication, and can print with almost any material, what will happen? 

I think one of the first things will be mobile communication devices. Smartphones and tablets are changing the way we interact electronically, but we are still tied to an imperfect system. What if phones were designed with another system in mind. If every device had a long-range wireless chip inside of it, that piggybacked onto other devices, it could create an enormous wireless mesh network, making the old system of paying companies for voice and data access obsoloete. 

This would provide numerous benefits. One would be that there would be no point of failure. No natural disaster or oppressive government could shut it down (such as in Egypt). Censorship would be a thing of the past. We would no longer be forced to buy outrageously overpriced phones or services, and by the nature of 3D printing, we would have amazing choice in our devices. 

There are some projects out there woking on similar ideas such as [Commotion](https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion) and [FreedomBox](http://www.freedomboxfoundation.org/). As well as some great open-source stuff like [Firefox OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS) and the [Ubuntu Mobile OS](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9227704/Ubuntu_OS_for_smartphones_may_come_next_year).

For those of you not familiar, there are two alien races featured in the Stargate series that have achieved some measure of immortality: the [Alterans, or ""Ancients""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_(Stargate)) and the [Asgard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asgard_(Stargate)).  I'll talk about the Asgard first because they represent a ""path"" to immortality similar to that represented by the Singularity.  

In essence, the Asgard upload and store their consciousness until they clone a new body and download their their consciousness into it.  They are characterized by being very cold, logical, but not without empathy.  Their ""path"" is represented by purely scientific means.

On the other hand, the Alterans achieve a state called ""ascension,"" in which they shed their bodies and exist as energy through sheer force of will via philosophical reflection, meditation, as well as some technological augmentation.  Their ""path"" is somewhat spiritual in nature, and is seen as being achieved through advanced brain development and the consequential development of forms of ESP.

I'm more attracted to the latter.  While definitely useful and effective, I think the singularity eliminates the opportunity for a progressive biological evolution that could achieve new and fascinating possibilities for humanity.

Anyone here work in the field and want to be on the radio?! Would take about 20 minutes and we can pre-record it so you don't have to worry about sounding like a tool on live radio. Discussion would be pretty general: What is AI, what obstacles are we facing, where is it going, etc...

They can update their status, comment on other people's walls, view photos etc only everyone else they are friends with doesn't see any of their activity. Friends simply see the same profile they have had all along.

So the crux of this form of punishment is to provide the mirage of communication with others but with the eventual realisation that you are essentially mute in the social world. That no one can hear your voice. You are able to understand and comprehend the changes that are going on around you but can never enjoy the pleasure of a feedback loop.

The same could also be applied to other modes of communication i.e. smart phone for calls etc
