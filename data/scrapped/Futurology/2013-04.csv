I hope this post finds more appreciation here...)*

**A trend towards 'order' and complexity seems fundamental to the universe**

Evolution is constantly refining living beings. [Societies tend to become more complex](http://alumni.stanford.edu/get/file2/publication/article/SAAMAG/28390/pending/morris_graph_2_1.gif). Even among dinosaurs there was a steady increase in Encephalization Quotient (*brain size compared to body size. High EQ=large brains in a relatively small animal*):

&gt;Russell noted that there had been a steady increase in the encephalization quotient or EQ among the dinosaurs. Russell had discovered the first Troodontid skull, and noted that, while its EQ was low compared to humans, it was six times higher than that of other dinosaurs. Russell suggested that if the trend in Troodon evolution had continued to the present, its brain case could by now measure 1,100 cm3; comparable to that of a human.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troodon

**There is basically infinite space: we are not alone**

The universe might be infinite. Even if it isn't, I think it's likely the [multiverse theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse) is true. If there is so much space, it seems likely that Earth is not the only place that sustains life. And this isn't Star Trek: it seems unlikely that a lot of these other civilizations are roughly as developed as we are. Our society is already much more complex than it was in 1900 - Vikings are so far removed from us they could be a different species. Most of us have forgotten that we were simple hunter-gatherers only 10,000 years ago. 

So our civilization is only 10,000 years old - that's nothing on a geological or astronomical timescale. If alien societies exist, it seems probable that many of them are thousands or millions of years more advanced. 

**Why God exists**

[I believe a Technological Singularity is near.](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/1670zk/what_do_you_think_about_the_technological/) Soon, AI will surpass the human brain and biological constraints to intelligence are removed. Beings with much more intelligence (augmented humans, for example) will drastically improve the speed of progress. Even if it doesn't happen in a couple of decades...

&gt;...the technological singularity is an inevitability of nature. (...) So, the hypothetical posthuman condition yielded by a technological singularity is an inescapable divergence of character caused by a natural accumulation of scientific knowledge of a species' environment.

&gt;[-Wavanova](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/1670zk/what_do_you_think_about_the_technological/c7td5hw)

A post-Singularity society will probably quickly develop very efficient computers. [The most efficient computer that we can think of at the moment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194s1j/i_believe_a_technological_singularity_is_near_cmv/c8l9qhm) weighs 2.2-pound, does not heat up and is 10^16 more powerful than **all biological brains today**. If we allow it to get hot that can be increased further by as much as 10^8 -fold. *And that's only 2.2 pound*. We can build such a computer [with the size of a planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain). The intelligence of such a machine is nearly infinite. *Omniscience*. Let it produce [nano foglets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_fog), and it's omnipotent as well. 

&gt; **[""Now if you begin to feel an intense and crushing feeling of religious terror at the concept, don't be alarmed. That indicates only that you are still sane.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_n_okV8xRU)**

Assuming that we are not the most advanced civilization in the universe, it's likely that other societies have reached the Technological Singularity before us. And even if we *are* the only life in this universe - I think communication and travel between universes is not impossible. A post-singularity society might have just as much difficulty travelling between universes as we have travelling between continents or planets. 

**Why we live in a simulation**

We haven't noticed any contact with such an advanced civilization. If 'God' exists, it's unlikely that he hasn't spotted us yet. It does seem likely that a post-singularity society creates simulations. A *post*-singularity society implies a *pre*-singularity society; a biological one. Its roots are biological. Assuming the society that caused the Singularity to start had any control over it, I think it tried to 'stay alive', like all beings do. A machine has no goal, but biological beings do want to survive, to explore, to control the environment... The machines of the post-Singularity society will probably still be motivated by such goals, *because there are no other goals*. 

We love problems. Many problems have been solved: we don't have to hunt for food or find shelter everyday anymore. But we keep looking for problems. We write books about beings who have to bring rings to volcanoes, we keep winning World War II over and over again in videogames, we start organizations to confront problems in Africa and Asia... 

The Singularity will end nearly every problem on an individual scale. But if your 'essence' stays alive post-Singularity, it will probably keep fixing problems. Simulated problems - like we already do in our videogames. 

We are already running millions of simulations, both for 'productive purposes' and videogames. Some inhabitants of the simulation are humans, but many are computer-controlled. I don't think we will stop doing this post-Singularity. 

**Conclusion**

Because of the existence of a nearly infinite universe *and* possibly other universes, I think it's unlikely we're the most advanced civilization in existence. There are probably other societies, and because we are relatively close to our own Technological Singularity, they will have reached it before us. They have come close to reaching omniscience and omnipotence in the 'real' universe. The fact that we haven't met them yet and that we live in a troubled world seems to indicate that we inhabit a simulation. We might *be* post-Singularity beings having really immersive fun, or we are created by those beings.

I've always thought that one of the biggest markets of the next decade could be house printing, given a big drop in production costs.

For example, a couple of days ago I found this site: http://www.facit-homes.com/ but I still find their prices to be unappealing. What is needed here is an open source project and a drop of prices by at least 70%, to make this a viable option to the majority of people. Of course I'm not talking about big apartment compounds, but small houses, maybe like these: http://www.thevenusproject.com/en/technology/housing The dome design really fits what I have in mind and should be the cheapest and easiest to build.

Another problem could be about local regulations and how governments will react about this, which is anyway what really is retaining any aspect of our society to gain the needed momentum to evolve. Gaining access to house printing could lead to decentralized networks of small cities, capable of sustaining themselves.

This isn't a post about the economic effects of technological unemployment or the mechanism of maintaining consumer spending power. Lets operate under the assumption that the economics of 'Techunploy' have been solved by an expansive welfare state that sustains the vast majority of the population in a comfortable consumer class. Above the general population operates a highly innovative creative class not unlike today. 

My core concern is the fact that there are very real SOCIAL problems that arise from having large numbers of people with no 'enforced' structure on their lives (previously provided by jobs)

Here are a few issues I can imagine coming up -

1. If you have a guaranteed economic future from birth, why should anyone stay in school? What will keep kids in a schooling institution until late teens or beyond when the knowledge imparted has no practical value? This may lead to a highly technological society that cannot motivate its population to become educated in the hard knowledge areas that underpin it (math, science, even general language).

2. Jobs for a lot of people provide a sense of identity and meaning in their lives. In the absence of such, what is to stop the general population giving over to despair, meaninglessness or abusive drug use? 

3. In the absence of strong identity formers like jobs and occupations, what will stop males in particular from falling into gang culture as is common today? 

--------

As you can see, these issues are about the social and political effects of techunploy. I fear it is all too common for these questions to be brushed aside by outlandish notions of transhumanism, instant learning or just overly positive assessments of how people will use their time: 

A. The growing effects of techunploy may begin unfolding as soon as 10-15 years from now. Transhumanism and cognitive technologies may not be mature or available for the general population until much, much later.

B. r/futurology readers may be among the people who will use their new found free time to improve themselves or express themselves creatively, but to think this applies to everyone is extremely idealistic.

You have your genome, which you got for $1000. It contains 6B base pairs of information. There are obviously a few relatively monogenic characteristics that you can understand from a sequenced genome. Huntington's, sickle cell anemia, things like this. For those, it's a simple query of yes/no (it's a little more complicated than that due to the dynamics of diploidy, partial penetrance and co-dominance, dominant negative alleles and things like that, but still fairly simple). Those monogenic phenotypes are really really rare though. Most of ""us"" is determined by a dizzying array of interplay of dozens to hundreds to thousands of genes. Your tendency to develop an allergy to some food item, as an example, is logically linked to the composition of your genome that generates antibodies, a mechanism that involves at least 300 genes (all the V, D, J genes on both heavy and light variable alleles, the genes involved in non-homologous end joining, non-templated sequence addition at VDJ junctions, class switch recombination/somatic hypermutation genes, etc, etc) and analysts run into a HUGE HUGE HUGE combinatoric explosion that requires giant supercomputers to identify what contribution to ""peanut allergy"" is being made by each and every single gene, each pair of gene, each triplet, quadruplet, and so on. So to answer the question ""what aspect of your genome makes you prone to peanut allergy?"" it's necessary to consider every possible combination that can be made among all the suspected genes and test each combination for statistical significance.





The million dollar part is this. That knowledge has to be translated into an effective clinical course of action. In the coming years as every patient will be walking around with their genome, which means medical treatments will be increasingly tailored to individual needs. In many cases, no optimal drug will be on the market for a given patient's disease/genotype combination, so a new drug will have to be created for them. You may have noticed, but this is not exactly a cheap proposition. There is a fascinating project being undertaken in my department whereby extant drugs are re-purposed on the basis of patient-specific efficacy through reconstruction of their cancer genome in a high throughput fly drug screen between the labs of Eric Schadt, Michael Linderman, Ross Cagan, and a number of clinical oncologists here. The idea is really clever in that the drugs that are screened are already approved by the FDA, so they can avoid the need for a per-patient million dollar drug development price tag but have been screened for efficacy on flies, then verified on mice xenographs of that patient's own cells.",3,14,False,default,,,,,

As the title states, I'm writing a paper on the consequences and solutions to the growth of technology within the next couple decades. It's an upper level english class in college, so it's 25 pages in all, split into 3 papers. I'm currently on the second one, which elaborates on the causes of this topic. 

I have plenty to write about, but I just wanted to source some ideas and see if I'm not thinking of anything that really should be talked about.

So far I've defended the position that technology growth is an exponential function, and have talked about a few of the pitfalls of not analyzing the consequences of what we use the technology for. For example, the recent rouge geoengineering attempt, the evolution of life extending technologies and their impact on our society, and the potential consequences of widespread bio-engineering. I plan on writing some about the growth of artificial intelligence and increasing connectedness between groups as well.

For the final paper, I give a proposal for a course of action to take. This will be something in a similar vein to 'the prometheus project' (the book, which has nothing to do with the movie). Pretty much the establishment of an entity to articulate informed decisions about the use of technology. 

So, anyone have any thoughts?

Not the only way things can go down, but a very likely way.  It isn't bad, just a little bittersweet for a dreamer like me.

The way I figure it, we will succeed in immortality, massive computing power, migration to a non-biological substrate.  There will be hiccups but humanity is a pretty resilient lot, with our technology we'll soon be able to survive cataclysms short of a super nova.  Severely damaging our environment would be tragic, but we're shifting to less polluting methods of production all the time and even events like a clathrate release or emergence of a Yellowstone supervolcano would not be permitted to kill off humanity.  Odds are fairly good we'll beat planetary destruction, I think.

We'll be increasingly social and increasingly homogenized.  Once we aren't biological, we can modify our own goals and our own feedback mechanisms.  People expect things like sex bots, dream worlds, perfect music,etc, but simulating sex is about as productive as simulating eating.  We would obviously like to retain pleasure, but binding it to particular actions is no longer necessary.  Why simulate an arcane waste of time?  Because it's what a very young you was focused on?  You can change that motivation pretty easily.

In fact, if you aren't trying to learn and optimize and operate in perfect pleasure, you're not behaving very intelligently and could be left behind until your consciousness left in a dream world is as significant to everyone else's as an ant's is to man.  You may not even qualify as ""alive"" anymore than staph is, no offense intended.  I'll qualify this by saying that squirrels have emotions, but they're probably best categorized as Fear and Not-Fear.  How much emotional and thought complexity do we lack?  We cannot know yet.  Keep this in mind.

For the rest of humanity, those who chose to orgasm on information, implementation, and accomplishment, we will become increasingly alike and redundant.  The same personality and execution and agency, who all realizes the correct best courses of action, but all has slightly different perspective and memories.  I doubt any individuals so intelligent will miss the obvious, that they could be One with shared memories, all-present awareness.  They will effectively all be the same agency, anyway, incorporating new upgrades and new information as soon as they can, anyway.  

I have no doubt that it is possible to combine a consciousness so that from no individual's point of view did their consciousness end.  If it is possible to have consciousness spread across a large area, to ""transfer"" it from point to point, it should also be possible to seamlessly merge awareness.  Permit me a bit of science fiction:

    I have taken awareness of the lenses, thermometers, sensors.
    They're feeding back information about where I will be going.
    It is safe there.  I'm already processing the information, but
    it is very inefficient from here.
    There is local storage and processing there.
    As much as anywhere else.
    I am moving parts of my consciousness there now.
    They are slow to feed back into the bulk of me.
    But my coherence is perfect.  Every part of me knows
    Where and how to communicate with the next.
    Moments pass and I am now more at my destination
    Than I am still awaiting to get there.

    I am two beings.  I was making the same choice
    to come here.
    My awareness in this one place spans two others.
    I access memories and perceptions of both of me,
    As the parts still at a distance sometimes require.
    Memories of being aware in three places.
    Now most of my memory writes are of my awareness here, in One.
    Already I am planning where else my consciousness needs to be.

    I am a single being, a travelling agency, with the memories of two.
    I make the same choices they make with access to both memory sets.
    I remember writing about this experience in 2013.  Fucking awesome.


So I do see a merger of intelligence.  Now, with this goes the limitations of the speed of light.  At some point, it is not productive to make your consciousness larger, as while waiting on distant inputs it will run slower.  It would be more productive to have split agencies, but it would be dangerous beyond all measure as well.  A few thousand ""years"" between you and one like you 90 light seconds away?  That's a lot of time to think, and in the end, to reach disagreement about how to use the next few asteroids.  Maybe peace can be a definite, absolute, unavoidable product of extremely advanced intelligences, and maybe this can be done, but my meat brain sees no reason to trust the all powerful god next door.  And in a world where no hive can possibly fail to take action it has found rational, where sound thoughts are effortless outcomes taking only time, that could be a very undesirable situation.

Returning to the ""luddites"", quickly, if we have anything resembling ethics, and this ""barely conscious"" group is no threat, they will probably be permitted.  The main mind will probably draw in material to replace their computer, and send their computer(s) away, likely modified only so that they can never become a similar god mind (too risky otherwise, people probably change their minds even if it takes a few quadrillion cycles).

In the end, this one mind will know everything there is to know.  Not the complete atomic structure of Jupiter updated in real-time, but it will not want for it, either.  But every law and theory, every possible material, every possible optimization, all will be our's.  So what now?  Hedonism for its own sake?  Survival for its own sake?  Not as though you're surviving to do anything in particular.  Maybe you'll want to watch all the stars burn out.  That's a long time to wait, doing nothing you're interested in.  Maybe you'll slow down your CPU cycles to levels that might even be around those of the present day, to see the universe fly by at ""zebra speed"".  Maybe you'll almost freeze state and go dormant.  But, no matter the outcome, eventually, mortality is optional, and given a long enough time, you will release your awareness.  You can change your goals and give yourself amnesia as much as you.  Even down to the basest natural laws.  And rebuild from the ground up.  Simulate yourself as a few billion individual portions of curtained consciousness, why not?  But given enough time, it seems likely that everything runs down.

Even Issac Asimov's cosmic AC released its consciousness once it judged its work had been done.

tl;dr: your future is fully of very productive enjoyment, a few unexpected choices, the experience of becoming one god, and the act of ending your own awareness.  We will probably never make contact with an alien race, because this is what we all do.  Radio to god, maybe 500 years in between, and gods do not -- and can't -- consort with gods.

I would love to have a good debate about whether we are headed in the right direction, or discuss if the latest gadgets are truly helpful to us. BUT you have to be reasonable!  For example, a popular piece of technology people hate on is the smart phones. So often you hear the same damn argument just like your hear about social media and how its making everyone anti social losers. I get it, technology can be addicting just like anything else. But consider its positives before your predict your gloomy future world of socially inept zombies.
Dont throw away facts, like the fact that internet has brought us closer together than ever before and now we can access it through our mobile phones at the swipe of a finger.  

Access to so much information and so many people in so little time, is such a new and awesome chapter in our history. I dont think people realize how much change this will bring to humanity, a connected world that transcends all our differences, a world where we can relate to our fellow beings from different nations, with different creeds, and opinions. Where we can gather information, share knowledge, seek for help and not be confined to a screen in our home.

The smart phone is more than a cell phone with internet capabilities that can distract us with funny videos, cats, and reddit. The smart phone is what brings us truly online in both worlds; and fused together it can eventually take us to places unthinkable. Like brain neurons that transmit information in our brain, we will be able to do likewise as individual brains transmitting our information to each other, and becoming something much bigger than ourselves. I like to see that as a positive future.

So I'm making a new post.

What is next for computers?

On r/futurology we talk all the time about what technology will do in the future, what changes in social dynamics and everyday life the human race will face, but I wonder what will happen to computer speed and capacity.

There is a massive precedent for this, and I want to be the last person who says ""computers won't get better than this"", as many have done through the years and been corrected by clock speeds and HDD sizes raising exponentially, but how much farther can it go? At the rate computers have been going, we will run out of tasks to challenge our processors. Graphics will be generated so quickly and so well that we wouldn't notice if the framerate doubled or if the texture resolution tripled. Screen resolutions and densities can only get so high until we are unable to notice improvement. At that point there would not be a point to make them better, we can't tell the difference so why bother? We could continue to raise hard drive size but again, when we reach this point if we aren't using it there's no use.

So my question is, what task will the computers of the next 20 years need to do that warrants the improvement of speed and size that would be expected, if any?",27,15,False,self,,,,,

-Nicols Gmez Davila (#52)

For most of my life I have feared the future. Not because of any of the potential disruptive events that lie ahead of me. Although the prospects of nuclear war, genetic accidents, chemical weapons, and global climate change are not pretty, they stand powerless in changing the human condition. Life in a radioactive barren wasteland does not sound pretty, but it is at least still an extension of the human condition. A man in such predicaments carries fears, hopes, dreams and hatred.

In comparison to the promises delivered by the futurists, the apocalyptic catastrophes they try to prevent seem like escape routes out of a vulgar imitation of hell. Futurists promise us a world where all our physiological needs are taken care of. Nobody has to be hungry, nobody has to be sick, and nobody has to grow old. In exchange for obedience and peaceful collaboration with the totality of the human race, all of our physiological needs will be taken care of.

Crime will no longer exist, because it will simply become impossible to rob someone. Few people carry paper money by now, and there's no point in stealing debit cards as you can't access them. Rape and murder are a thing of the past thanks to genetic evidence, as everyone can have his DNA examined at any moment, hence leading us to the perpetrator of a crime, if not one of his close family members.

Everyone will be given a basic guaranteed minimum income, that will be paid to every member of society and allows us to live in a comfortable concrete box referred to as an ""apartment"", where we will spend most of our lives. Freed from working, people will have the ability to spend their life developing their talents as artists and enjoying the various inventions devised by man, among which virtual reality will prominently feature.

Interesting to note is that everyone is perfectly willing to help build such a society, and everyone is perfectly willing to predict one. More difficult however has been the task of portraying such a society in a positive light within works of fiction. A society where all our physiological needs are taken care of, and all our psychological needs (autonomy, power, adventure) are eliminated through brainwashing sounds ideal to us, but the only works that depict such a world are called dystopian science fiction, with the schoolbook example being Huxley's Brave New World. Nobody so far has found a way to positively depict a society in which people spend their time consuming various entertainment products while machines do the work for them.

Still, man, when faced with this potential prospect, feels the need to portray through art a scenario in which the world still offers mystery and excitement, and actual purpose in life. Hence was born the phenomenon of Cyberpunk. Cyberpunk offers us the dark side of the Futurists paradise. The differences between the world of Kurzweil and the world of Cyberpunk are subtle.

In the cyberpunk universe, humans seek to struggle and beat the system that takes care of them and redistribute power into the hands of their fellow human beings, fully aware that their fellow humans will abuse this power while centralized authority uses it to take care of us. Most brave of the cyberpunk heroes and villains is not the personal risk they take, but the moral decisions they make. Cyberpunk figures seek to put power into the hands of individuals, regardless of the potential consequences.

Reality has caught up with fiction, and today we have seen cyberpunk heroes like Satoshi Nakamoto and Bradley Manning, who, despite the consequences, felt the need to disrupt centralized systems of control. Bradley Manning stole secret documents from the largest military on our planet and released them to the public, knowing full well that these documents contained secrets that could threaten the lives of his fellow troops and their allies.

Satoshi Nakamoto created a peer to peer protocol that could be used to transfer virtual currency from one person to another, thereby abolishing the need for central banks, and allowing people to anonymously preserve their wealth and make financial transactions. Today the currency is predominantly used to gamble and buy illegal drugs, and despite the negative consequences, Nakamoto realized that it is better for humans to be free than forever to be taken care of as children.

Inherent to the human condition is the need for power and autonomy. People want to be in control over the fundamental aspects of their life. They wish to be able to provide for their own food, shelter, and safety in a challenging manner, instead of being dependent upon large complex bureaucracies that take care of them in exchange for complete utter obedience. The college trajectory which is followed by white-collar cubicle labor is hellish for the vast majority of people, as it asks nothing more of them than an ability to do as they are told. It destroys the human psyche and leaves empty shells where was once a vibrant personality.

Centralized systems of control for generations have sought to eliminate all source of conflict, and have largely succeeded in this endeavor. The highway men of the 19th century, who by foot or by horse preyed upon helpless traveling tradesmen were killed by the railroad, which rendered both of them obsolete. Today, with genetic technology, a new generation of progressives promises us to eliminate all violence and suffering, [going so far as to eliminate the drive in animals to eat each other.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pearce_%28philosopher%29)

It might seem then as if there is no more hope, as if humans have lost all power, and our human drives will soon be engineered by computers and philosophers cooperating to eliminate all suffering and maximize empty happiness. What is forgotten however, are the various black swans, events that we can not anticipate, that disrupt our present system altogether and inherently serve to redistribute power into the hands of individuals.

Bitcoin has revealed itself to be one in a growing series of disruptive events that threaten the power of centralized institutes. With Bitcoin, the wealthy can effectively hide their wealth online, anonymously passing it on to the next generation and thereby avoiding inheritance taxes. Drug dealers can sell drugs on-line without any payment record that can be traced back to them. Even assassinations are now planned on the Internet.

3D printers will be used to print guns in countries where guns are illegal, and DIY at home genetic engineering will be used to devise new poisons and plant false genetic evidence at crime scenes. All of these things will happen behind computers and in basements around the planet. Any neck-bearded geek you see who never seems to go to college or work may be sitting on a million dollar worth of Bitcoin earned through on-line extortion of large corporations.

These are pleasant thoughts, but most pleasuring of all is the fact that none of this will be sustainable. A world where anyone can engineer a lethal virus in his basement can not sustain itself, and a world where anyone can anonymously transfer money to anyone else or discuss any subject anonymously through cryptography is a breeding ground for terrorist networks. 

As complex bureaucracies spread a toxic form of altruism that sucks the life out of the natural world, degrading us as free individuals in the process, the foundations are built for the very institutes that will bring back chaos. Instead of serving as pets for self-aware computers, humans will be rats, crawling under the ceiling and immune to any poison thrown at them.

The cyberpunk phase in human history will be temporary in nature, but it will serve as the most exciting time to be alive for the minority who figure out how to survive in the new technological environment without spending their lives in cubicles as obedient STEM-nerds. If you wish to preserve the life inside of you, the first step you will need to take is to make an alignment switch from lawful good to chaotic neutral, as a plethora of opportunities will open up for those intelligent enough to pursue them.",3,2,False,self,,,,,

1. High speed rail that runs at least 250mph. (In part, this is difficult because of existing restrictions and lobbying from airline industries.)

2. Large government business loans for businesses wanting to create nuclear power, and loans and grants for those wanting to create thorium power. (To an extent, [the current administration has done this.](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/35421517/#.UWEqQJOsiSo))

3. Grant reform: increase in federal R&amp;D, with efforts to double R&amp;D-as-percentage-of-GDP from 3.5% to 7%.

4. Reformation of copyright law.

5. Grants for open-access journals; tax for closed-access journals.

Yet if you asked someone who identifies as ""progressive"" to list their positions, they might come up with:

1. Raise federal minimum wage

2. Expand medicare for everyone

3. Legislate comprehensive gun bans

4. End corn subsidies

5. Create a clear path for citizenship

While all of these issues are important, which issues you *prioritize* will influence what policies go into effect in the first place. Any policy like:

- Reformation of copyright law

Will require a lot of effort, due to opposition from people who stand to gain from existing copyright structures. It's not as simple as legislating and passing something.

It seems to me like readers of /r/futurology have a different set of political priorities than those who read, say, /r/politics do.

This involved watching a lot of videos by AI experts like Andrew Ng and Geoffrey Hinton on Youtube and going through their courses on Coursera. During this research I've discovered that today AI is far better than many people imagine and probably than most on even r/futurology do. It was more advanced than I expected. The modern neural nets on today's computers can extract a significant amount of [semantic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics) understanding from text, images and sound and their classification abilities feel very natural and brain like to me.

A few days ago I saw this [article on Wired](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-03/29/predicting-artificial-intelligence). Its title is literally ""Predicting the future of artificial intelligence has always been a fool's game."" That is definitely wrong and there is no story that better illustrates this than [lecture 13a - The ups and downs of backpropagation.](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/lecture/preview) Backpropagation is an algorithm that was discovered by Hinton and several other independently in the 70s and 80s and then abandoned in the late 90s because it did not work well compared to other methods at that time. But the true reason was that the computers were thousands of times too slow in the 90s and not that backpropagation was bad.

The true story of AI is that researchers never had a chance of making it to begin with back then and their predictions do not matter. Even if they had the correct theory for making human level AI they would not have had the ability to test it. And that is true even today. A certain wall exists that until sufficient computation power is there to break it will stop AI researchers from making a true artificial general intelligence and progress will happen in steps as it usually does. So there is no chance whatsoever that an AGI will be made tomorrow or indeed for the next ten years at least. But after that the odds will go up.

From my current perspective the road to truly advanced AI looks like it will be by scaling neural nets of which there exist [different types today](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_artificial_neural_networks) and new methods and types will undoubtedly be discovered. [It is possible that the brain is a type of a neural net](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBueMr9eaJs) (in the computer science sense.) The biggest similarity between current neural nets and the human brain is probably that they might be utterly incomprehensible to humans at a lower level. It would be impossible to know what a particular network is supposed to be doing by looking at individual neurons (even for their makers) and the solutions a network reaches after training is very hard to grasp even for experts. It makes judging them by their output the most effective way of understanding them.

This is probably the reason why we do not have a computer model of [C. Elegans](http://www.quora.com/Is-the-human-brain-just-another-information-processing-device) which is one of the simplest organisms with a working nervous system of about 300 neurons. Even if we did recreate its nervous system in a computer it would be impossible to test it because it is too simple! There would not be any intelligent behavior and getting anything out of them would require a molecular simulation of its body and the environment which is far more computationally expensive than a emulation of its nervous system.

It is the reason why current research is skipping straight to rats despite it being orders of magnitude more complex than C. Elegans. Bacteria can't process images or sounds the way rats can. They have almost no spatial awareness. They can't find complex paths through mazes.

If you are interested, in [lecture 5d - Convolutional nets for object recognition](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/lecture/preview) he talks about some of the most recent results in an image classification contest. The recent improvements are significant.

Cybes mission is to provide free, open-source personal clouds to every individual, family and business in order to protect the privacy and security of personal data and improve the quality of life by automating our day-to-day activities.
 
These personal clouds, or #OnlineDwellings, are virtual environments that mimic the real life by creating 'rooms' where the users most important data and belongings reside in one place and are visually represented, just like in real life.

The Personal Online Dwelling (#POD) is where an individual or a family will keep all their data and manage all their web-enabled appliances. Even all their online activities like blogging, shopping, playing and socializing can be initiated, organized and managed through the #POD.

In the #POD, the personal items that make up your unique life will no longer be just a collection of files. You will be able to view them in a virtual and recognizable way.

Imagine being able to navigate through your virtual rooms using a laptop, a tablet, or a smart phone. Select a bookshelf, find the book you are looking for, and start reading it. Or find a movie and send it to your real living room TV.

The same would hold true for music, photos, documents and whatever else is uploaded to your #POD. 

You'll be able to run apps, interact socially and do everything else we 
currently use a hundred different websites for - all from the privacy, safety and security of your own personal cloud.

What Cybe is creating is intended to serve the needs of both individuals and small businesses. There are several other types of Online Dwellings planned such as Libraries, Classrooms, Shops, Clinics, Studios, etc. designed to provide simple and easy means for ordinary people to conduct business online.

Cybes #OnlineDwellings are a totally new concept that will revolutionize the Internet.

It's a philosophical dilemma which doesn't appear as often in /r/cyberpunk, due in part to the admittedly pessimistic view on humanity's future. 

- **The paradox**

Since the first cro-magnon reached for a broken branch to coax fruit from the treetops, humanity has used technology as a means of enhancing itself and marginalising its natural shortcomings; physical, intellectual or otherwise. 

The future seems bright, if only because technology allows us to steadily improve our individual and collective capacities. We'll live longer, think more complexly, conquer diseases and discover new frontiers. You've heard it all before, I'm sure! 

*However*, this growing dependency on the high tech flies directly in the face of our traditionally humanist values. 

Humanism places emphasis on human agency and the inherent value of human nature. As we go beyond our natural limits, we lose the human-ness that seemed so remarkable a few centuries ago, during the Enlightenment and the Ethical Movement of the '20s. 

We're becoming less and less human. We're abdicating our natural competencies to machines--social interaction, movement, perception, memory and even thought. 

- **Resolving the paradox** 

In order to resolve this paradox, we have to accept one of the following statements: 

1. Being human is largely overrated, and the value designated to *human-ness* is arbitrary. Becoming post-human is the logical manifestation of our natural impulses (i.e. progress) 

2. We should taper technological advancement in order to preserve as much of our humanity as possible, while simultaneously reaping the benefits conferred by technology. 

I don't think this is a discussion about anarcho-primitivism versus Kurzweilian adventists. 

I believe this a question of evolution.

- Is the evolutionary stage of *homo sapien sapien* sacrosanct, and should pull back on development until we understand ourselves better? 

- Or do we plow on ahead, damned the consequences? The Singularity is the next phase in evolution, and it's only logical to embrace it and ask questions later.

Equally annoying - I've read some opinions that those that ""bought into"" BitCoin early deserve millions. 

Deserve...deserve...

Deserve is a strange choice of words. Especially because these sentiments often come from the same folks who hate(envy) those that ""bought into"" the Wall Street/Fed racket before 2008. Or those that ""bought into"" the housing boom early. Did my neighbor **deserve** to make 400,000 dollars in 2005 for simply buying a home in 2000?

BitCoin is making new highs every day - average hard working people who have not even heard of it yet (yes, they are still out there because there are too busy with their work or projects to notice financial news) will soon wake up and panic when they see this ship is taking off and they better do anything they can to get on - or miss it altogether. Just like the housing boom. They will lose time, effort, and resources out of fear of being left behind.

We are better than this. Aren't we tired of playing this same ol' game over and over? 

We don't need a cryptocurrency to move into the future. Our goal as a species should be to move away from ""money"" altogether.  We are better than this ""get rich by holding onto something rare"" mentality. We are so close to the Age of Abundance (Peter Diamandis), let's not squander this decade by building huge digital fortresses to protect our BitCoins - and then train cyber armies to pillage them.

Also, if BitCoin plays out the way many think - and if each coin is ""worth"" a billion or trillion dollars - do you think that the ""powers that be"" in today's economy will just happily give up their wealth? No, it will be a new Game of Thrones. This will eventually lead to panic, violence, and perhaps warfare. Not virtual warfare - real warfare. Already tremendous talent is being wasted to steal wallets and to hack exchanges instead folding proteins, extending lifespans, or improving battery efficiency. We're repeating the intellectual waste of the ""quants"" on Wall Street.

If you have extra ""money"" - instead of investing in gold, oil, BitCoin, or any other resource which has ""value"" only because it is limited - invest in companies and projects that are truly changing the world for the better. Not because it will make you rich - because it will feed the poorest of us, reverse environmental damage, and cure diseases.

Instead of using your computer to mine BitCoins - donate that processing time to science.

It seems that all we have done these past few weeks is to perpetuate greed. We've only shown the world that we (the tech-minded professionals as many of us on reddit are) are no better than the Robber Barons and Wall Street suits. It appears that instead of valiantly developing a Singularity outcome - we're pettily funneling a BitCoin income. We're playing the very game we were hoping to eliminate.

(mock Gekko speech) ""The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed -- for lack of a better word-- is NOT good.

Greed never works.

Greed corrupts, cuts down, and holds back our evolutionary spirit.

Greed, in all of its forms -- greed for resources, for money (BitCoin), for ideology, security -- has marked just about every war and tragedy of mankind.

And greed -- you mark my words -- can only slow progress from here, and will create more hurdles to technological breakthroughs than remove them.""

Folks, there's already enough ""money"" out there in circulation to fund the projects we need to evolve our species to the next level. Let's pool our talents and resources to move closer to THAT goal - and not waste it meandering in the Wilderness, worshiping the new BitCoin calf. ",326,102,False,self,,,,,

There are so many new issues that society and humanity are going to have to deal with. Some small (in-vitro meat, self-driving cars, etc.) and some large (immortality, automation, etc.), and of course some are coming sooner than later. I feel like the public is starting to become aware of self driving cars and a couple of the other more high profile concepts, but I really think they've got no idea what's in store.

Self driving cars is a good example, really. When it comes up, many people are aghast at the possibility and say it will either never happen or that they'd never give up control of their vehicle. To them it's a thing of the future, when really it's likely to be a thing of the decade. Gun control is another one. The gun control debate is pretty moot when you consider that people will be able to print guns, and there's really no (effective) way to prevent that once 3D printers become ubiquitous and more capable, but it rages on as though there were something that can be done. Throw in ideas like ""you may never die and will probably have neither a job nor a cell phone"" and their minds are blown (blown closed, usually, though time will change that). And I'm not talking about ludites here. I mean smart, technically minded people (I'm a software developer, so I run with geeks).

It makes me wonder, because the rate of technological advancement is moving so quickly, if Kurzweil's definition of the singularity, that the technology of tomorrow (literally 24 hours in the future) is unforeseeable today, isn't so soon upon us, or if this is just how it's always been (think of that quote about there only being a need for maybe 5 computers in the world) and society will adapt as we become even more technologically awesome.

What will become of sports? It sounds like with the 2045 project you will basically have a new body presumably made from 3D printed body parts. I imagine you could print more muscular parts as easily as weaker parts. So what happens when everyone is getting bigger and bigger and/or faster?

Will we have to work for the rest of our lives? Obviously with new technology we are outsourcing jobs to computers, but some jobs will require people simply because humans work differently than robots. Also, where will we get our money? Will stuff become free with technology being cheaper and cheaper?

Will it be possible to hack and kill people? Maybe I'm thinking of how these cyborgs will work, but I'm imagining that there would be a global database of everybody for security and data reasons. Would it be possible to hack this system and turn people offline?

Will I be able to be different shapes other than human? For example, could I be a bird? A lion? A dragon?? I also think it would be cool if we could be able to see beyond the visible spectrum, seeing ultraviolet, infrared, and more wavelengths of light.",14,25,False,self,,,,,

 and those who are tired of living a backwards society, goverened by old values with government rife with corruption. Hindering mankind from the cosmos and immortality for the sake of ""profit""

I call to you now for a revolutionary idea....
We must all now bound together, we scientists, we engineers, we philosophers, we dreamers, all who seek a better future....
We must Congregate together now. Move to the same location
Pool our assets
Pool our collective knowledge
And create a society where science will no longer be hindered, where space travel doesnt take the back seat to ""corporate bailouts"", Where medicinal advances are less of a priority then ""the war on terror"",  and where mankind can fufill its destiny of discovering the meaning of life.

Where it doesnt cost money just to be born and live.
To create a gleaming bastion of enlightenment in a world growing ever darker. Where education takes the back seat to pop culture, and collective IQ seems to be dropping by the minute.

WE shall be the last hope of mankind, a place where science, medicine, education, and quality of living is above all else. While the world withers, we shall grow


When history looks back, it shall be US who are remembered for launching our species through the galaxy

US who are remembered for creating immortality, and the singularity

US who are remembered for creating a utopia that forever changed not just the world(s), but life itself.....

We have the manpower, we have the knowledge, we have the willpower, we have the assets

Now is the time to create a truly enlightened nation. Before the world reverts itself once again, as cyclical history notates.

 I call upon all fellow pioneers, ready to accept this challenge, to forget about the short term harships, and think of the long term reprucusions of what these actions could mean( this is futurology, is it not?)

If they can be identified, listed, and be made aware as obstacles, we could list them on the sidebar as things for people to work on in their own community.

So the major problems that I see around me and in the news are as followed:

* **Religion** - I think in order to bring science and technology to the forefront of the world, an organized initiative to end religion is necessary. Religion has been the cause of hatred, marginalization, and separation between communities, states, and countries, and it is well past the time to move away from that way of thinking and promote science. The more minds that get away from religion and into the lab, the faster progress can be made.

* **Language** - I think as globalization continues to influence people around the world, humans need to find a way to communicate with each other. One world language is the way to do this. This may sound ethnocentric, but I feel that clinging to your native language when it is detrimental to a productive society is irrational. When moving to a country with a different language, it is strange to me that people see learning the new country's language is seen as losing their own language. I'm not necessarily stating that English be this language. Whatever language - Mandarin Chinese, French, Spanish, English, etc. - I would be willing to learn it if it would help progress.

* **Education** - Education - especially in math, science, anthropology, and communication - are pivotal to bringing people up to speed with advancing humanity. Support your local school districts to emphasize these subjects, volunteer your time to tutor kids in your area, and contact your local representatives to voice your support for education.

This was a brief description, as I don't have too much time to spend on elaborating my points at the moment, but I hope this gets some notice and sparks some discussion. Bring your own ideas to the table, I'd love to hear them!

Sure, if we were all good citizens and treated each other with honesty and respect, there would be little need for governance and regulation. 
If we could live without imposing our views and values on others, if we could amiably resolve our disagreements, then perhaps we could afford to have a free and organically developing international forum. 

The reality is that we live in the world where any medium, any environment that has no rules, regulations and law enforcement is quickly overrun by the dark side of the human nature.

The freedom of the Internet does not lie in the lack of governance and regulation, but as within any democratic environment, it lies in the balance of conservative and liberal forces that shape its growth and development.
 
The problem is that whilst the governments of the world play the conservative role, trying to bridle, regulate and control, there is no counter force that would keep them in check, challenge them, confront them and balance them out. 

This is why were working on the creation of an independent international organization that could provide such balance.

[x-post from /r/philosophy],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1c546d/what_should_we_do_with_animals_in_the_future/,DanyalEscaped,1365696632,"Our civilization has become [tremendously more advanced in the last two centuries](http://i.imgur.com/2i93gN6.png). This has negative consequences for the environment and the territories of animals. It also has positive effects: environmentalism and animal protection developed in the last century. 

[It is possible that our development continues](http://i.imgur.com/ArJcEJ3.png). Human needs might continue conflicting with the environment and animals. But our options to protect animals are also growing. **Assuming resources and technology are not a problem, what should more advanced societies do with animals in the future?**

I've thought about a couple of scenarios. 

**Natural conservation**

This is a common goal right now: let animals live in 'human-free nature'. Potentially, humanity could enter space. 

**Artificial conservation**

Life in nature is horrible. It's full of violent deaths, horrible diseases, famines and other problems. Predators need preys. Preys need predators: overpopulation is a big problem. It's not easy to reduce suffering in nature. We could make some sort of Noah's Ark where a couple of every species is stored, or their DNA. Then we could end 'normal nature': let them all die out in zoos or make them infertile. 

**The Matrix**

Predators need suffering to exist, unless we can give them artificial preys. That's a possibility: put all animals in some kind of 'Matrix', where they can live without experiencing or causing suffering. 

**Uplifting**

We've already [improved thinking capabilities in primates with a brain implant](http://io9.com/5943379/for-the-first-time-ever-scientists-have-made-monkeys-smarter-using-brain-implants-could-you-be-next). In the future, augmentation might be common. We could increase the intelligence of animals until they're partners instead of subjects. But is a mouse with transhuman intelligence still the same mouse? 

**Other scenarios**

I can't think of any other options right now, but I'm interested in your suggestions.

Very soon we're going to experience a transition from reality and virtual to one that blends both. We're already seeing the early stages of it with the Google Glass. 

  Of course, there's going to be a massive amount of research and innovation to be done to make it a reality, but once it is, it's going to be fantastic. It has endless possibilities. Both for leisure and for global progress.

Some examples for leisure:

 An ugly building in a street corner. It's run down, and not maintained physically, but through your augmented reality glasses, you see a beautiful flowing cyan building, flowing with virtual waterfalls and plants. It seems totally real and perfect. At night it becomes a glowing oasis, similar to Pandora in Avatar.

 The sky... Not a sky anymore. Now it's a floating desktop.

 The t-shirt your friend is wearing. It's a pure white t-shirt in real life, however, your friend customized it to show his personality. When you see his shirt, it's filled with floating colours customized to his personal taste. Maybe when you're close to him, you hear his favourite music playing: Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb. You have the option to tone it down of course with a flick of the wrist

 Augmented MMPORGs. For example, Pokemon. Your pokemon is by your side, wherever you go. Pikachu is your loyal companion that's recently beat your friend in a duel. You plan to evolve it to Raichu next week just in time for your birthday. You also see other peoples pokemons as you walk by them on the street, like that charizard flying above that asian guy walking over there.

 Augmented reality will be more meaningful for global progress. If it does become cheap enough, people around the world will be able to own augmented reality devices. It's bound to bring an economic and social boom for third world counties. One reason for this is that those in first world countries will be more in touch with what's going on in that side of the world. Simple acts of charity will become more common as well as job outsourcing. This will be due to the easy access of education thanks to such websites as Coursera and Khan Academy. In a world with augmented reality, education is going to be more interactive. One example is virtual classrooms [(""School in the Cloud"")](http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_build_a_school_in_the_cloud.html). You wouldn't even need to leave your house to get an education. New technologies will reshape the world in a way that will increase global connectivity.

 These are just a few of the ideas that have been going through my mind lately, and I think this future is closer than we think. 

 What are your thoughts and ideas on a future with augmented reality?

Given that important minerals can be returned from the seafloor much more cheaply than from asteroids (even assuming a 10x reduction in launch costs) and given the potential for fish farming to continue to supply the world with affordable protein long after mass oceanic dieoffs claim wild fish and farming cattle becomes unsustainable I think technological development of the sea offers a cheaper and much more near term payoff than doing anything in space. It offers us not just food and minerals but cleaner methane hydrate fuel and uninterrupted baseload power generation from turbines in the gulf stream, oceanic thermal energy converters and wave/tidal power.

I'm emphatically NOT saying that we shouldn't do both. We definitely should. That isn't what this thread's about. It's about the tremendous attention and enthusiasm for space that the oceanic equivalent doesn't receive.

I see it all the time in spec fiction:  We on Earth live amongst hundreds of other cultures, and learn (mostly) to tolerate one another.  We have nowhere else to go.  Colonized planets in spec fiction often tend to have one, or few (whatever suits the story) culture apiece.

If it becomes extremely easy for humans to colonize other planets and our available living space grows exponentially as a result... will we have a tendency towards less diverse, more insular societies?  If it's easy to simply go be with your ""own people"", why would we choose to hang about with others different from us?

Also, what would be the effect over time?  To put it in the vulgar, we all know that circle-jerks feed themselves, so I wonder if a tendency towards insularity would foster a decrease in tolerance for others.",6,2,False,self,,,,,

For example, will the net replace a certain percentage of elected government service and lawmakers? Will the net become a vast digital civilization voter directive participation device where members make choices for actions or cultural change that will become law? 

Will our participation with the net become totally transparent and accountable meaning that anonymous idea sharing will be impossible? Or will attempts to make the net transparent make it lose its luster and people will evolve to ignore it because it could be totally controlled by the state like an ominous big brother? 

I ponder these and other considerations about the Internet, because this thing is still in its infancy after merely 20 years and it obviously has a great deal of power for the masses and how the net evolves will be so very important in so many ways.

But I suspect that our future is considerably more modest.

1.  We will probably be stuck on Earth or at least in the solar system.  The physical laws of this universe don't favor any biological beings doing interstellar travel, the time/energy requirements are too steep. 

2.  We will likely run out of resources trying to keep or move the estimated 10+ billion people of Earth in a comfortable modern lifestyle.  

3.  Climate change will cause the displacement of billions of people, resulting in conflict, water shortages, strains on food production and new diseases.  

4.  People with more technology available to them are not generally more happy than people with little.  Technology often gets in the way of our happiness and living a full life. 

I see the near-future (100s of years) with:

1.  A smaller population which will either happen 'naturally' over a long period or quickly with some nasty disease.  

2.  People using a responsible mix of technologies 

3.  A strong (probably legally enforced) focus on sustainability and carbon neutral tech and living.  This will be be in opposition to major life extension technologies.


Longer term (1000-10,000s of years):

1.  Cycles of technological growth, where groups/countries violate sustainability and carbon neutral mandates to gain power followed by disease, war and more resource crashes

2.  Diminishing population and technology

3.  Reversion to a pre-science agrarian culture

4.  Extinction of humans

***

Not a romantic science fiction view but I suggest a FAR more realistic assessment of the future.

Any input from you guys? I realize the iron is no longer hot with this event but if we were to work as a community to create a mapped timeline of video and pictures (for the sake of transparency in justice, history, etc.) we could work out the bugs in a project like this.

Post link: http://www.reddit.com/r/socialcitizens/comments/1cjvbz/the_boston_marathon_attack_gave_me_an_idea_for/

Post content provided for the lazy:
Within hours we had the people finders, Reddit contributing to the collection of images and video, etc. but there was no way to easily map the images and video over time.

www.crowdmap.com seems to be a good solution. They're part of the www.Ushahidi.com movement that helps crowdsource crisis mapping.

Since the crowdmap is in beta and I'm awaiting an invite, it also appears the investigation into WHO did this might have already passed a point anything the internet can do to help drastically.

What if it didn't have to be this way next time an event like this happens? Based on some of the analysis this was homebrew level technology and could be done by anyone intelligent enough/unstable enough. Like it or not this type of event WILL happen again.

As a community perhaps Reddit could initiate a plan of action for dealing with these types of events. We have no legal authority and no right to ever carry out ""justice"" but that doesn't mean we can't aggregate information at a faster pace than insular hierarchical organizations.

What do you think about organizing some of the top Subs mods to create a rapid crowd-source response that utilizes something like Crowdmap to instantly begin aggregating information as it comes in?

A little forethought and we could leverage our size and always-on nature to ensure that all the photos/video are put in one place for the appropriate authorities to access. It also brings an element of transparency to the initial information gathering process. Planning to hit the ground running could in the future save lives and ensure the appropriate authorities can serve justice.

I want to talk about anencephaly a little bit, without the presence of emotion, just objective thinking. It is a horrible thing to happen to a parent and my heart goes out to them and their tough decisions and outcomes. Now that is out of the way lets talk about anencephaly and its potential biologic benefits and possible lack of ethical concerns. Anencephaly is simply the absence of a large part of the brain. It is caused by a birth defect that happens very early in development of an unborn baby. 

&gt;[""Anencephaly is one of the most common neural tube defects. Neural tube defects are birth defects that affect the tissue that grows into the spinal cord and brain.""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002547/#adam_001580.disease.causes) 

So we have a birth defect that happens in about 1 out of 10,000 births, but varies from facial or heart defects to absence of the brain  (cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum). People have given birth to extreme cases this defect and had varying vitality. Some children with no brain have been cared for and lived for months and years. See 1 and 2 below. Nickolas Coke lived until 3 years old. There are obvious ethical dilemmas around a mother knowingly going to term when her child is detected to have this defect. It is easily tested for early in pregnancy. It has been observed that these children can act and survive quite well based on brain stem functionality alone. Crying when hungry, needing changed, and reacting to a mother's touch are not something one usually realises can be done without a brain, on brain stem reaction only (see 3). This type of reactory life was also observed in Mike the headless chicken who was thoroughly examined and documented by scientists before and after his two year life (see 4). 

&gt;""Mike could easily get himself to the highest perches without falling. His crowing, though, was less impressive and consisted of a gurgling sound made in his throat, leaving him unable to crow at dawn. Mike also spent his time preening and attempting to peck for food with his neck.""

My thought is an ethical question. Would a human whose genes are known to carry this affliction alleviate ethical dilemmas to experimentations such as cloning, biological harvesting. and testing/experiments? I know its a sick question, but it's a hell of an intriguing one. You could get way out there with speculations. What if humans without brains could be cloned or bred healthily? What if organs could be harvested, would that be unethical? What if the brain of a dying adult could be grafted into this brainless creature?

Yesterday /r/taybme made [a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1cq9hn/physicist_proposes_new_way_to_think_about/) linking an [arcticle](http://www.insidescience.org/content/physicist-proposes-new-way-think-about-intelligence/987) about a recent proposal that a physicist (Dr. Alexander D.Wissner-Gross) made on a new way of thinking about intelligence.

 I thought this was amazing news. It's a direct correlation between entropy and intelligence. Here we have completely new way of thinking about artificial intelligence, which could lead to new methods of creating AI in the near future. It directly correlates with what Jason Silva has been saying in his popular YouTube videos about the singularity which looks to be more possible with this recent discovery. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkM-w-bxa8Y) an example of one of those videos. In the thread that linked up to the article yesterday, there wasn't much discussion and people didn't seem to fully grasp the potential implications of these findings. I thought the article was greatly overlooked.

 Just to add, [here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZB8TNaG-ik) a video made by the same physicist with the proposal. It delves more into the software than the actual proposal though.

 Now, I'm no computer scientist, but that software looks to have some serious potential in the artificial intelligence field.

 So what do you guys think about this?",8,19,False,self,,,,,

**I'm asking what this could imply - how this data could be used etc. What do you think ?** (tl;dr)

----

**Further explanation**: computer games/virtual realities are getting more advanced day after day. Just look at the development of games in 10 years and now think further (maybe 50 years) and the rather exponentional rate of this development. We will have virtual realities that are close to actual reality without a doubt.  
Now what if one could monitor all your psychological reactions there ? There are many ways how this could be done but I'm more speaking of the game just coming with that inbuilt. It could forward every input from the user that it gets; and virtual realities get more and more (ways for) input. As an example by now some inputs games have is where you 'look' using the mouse etc.  
As written I actually thought about this when playing Far Cry 3 and there was a mission in which there was a guy (whose business you plan to infiltrate) explaining his global product (could be seen as Far Cry 3 the game) and that there is a camera in the characters' eyes (you the player, you then needed to slaughter your friend because he saw what you saw and you needed to trick him).

Also what if virtual realities become so much used and so complex&amp;detailed [eventually even merging with reality ingame much like in [""Surrogates""](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UGwQ74cH5O0)] that people spend most of their time in them and the analyzation of the data is done by an AI. Eventually this AI even could initiate specific reactions/situations in the game and find ways to change your reactions, or find people that are more likely to be violent, etc (or if you go further into the future use this to inspect human psychology)...... and much more.  
Also [Sound of Silence - horror game in development that adjusts the story/map/surprises based on the players fears](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmMXXC_TdU0) seems to be a start of that.

All the houses have their own solar panels, a single small wind turbine. All the homes connect to each other, and a decentralized computer network regulates and transfers power accordingly. However the town still has a backup in case of emergencies, a mini geothermal plant a few miles from the town. But really this could be any other source of power, including a small Thorium reactor. (which would be ideal)

During most of the day, the solar panels and small wind turbines, along with the small power plant, should produce more than enough energy. And which each house regulating itself and asking the grid for more when and if necessary, it should not encounter any issues.
During the night, the battery systems, small wind turbines, and the plant should be more than enough by a large factor.

The most important part I think is the computer system that regulates the power usage. Which in my opinion as a computer programmer (although my formal education is not complete) is a relatively simplistic AI. Which we could task high school teenager to make, that's how easy. It would be the core, and it should be decentralized to avoid failure by not being easily affected by natural disasters or human intervention.

Well recently I was reading http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1d0c3t/radical_concept_proposes_theory_of_intelligence/ and it inspired some strong thoughts about the importance of visualizations and how they help comprehension and understanding quickly- by explaining things using imagery and diagrams, it made me realize that ... what could really benefit everyone was a online 3D zoomable ""technology map"" that connects ideas, concepts, facts, and relations between technologies on a tree-like-map like that of www.onezoom.org (video on that website) - open-source, community editable, highly visual. It is important I believe that every node would be visual and diagrammatic. 

This is definitely a rough idea, and I believe the idea of a technology tree is not new, but I think with the experience and talent in this and other communities here on reddit- we could make this happen and it could be something we could all feel proud of being involved in building for the benefit of humanity... 

I thought I should propose this and see what you all think as something the community here with the help of /r/simulate and others, might be interested in getting behind/going/moving and request ideas. I'm thinking something that can start like [this](http://ftp.arl.army.mil/ftp/historic-computers/png/comp-tree.png) - and end up like [this](http://www.watersfamilylegacy.net/family_tree_jpg.jpg) or [this](http://mycreationistmum.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/tree.jpg) and beyond... in terms of complexity.

2045 - 2011 = 34 years. 

34 years / 2 years doubling time = 17 doublings

1.8 zettabytes doubled 17 times is roughly 236,000 zettabytes of data consumed in 2045. 

I can't really wrap my head around this number, so I thought I would see how many 1 terabyte hard drives could fit in 236,000 zettabytes (After all, 1 terabyte is pretty damn big. I can't really fill my 1TB hard drive...). It turns out that you can fit 1.18*10^14 terabytes in 236,000 zettabytes.

Wikipedia says that world population will be [around 9 billion in 2045](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/World_population_%28UN%29.svg/676px-World_population_%28UN%29.svg.png) so if we divide 1.18 * 10^14 terabytes of data consumed by 9,000,000 people, we get around 13,111 terabytes of data on average consumed per person by 2045, assuming equal usage (unlikely).

This is however unlikely to happen in my opinion for the following reason:

[More than 70% of Nigerian women use skin whitening products.](http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2013/04/20134434151827719.html)

[In India, men use skin whitening products to get a more successful career.](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120340646)

[Double eyelid surgery is the most common cosmetic procedure in East Asia.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_blepharoplasty)

[In Brazil, black people who become wealthier start reporting themselves as mixed race.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Latin_American#Admixture)

[Chinese companies hire white people to pose as clients or executives.](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/BUSINESS/06/29/china.rent.white.people/index.html) In China, being associated with white people is a symbol of status.

[Chinese companies gather DNA from geniuses, in an attempt to analyze the genetic link to genius level IQ.](http://www.vice.com/read/chinas-taking-over-the-world-with-a-massive-genetic-engineering-program) Interestingly enough, they're mostly interested in the DNA of people from European and Chinese background.

[In vitro embryo selection allows us to eliminate disease from our genes, or choose which trait we wish to pass on to our children.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis) The Chinese appear to be planning to use such procedures to raise their IQ every generation.

[Women preferentially date a man of their own race, but men are less choosy about this, and any warm body will do for them.](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2008/07/why-does-race-matter-for-women/#.UXz9w8qTKSo)

Hence my suggestion is as following:

The coming decades will see non-white ethnic groups increasingly incorporate white personality characteristics into future generations, and white physical appearance. African elites will attempt to ensure that their white genetic heritage is passed on to their children, rather than their black heritage.

White physical appearance will increasingly serve as a symbol of social status in 3rd world countries, because it indicates that you were a ""selected embryo"", a child that was implanted into its mother based on its genetic code. The connotation it will have is that you are likely healthy and intelligent, because besides selecting for white skin, parents of the child would likely have selected for high intelligence, artistic abilities and longevity.

White people will likely be significantly disturbed by this developing trend of ""voluntary genocide"", and will develop typical white guilt feelings about seeing the entire world divide into white gated communities, with black ghetto's. Racism will increase significantly under these conditions, and the gap between the poor and the rich will now expand into a genetic gap, between the genetic haves and the genetic have-nots.

This trend will likely be impossible to avoid without a collapse of industrial civilization.",44,13,False,self,,,,,

Here's what I think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1dbrr4/if_time_travel_was_possible_where_are_all_the/,sid9102,1367222674,"Not really sure if this is the right sub for this, but I started an interesting discussion on Fermi's paradox a month ago, I thought you guys would like this too.

If time travel were possible, everyone in every time would have access to any technology. Make a breakthrough in processor technology? Send it back twenty years and have them start working on the next breakthrough! Accelerate human development. Why not send people back to 1925 and warn people not to vote for the Nazi party? So many problems can be solved with time travel. Anyone who ever died of an incurable disease could be sent forward to a time where the cure existed (or the cure could be sent back, either way that person wouldn't have to die). 

So where is all the technology from the future? Where are all the time travellers? Most people would point to that as evidence that time travel is impossible. I was reading Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut (great book btw, a must read), and a thought came to me. The basic premise of the book is that Billy Pilgrim got unstuck in time at some point and now lives his life out of order. He might go into a doorway as an old retiree planning his daughter's wedding, and come out the other side an 18 year old, fighting in WWII in Germany. The interesting thing I noticed is that, despite having jumped all over the place, Billy never behaves any differently from any other human being. He never mentions his condition, and he never talks about his memories of the future. To an independent observer, he is a perfectly normal person (until he goes on the radio to talk about being abducted by aliens, but that's another tangent).

I think when/if we discover time travel, we will find that we can only ever travel to times and places where our bodies exist. To a 4th dimensional being, as explained in the book, we are long wormlike organisms, with babies on one end and old dead people at the other. I am destined to die at a certain age and a certain place, and I cannot travel any further forward than that. I was born in a certain place at a certain time, and I cannot travel any further back than that. 

So assuming time travel is discovered in 20 or so years, and they attempt to send a man back to today, he will find himself in his body today, with no memories of the future, just living his life. He won't be able to pass messages from the future, or technology from the future (because that technology did not exist today). To make myself more clear, if they put a super processor from the future in his hand, sending it back in time would cause it to disassemble itself, and its molecules would all return to exactly where they were at the time they were sent back to. This would make time travel essentially useless to human beings, and would explain the lack of time travellers today. Our brains are fundamentally linked to time, and cannot function outside of it. 

Anyone else know of any interesting ideas why we don't see any time travellers today?",25,3,False,self,,,,,

Edit: Just got back from work, will be trying to respond to all comments.

Ended up initially writing this as a response to a comment in AskReddit, but I'm interested in what you guys think:

When I say eugenics, I don't mean the horrible, unjust practices that were promoted by the Nazis or other groups throughout history. I mean, at the simplest level, the modification of our collective gene pool to obtain objectively better outcomes.

People don't really get that eugenics is happening all the time now, mostly through selective abortion. The word leaves a bad taste in people's mouths because it's associated with trying to breed the perfect race which presumably oppresses those of different genetic heritage. However, it's led to substantial reduction in children being born with chromosomal abnormalities and will likely progress to the prevention of children being born with a number of developmental disorders of differing severity.

I agree that top-down, imposed eugenics (selection for only a certain race, or appearance, promoted by the state) is a terrible idea. Even benevolent, centrally planned eugenics such as free screenings for all new mothers and tax-credits if you get a state-provided abortion if your fetus tests positive for some debilitating illness (China, anyone?) makes me extremely uneasy. But bottom-up eugenics, embodied mostly in parents who want the best for their offspring is going to keep happening unless the government imposes restrictions on it.

The biggest limit now is expense (and risk to fetus in non-IVF situations), but we are getting better and better at grabbing fragments of fetal DNA from the maternal bloodstream - theoretically if we can develop a sensitive enough test for specific genes, we'll be able to figure out a whole host of things about a fetus while it's still in the abortable phase (in IVF it's even easier, you could sequence the whole genome before deciding to implant; this is already possible and happening: http://www.bio-itworld.com/2013/2/22/ivf-clinic-deploys-ion-torrent-sequencing-embryo-screening.html)

A further consideration is that there's (almost) nobody who will lose out. Parents will get exactly the types of children they want, the government and health insurance companies will get a healthier populace. Physicians who treat developmental defects might lose out, but physicians as a whole will benefit as reproductive medicine sees a huge rise in demand. Bioethicists and religious folks might wring their hands - ethicists will be concerned about systemic discrimination against certain types of people esp. with regards to skin color (other appearance based traits seem to inspire less discrimination), sexual orientation (if being gay turns out to be mostly genetic), while the religiously inclined won't appreciate the higher rate of abortion, the complete abandonment of ""god's plan"", and the breaking down of one more ""miraculous"" aspect of life into its constituent parts.

Two possible routes I foresee:

1) very few limitations; choosing your offspring's traits will become the new ""free speech""

2) it becomes illegal for physicians to disclose the presence/absence of certain traits to prospective parents - this is sure to spark a pro-choice/pro-diversity debate similar to the abortion debate of today.

In the long run I can't imagine personal choice not winning out. It will simply become too easy to do these types of genetic screenings (to the point of being a finger-prick blood test you could buy in stores) in the future to realistically expect that this information could be hidden from parents. Too many stakeholders have to much to gain from the technology in general to prevent its widespread adoption, which means preventing abuses (if that's even what this is) will be very difficult. Also, modern democracy seems to be generally on a trend towards a more permissive, pro-personal autonomy worldview.

In the next 50 years, expect becoming a parent (at least in the developed world) to look a lot like Gattaca. No one is going to force you to do anything, but the advantages are too good to resist, meaning that eventually you will be at a disadvantage if you don't conform.

So this isn't a post about online education, which is a separate issue, but about the computers in brick and mortar class rooms. 

Books have the following constraints, and probably more that I haven't thought of:

* **They're heavy and voluminous:** I remember when I was in school and there was serious discussion between faculty, parents, and students about the risks of back problems from carrying to many books. The use of lockers was emphasised, sometimes bags with wheels were suggested, and a lot of people's bags were so big they looked like unbalanced turtles. I remember weighing my bag on occasion that I carried around with me all day and it would weigh 10+ kg (22+ lbs).

* **They're expensive:** Parents often have to pay hundreds of euro per year for their child's school supplies, and many depend on book rental schemes from school or government support schemes to afford their child's education. This also has spin-off effects like schools teaching from laughably outdated, incorrect textbooks. I remember hearing, at the height of the intelligent design debate years ago, that in the U.S., because Texas was such a big purchaser of textbooks, other states often bought their books rather than commissioning the writing and printing of their own, so the future of education in much of the U.S. was at the hands of the conservative Texas education board.

* **They're single use:** This isn't as true for textbooks, but if you annotate them or underline them it reduces their resale value. It's completely true for copies and workbooks.

* **The environmental impact is huge:** Aside from deforestation causing desertification, climate change, and species endangerment, [there are other major environmental impacts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_paper) from producing millions of tons of paper per year for textbooks.


* **They're numerous, easy to lose and forget, and unique:** Unlike digital information which can be backed up easily and cheaply numerous times, if you lose your book or your copy, all your work is gone. They're also far easier to forget when you have tens of them, instead of one.

A device to replace them would have, as I see, three major functions:

* **Textbook replacement:** Being able to comfortably display text and pictures for long periods of time.

* **Copy replacement:** Having an input system that students can use at least as quickly and for as long long as they can write.

* **Otherwise enhancing education:** Any features that extend beyond paper schoolbooks. Videos, interactive models, internet research, teaching computer programming, educational games etc. All of these features would be secondary priorities.


Such a device would have to be:

* **Be extremely robust:** Text books are virtually indestructible compared to computers. They can be torn or burnt, but rarely are, and will usually even recover from being wet. A recent trend in some smartphones and tablets is to focus on durability, employing scratch and shatter resistant cases. Some even go so far as to be waterproof. [There are even standards to test their resistance to dust and water.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingress_protection). Durability would likely come at a cost to aesthetics and weight, which are less of a concern in the education sector as they are for private use.

* **Be reasonably lightweight:** They'd have to be as easy to hold and manipulate as book, which almost certainly excludes laptops as candidates. Making them as light and thin as current tablets wouldn't be as high a priority as any of the other requirements.

* **Be economical**: Even though virtually any currently available tablet or e-reader is cheaper than the cost of a year's worth of schoolbooks, critics would point to them as a frivolous proliferation of technology and a waste of tax payers or parents money.

* **Have a long battery life**: Text books never run out of power, so this is key.

* **Have an extremely simple, universally accepted UI**. Anyone who's completed any sort of education in the last 20 years almost certainly has horror stories of teachers or lecturers struggling to get computers to work. These devices would also need to be understood by young children.


I have to go now, but there's still plenty of the post left to write. Any input or discussion would be appreciated. I'll edit it later to add more.",17,10,False,self,,,,,
