I think the first candidate to make wheel a thing of past will be the room temperature superconductors. They could make hovering cars a reality as there are trains that float little above the ground with Maglev technology. If superconductors were at room temperature they could be everywhere. Everything that needs wheels and supports to move around would no longer need them and would hover around through electromagnetic currents.

The other technology could be electromagnetic propulsion/repulsion . They could enable flying cars that wouldn't have wheels and flying/floating objects that would use electromagnetic fields and waves to float or hover above the ground. This makes sense since electromagnetism is much stronger than gravity.

The other technology that might become possible in the far future is antigravity. However most people think that antigravity is impossible and will never become reality.(But that is an issue for another thread). Antigravity could make things float and fly magically as if they weren't being attracted by Earth's gravity.",9,1,False,self,,,,,

It's been about ten months now, it seems that for some reason everyone is hearing my thoughts. I can communicate with almost everyone really just by thinking of them, which has created an immense tension. I've tried to calm everyone down, but doing so takes up most of my time. I feel that my work is now complete, now finally seeing children calm about what's going on. there's a weird game around it which I am on my way to let go, so everyone can finally chillax for a bit. By the way, I have no place to stay and almost nothing to eat right now. My account number is 0438015289696 Banco General savings acct email [liannangelis711@gmail.com](mailto:liannangelis711@gmail.com) my friends are stuck with me on this one so I appreciate your help. Trying to find a job, but everyone is scared that if I stay too long they won't be able to stand it. Fled away from my main city, now I'm trying to get back. Need help fast. Someone may communicate with you trying to warn you something will happen if you do so, but most likely nothing will. We just need to get past this chasm. We will together. I can't seem to find a way to sustain myself right now, this is why I am asking for help. Been helping others for too long now it seems they are used to it. One dollar, ten helps, at least to get around have breakfast, or use Wi-Fi to get everything resolved, let's get out of this together... now everything seems fine, since I've guided everyone how to stay safe, but not sure I will be able to for much longer. There is another option, another person I may call, but it just will keep us trapped in the same circle. Post to the account, wire transfer if you will, I appreciate it. Last night I had to sleep in an abandoned building and got harassed by the cops. Tonight by the church. Got tithed by some very nice people, but I'm afraid it's not enough.

Stopping (or at least slowing down) global warming should be a priority to the human kind, we're the ones who caused this and we are the only ones with the power to stop it - and a man-made thing (aka money) is stopping us from doing so?

From another perspective, the amount we'd spend on fixing our infrastructure and paying the military and emergency personnel and services could be much higher than the amount we'd spend on global warming (modernising factories, changing anything that currently uses any kind of fossil fuels to green energy...).",11,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

There are certain facial features that are considered attractive by *all* cultures and peoples, ancient and present. More often than not these facial features are strong positive indicators of good health and thus over time people gravitated towards finding them attractive. 

&amp;#x200B;

My face didn't develop properly nor did the bones in other parts of my body and as a result I have an incredibly mis developed jaw, non-existent cheekbones, non existent infraorbital rims, close set small eyes, thin small lips, disproportional facial thirds (the middle third is too long and is impossible to change that) and a narrow palate. The extent of my misdevelopment can't be treated with surgery due to every bone in the face and as a result soft tissues misdeveloping in tandem with one another as a whole. This has resulted in me being objectively ugly and sickly looking. 

&amp;#x200B;

The golden ratio/mask of attraction holds true for the majority of people because it is an example of adequate facial development - one with strong cheekbones, jaw projection, proportional thirds, eye spacing etc. Things like hair colour eye colour, skin colour and other superficial features such as eyebrows and freckles are the more conscious things people think of whereas facial structure is more subconsciously noted. 

&amp;#x200B;

My sister suffers from the same issues I do and I really can't stand to live knowing that we both, be it genetic fault or environmental literally *grew wrong* and are ugly as a result. My only drive to live is the hope of one day being able to undergo some form of future surgery that allows for results and change as radical as say turning a camel into a car (extremely shit analogy but needed something to highlight the level of fundamental change needed). Or perhaps some sort of matrix tier virtual reality or in-vivo genetic engineering or being able to artificially induce a second growth period. I think about this throughout most of my waking day be it consciously or subconsciously and how the improper growth of my facial bones have lead me to having such a shit life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Humans aren't meant to be ugly and objective ugliness shouldn't exist. It is the result of less than adequate growth and it tortures me knowing that in principle it should be easy to fix, but in practice the level of change to every minute detail of ones facial anatomy far surpasses the ability of any current surgery.",9,1,False,self,,,,,

With Messenger, Whatsapp and Instagram, Facebook already owns a huge junk of your private conversation and I think its safe to say that, if anybody would be able to predict your answer to a friend based on your previous reactions, its Facebook. 

From fotos, videos and now portal Facebook would also be able to recreate your body language and facial expression. 

And with the development of VR there will be a moment, when the visual quality of devices will get very close to the human eye. 

Which means at some point theyd be able to build a virtual version of yourself that could be there for your loved ones. Even if you couldnt. 

This surely raises ethical questions, but it could also be a way to deal with losses, a lot of people might considerate.

The strongest selling point for VR right now seems to be, that it can give you an experience you cant have IRL. What if that could be a conversation with an old friend or family member?",3,1,False,self,,,,,

I could write entire volumes on this subject, but here is a condenser form of my argument. Please share any thoughts you have on the subject. 

  

Based on my own experiences and observations, it has become abundantly clear to me that higher education is the best investment that a government can possibly make in their society. The US economy is rapidly changing into one driven by high-skilled technology based jobs, but the biggest current problem with this sector of the economy is the lack of qualified candidates to fill open positions. Many people grow up with the belief that a college education is not required in modern society, and that one can make a decent living if they are just willing to work hard and put in their 8 hours every day. That may have been true in previous generations, but it is no longer the case and we need to start coming to terms with that reality. The solution to this of course is simple: government funded higher education for all citizens. While most people universally agree this would be a good thing, the nay-sayers out there only have one real argument: it would be too expensive for the government to fund such a project. This is utter non-sense. Not only would such a program pay for itself, it would substantially boost the governments revenue. Let me break down some of the numbers here using a hypothetical citizen, call him Joe, as an example. 

Lets consider two possible paths for Joe. In the first path, he graduates high school at 18, and being from a poor family that cannot afford to send him to college, he goes right into the workforce. He gets a working-class job making 20K/year; so little that he is exempt from paying any taxes. Later in life, Joe starts a family but is not able to fully support them on his meager salary, so he gets some welfare assistance from the government. He retires at 65, no longer able to do the physical labor from his working-class job, and starts drawing Social Security and using his Medicare to address various physical issues caused from a lifetime of hard labor. By the time Joe dies, he has ended up as a net financial liability for the government, costing them several thousand dollars. 

Now lets consider an alternative path for Joe. After he graduates college, the government invests 100K in his higher education. Joe graduates at 22 and gets a job making 50K a year. Given his salary, he ends up paying about 10K a year in taxes. This means that in 10 years, when Joe is 32 years old, the government has already made their money back from their investment. Joe still has about 40 years left in his career, which will most likely see his salary grow, and every dollar he pays during that period is a net financial gain for the government. Joe starts a retirement savings account and is able to comfortably retire with his own funds and pay for his own healthcare, which is minor given that he has had a comfortable desk job his whole life. By the time Joe dies, he has ended up contributing close to one million dollars to the government, all because they invested a meager 100K for his education. 

And this is only the beginning of the benefits to such a program. What is the government to do with all this extra tax revenue? They could fund massive infrastructure projects that would further boost the economy, such as public access internet, free public transportation, improving educational institutions, etc. Also, what are folks like Joe to do with all of their excess income? Spend it, of course, and pump more money into the economy, which in turn creates more demand for more jobs. And what are the banks that are holding people like Joes money to do with all their excess cash? Loan it out to businesses to help them expand, creating more jobs. 

For those concerned about the government giving hand-outs and free stuff to those who dont deserve it, keep in mind that such a program would be done on a year-by-year basis and everyone would be responsible for maintaining a certain GPA to continue qualifying. Yes, there will be some wasted investments. Some will probably not be very successful and end up costing the government a little bit, but given the enormous gains made by the others, like Joe, the profits would still be immense. Even if it were a complete financial wash for the government, which it certainly would not be, it would still be more than worth it, simply from the societal benefits. Less poverty means less crime and increased safety, security and general well-being for everyone. It would lead to a much more enlightened, healthy, happy, and productive society.    

In conclusion, there is absolutely no excuse not to institute a program of government-funded higher education. It is the best possible investment that taxpayers can make in their future, and I am perpetually amazed that nobody in Washington seems to be able to understand this. What in the world could we possibly have to lose? Many other European nations have already instituted similar programs and are reaping enormous benefits, while meanwhile the US falls dreadfully behind them in nearly every metric used to measure a societys success. How can this not be the top priority of every government in the world?",8,1,False,self,,,,,

Will the adoption of electric cars cause an increase in air travel. Pretty much anything more than 300km is out of range for a full car on a road trip. In North America regularly people drive 600km to visit family for a weekend and the additional waiting for a charge will push people to flying since the costs are equal to the train.

My other question is about maintenance. The average person buys a 2-3 year old used car and has a trusted mechanic to support that vehicle. If and when structural and electrical issues arise the average technician willl have no background to support all these new technologies and advancements. Basically a whole new breed of technicians will be required. This will take significant time to have adoption at least in North America. 

I think  a lot of government planning should be around the maintenance education to ensure the support network is there otherwise people will be even more hesitant since for a lot of people their car allows them to work.",6,1,False,self,,,,,

647,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2018-12-7,2018,12,7,15,a3x7bw,self.Futurology,"Comparing Nuclear, PV, Pumped Hydro and Lithium-ion storage for Sustainable Energy Generation Systems.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/a3x7bw/comparing_nuclear_pv_pumped_hydro_and_lithiumion/,LiveWithEarth,1544163343,"I wrote an algorithm to figure out how much solar power and how much battery energy storage is required to support the electric grid with 100% renewable energy. I found that there are many possible configurations between PV and storage by increasing the PV system beyond the minimum required size.

I recently modified the algorithm to analyze four distinct systems:

1. PV and Lithium-ion Storage
2. PV and Pumped Hydro Storage
3. Nuclear and Lithium-ion Storage
4. Nuclear and Pumped Hydro Storage

I used the algorithm to design these four SEGSs for Turlock Irrigation District (TID). TID is an electric utility that provides power to Turlock, CA and surrounding areas. TID has an annual consumption of about 2,000 GWh which is about 0.05% of the total US consumption. 

Here are the results: https://imgur.com/vKurSeg. Also here is a graph of the [power demand data of TID](https://imgur.com/vANPcsO) that was used.

Assumptions for Pumped Hydro:
* 75% round-trip efficiency
* no de-energization (self-discharge) effects

Assumptions for Lithium-ion storage:
* 88% initial round-trip efficiency
* 5% self-discharge losses per month
* energy storage degradation of 1% per year

Assumptions for Nuclear:
* power output is constant at rated capacity year round. 

From the graph, Nuclear, after a certain threshold of about 600MW, will not require storage. By comparing [the time-series power demand with the power output of a 600MW nuclear system](https://imgur.com/a/P92JO85), this results is reasonable since the power output is greater than the power demand most of the year. 

I also tried to compute the [cost of all the different configurations](https://imgur.com/5y2bnpG). I have not yet been able to verify if these results are reasonable. I was expecting all 4 graphs to show an inverse relationship, but PV+Pumped Hydro and Nuclear+Pumped Hydro show a linear relationship. 

My assumptions for the cost were: PVs cost $1.64 per watt installed which is the forecasted cost of PV for year 2025. Lithium-ion cost $160 per kWh which is also the forecasted cost for year 2025. Nuclear cost of $34 dollars per MWh which includes capital, operational and maintence cost. Pumped Hydro storage cost of 2.5 million dollars per MW installed.

As a plane careens into the cubes, the cubes break apart. Friction between the cubes and the plane's wheels ultimately slows the plane to a stop. The system can safely stop a Boeing 737 traveling at 65 miles per hour in fewer than 300 feet. If you enter the EMAS straight on and you don't miss off to the side and go right down the middle and steer forward and use your brakes it can slow the airplane down at a pretty good clip and not damage the airplane.

The 4-foot cubes are made of a concrete aggregate infused with a foaming agent, which creates air bubbles. The bubbles give the cubes a low density, which allows them to collapse on impact. The number of air bubbles can be adjusted to create different strengths depending on whether an airport caters to larger or smaller aircraft.

686,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2018-12-7,2018,12,7,23,a409qn,self.Futurology,"Comparing Nuclear, PV, Pumped Hydro and Lithium-ion storage for Sustainable Energy Generation Systems.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/a409qn/comparing_nuclear_pv_pumped_hydro_and_lithiumion/,LiveWithEarth,1544192235,"I wrote an algorithm to figure out how much solar power and how much battery energy storage is required to support the electric grid with 100% renewable energy. I found that there are many possible configurations between PV and storage by increasing the PV system beyond the minimum required size.

I recently modified the algorithm to analyze four distinct systems:

1. PV and Lithium-ion Storage
2. PV and Pumped Hydro Storage
3. Nuclear and Lithium-ion Storage
4. Nuclear and Pumped Hydro Storage

I used the algorithm to design these four SEGSs for Turlock Irrigation District (TID). TID is an electric utility that provides power to Turlock, CA and surrounding areas. TID has an annual consumption of about 2,000 GWh which is about 0.05% of the total US consumption. 

Here are the results: https://imgur.com/vKurSeg. Also here is a graph of the [power demand data of TID](https://imgur.com/vANPcsO) that was used.

Assumptions for Pumped Hydro:
* 75% round-trip efficiency
* no de-energization (self-discharge) effects

Assumptions for Lithium-ion storage:
* 88% initial round-trip efficiency
* 5% self-discharge losses per month
* energy storage degradation of 1% per year

Assumptions for Nuclear:
* power output is constant at rated capacity year round. 

From the graph, Nuclear, after a certain threshold of about 600MW, will not require storage. By comparing [the time-series power demand with the power output of a 600MW nuclear system](https://imgur.com/a/P92JO85), this results is reasonable since the power output is greater than the power demand most of the year. 

I also tried to compute the [cost of all the different configurations](https://imgur.com/5y2bnpG). I have not yet been able to verify if these results are reasonable. I was expecting all 4 graphs to show an inverse relationship, but PV+Pumped Hydro and Nuclear+Pumped Hydro show a linear relationship. 

My assumptions for the cost were: PVs cost $1.64 per watt installed which is the forecasted cost of PV for year 2025. Lithium-ion cost $160 per kWh which is also the forecasted cost for year 2025. Nuclear cost of $34 dollars per MWh which includes capital, operational and maintence cost. Pumped Hydro storage cost of 2.5 million dollars per MW installed.

Internet will change the way we know.

Big cable providers acted by not acting when the Net-Neutrality shifted in their favor. They used this opportunity to show nothing bad happened see. What people didnt understand was this was part of the plan. The Providers used this to stage a Trojan horse. Illustrating nothing changed all is well, no need to fight us. 

Once the opportunity had come and gone for saving the internet the hammer came down and the horse opened. First media providing services such as YouTube, Hulu, and Amazon. These businesses removed revenue from the once cable TV cash cow and the cable provider needed to punish them by limiting the bandwidth. To lift it the competitors had to pay the Providers on a 90/10 split, barely meeting costs to offer the service. In time all will end their streaming services, limited the customer to one a handful of choices.

With now full control over the media, they set their sights on what the people were allowed to see and do and for how long. Nickel and diming you for each internet action.  The filtering is so tight you cant see anything they dont want you too. 

&amp;#x200B;

To pepper some conspiracy theorist content, with this much power it enviably falls into the wrong hands favoring nominees in different political parties to take office and start wars and home and then across seas. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly do believe the internet will change and like anything else you will pay more for less. ",6,1,False,self,,,,,

I don't think humans of the future are going to own anything.  A list.

1. Cars: with self driving cars on the horizon, it's only a matter of time before the governments of the world make driving illegal.  Pretty soon, people will subscribe to a self driving car service that can take them anywhere they want to go.

2. Movies and Tv shows: to an extent this has already happened with streaming services like Netflix and hulu.  It's only a matter of time before they just do away with blue ray and DVDs.

3. Music: yet another entertainment service that will eventually end up only on the cloud.  As Spotify gets more advanced with their music streaming service it's only a matter of time before  your playlist is off your phone and online

4. Video games: Right now with digital downloads,  you still have a physical copy of your game that's on your console or PC, and you can redownload it anytime you want, which means you still own it.  Now what if I told you that Video game companies are investing in gaming streaming services where you pay a flat fee and stream all the games you want.  Sure, the technology may be still in it's infancy, but it's only a matter of time before it's everywhere including on your handheld.

With poverty and income inequality rising as pressing issues, it's only a matter of time before the government steps in and gives the populace over the age of 18 a living quarters.  With income inequality due to rise thanks to automation, its only a matter of time before the future house you live in is not owned by you.

The Fleet Management Software helps the user find the best mode and rate for any type of shipment to make sure that they are getting the best deal possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Transportation is a necessary part of any manufacturing business whether it is functioning in the local, national or international market. Looking at vital part of transportation, companies spend huge sums on it, often overlooking the opportunity to save shipping costs.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Mainly focused on quality and price of the product, most companies fail to determine optimal shipping procedures. Which is why companies outsource the very task of shipping to professionals or buy a software for the same. Now, what is the best way to get the shipping done at minimal pricing is the question that hovers over the minds of many.

&amp;#x200B;

[Logistics management software](http://sagarinfotech.com/Logistics-Management-Software.aspx) is a transportation software which offers integrated shipping solutions that are custom-made according to companys specific needs.

&amp;#x200B;

A single, integrated shipping solution can be devised for large companies with complicated shipping process and multiple assembly locations and warehouse needs, which will save significant time and money. For smaller companies that have simple shipping procedures, the software can be used to improve delivery time by studying factors such as road construction and highway traffic patterns.

&amp;#x200B;

Studies show that 10% of shipping costs can be saved by either hiring a 3rd party logistics provider or implementing logistics software. Though hiring a 3rd party logistics provider is a lot more expensive than implementing a logistics software.

&amp;#x200B;

We have listed crucial 4 reasons about why one should opt for Logistics Management Software instead of hiring 3rd party logistics.

&amp;#x200B;

Economical

Hiring a service provider providing end to end solution will cost almost equal to hiring an in-house logistics department. Instead one should opt for Logistics Management Software which provides logistics through a software as a service (SaaS) platform. Instead of relying on a costly comprehensive service provider one can save money and realize more control by using a software solution.

&amp;#x200B;

More Control

Usually, 3PL customers feel distanced from the shipping process and the managing entity. It is appealing for some shippers having the shipping process fully managed by another entity.Due to the underlying expense and vendor issues involved, most shippers wish to be involved in the process. Freight logistics software give them full control of the shipping process rather than just being involved in shipping process.

&amp;#x200B;

Better Options

Traditionally, 3PL providers make freight arrangements by listing an available load in an electronic posting system, where it can be matched with an available carrier, or by negotiating with carriers that dont use a posting system. Logistics software facilitates a better carrier option and makes several carrier options available. In some instances, a shipper misses the best carrier option because the carrier who could provide it will not work with the shippers 3PL.

&amp;#x200B;

Greater Security

None of the shipping processes is more secure than managing the shipper on its own. Instead of letting 3PL providers who may pick carrier according to their preferences and total disregard to customers requirements. When outsourcing to a 3PL, shippers naturally lose the capacity to scrutinize the carriers with which their loads are placed. Freight logistics software mitigates security concerns by putting you in control of the shipping process.

&amp;#x200B;

In SIPL, Logistics software is a viable replacement for 3PL, particularly for shippers who wish to control their own shipping process. Next to payroll, shipping is the second largest operating expense for most shippers. This means that strengthening a stale shipping process with better carrier options can have a notable impact on a companys bottom line  an impact that logistics software allows you to achieve.

Any ideas as to a solution?

So, Yuval Noah Harari thinks that everyone's jobs are going to be wiped out by AI and robots in the not-so-distant future. And I very much believe that the vast majority of jobs COULD be wiped out (from a technological perspective), however, I've come across a simple economic paradox which might get in the way of such a future ...

If the majority of jobs have been wiped out by AI and automation, the government would have to implement some kind of Universal Basic Income for all citizens - people need to eat, after all.

However, this means that the government wont be able to afford to (or have the inclination) to pay citizens above their basic threshold needs. And if people can only get what they need (as opposed to what they want), businesses of all kinds will begin to collapse. This will therefore cripple the economy  and undermine / wipe out the very growth opportunities that AI and scaled automation is supposed to bring.

i.e. The businesses who want to automate are in themselves dependent on the workers in the labour market being paid enough so that they will spend frivolously on consumer goods as they do today; without it, the economy would collapse. 

Can you come up with a solution to this paradox, if it even is one?",19,1,False,self,,,,,

Through my thinking I have come to the hypothesis of what I have dubbed ""species wide problems"". It basically entails that as technology advances we will create more and more problems that threaten humanity. The first species wide problem that came to mind is nuclear weapons. This is a problem that has the potential for causing mass extinction, and therefore needed to be taken care of on a global scale. The second species wide problem, what I was initially thinking about, is climate change. This also has the potential to affect humanity on a global scale and potentially cause extinction. I think that the rate at which we see these types of problems will increase, and could also be much more imminent than climate change. We have essentially seen two species wide problems develop in the last century, with no real example of one beforehand (at least that I can think of) that could cause the extinction of man. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a firm believer that if you want something done then you cannot just complain about it, but you have to come up with a solution for it. We have come up with several solutions for both nuclear weapons and climate change. Will they work? I can't answer that, but how will we  know if they are not implemented globally? The process which we have in place as of now to deal with these types of problems, namely the UN, seems slow and arduous and not guaranteed to come to a unified decision, like how the US and Russia and various other countries are against climate change. If the rate of these types of problems increases, I fear that this system will be too slow and too prone to countries' own agendas. What are some ways that are better or more efficient in handling species wide problems?  ",4,1,False,self,,,,,

Noel Gallacher of Oasis dying?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/a53hvn/if_ai_could_dream_what_would_it_dream_noel/,shaunomegane,1544502245,"Hi, this is my first post in this thread, but I've been an avid reader for the past six or so months.

I am a writer from the United Kingdom, my favourite Beatle was once Paul, but it is now John. I understand the difference been a Bee and Three, and I sometimes enjoy a latte with semi-skimmed milk. 

But of late, I've been having reoccurring dreams (sometimes nightmares) of technology - it is starting to plague my everyday thoughts and I can't stop thinking that Artificial Intelligence is literally starting to take over my life. For example - I woke from a dream the other night where I was playing guitar and writing a song (I'm currently building a guitar), and as I was writing and singing, a klaxon went off each and every time that I hit a bum note. The klaxon went off when I wrote a line that sounded like something from another song... the chords that I used were flagged when I created a riff that sounded like something I'd heard off of Youtube... It was insanity at its best. 

The dream finished with some kind of super-intelligence telling me that I sounded too much like David Gray and when I finished my song, it played my song, alongside 'Babylon' and broadcast both songs on a screen of sorts, and 'users' downvoted my song on the basis of what this superintelligence had claimed. 

It deleted the song from the platform and told me to start again. So I did... and then I awoke with the song in my head - riff, tune, lyrics and all. 

In the following night's dream, Noel Gallacher of Oasis was dead and when I went to his funeral, his head was frozen on ice and all his memories and songs were accessible via a screen over his face. It was cold to the touch and when I went to touch the screen, I got an infusion of gigs and tours whereby the song 'Hey Now' was played. I was then transported to a room where I was playing this exact song, to a room full of robot-looking people who didn't clap - they simply knocked on the table. 

It was frightful and got me thinking about one of the last bastions of where Artificial Intelligence could replicate - music. But I know that this is as much of a fallacy as the term 'Artificial Intelligence' itself. Of course machine learning could learn how to create a song from a massive database of uploaded content... it could extrapolate chords, lyrics and riffs from a whole host of sources, check that they are in tune and in beat, and then create a truly unoriginal original piece of music and pass it off as a creation.

I suppose this is how we as humans write our music - it is kind of like hacking. You take inspiration from people before you and wrap it around an element of your life and pass it off as your own. 

However, in the grand scheme of things, it is how we present it that differs us from a model of this kind of artificial music production. Artificial Intelligence couldn't warm a room of humans and interact with them to create an experience that would develop a mutual respect for performance and music.

Now I'm under the assumption that AI never sleeps - it doesn't need to. Not unless a system or host computer/server (forgive me, my terminology isn't that great) is turned off and the chips and microprocessors are discharged off electricity.

But what I'm thinking is... If a computer was turned off, and AI got a break, if it slept... in true blue-sky thinking, what would it dream of? Some would say 'AI can't dream' and that is true - but if it could, what would it dream? 

And with that metaphysical piece of imaginative thinking out of the way - I come to a question that someone might be able to answer - when AI is turned off (or a computer running an AI system), when it is turned back on, what are the first 'things' that it does? I mean, imagine if you were explaining it to a child or someone with no prior knowledge of IT, computers or algorithms... 

Every system has a POST (am I right here?), a series of checks and system procedures that enable it to function. But with AI, what would be its first steps in the 'boot up' procedure?

When I wake up, the first thing I try to do is to establish what time it is... secondly, I'll check to see if anyone has gotten in contact with me, then I will probably check on my dog... I will then use the toilet, brush my teeth and get the sleep out of my eyes whilst fixing my big head of hair. 

But how would that translate to AI for example?

As I say, just looking to discuss here, not trying to heavily argue or debate a specific topic as my knowledge on these matters is very limited. I am learning more and more as the days progress and getting to terms with some of the terminology and science behind AI. 

So please, forgive me if I do not use the correct terminology or if my diction is incorrect. It is 4 a.m here and I before someone else says it, 'I need to sleep more'.  ",2,1,False,self,,,,,

I am very happy to let you all know that today we launched Bitcoin integration. Any Ethereum-based project can now reach Bitcoin users via [Wanchains](https://wanchain.org) cross-chain mechanism. This might not seem like a big deal but the blockchain space won't really kickoff until interoperability is solved and we are one of few projects getting closer to solving it.

Also a reminder from the 1995s [https://thenextweb.com/shareables/2010/02/27/newsweek-1995-buy-books-newspapers-straight-intenet-uh/](https://thenextweb.com/shareables/2010/02/27/newsweek-1995-buy-books-newspapers-straight-intenet-uh/) and how they were (along with many others) wrong about the future of the internet.

**The future of finance will be built on blockchain. Power will be given back to the people who will form decentralized autonomous organizations to solve the biggest problems.**

This marks an essential milestone for IOTWs blockchain infrastructure that enables green, secure micro-mining through connecting IoT devices without extra hardware cost. In the TestNet, users can experiment by downloading its mobile wallet to connect virtual IoT devices and mine TestNet coins for purchasing goods on its decentralized marketplace.

The Founder and CEO of IOTW, Frederick Leung, commented on the TestNet launch, saying, Thanks to our tech team! I am very pleased that we have come to this stage and it is an extremely important step for our blockchain network infrastructure. Anyone who joins the TestNet can easily use our wallet to do micro-mining from the connected virtual IoT devices. People can get rewarded with mined Testnet coins. We will also run a Hackathon in some top universities in the world and other competitions. I am cordially inviting all of you to participate in our activities and provide useful feedback so that we can enhance our network. 

Meanwhile, Fred added, I would like emphasize that in our future Mainnet, it will require $0.50 cents of electricity to mine for every device annually, potentially revolutionizing the Internet of Things industry utilizing our proof of assignment (PoA) consensus algorithms. As our tech team are testing more real connected devices, there will be tens of thousands of IoT blockchain deployment in the coming years.

According to IOTW development blog posted on November 28th 2018, it has done a stress test by stimulating creations of 9,000 IoT Devices in the network, and it received no problem. It has reached 3,000 instant TPS (Transaction Per Second) on the average of two seconds without optimization, but it aims to reach up to 1 million TPS.

The IOTW Testnet aims to focus on validating the blockchain network, getting performance metrics, increasing the understanding of hardware needs for Mainnet which is set for March 2019, enhancing the understanding of potential security vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, it intends to gather user experience data of micro-mining from IoT device owners for further network improvement. Those who join the Testnet will be able to purchase the goods available on its marketplace with the Testnet coins, such as real IOTW tokens, IOTW T-shirts, lightbulb, stickers, and more.

About IOTW
IOTW (iotw.io) is owned by AnApp Blockchain Technologies Limited (AnApp), which is developing the IOTW cryptocurrency and blockchain software which can run on different IoT devices. The Micro Mining software can be embedded into different IoT chipsets and also downloaded into existing IoT devices through firmware update. IOTW has been selected out of 2,000 companies into 500 Startups Batch 24 Accelerator Program, where only 4 blockchain companies are accepted, with IOTW being one of them.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Today I'd say things are getting really bad in the US. The country has a huge debt, both on a national and personal level, yet American companies are also making huge profits, in part thanks to monopoly positions and a strong control over the government. Sectors include banking, finance, education, military...

&amp;#x200B;

Thomas Jefferson himself is quoted as saying The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. This suggests that in order for a population to be free, there must be a regular ""trimming"" of the political elite fat. Seeing as the US government has put its people in a perpetual state of debt, and leaders like Obama and Trump failed to make any promised changes, it is only logical for the American population to start over.",24,1,False,self,,,,,

Here are my results: https://imgur.com/TWWwBmm.

The y-axis is the amount of storage required, and the x-axis is the G2C (Generation-to-Consumption) ratio of the system. For example, a G2C of 1 means the annual expected generation is equal to the expected consumption. A G2C of 1.5 means the expected annual generation is 1.5 times greater than consumption, etc.. 

I ran to simulation 100 times (100%Solar &amp; 0%Wind, 99%Solar &amp; 1%Wind, 98%Solar &amp; 2%Wind, etc..) to design sustainable systems for Turlock Irrigation District (TID). TID is an electric utility that provides power to Turlock, CA and surrounding areas. TID has an annual consumption of about 2,000 GWh which is about 0.05% of the total US consumption. 

Here are the results of the costs: https://imgur.com/59haO1k and https://imgur.com/gcEJjdj. The most cost-effective configuration was 65% Solar and 35% wind. For viewing convenience, only the optimal system and the two extremes (100% Solar/Wind) were plotted on the first graph.

Wind speed data for the coast of California was obtained from NREL's [The Wind Prospector](https://maps.nrel.gov/wind-prospector/). Then, I used the [power-curve of a Vesta wind turbine \(V164-7.0MW\)](http://www.academia.edu/1489838/Wind_Turbine_Power_Curves) to determine the time-series power output. 

Solar output data was obtained from [PVWatts](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/).

Assumptions for Lithium-ion storage: * 88% initial round-trip efficiency * 5% self-discharge losses per month * energy storage degradation of 1% per year

My assumptions for the cost were: PVs cost $1.00 per watt installed. Lithium-ion cost $160 per kWh. Wind cost $1.5 million dollars per MW installed. 

These results are site-specific, so for other regions, optimal results may vary.

A colony of 'avatar robots' will replace astronauts and operate a long-term base on the MOON by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
1 point 1 month ago 




Russia, immediately post Soviet Union, went through an extraordinarily bad time. At some points in the last, nearly 30 years, it has been relegated to near irrelevancy. But in the last ten years, it has been noticeably ascending once more. Testing the waters with Gazprom control and that Ossetia and Crimea business. We would also do well to remember that Russia has by a slight edge the most nuclear weapons of anybody, in case any of you are too young to be familiar with the ""Cold War"".

Just like China has a different way of viewing humanity, so too does Russia. A sentiment that Czarina Alexandra pithily expressed when she said; "" Russia loves to feel the whip, it's their nature."" And this was demonstrated by their military organization as well. The higher echelon officers like generals and field marshals were ruthlessly purged to ensure loyalty through stark fear. The lower ranks to include lower ranking officers, under the rank of colonel I mean, had virtually no initiative training. They were trained to carry out the orders of the commanding officers to the letter, regardless of circumstances. The goal being that the lower ranking officers wouldn't get any uppity ideas. During the second world war, if an officer was killed--that unit was in big trouble. Nobody would know what to do. Not to mention NKVD political officers that accompanied the troops and shot anyone who wavered or was potentially mutinous. This included talk that was deviant of state ideology or the party line. This manner of military discipline continued through the entirety of the ""Cold War"" era. I don't know how much the military has changed after the fall of the Soviet Union. But I see signs that it is still much the same in ideology. It's not a good idea to be too smart for your own good.

And that is another reason that Russia is the way Russia is. Russia has always operated by people crudely, but effectively, bossing other people around. First with the royal government bossing around the actual 20th century serfs. People with technology and culture virtually unchanged from the middle ages. And then with the Soviets bossing around the ""Worker's Paradise"" serfs and now with this so-called presidency which is really a sort of ""oligarchy"" of powerful and cooperating rich people. I think today's Russia is the closest thing to a country governed by organized crime. If you cause trouble you get whacked. And they're real specific and pointed about it. They don't try to hide it like say, China (PRC). Back in the Soviet day, the person went to a ""psychiatric hospital"" and ""passed away"". Now they are assaulted by ""criminals unknown"" in broad daylight. But the Russian people love Putin and his government. Make no mistake. So it is a Russian way of thinking.

Well I said all that to make the point that it is time we recognize that Russia is a viable and potentially very dangerous player on the world stage once again. If they can have the capability and audacity to truly influence a USA presidential election. If they have the chutzpah to reach right over to England and poison former Soviet operatives to shut them up (and apparently be unconcerned with collateral damage)--then Russia is powerful.

Russia's ""Soviet"" style propaganda machine does not even try to hide it's intentions either. ""RT"" is proof of that. RT is meant to take a given countries flaws and exploit them to cause dissension, discord and instability in that country. I don't even know why they want to do that anymore. I think some Soviet habits just die hard. Whenever I see a RT video on Youtube, I'm like; ""tsk! Soviet, I mean Russian propaganda...""

Now Russia wants the same thing that the USA and China (PRC) want. A piece of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) pie. And not just ARA. I note with interest that Russia seems to be a hot bed for human longevity research money. At first I discounted this because I felt that Russia was, well, too low-life, shifty and technically backward to be able to do such things. But when I saw their bipedal robot a year or two back. I realized that Russia is back. In the scariest way you can imagine. Scatter minded and messily disorganized, but clumsily powerful. And they are quickly focusing again. Putin himself stated that the country that controls AI will control the world.

Oh and about their space program. As blocky and hamfisted as it is, it is undeniable proof that the Russians are dogged masters, bar none, of the spit and bailing wire ""workaround"" (acknowledging the miracle that was the USA's ""Apollo 13""). They are born brute force technicians. Sure, somebody occasionally falls right out of space to the ground. But that don't phase 'em. And when something like that does happen, they don't tend to advertise it. And right now the USA, and everybody else, I think, is using their workhorse ships to get people around in space. If the price is right, Russians can be pretty darn dependable.

If Russia says they can put a colony of robot avatars on the moon, which by the way I think is a brilliant idea, I don't doubt that they can. And, I bet, sooner than you think. The Russians are very good at persevering and pushing through. Just ask the Germans.

Steadily, as the years, not decades, go by, these robotic devices will come to handle more and more of the surgery autonomously. There is computing and learning AIs attached to some these robotics that collect information and simulate it. Human surgeons are not going anywhere for about ten years, but after that, well, I think it's gonna be a brave new world.

and, you are calling me pretentious?
 
What? I never called you, or implied that you are pretentious. What are you talking about? But let me ask you this since you appear to be a pretty major robotics expert...

What year do you think we will see a human modeled, bipedal robot with the biological form and grace of that animatronic in the first video, the face of the gal in the second video and the balance of the ""Sophia"" in the third video.

I put it at ten years, extrapolating from what I see today. (Exponential me: Four years)

Oh I have to address ""looking at you"". ""Sophia"" can localize and ""look"" at your face. That does not seem to be a difficult technology anymore. I also saw a technology that can literally look you in the eyes and follow your eyes, even if the devices head is moving. 

Here is the video of that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=way2NSgYM0Y

You saw that Atlas robot back-flip and parkour them crates. Yes, I am aware those actions were both carefully choreographed and that it failed the executions multiple times. But I think one day we shall see Atlas navigate a dynamic moving environment. What I want to see is a biological form bipedal human robot do that kind of thing. What year will we see that?

I say about 15 years from now. Is that too liberal a guess? These are not wild guesses. I think I'm pretty in the ballpark on these. (Exponential me: Six years)

I cannot over-emphasize that these technologies--none of them are in a vacuum. Multiple technologies are ever more rapidly converging now. All of it driven by our exponentially improving computing power. And the new ""post 2007"" narrow AI that it has empowered. I sort of put it like this in a self post if you are interested.

To Keep Pace With Moore's Law, Chipmakers Turn to 'Chiplets' by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]

Interesting point.


AMD tested its chiplet approach last year, with a server processor called Epyc made by bundling four chiplets. That helped AMDs chip offer more data bandwidth to memory and other components than competing server chips from Intel with more conventional designs, Papermaster says. His engineers estimate that making Epyc as a single, large chip would have almost doubled the manufacturing cost. On Tuesday in San Francisco, Papermaster announced a more powerful second-generation Epyc chip, a literal doubling down on the Lego-brick chiplet strategy. Its made with eight chiplets.

ARA (AI, robotics and automation) don't have to take everybody's jobs. Just enough vocations that it hits a critical threshold of unemployment that causes societal unrest.

A clever wag once said; ""The goal is 100% unemployment, the tricky part is that ten to ninety percent.""

USA citizens will start freaking if we go over 7%, because everybody knows what is happening now.

tl;dr: ""We don't know, but exponential handwave.""
 
I gotta take exception to that inaccurate statement.

I clearly stated the technologies that are brand spanking new compared to ten years ago. It is not difficult to imagine that every one of these technologies will advance in impressive ways in the next 5 years, but in the next ten years and on--they will evolve to be unimaginable. The exponentially improving computing power driving it all.

In fifty years it will be one of two things. 

External AI that is godlike in power.


The AI and computing will be inseparably joined with the human mind. The resulting hybrid will be godlike in power.


I don't see any other choices. I don't think we can retain our biology for even one hundred more years. And the computing/AI cat is not going back in that bag.

Mything the point: The AI renaissance is simply expensive hardware and PR thrown at an old idea by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
3 points 1 month ago 




I have had multiple discussions concerning just what is happening with the development of ""AI"" lately. The first thing I want to clear up is we should all be fully aware that there exists no ""I"" in ""AI"". That's just an illusory perception promulgated by humans easily impressed. ""AI"" today is nothing but computing power, speed and data capacity.

But.

I won't throw away the baby with the bathwater. This illusion of artificial intelligence is a real thing. And it may not matter in the end whether it is ""illusory artificial intelligence"" or actual real life, cogitating artificial intelligence.

There seems to be two schools of thought here. The first is the development of genuine ""thinking"" artificial intelligence. This is the AI that is embraced by the purists. It holds that current development of AI is no more intelligent than an insect, maybe even less.

The other philosophy is that generality of thinking might not matter. That brute force computing power and data capacity can force the perfect simulation of ""generalizing"".

In other words the one group thinks that AI should be able to think like a human brain. The other group thinks that the effects of thinking like a human brain can be simulated or achieved without actually functioning like a human brain.

I don't know if we are ever going to achieve AGI. But I know for a fact we are going to achieve the effects of AGI even if we never make AGI.

I read an article the other day that the biggest road block to AGI is that our current AI doesn't actually know what words or concepts or things are. But I would argue that just like we made objects that are nothing like birds or horses that our ""computing mind"" will be nothing like a human brain either. The jet has a sort of function of a bird and a car has a sort of function like a horse. Well I think the same thing holds for our development of AI. 

The AI may never have consciousness. (And God help us if it ever does) It may never know what things actually are. But we will continue to improve our computing power in ever increasing exponents of speed and capacity. And that will force the computing to know what things are by simple example. Sure it might take a billion examples compared to the two or three that humans need. But with that kind of computing power--so what? It is child's play for a computer to take in a billion examples of something. A birth of ""thinking"" utterly alien to biological neurology, particularly human cognition neurology. But just as effective. Probably way more effective.

One of the things I see is that every time we hit a wall in a practical application with our AI development since the year 2012, we manage to overcome the obstacle. And that's another thing. The universe changed in 2007 when Geoff Hinton placed a GPU into a CPU driven computer and he got the holy grail of AI development. Something he had been in a very lonely struggle with for nearly 20 years- a functional convolutional neural network.

And now since that day we are in an ever more powerful upward spiral of computing power that can do things once thought, well, simply impossible. No consciousness, no generalizing required.

Narrow AI in its many forms is becoming absolutely indispensable in our society today. Finance, medicine, corporations and the military to name but a few cannot function without the ""new"" narrow AI that began in 2007. Do you think the Chinese (PRC) think this AI business is a flash in the pan? Something unsustainable? 

Here is the future I see coming. The computing power will leap with the advent of the general quantum computer in about 2 more years. This leap will be astronomical in scale. When we apply the quantum computer to our AI development efforts it will be like replacing horse-feed with rocket fuel. At the same time we will have multiple functional exa-scale computers. Exa-scale. Think about that. Right now the most powerful computer on earth has roughly 200 petaflops of power. Exa-scale is 1000 or better petaflops of power. Just imagine what kind of things that kind of brute force can do. Oh also there are neural networks associated with that 200 petaflops computer, so you can be sure that whatever our exa-scale computer looks like it will have AI architecture built into it as well.

If you give a computer enough examples of an idea or thing it can apprehend ""meaning"" that is enough to do what we want it to do. I suspect the computer and it's resulting ""AGI"" will be no more like the human brain than the jet is like the bird. But we seem to very satisfied with our jets and cars.

Um as long as our ""new"" mind doesn't wipe us out...

Physicists name and codify new field in nanotechnology: 'electron quantum metamaterials' by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

A little earlier today I posted a self write-up about how we might go about transferring our minds to inorganic substrates. At the end of the write-up I noted that within days of my correspondence that my write up was based on, that I saw multiple articles that supported my contention that we are making important and continuous meaningful advancements in that direction even though it's still gonna take a while to move our minds.

But this article I just came across today is yet another breakthrough that is in line with my predictions for the ability to transfer our minds. I suspect these developments in the various salient technologies needed for mind transfer will occur with greater speed time going forward.

Utopian fiction could help us unlock the bright future we never imagined - We're drawn to narratives like Handmaid's Tale and Black Mirror. But they're not helping us create a better world. by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
12 points 1 month ago 




The trouble with ""Utopian"" fiction vs. ""Dystopian"" fiction is that ""Utopian"" fiction is boring to watch on TV. For each individual human of course, utopia rocks. But since utopia by definition does not have any discrete societal conflict, it would be super difficult to make a compelling series about it.

Most of the science fiction we have today tends to take a given issue in human society today and extrapolate it to what agendists would call it's logical conclusion, like ""Handmaid's Tale"". We have victimization in society today and this exaggerated fiction brings society's problems into better focus.

In fact most of this kind of dysptopian science fiction is about the human condition period. One of the points I often make about what the future is actually going to be like is that it's not going to be anything we have the brainpower to envision. Shows like ""Star Trek"", whatever it's iteration or movies like ""Star Wars"" are just us today with gee whiz special effects.

The future of what is today's humanity is going to be beyond anything we can imagine, little less fathom. When you don't have biology with biological imperatives or emotions with emotional imperatives, most screenplays sort of go out the window. Per our development today, the absence of conflict or problem is unhealthy for humans and causes our mental processes to atrophy. I'm not complaining just commenting. Personally I like utopia.

Utopia is simply going to ""happen"" despite the scary show and movie scenarios that make us invest emotion and intellect into their problems thereby making them ""interesting"" to watch.

A utopia is drama-less.

Old norms and institutions are being cast aside at breakneck speed, with no sign of abating. You only need to look back a few decades to see a Western society that is almost unrecognisable today.  
  
Traditional values such as the family and religion are fading. Women are no longer deferential to men. Even deep-seated norms like gender can no longer be counted upon. Celebrity has become cheap. The explosion of information via the internet has caused trust in political institutions to evaporate. The obsession is with individuality but people seem more insecure than ever. The world is so loud, with everybody fighting for everybody elses attention. People present their perfect lives on social media and yet loneliness is at epidemic levels.  
  
Sexuality has transformed. No longer are people inhibited. Porn is available to all, and much of it depicts sexual practices that would seem alien to those living only a few decades ago.  
  
It seems to me that the human race is more connected than ever. There is so much information available and that is a deeply destabilising thing. The rulers of the world, who used to make decisions in smoky back rooms are suddenly finding themselves scrutinised just like anybody else.  
  
Where does society go from here? Where do the chips fall? I feel like everything is up in the air and is not even close to settling on the table yet.

Calculations to follow-Corrections welcomed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/a730x5/can_we_produce_enough_electricity_to_transition/,sharptransient,1545075088,"I am not an engineer or scientist.  However, I was thinking about the USA capacity to produce electricity and what shifting away from fossil fuels would require.  After talking to a GM engineer who works on electric vehicles and reviewing the net I found the following:

&amp;#x200B;

In 2015 the US produced 4.03 trillion KWh of electricity from all sources

60% came from natural gas

In 2015 the US used 140 Billion gallons of gasoline and 35 Billion gallons of diesel

&amp;#x200B;

1 gallon of gas = 114,000 BTUs

1 gallon of diesel = 129,500 BTUs

1 Watt = 3.4 BTU hr

&amp;#x200B;

According to my contact at GM:

Gasoline internal combustion engine is about 40% efficient

Diesel engine is about 50% efficient

Electric vehicles are about 90% efficient

Electric vehicle recharging efficiency ?????

&amp;#x200B;

To convert gasoline energy to the equivalent in electricity I used:

(1 Watt.h/3.4BTUs)\*(1KWh/1000Wh)\*(114,000BTU/gallon of gas)\*(140,000,000,000 gallons of gas\*.4 efficiency)=1.88 trillion KWh

If electric vehicles are 90% efficient then we need an additional 2.08 trillion KWh/year to replace gasoline alone

&amp;#x200B;

Doing a similar conversion for diesel:

(1 Watt.h/3.4BTUs)\*(1KWh/1000Wh)\*(129500BTU/gallon of diesel)\*(35,000,000,000 gallons of diesel\*.5 efficiency) = .666 trillion KWh

&amp;#x200B;

Again, using the 90% efficiency for electric we get .74 trillion KWh

&amp;#x200B;

So the total is 2.08+.74= 2.82 trillion KWh/year of additional electricity to replace gasoline and diesel. This doesn't include efficiency losses for recharging the batteries.

&amp;#x200B;

You engineers, physicists and energy experts please weigh in.

Are my numbers off?

How do we get the infrastructure and production capacity to meet this demand? 

Also keep in mind that 60% of the USA's current electricity production comes from natural gas.

I'm curious what others think about this idea....

Hello all,

My focus since 1992 has been customizing education (e.g., for AI). Links to praise I received in 1998 and 2004:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-02-13/one-more-thing-on-43-things](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-02-13/one-more-thing-on-43-things) ([cached](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3AAzl9aFN9dWMJ%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2005-02-13%2Fone-more-thing-on-43-things+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;fbclid=IwAR13kRWS4IIrKTctQRqRPT0DGLe3s_ZYwE90aPHqX61MAVaMEYoOkMrl3oM) by Google)

[http://blogmaverick.com/2005/01/31/grokster-and-the-financial-future-of-america/#comment-7049](http://blogmaverick.com/2005/01/31/grokster-and-the-financial-future-of-america/#comment-7049)

Said threat is taking shape at the intersection of 1) the [burgeoning sciences of human reproduction](https://www.amazon.com/End-Sex-Future-Human-Reproduction/dp/0674728963/) (e.g., molecular genetics for identifying markers of [psychopathy](https://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Violence-Biological-Roots-Crime/dp/0307475611) and other traits that are highly heritable), 2) [superstar-biased](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/yes-robots-are-coming-for-our-jobs-now-what/) technological change, 3) the ongoing build-out of [human-capital](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/HumanCapital.html) markets (e.g., customized education) and complements (e.g., [gamete markets](https://www.amazon.com/Sex-Cells-Medical-Market-Sperm/dp/0520270967)). Details about the threat are below.

I identified the threat in 2016. In particular, I recognized that Im one of the people most endangered by it. So my focus since 2016 has been updating my work to yield an ideal [front company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_organization#Intelligence_agencies) for gathering [(anticipatory) intelligence](https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/about-iarpa/anticipatory-intelligence) about the threat. The planned company could benefit police officers most, because, according to a study cited in a 2011 [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4059069/), more than 50% of all police officers killed in the line of duty are killed by psychopaths. Other top beneficiaries would include human-capital professionals, reproduction-science pros and people whose gametes are top-quality. The largest group of beneficiaries would be prospective buyers of top gametes (e.g., you and/or your children a/o your grandchildren).

The ideal source of funding for said company is the U.S. governments [Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity](https://www.iarpa.gov/) (IARPA). From a January 2016 [article](https://www.c4isrnet.com/it-networks/2016/01/15/iarpa-looks-for-new-ground-to-cover/) (my emphases):

\[IARPA\] is in the business of the cutting edge**seeking solutions for problems that dont even necessarily yet exist**. Thats the goal of programs like IARPAs Office of Anticipating Surprise, where the **agency looks to develop anticipatory intelligence** that can predict things like disease outbreaks, political unrest and elections results.

. . . Now IARPA is looking to go beyond its current projects, **asking industry and the public for ideas** that even IARPA officials may not have considered.

GROWING this Facebook group, then, could be an ideal way to motivate IARPA.

Details about the threat follow, starting with excerpts from my submission to Wikileaks (submitted via Web form, so no links and no formatted text). Many more details are in the documents that are 1) referenced below, 2) accessible via the Files link in the left margin of this groups home page.

**\[Wikileaks form:\] Which organisations, groups or individuals are involved in this material?**

Organizations: Berkshire Hathaway Specialty (BHS), some U.S. government agencies (e.g., IARPA, DIUx).

**Which organisations, groups or individuals would officially have access to this material?**

I submitted the attached slide deck to said organizations. Subsequently, DIUx requested a one-pager (attached) and I discussed the deck with BHS-ers via 2 or 3 conference calls.

**Necessary publication time-frame:**

within two weeks \[selected from a drop-down menu\]

**When was the material created?**

My threat analysis was conducted in 2016. (Said slide deck has been updated a bit since then.)

**Any further information or instructions to Wikileaks staff for handling and publishing of this material.**

Many people could benefit enormously if Wikileaks raises awareness of said threat analysis without revealing any particulars about my work on said front company. Prominent among the potential beneficiaries: all police officers who arent psychopaths, all politicians who arent psychos, all journalists who dont want to be Khashoggi-ed. (The attached documents dont include up-to-date information re: the front company. Much of this information is online at OrgyforFree.com.)

\-- Re: it would be predictable if my analysis hasnt been acted on by any of said government agencies --

From 2017 book Warnings: How to Find Cassandras and Stop Catastrophes, co-authored by a former U.S. National Coordinator for Security and Counter-Terrorism:

In many instances, however, it seemed that an expert or expert group, a Cassandra, had accurately predicted what would happen. They were often ignored . . .

. . . We began to realize that to successfully navigate a Cassandra Event, an organization or society must move through several stages. First we must hear the forecast, then believe it, and finally act upon it. . . . In particular, the ability to get it right is exceedingly rare when the prediction varies substantially from the norm, from the past, from our experience, or from our deeply held beliefs about the way the future should unfold. Add a significant financial cost as a requirement of acting on such a warning, and the probability for action often approaches zero.

. . . INITIAL OCCURRENCE SYNDROME: In many cases, the event foretold has never happened before, at least not in the cultural memory of the audience, who will therefore resist taking the threat seriously. In our estimation, no obstacle to action is bigger than Initial Occurrence Syndrome.

. . . DIFFUSION OF RESPONSIBILITY: Often it is not clear whose job it is to detect the warning, evaluate it, and decide to act. The President of the United States or the CEO of a corporation might be the person who could order action, but there may not be a general understanding of who should take the issue to them. Who owns it? Frequently, no one wants to own an issue thats about to become a disaster. This reluctance creates a bystander effect, wherein observers of the problem feel no responsibility to act. Increasingly, complex issues are multidisciplinary, making it unclear where the responsibility lies. New complex problems or issues on the seams are more likely to produce ambiguity about who is in charge of dealing with them. This phenomenon is especially true when Initial Occurrence Syndrome is involved. After an event has happened for the first time, the system will decide who gets to deal with this kind of thing in the future, but if it has never happened before, it may not be readily apparent who should be evaluating the multidimensional warning.

AGENDA INERTIA: Most organizations and their leadership have an agenda to which they are devotedly attached. Such groups are subject to Agenda Inertia, a force that concentrates focus on issues already in the plan. Unanticipated threats, ones that the leadership didnt see coming and doesnt really want to deal with, tend to have a difficult time crowding out preconceived agenda items. Dealing with the unforeseen may take resources away from the leaderships Pet Rock. It will certainly take away leaderships rarest commodity, time. **Warnings that have this potential to steal resources from less threatening projects tend to encounter institutional reluctance to tackle the issue** \[my emphasis\]. Audiences who react by rejecting an issue for these reasons tend to be the kind of decision makers who help to create Cassandra Events.

\-- End of excerpt from Warnings --

\-- Re: my selection above of within two weeks --

I submitted my threat analysis to government agencies in 2016. Worst case, the agencies neglect re: preventing/subduing said threat is less than benign (e.g., via my submissions, the threat has been increasing since 2016). So motivating politicians to motivate said agencies ASAP . . . so raising public awareness ASAP . . .

\-- End of excerpts from my submission to Wikileaks --

**From said one-pager**

From 2016 book [*The Gene: An Intimate History*](https://www.amazon.com/Gene-Intimate-History-Siddhartha-Mukherjee-ebook/dp/B017I25DCC), by a Pulitzer Prize recipient:

As the political theorist Desmond King puts it, One way or another, we are all going to be dragged into the regime of gene management that will, in essence, be **eugenic. . . . Genetic change will be managed by the invisible hand of individual choice** \[my emphasis\], but the overall result will be the same \[as government-run eugenics\] . . .

. . . Worst case: Wealthy VIPs \[i.e., very intelligent psychopaths\] are already organizing to resist/shape this future.

Hello all,

My focus since 1992 has been customizing education (e.g., for AI). Links to praise I received in 1998 and 2004:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-02-13/one-more-thing-on-43-things](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-02-13/one-more-thing-on-43-things) ([cached](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3AAzl9aFN9dWMJ%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2005-02-13%2Fone-more-thing-on-43-things+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;fbclid=IwAR13kRWS4IIrKTctQRqRPT0DGLe3s_ZYwE90aPHqX61MAVaMEYoOkMrl3oM) by Google)

Said threat is taking shape at the intersection of 1) the burgeoning sciences of human reproduction (e.g., molecular genetics for identifying markers of psychopathy and other traits that are highly heritable), 2) [superstar-biased](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/yes-robots-are-coming-for-our-jobs-now-what/) technological change, 3) the ongoing build-out of [human-capital](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/HumanCapital.html) markets (e.g., customized education) and complements (e.g., gamete markets). Details about the threat are below.

I identified the threat in 2016. In particular, I recognized that Im one of the people most endangered by it. So my focus since 2016 has been updating my work to yield an ideal [front company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_organization#Intelligence_agencies) for gathering [(anticipatory) intelligence](https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/about-iarpa/anticipatory-intelligence) about the threat. The planned company could benefit police officers most, because, according to a study cited in a 2011 [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4059069/), more than 50% of all police officers killed in the line of duty are killed by psychopaths. Other top beneficiaries would include human-capital professionals, reproduction-science pros and people whose gametes are top-quality. The largest group of beneficiaries would be prospective buyers of top gametes (e.g., you and/or your children a/o your grandchildren).

The ideal source of funding for said company is the U.S. governments [Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity](https://www.iarpa.gov/) (IARPA). From a January 2016 [article](https://www.c4isrnet.com/it-networks/2016/01/15/iarpa-looks-for-new-ground-to-cover/) (my emphases):

\[IARPA\] is in the business of the cutting edge**seeking solutions for problems that dont even necessarily yet exist**. Thats the goal of programs like IARPAs Office of Anticipating Surprise, where the **agency looks to develop anticipatory intelligence** that can predict things like disease outbreaks, political unrest and elections results.

. . . Now IARPA is looking to go beyond its current projects, **asking industry and the public for ideas** that even IARPA officials may not have considered.

GROWING this Facebook group, then, could be an ideal way to motivate IARPA.

Details about the threat follow, starting with excerpts from my submission to Wikileaks (submitted via Web form, so no links and no formatted text). Many more details are in the documents that are 1) referenced below, 2) accessible via the Files link in the left margin of this groups home page.

**\[Wikileaks form:\] Which organisations, groups or individuals are involved in this material?**

Organizations: Berkshire Hathaway Specialty (BHS), some U.S. government agencies (e.g., IARPA, DIUx).

**Which organisations, groups or individuals would officially have access to this material?**

I submitted the attached slide deck to said organizations. Subsequently, DIUx requested a one-pager (attached) and I discussed the deck with BHS-ers via 2 or 3 conference calls.

**Necessary publication time-frame:**

within two weeks \[selected from a drop-down menu\]

**When was the material created?**

My threat analysis was conducted in 2016. (Said slide deck has been updated a bit since then.)

**Any further information or instructions to Wikileaks staff for handling and publishing of this material.**

Many people could benefit enormously if Wikileaks raises awareness of said threat analysis without revealing any particulars about my work on said front company. Prominent among the potential beneficiaries: all police officers who arent psychopaths, all politicians who arent psychos, all journalists who dont want to be Khashoggi-ed. (The attached documents dont include up-to-date information re: the front company. Much of this information is online at OrgyforFree.com.)

\-- Re: it would be predictable if my analysis hasnt been acted on by any of said government agencies --

From 2017 book Warnings: How to Find Cassandras and Stop Catastrophes, co-authored by a former U.S. National Coordinator for Security and Counter-Terrorism:

In many instances, however, it seemed that an expert or expert group, a Cassandra, had accurately predicted what would happen. They were often ignored . . .

. . . We began to realize that to successfully navigate a Cassandra Event, an organization or society must move through several stages. First we must hear the forecast, then believe it, and finally act upon it. . . . In particular, the ability to get it right is exceedingly rare when the prediction varies substantially from the norm, from the past, from our experience, or from our deeply held beliefs about the way the future should unfold. Add a significant financial cost as a requirement of acting on such a warning, and the probability for action often approaches zero.

. . . INITIAL OCCURRENCE SYNDROME: In many cases, the event foretold has never happened before, at least not in the cultural memory of the audience, who will therefore resist taking the threat seriously. In our estimation, no obstacle to action is bigger than Initial Occurrence Syndrome.

. . . DIFFUSION OF RESPONSIBILITY: Often it is not clear whose job it is to detect the warning, evaluate it, and decide to act. The President of the United States or the CEO of a corporation might be the person who could order action, but there may not be a general understanding of who should take the issue to them. Who owns it? Frequently, no one wants to own an issue thats about to become a disaster. This reluctance creates a bystander effect, wherein observers of the problem feel no responsibility to act. Increasingly, complex issues are multidisciplinary, making it unclear where the responsibility lies. New complex problems or issues on the seams are more likely to produce ambiguity about who is in charge of dealing with them. This phenomenon is especially true when Initial Occurrence Syndrome is involved. After an event has happened for the first time, the system will decide who gets to deal with this kind of thing in the future, but if it has never happened before, it may not be readily apparent who should be evaluating the multidimensional warning.

AGENDA INERTIA: Most organizations and their leadership have an agenda to which they are devotedly attached. Such groups are subject to Agenda Inertia, a force that concentrates focus on issues already in the plan. Unanticipated threats, ones that the leadership didnt see coming and doesnt really want to deal with, tend to have a difficult time crowding out preconceived agenda items. Dealing with the unforeseen may take resources away from the leaderships Pet Rock. It will certainly take away leaderships rarest commodity, time. **Warnings that have this potential to steal resources from less threatening projects tend to encounter institutional reluctance to tackle the issue** \[my emphasis\]. Audiences who react by rejecting an issue for these reasons tend to be the kind of decision makers who help to create Cassandra Events.

\-- End of excerpt from Warnings --

\-- Re: my selection above of within two weeks --

I submitted my threat analysis to government agencies in 2016. Worst case, the agencies neglect re: preventing/subduing said threat is less than benign (e.g., via my submissions, the threat has been increasing since 2016). So motivating politicians to motivate said agencies ASAP . . . so raising public awareness ASAP . . .

**From said one-pager**

From 2016 book *The Gene: An Intimate History*, by a Pulitzer Prize recipient:

As the political theorist Desmond King puts it, One way or another, we are all going to be dragged into the regime of gene management that will, in essence, be **eugenic. . . . Genetic change will be managed by the invisible hand of individual choice** \[my emphasis\], but the overall result will be the same \[as government-run eugenics\] . . .

Hello all,

My focus since 1992 has been customizing education (e.g., for AI). Links to praise I received in 1998 and 2004:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-02-13/one-more-thing-on-43-things](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-02-13/one-more-thing-on-43-things) ([cached](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3AAzl9aFN9dWMJ%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2005-02-13%2Fone-more-thing-on-43-things+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;fbclid=IwAR13kRWS4IIrKTctQRqRPT0DGLe3s_ZYwE90aPHqX61MAVaMEYoOkMrl3oM) by Google)

[http://blogmaverick.com/2005/01/31/grokster-and-the-financial-future-of-america/#comment-7049](http://blogmaverick.com/2005/01/31/grokster-and-the-financial-future-of-america/#comment-7049)

Said threat is taking shape at the intersection of 1) the burgeoning sciences of human reproduction (e.g., molecular genetics for identifying markers of psychopathy and other traits that are highly heritable), 2) [superstar-biased](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/yes-robots-are-coming-for-our-jobs-now-what/) technological change, 3) the ongoing build-out of [human-capital](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/HumanCapital.html) markets (e.g., customized education) and complements (e.g., gamete markets). Details about the threat are below.

I identified the threat in 2016. In particular, I recognized that Im one of the people most endangered by it. So my focus since 2016 has been updating my work to yield an ideal [front company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_organization#Intelligence_agencies) for gathering [(anticipatory) intelligence](https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/about-iarpa/anticipatory-intelligence) about the threat. The planned company could benefit police officers most, because, according to a study cited in a 2011 [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4059069/), more than 50% of all police officers killed in the line of duty are killed by psychopaths. Other top beneficiaries would include human-capital professionals, reproduction-science pros and people whose gametes are top-quality. The largest group of beneficiaries would be prospective buyers of top gametes (e.g., you and/or your children a/o your grandchildren).

The ideal source of funding for said company is the U.S. governments [Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity](https://www.iarpa.gov/) (IARPA). From a January 2016 [article](https://www.c4isrnet.com/it-networks/2016/01/15/iarpa-looks-for-new-ground-to-cover/) (my emphases):

\[IARPA\] is in the business of the cutting edge**seeking solutions for problems that dont even necessarily yet exist**. Thats the goal of programs like IARPAs Office of Anticipating Surprise, where the **agency looks to develop anticipatory intelligence** that can predict things like disease outbreaks, political unrest and elections results.

. . . Now IARPA is looking to go beyond its current projects, **asking industry and the public for ideas** that even IARPA officials may not have considered.

GROWING this Facebook group, then, could be an ideal way to motivate IARPA.

Details about the threat follow, starting with excerpts from my submission to Wikileaks (submitted via Web form, so no links and no formatted text). Many more details are in the documents that are 1) referenced below, 2) accessible via the Files link in the left margin of this groups home page.

**\[Wikileaks form:\] Which organisations, groups or individuals are involved in this material?**

Organizations: Berkshire Hathaway Specialty (BHS), some U.S. government agencies (e.g., IARPA, DIUx).

**Which organisations, groups or individuals would officially have access to this material?**

I submitted the attached slide deck to said organizations. Subsequently, DIUx requested a one-pager (attached) and I discussed the deck with BHS-ers via 2 or 3 conference calls.

**Necessary publication time-frame:**

within two weeks \[selected from a drop-down menu\]

**When was the material created?**

My threat analysis was conducted in 2016. (Said slide deck has been updated a bit since then.)

**Any further information or instructions to Wikileaks staff for handling and publishing of this material.**

Many people could benefit enormously if Wikileaks raises awareness of said threat analysis without revealing any particulars about my work on said front company. Prominent among the potential beneficiaries: all police officers who arent psychopaths, all politicians who arent psychos, all journalists who dont want to be Khashoggi-ed. (The attached documents dont include up-to-date information re: the front company. Much of this information is online at OrgyforFree.com.)

\-- Re: it would be predictable if my analysis hasnt been acted on by any of said government agencies --

From 2017 book Warnings: How to Find Cassandras and Stop Catastrophes, co-authored by a former U.S. National Coordinator for Security and Counter-Terrorism:

In many instances, however, it seemed that an expert or expert group, a Cassandra, had accurately predicted what would happen. They were often ignored . . .

. . . We began to realize that to successfully navigate a Cassandra Event, an organization or society must move through several stages. First we must hear the forecast, then believe it, and finally act upon it. . . . In particular, the ability to get it right is exceedingly rare when the prediction varies substantially from the norm, from the past, from our experience, or from our deeply held beliefs about the way the future should unfold. Add a significant financial cost as a requirement of acting on such a warning, and the probability for action often approaches zero.

. . . INITIAL OCCURRENCE SYNDROME: In many cases, the event foretold has never happened before, at least not in the cultural memory of the audience, who will therefore resist taking the threat seriously. In our estimation, no obstacle to action is bigger than Initial Occurrence Syndrome.

. . . DIFFUSION OF RESPONSIBILITY: Often it is not clear whose job it is to detect the warning, evaluate it, and decide to act. The President of the United States or the CEO of a corporation might be the person who could order action, but there may not be a general understanding of who should take the issue to them. Who owns it? Frequently, no one wants to own an issue thats about to become a disaster. This reluctance creates a bystander effect, wherein observers of the problem feel no responsibility to act. Increasingly, complex issues are multidisciplinary, making it unclear where the responsibility lies. New complex problems or issues on the seams are more likely to produce ambiguity about who is in charge of dealing with them. This phenomenon is especially true when Initial Occurrence Syndrome is involved. After an event has happened for the first time, the system will decide who gets to deal with this kind of thing in the future, but if it has never happened before, it may not be readily apparent who should be evaluating the multidimensional warning.

AGENDA INERTIA: Most organizations and their leadership have an agenda to which they are devotedly attached. Such groups are subject to Agenda Inertia, a force that concentrates focus on issues already in the plan. Unanticipated threats, ones that the leadership didnt see coming and doesnt really want to deal with, tend to have a difficult time crowding out preconceived agenda items. Dealing with the unforeseen may take resources away from the leaderships Pet Rock. It will certainly take away leaderships rarest commodity, time. **Warnings that have this potential to steal resources from less threatening projects tend to encounter institutional reluctance to tackle the issue** \[my emphasis\]. Audiences who react by rejecting an issue for these reasons tend to be the kind of decision makers who help to create Cassandra Events.

\-- End of excerpt from Warnings --

\-- Re: my selection above of within two weeks --

I submitted my threat analysis to government agencies in 2016. Worst case, the agencies neglect re: preventing/subduing said threat is less than benign (e.g., via my submissions, the threat has been increasing since 2016). So motivating politicians to motivate said agencies ASAP . . . so raising public awareness ASAP . . .

\-- End of excerpts from my submission to Wikileaks --

**From said one-pager**

From 2016 book *The Gene: An Intimate History*, by a Pulitzer Prize recipient:

As the political theorist Desmond King puts it, One way or another, we are all going to be dragged into the regime of gene management that will, in essence, be **eugenic. . . . Genetic change will be managed by the invisible hand of individual choice** \[my emphasis\], but the overall result will be the same \[as government-run eugenics\] . . .

. . . Worst case: Wealthy VIPs \[i.e., very intelligent psychopaths\] are already organizing to resist/shape this future.

**Re: Worst case: Wealthy VIPs . . .**

Details below.

**From said slide deck**

*Re: psychopathy is substantially heritable*

From 2011 book *The Science of Evil*, by a University of Cambridge professor of developmental psychopathology:

\[\]If a trait or behavior is even partly genetic, we should see its signature showing up in twins.

. . . Regarding twin studies of Type P \[i.e., psychopaths\], none of these show 100 percent heritability, but the genetic component is nevertheless substantial (the largest estimate being about 70 percent).\[\]

*Re: many/most/all genetic markers for psychopathy will be identified soon (2 slides)*

From 2013 book *The Anatomy of Violence: The Biological Roots of Crime*, by a University of Pennsylvania professor of Criminology, Psychiatry and Psychology:

Behavioral genetics is a shadowy black box because, while it tells us what proportion of a given behavior is genetically influenced, it does not identify the specific genes lurking in there that predispose one to violence. Molecular genetics is poised to pry open that black box . . .

Twenty years ago, molecular genetics was a fledgling field of research. Now it is a major enterprise providing us with a detailed look at the structure and function of genes.

The essence of the molecular genetic research we have been touching on aboveidentifying specific genes that predispose individuals to crimeis that genes code for neurotransmitter functioning. Neurotransmitters are brain chemicals essential to brain functioning. There are more than a hundred of them and they help to transmit signals from one brain cell to another to communicate information. Change the level of these neurotransmitters, and you change cognition, emotion, and behavior.

. . . Its 2034 . . . \[A\]ll males in society aged eighteen and over have to register at their local hospital for a quick brain scan and DNA testing. One simple finger prick for one drop of blood that takes ten seconds. Then a five-minute brain scan for the Fundamental Five Functions: First, a structural scan provides the brains anatomy. Second, a functional scan shows resting brain activity. Third, enhanced diffusion-tensor imaging is taken to assess the integrity of the white-fiber system in the brain, assessing intricate brain connectivity. Fourth is a reading of the brains neurochemistry that has been developed from magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Fifth and finally, the cellular functional scan assesses expression of 23,000 different genes at the cellular level. The computerization of all medical, school, psychological, census, and neighborhood data makes it easy to combine these traditional risk variables alongside the vast amount of DNA and brain data to form an all-encompassing biosocial data set.

. . . Fourth-generation machine-learning techniques looked for complex patterns of linear and nonlinear relationships . . .

\-- End of excerpt from slide deck --

**Re: psychopaths who are wealthy and very intelligent could be organizing already**

From *The Anatomy of Violence* (my emphases):

Its 2034 . . . The economic cost of crime is now astronomical. Back in 2010, the cost of homicide in the United States was estimated at over $300 billionmore than the combined budgets of the Departments of Education, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor, and Homeland Security. Way back in 1999, it was estimated to consume 11.9 percent of GDP, but in 2034 it is gobbling up 21.8 percent.

. . . \[This\] leads the government to launch the LOMBROSO programLegal Offensive on Murder: Brain Research Operation for the Screening of Offenders.

. . . Under LOMBROSO, all males in society aged eighteen and over have to register at their local hospital for a quick brain scan and DNA testing.

. . . Fourth-generation machine-learning techniques looked for complex patterns of linear and nonlinear relationships . . .

. . . The result is not perfect prediction, but it is pretty darn goodgood enough for an outraged society. Those tagged as LP-V (Lombroso PositiveViolence) as a group have a 79 percent chance of committing a serious violent offense within the next five years. Those classified as LP-S (Lombroso PositiveSex) have an 82 percent chance of committing either rape or pedophilic offenses. Finally, those classified as LP-H (Lombroso PositiveHomicide) have a 51 percent chance of killing someone in the next five years. Some have dual designations.

The program works like this: **those who test positivethe LPsare held in indefinite detention**. . . . LPs are given the legal right to challenge the findings and be retested by an independent authority. The detention centers are highly secure, but are not the harsh holding bays of decades gone by. They are equipped as a home away from home. Conjugal visits are allowed on weekends, albeit under surveillance that is a bit too close for comfort for the partners concerned. There are full recreational and educational services. They are allowed to vote. The LPs have full communication access to their family and even friendsafter appropriate security checks on those concerned. It sounds quite cushy, but **remember that the LPs have not actually committed a crime**. Perhaps the main drawback is who they live with, housed as they are in facilities full of other LPstime bombs waiting to explode.

Every LP is reassessed every year, as the changes brought about by the detention environment and treatment can bring about significant epigenetic change and hence a change in their LP status. They can be downgraded to tagged probation where they will be back in the community and kept under continuous auditory and visual scrutiny.

**All told**

It seems (very) likely that non-psychos and psychos are on a collision course, much the way the [human community is on a collision course with its environment](https://citizenactionmonitor.wordpress.com/2018/03/11/humans-on-collision-course-with-natural-world-warn-20000-scientists/) (i.e., with the earths [carrying capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity)).

**From the Happy-Ending Department**

If IARPA is motivated to act (VERY) soon . . .

From an [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/) in the January 2019 issue of *The Atlantic*:

The moment the president declares a national emergencya decision that is entirely within his discretionmore than 100 special provisions become available to him. . . . For instance, the president can, with the flick of his pen, activate laws allowing him to . . . freeze Americans bank accounts.

\[W\]hat if a president, backed into a corner and facing electoral defeat or impeachment, were to declare an emergency for the sake of holding on to power?

In the 70's, a Japanese dude (now in his 90's) realized that Japan's forests had serious weaknesses.  *Like being extra flammable.*

Fyi, the lumber industry prefers conifers, which are extra flammable.  And of course, they prefer monoculture... (must stay calm).

Anyway, the Japanese dude figured out way to grow forests that were not only more fire-resistant but also grew a lot faster (10x faster) than monoculture plantations.  Luckily for Japan, some of their big corps. really wanted forests in their factory lots, so much so that one of them contacted Miyawaki after their first attempt (probably monoculture-style) failed miserably.

Miyawaki didn't let them down, *and my guess is that word spread through the environmental departments of various corporations*, cause corporations kept on hiring him to make forests for them.

Over on the Western-front though... monoculture.  *Anyway*, it took an Indian industrial engineer to get Westerners trying the Miyawaki method a bit more, probably cause he made [an English website and kept on posting before and after photos of how fast their forests grew] (https://www.afforestt.com/results).  

OK, stay calm, me.  Let's not blame the Japanese for not online advertising more to the English-speaking public.  Please pardon the bit of frustration there.  It took me today like 2 hours for me to finally find an up-to-date picture of the most famous original Miyawaki forest.  *Had to use Google Maps.*

Now, I really like Afforestt a lot, ok?  I stalk their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

[Look at this tweet of tree awesome!] (https://twitter.com/shubzsharma/status/1055278257560465408)

It is just that their forests are decades younger than the ""original"" Miyawaki forests, pics of which are a lot harder to find on the English internet.  Fyi, the Japanese have been making a Great Tsunami Forest Wall for those areas that got hit by that 2011 tsunami.  See:

I bet you want to see before and after pictures of -that-, don'cha?  Me too...  Maybe you can help me hunt for them, cause even though I found the project's official website, they prefer to update about planting sessions.  So far, I've only found two updates with ""after"" pictures on their website.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is considered by many to be the next step in the advancement of humanitys technology. The idea of AI possibly taking over certain areas of the job market has already spawned fierce discussion over the potential consequences of introducing such a impactful entity. I question, however, the possibility of AI finding a place in the instrumental music industry.
	AI could not replace a musician in an orchestra, band, or any music ensemble because it would not be doing the music or the composers justice. This instrumental music was composed so that it could be performed by humans. After all, the goal of music is that it is supposed to have an effect on the human listener. This is the only reason why we have created, and will keep on making, music. It is not just there for the sake of it, rather, it is there to play with the human emotion. 
	The main reason why I believe no AI can be a competent musician stems from what it takes to be a good musician. To be a musician, one must be able to fuse their creativity and emotion into the music while at the same time respect the type of style of the music. An example of this is in the opera Don Pasquale. There is a trumpet solo which tries to resemble the troubled fate of an old man, Ernesto. After he witnesses his bride-to-bes true likeness, which is full of greed and jealousy, he expresses his sorrows out to the audience. The trumpet solo is full of contrasting emotions like sadness, hope, anger, and longing which at the same time has a sense of vulnerability. No AI could ever fuse this much emotion into one phrase and at the the same time play along with other musicians.
	Just like not having the ability to have complex emotions, AI also has another limit in its programming. Musicians have to adjust their playing all the time in order for their sound to match the sound of the ensemble. These adjustments may seem insignificant but in the professional world, they are mandatory. A musician can adjust their pitch if they need to play in tune with the ensemble. Something that most people don't know is that your first priority is playing with the ensemble; if the ensemble is out of tune slightly, you must match them in their wrong pitch. If not, you sound out of tune. A musician must also be able to react to a conductors interpretation of the music, which varies from conductor to conductor. In both of these instances, an AI musician could not react appropriately because it does not have human reason. AI would be programmed to be perfect all the time; a musician like that could never work with other musicians because the AI could never compromise, which is an integral part of playing. Hypothetically, if a musician were to be playing in an orchestra and the group sped up a bit, any human would come to the logical conclusion that he/she needs to follow the group. AI would be steadfast on playing at the right tempo because they would be programmed to be perfect. The audience would hear one player playing slightly off beat, leading to the conclusion that someone is playing incorrectly. 
	Instruments are very vulnerable and high maintenance which means a musician must treat his/her instrument with the utmost care. Maintaining instruments to the highest degree is an art form that, if done improperly, can lead to a betrayal in a performance. For valve instruments like a trumpet or a tuba, this means oiling your valves, greasing slides, and polishing necessary areas. String musicians have it much harder. They must replace worn strings, apply rosin to their bows, and must tighten the hair on the bow when needed. Anything less can lead to missed notes or even worse, damaging an instrument. If an instrument needed maintenance, AI could not troubleshoot the problematic instrument like a normal object. Some of these instruments are irreplaceable.
	As well as maintenance, instruments must also be handled properly. An example of this possible damage can be seen with a 1772 violin made by Giovanni Guadagnini, the apprentice of Antonio Stradivari. Currently, it is speculated that Stradivari built around 1600 instruments himself by hand; 900 of those instruments are still around today. After being being transported on a plane in its case, this violin sustained damages that included a large crack that ran through the whole back of the violin. While there could be human error involved in this instance, it still shows how delicate instruments can be. AI could not be trusted to the same degree as a trained musician. In the eyes of musicians, these instruments are more than just pieces of equipment that you can replace. Because musicians are in contact with their instruments virtually all the time, a bond forms between them. When violinist Philippe Quint was traveling to New York, he was stepping out of his cab while traveling with his Stradivarius Violin. Before Philippe could get his violin, the cab sped off with his $4 million instrument. He was quoted saying in a Vox interview Its like losing apart of yourself, you know its like someone cutting off your hand. After the antagonizing ordeal, the violin was recovered and he named the violin Ruby.
	If you have ever listened to music live, you know how different it sounds compared to a recording. Live music has that certain wash-over effect on the listener that lets him/her feel like they were in that time period. When an orchestra plays Shostakovich, the intensity of the music and the nervousness of the notes played by the strings can cause goose-bumps. If played appropriately, this work can make you feel that you are in the middle of the Stalins reign of terror in Soviet Union. If a robot were to play the instruments, how could it possibly do the composer justice? This piece of music was composed in defiance of the Soviet government and was the embodiment of the struggle of the people under a Communist dictator. How could a robot relate to that? 
	Granted, AI will have the ability to make music using instruments but, the pushback from the music community will be harsh and firm. Musicians in instrumental sectors of music have a hard enough time supporting themselves in a super competitive job market. There is a long running joke in the music community that people who go into music are so addicted to making music that they dont realize the pay gap. A teacher of mine once told me that You need to be in the situation where you cannot imagine yourself not playing your instrument. If that does not directly apply to your mindset, you will not be in a good place 10 years from now. People do not need AI musicians to crowd the business even more.
	Musicians are not in this business to make money. They are musicians because they love playing music. It is why they started playing their instruments before they could do simple arithmetic; it is why they are willing to practice for about 4-6 hours a day; it is why they try to master their craft and try to improve their playing; it is why they are willing to have other side jobs to support themselves and their families. Even if AI could reasonably play an instrument, they could never match a human musician in talent, dedication, and passion. Music is not being played in our lives just to be there. It is humanitys way of expressing itself.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

Consider the long-term costs of a single displaced worker in the context of a job market where the prospects for finding the next job become more complicated in the future. Many consider UBI as the solution to this issue. If so, then the true total cost of a single displaced worker must include the cost of funding that former worker's UBI until the time that worker would leave the job market, if not displaced by automation.

As we consider the complexities of costs associated with climate change, we have become more sophisticated about considering broad contexts in our calculations. We require environmental impact assessments and proposals before approving large scale infrastructure changes. Yet, for decades we have seen companies laying off thousands of workers, all at the same time, due to automation. Indeed, when governments grant sizable tax cuts to large corporations to create jobs, we can now predict that those corporations will invest their extra cash in automation instead, in order to reduce their costs associated  with labor.

If we really do see the future as one where society at large becomes responsible to support displaced workers, then perhaps governing bodies should require economic ""environmental"" impact assessments related to large scale layoffs due to automation.

Ive noticed this issue a lot lately, big brands are using a new method of marketing and hits collecting -Items sold online trafficking- by doing the following and those are examples I encountered:

1. Amazon, faked a glitch on Facebook advertising or probably it was Facebook faking it to presenting real pings on items advertised throw their website 
(The items list ribbon of amazon on Facebook shows you (e.g, picture of a Pen, but item name is Headset, once clicked the headset link is correct, but you start seeing advertisement for Pens like the one in the picture on your Facebook account )

2. Amazon, faked another glitch on their app, (e,g. youd be searching for a screen protector once search buttons clicked it takes you directly to Kindle Paper-white page and youd have to perform your search criteria again to make it to your targeted item)

3. Uber are find raising from those who dont use the app much like my self by doing the following (e.g., you pick your trip and a vehicle is on the way, once it is so close to picking you up, the app shows that have canceled the trip and charges you $5 for a cancellation fee, you freak out and order again and you get the same exact vehicle, you later on protest the cancellation fee and automatically the $5 are credited to your account, now you have an insensitive to using your Uber over any other commuting service because your money is trapped their units you use it.

Kindly share with me if those or any other suspicious acts are happening with you, as this might be a new era of marketing.

Should you get one? Should you avoid it?
Personally, I'm currently in the group that thinks anyone who is under the age of 40 should avoid it for the following reasons:
1. There is strong evidence to suggest that we are on the brink of extending the human lifespan - perhaps by as much as double. This would mean the retirement age would be extended to at least 120 if the average age was 150.
2. As automation improves how many jobs will there really be remaining? One could go with the old argument that new jobs will be created - but for how long? Surely with enough advances in AI all jobs could potentially be automated its just a matter of when. 
3. With number 2 in mind, everyone will either - a: Live like in elysium with a super class of the rich and underclass of the poor... or b: receive a universal basic income to supplement the lack of a job. Will pensions really still be honored in either scenario? Who would pay for the pensions when no one is working to sustain them?
4. When you consider number 1, it seems almost inevitable that if you are under 40 (perhaps even under 60...) that you will live to see number 2 and 3.

The reality is farmers have been using crude versions of genetic modification through selective breeding for eons. But now we are on a potential genetic revolution.

The question becomes how will this impact the future?

Will we see new human cancers from consuming GMOs?

Will some future terrorist group try to introduce a GMO fly to infect our meat supply?

Or will we end up with the [Ameglian Major Cow](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Ameglian_Major_Cow) from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy?

What do you think is the future of GMO?",1,1,False,self,,,,,

A Rootkit is defined as a malicious computer software hidden inside a computer or system and it is undetectable. Although Rootkits on their own may not be harmful, they hide worms &amp; malware. Attackers can have root access to the users computer or system using a Rootkit. Rootkit virus is considered extremely dangerous for users privacy.

[**What Can a Rootkit Do?**](https://www.redbuddy.in/2018/09/rootkit-virus.html)

A rootkit gives permission to somebody to take care of command and control over a pc without the knowledge of computer user. Once a rootkit has been installed, the controller of the rootkit has the ability to remotely execute files and alter system configurations on the host machine. A rootkit on an infected computer can also access log files and spy on the authorized computer owners usage.

Latency is defined as the time it takes for one endpoint to send a packet to another endpoint. Latency can be measured in one direction, or in both, and is quantified in terms of milliseconds. One-way latency is the time taken for a data packet to travel in one direction only and it is generally used to diagnose network problems. 

Another hand, two-way latency measures the round trip time and this figure is used to calculate MOS scores. A high round-trip latency affects normal conversation between people since the data packets take longer to reach their destination, and also take longer time for the acknowledgement to be sent back. Latency higher than 300 ms(milliseconds) is generally unacceptable for logical conversations, especially for organizations. ",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I really feel like as a society, we could be a little more creative with the terms we use to name things. Ever since flying machines were invented, people have dreamed of having their own personal form of air-transportation. Too often, though, I have seen every new and innovative kind of aircraft lumped into the category of ""flying car.""

So here are a few reasons why I think we should rethink the terms we use to describe these future vehicles.

**1.** **If it doesn't travel primarily on wheels, it isn't a car.**

Every dictionary I can find defines a ""car"" as a vehicle with wheels that travels on land. As far as I can tell, most of the flying vehicles we see in science fiction such as Star Wars, Blade Runner, and even The Jetsons are able to take off and land vertically, bypassing roads altogether. This is what I think of when I imagine personal air transportation. The only good reason I can think of for a VTOL aircraft to be called a car is that it might replace cars as our primary mode of transport, but I'll get into that in a moment.

**2. A true ""flying car"" is a silly and impractical idea.**

The only kind of vehicle that really fits the definition of a flying car is a sort of car/plane hybrid. Something that is street-legal, but can roll up to a runway, unfold its wings, and take off like a plane.

Something like this: [https://www.aeromobil.com/aeromobil-4\_0-stol/](https://www.aeromobil.com/aeromobil-4_0-stol/)

The problem with a plane/car hybrid is the same as any other hybrid. In its effort to perform two very different functions, it does both poorly. Do we really think something like the AeroMobil will ever be anything more than a novelty for a very niche market of wealthy buyers? I think most private pilots would rather have a better performing plane than a lame-duck plane that can also transform into a lame-duck car.

**3. Flying vehicles will never fully replace cars, and that's okay!**

Most of the criticism I've seen for the concept of personal air transportation come from people, especially pilots, who have concerns about its safety. In their minds, they imagine a crowded city sky, with untrained pilots flying their own vehicles around, just like they do with cars. Collisions would happen frequently, with a high death rate resulting from them, not to mention the danger posed to people on the ground. This is a valid criticism only if we think of personal aircraft as a replacement for cars.

But what if we just thought of them as fancy new airplanes?

Personal VTOL aircraft don't have to fully replace cars in order to be viable. They just have to take over a sizable portion of the private aviation market, as well as open up some new possibilities for personal transport.

I really think that concepts such as the Lilium Jet and DeLorean Aerospace's DR-7 have the potential to make aviation more accessible to a lot of people. It's just important that we be careful about the words we use, because they do shape people's expectations for what this new technology will look like.

I'm curious, though. What term do you think would best describe a civilian VTOL aircraft. As a Star Wars fan, I kind of like the term ""speeder"" myself. :)",16,1,False,self,,,,,

As a trucker, I have always hated that I'm supposed to make 800 miles in 11 driving hours over a 14 hour work period without speeding or going over time.
11@60=660. Cali is 55. Parts of Idaho and Nevada are 70, Washington is 60. All the same, max miles are required.

What I hope is that something like a 3:1 delivery ratio starts easing the required labor by close to 2:1. (We're easy)

The idea being:
I drive for 8 out of 9 hours for a workday like many other industries. 
For this I am compensated as a trained professional who's resposibilities include:
Care and safety of 3 otr vehicles, safe and effective autonomous vehicle routing, and safe driving of lead vehicle.  
I charge em, I get them there, I keep folks safe. 
My fee is: 8 hour drive day @400 miles-ish.
a fucking lunch break.
A salary that I receive because I'm a driver for company x. No competing for hours/miles/deliveries/$$$.
Training and resources that can help me make sure your shit gets to the place at the time with safety.
Back to money: As a person who makes things be where they go, I will never break 6 figures without cheating. So let's put the CONVOY!!!!! driver at a nice spot around 1.5x current actual. Super fair. 100k/annum.
No bonus for bulk delivered.
No bonus for miles covered.
Bonus: no shit broken or people killed/time.

Given the rate of increase of shipped goods vs. the rate of increase of goods shippers, this new tool for transport could maintain current job numbers while growing wages AND significantly increasing shipping infrastructure with only targeted reinvestment in hardware. (Trucking companies have an annual or even quarterly reinvestment in drivers and trucks).

First, pumped hydro has a relatively good round-trip efficiency of 70%-80%. Second, we may find the topography to store energy in the TWh scale if we think outside the box.

Pumped Hydro is an energy storage system that uses an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir to store energy. The amount of stored energy is measured by the volume of water in the upper reservoir. Water is released from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir to produce electricity. Water is pumped up from the lower reservoir to the higher reservoir to store energy. If the upper reservoir has no water, there is no stored energy. If the upper reservoir is full, the amount of stored energy is at maximum capacity. 

The topography to store a massive amount of energy may already exist if we think outside the box. Any two reservoirs that are near each other with an elevation difference could work for a pumped hydro system. The reservoirs can be at any location where fluids collect. As an example, we have been mining underground for decades. Are there salt caverns/caves that we can use as reservoirs? If there is no natural water source nearby, it may require pumping water to the site. Or are there places where we can modify the topography for two reservoirs?

We (human like race) destroyed Venus, terraformed Earth using a Mars like core planet. We did this by moving moon's from a gas giant (formally Mars?) into the earth core.if you check out venus, it is 50% mass of Earth, yet 90% of size. In addition to be the only planet to spin backwards and one day per year. (Possibly for energy systems, seems most efficient to have the sun beat directly at one spot all year.)

 A neutron is an electron and proton mixed. (Our sun is made of protons and neutrons) So I would bet Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, and Uranus all  have an iron/rocky core. They say we can't tell for sure what electrons are, but that's just because the paradox of an ever expanding and contracting universe (s). What is macro, is micro. We can't see the being we inhabit, and we cant see the beings that inhabit us.

Which brings me to my next point. We live on a free radical.  An oxidized electron. Essentially we are cancer, it is said that everyone has cancer, just it's dormant. If we spread to more galaxies we grow like a tumor. This is heaven, also this is hell. Up to us, and how we leave the planet to future generations. We have everything we need here, as well as needing to learn more about what we have here instead of exploring space. (5% of ocean is explored!!) Life is about enjoying what you have right? 

Lastly, back to the electron topic. By terraforming Earth, we create an imbalance in the gravitational field of our solar system. Possibly bringing in other (planets) to gain balance. Terraforming Mars as it is now would be illogical, terraforming it at all is. Just look at Venus. At least if we continue our enzyme/phage like behaviour. Open to any retorts or opposing viewpoints.

Okay, sure.

But does anybody really blieve that our technology will continue to improve indefinitely or expenentially increase.. Are we not knowing everything there is to know or reaching the limits of technology. We are reaching the end of moores law, things can only get so small, energy density can only get so great, computation can only get so dense.. Are we really going to become gods with nano swarm creations or are things going to level off soon.

Look at the smart phone. It took off hugely, got amazing over a decade and now screens and cameras can only get so much better - we are looking at incremental updates. The speed of wireless transmission is becoming saturated. 5G is likely close to the maximum transmission speed - its distance is limited.",10,1,False,self,,,,,

My brain is being fried by this, and the longer I'm in this situation the more I'm going to be talking about this stuff and the more desperate I'll get. It's not a good thing. Quit trying to make sure that everything is ""fine"", I only seem fine because I'm traumatized out of my mind. I can't get actual help from any doctors or anything like that cause of this situation. I get treated like an insane drug addict or something like that, and have a lapse in cognition. I'm only able to do this and haven't killed myself because people REALLY care about me, know how capable I actually am, and how wrong this is, and this is an attempt to reach out. Stop trying to make me not talk about these things. I forget whenever this thing has stopped in the passed. So fix it, stop trying to fix me.

I used to sit in the halls of a church listening to the priest tell elaborate stories of Gods power. I took part in lessons to get baptized, but rather than finding spiritual peace I found existential turmoil. I realized that the word of man did not encompass the entire world around me. I found solace in posing questions and seeking answers; I became impartial to the existence of a divine creator as a way to rid myself of any bias as I explored the world around me. I used my reason and logic to dive into the field of physics and began to create unique observations. I became intrigued by the inner workings of the world and follow developments in the world of theoretical physics. Northwestern provides various avenues for me to advance my educational career and help develop new theories. One of these avenues is the chance to work alongside with Frank Petriello in making new predictions of the Standard Model and finding a new frontier of physics using the Large Hadron Collider. Northwestern also allows me to take the change to develop my insights and projects through the Academic Year Undergraduate Research Grant. My desire to experiment and learn first-hand physics lead me to form a group at my school who is designing and building a simple mass spectrometer. I would take advantage of the prospect of this grant to be able to form my research in theoretical physics. Furthermore, through Northwesterns Conference Travel Grants I would be able to present my ideas and be able to receive insight to refine my work. The opportunity to collaborate with like-minded individuals would allow me to provide relevant insight into the advancing field of theoretical physics. ",2,1,False,self,,,,,

No. And that's okay.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/aarujh/will_vr_ever_replace_film_no_and_thats_okay/,Locogooner,1546137256,"There seems to be a current trend of journalists, futurologists and filmmakers discussing VR capabilities and possibilities in regards to the medium of film. But I think if we are to look forward in terms of VR becoming viable on a mass scale, we must understand that VR is a completely different medium entirely. 

**There will be no such thing as a ""VR film"".** It's almost as insane as referring to a film as cinema theatre. Filmmakers today who try to create ""VR films"" usually fall short because of its storytelling limitations if considered in the same realm as film. 

If you are to package a VR concept as ""film"", you have placed it in a ballpark where there are forced perspectives, third person protagonists, editing, framing etc.

VR will always fall short in this consideration. 

Therefore, I believe VR filmmakers or creators should focus on clearly making the distinction. It's a different art form. 

As consumers of art, humans choose differing artforms to consume for several different reasons. 

You don't read a book, for the same reason you watch a film. And you don't go to the theatre for the same reason you listen to a radio show. It is benign to impose the same storytelling modes and conventions akin to cinema, to VR.

\-------------

**Now**, filmmakers of today should be focusing on how we can push filmmaking techniques as far as possible in the viewing plane of 2D as it is most likely remain for a long time to come. 

""Flatties"" as they are called. Or in other words non-VR / non-3D.

I am much more interested in how a filmmaker can play around with a 2D flatty than a VR/film combo that doesn't really do justice to both mediums. It is an attention deficit generation and attention is the most valued commodity filmmakers can harbour at the moment.

&gt;!How do we stop you from scrolling?!&lt; 

How do we convince you to leave the house can go to the cinema?

How do we coerce you to not pause the film / video because of that email or DM you just got?

**Whoever, interrupts and engages - wins.**

Whoever manages to hack the way viewers ALREADY watch film/videos, will win. 

Has anyone here thought of how 2D flat images (regular film) will be viewed in the future?",3,1,False,self,,,,,

This is my humble vision of how the future of humankind will look like.

&gt;The development of humankind can be compared to that of a single individual. Humankind has lived its phase of childhood, wanting to accomplish great discoveries. At that time, it thought that it was the center of universe, tied to many claims without foundation and with a certainty to be special. Many people are still in this phase.  
&gt;  
&gt;Today, humankind is in adolescence and loves playing with technology. It realizes that others living creatures in this planet also deserve to be respected. But humans still fight each other without tolerating their differences and experience difficulty in self-understanding, like a teenager.  
&gt;  
&gt;Someday in the future, humankind will reach maturity. But for that to occur, it must leave its home, its mother, the planet earth. [AstroTown](http://www.astrotown.de) is a free science fiction book written in 2009 about this phase. Whether humankind is expelled from the planet or whether it decides on its own to abandon it, the fact is that humankind must learn to live independently. Only then will it be prepared to be part of a community it does not know. Only then can it find other life forms that are also living in space in a similar phase of maturity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Find out how this independence process can occur and take a look at the difficulties that will be encountered on the way. The question is always the same: Is humankind able to redeem its mistakes and do what is right? Or is it a failed system that must be replaced by another, more-advanced system? The cards are on the table.

This is a thought that occupies my imagination for many years. I hope this vision is interesting for some of you.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Every idea, every hypothesis has to withstand new data. If they can't it means we need to re-think how we understand the world! In fact, I think science is at its best when it is a frank discussion among peers about their data and their experiments and the best way to integrate these into how we think about how the world works.

To this end, I came across a list Eric Topol recently put together of biomedical ""dogma"" that came under scrutiny in 2018. I've listed them below.

Eric makes the good point that just because we are questioning something, doesn't mean the old theory is wrong. It just means maybe we should revisit the data and decide if any new experiments should be done.

I think the concept of keeping a list like this is fabulous (I'll be doing this next year!). If you have any ideas for things that should be added to the list - let me know! Also, if you think something on the list shouldn't be here, tell me why.

I made this post because I see that a lot of the general public is pretty ignorant on technology and how close we actually are to groundbreaking achievements. Our technology is advancing exponentially. We have accomplished more in the last 100 years than we have in the last 10,000. We have been born during a revolutionary time period of human history, perhaps the most important. We are on the shift towards Type 1 Civilization status on the Kardeshev Scale. Technology that one would have expected to see in the year 3000 could very well be available within our lifetimes. Advanced artificial intelligence, interstellar travel and colonies on other plants, full immersion virtual reality, biological immortality, the list goes on. This world is going to drastically change this century, for the better or for the worse. Let's just hope we can handle this new technology and not abuse it.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

I am an architect who is studying the conceptual field of arcologies and I am interested in knowing the opinions of this forum about the theme and its connection to futurology. An arcology is, in basic terms, a densely populated and enclosed city, semi-isolated and independent from the environment surrouding it. A common image is the city under a dome.

Do you think that an arcology is a practical goal?

Is an arcology present in your vision of the future of humanity? Could it be a reasonable ecological protection measure?

In the extreme, do you think all of humanity could be housed in such structures?

All opinions and help are welcome.",19,1,False,self,,,,,
