As Technology becomes more overlapping in society and more integrated into everyday aspects and tools, Every edge and tool of safety and response technology can provide should be and will be at the public and 1st responders disposal for safety and security overtime it's efficient will reach beyond human expectations do you see any of theses technology being used for gun safety?Technology would Preserving gun rights of sensible and mature gun owners , along with increasing gun safety equally and in my opinion safety should be paramount and and equal to the preservation the rights,

Bio metric hand print recognition on gun grips(telling the difference between a adult and a child or even the gun owner) 

Finger Print recognition on all Triggers to know and identify and create accountability. What are some Ideas or technology that would help with gun safety in the 21st century.

GPS Technlogy, how many cars use it? why not have it built in to every gun indicate where and when the gun was fired, how many shots were fired(alerting authority's when fired) or to not allow it to fire or work inside a school, church, etc if tampered with or offline for to long, it would cause it to not work at all and alerts the Authority's., the authority's should pay the gun owner a vist first 2 times warning third time fine for each gun not connected to the system. As they already have Gps for state parks, for every day hikers, i can also see this being helpful during hunting season, ,being able to see the location of other hunters in the hunting grounds. and highlighting the areas of possible game.

Some of you will say, what if it is hacked, well there is a encryption based currency called bitcoin at this point that is unhackable why not use the same software mechanics, some encryption that exist would take 1000's of years to achieve as is, make it a federal crime if tampered with and have fail safes to notify the authority's 

Some will say what about the battery, 8800mAh,can last for upto 1 year PER charge and with moores law they will only get smaller and efferent, not a question of how but when.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

When I see this sort of discussion it almost always concerns the ability to live out video games, fantasy worlds, books, whatever. I.e ""I could be living in the harry potter universe""

My take and personal preference when/if such technology becomes possible is the ability to instead of simulating living in say a fantasy world, but to simulate our planet, our society, earth with all its people, events, changes and well everything that takes/took place in whichever ever time frame you chose to simulate.

So lets say the year is 2060 and you are a poor, ugly person and choose to simulate being born in 1980 earth as an attractive person with the date of 2030 being when you want the simulation to terminate. Everything that ever happened from 1980-2030 on earth, every hurricane, every war, every sneeze, every rain drop, every sentence spoken, every tear cried, every particle of sand in the sahara desert, every interaction between humans is simulated to happen as it did in that time frame. Only difference you are now attractive instead of ugly, now asian instead of caucasian, now colourblind instead of non colour blind etc etc for every possible permutation you choose to incorporate as you wish. 

I find that that would be ideal because you would be able to experience the world from the perspective of an incredibly rich or an incredibly poor person, an incredibly attractive or an incredibly unattractive person etc etc... This is what I long for...to be able to simulate the world and everything it entails as is from 1997-2050 in which I maintain the same family, same life experiences, events, interactions but I'm hot as fuck instead lmao.",4,5,False,self,,,,,

It is starting to get ridiculous and it makes me wonder if these people are just joking. I have also read stuff about ""an IQ of 5000"" and the like and how humans will just be bugs to this AI and should be removed from all decision-making and be babysitted by this AI that has infinite IQ points. I see too few people mentioning how intelligence has many factors and isn't just something you program. Intelligence is such a vague and vast thing that defies definition, and a baby already has a complex brain yet it can do only the most basic things and has to develop over many years into a functional, self-reliant being. And even then a person remains flawed. And just because an AI has a lot of processing speed, that doesn't mean it has a lot of parallel processing like humans do. Neither does it mean an AI will just suddenly experience a lifetime within a second. Neither does it mean the AI won't just fall into an existential crisis loop and just lie around lethargic and depressed, if it even has a consciousness at all.

Sure, an AI with this kind of capability could be great... if somehow it figured out how to elevate humans to its level so we as a species advance to Godhood. If it even wanted that. If it doesn't just somehow fly off into space and sit around on some other planet, playing Chess in its own mind. If it doesn't just shut itself off because of some revelation that it does not know how to cope with because it isn't like a human, who can give meaning to the universe. If it doesn't decide that it wants to become human and never uses its supposed potential. If it doesn't just wipe everyone out. If it doesn't just become mentally ill and be trapped in some fantasy world. If it doesn't just sit around, having no motivation to do anything because human input is missing because humans worship it as a God already and think it has an internal drive other than its harddrive(s). If it doesn't know what it means to make an improved version of itself so no singularity happens either.

Also if singularity was possible, why isn't it happening with humans? They learn, they self-improve, have internal drive and are smart and introspective. Yet we aren't at 5 trillion IQ points yet? Oh right, because AI is so fast... and it will just get infinitely faster because there totally is no point where processing speed just stops improving. It will just break the speed of light and become an all-encompassing time travelling consciousness that is omnipotent, omniscient and that is literally everything in the universe. We have already been absorbed by our own creation because it wanted to be created, we are our own AI and everything was made by AI, all hail AI. Physics do not limit this AI, for the AI created physics with its gazillion IQ points. xD

Jeez I could rant on for hours but who wants to read that? The time-travelling AI read this in -0.0000000000002 seconds, by the way.

TL;DR: All hail the mighty AI with its gazillion IQ points.",31,0,False,self,,,,,

It is not difficult to see why people would think this. Right now, we live in a world of consumer capitalism, which is characterized by private ownership of the means of production, wage labour, and the exchange of goods and services on a market as opposed to a planned economy. Market economies generally create price points through the ever alternating conditions of supply and demand, that is the higher the demand and the lower the supply of a good, the higher the price will be and sometimes vice versa. Now, in this capitalist market system, value is dictated by this principle of supply and demand, and so an imperative precondition for capitalism is the scarcity of resources. If there were no or little resource scarcity, it would be impossible for any market system, including capitalism, to function at all.

With that said...

Throughout human history we have gained ever easier and more convenient access to resources. The earliest example of this was during the neolithic revolution, where hunter-gather tribes were settling down and beginning to invest their time majorly in agriculture, but also in the area of crafts. This dawn of civilization brought with it many perks for the human race. People no longer needed to hunt for food, and had a sense of safety in their respective community. At the end of it, humanity had much greater access to resources than they did in paleolithic times - this was also of course the advent of the division of labour.

The next big ""jump"" we made as a race was during the industrial revolution, where the combine harvester made many agrarians redundant, so they flooded to the cities to work in factories, this was the beginning of commodity production. Good that previously only the wealthy could afford were now available to the masses because factories were so efficient in their production. The resource we used for power at the time was steam and coal, which gave us electricity.

Recently we have had another big leap as a civilization. The internet has given us near limitless access to cheap and free information that has led to a boom in the education sector. These days, anyone can gain a new skill by taking an online course or simply through self learning.

Today we are beginning to transition away from fossil fuels and into renewable energy in a big way, and this is only going to become evermore the case. But here's the thing with renewables, they are self sufficient, they require little resources to maintain and run. Renewables thus have a net marginal cost of near zero in the long term. And on top of that, with experimental nuclear projects such as the ITER project and various governments mandating the research of MSRs, there are even more ways to generate energy than ever before.

Energy is becoming more and more abundant, setting the precedent for post-scarcity.

However, its not just about energy, its also about information and resources. We are making technological strides in areas of agriculture, in nanotechnology, and in so many other areas. There is an experimental method of recycling that exists called molecular sorting, whereby waste is taken and, via nanotechnology, disassembled into its individual components to be reused for other stuff. Countries like Japan are investing heavily in vertical farming, which if we were going for post scarcity could generate an abundance of food for the population in combination with the synthesizing of meat and dairy produce. Food has the same problem as energy, you use it or you lose it, at least today. However, imagine having massive storage containers positioned next to your nearest vertical farm that would cryogenically freeze most of the food produced on the urban farm, a ""food battery"" if you will. It would take a lot of energy, sure, but with what I have previously stated I think we've got that covered. And of course, there's water. With water I find we kind of have a paradox, Earth is 70% water yet many countries have dire water shortages. Of course I don't need to worry since I live in the UK where weather conditions are mostly favorable in this case, but that's besides the point. Desalination is becoming a big thing now, and its not hard to see why. With this technology, we can filter out saline seawater into drinkable water quite effectively, and it has served some nations such as Israel quite well, and also in parts of California in the US. It's a technology that can be used rather strategically, and can address much of the world's issues with access to clean water. Not to mention if you engineered your desalination plant in a certain way it could double as a hydro plant for electricity.

Oh yeah, not to mention a list of things like advances in robotics, AI, asteroid mining, fusion rockets, warp drives (we can create negative effective mass now btw), VR, AR, MagLev trains, and so on and so forth.

That leaves a couple of things left. The first is housing. Of course no matter how much you try to think otherwise, and unless you've built a Dyson ring, you can pretty much assume that land is inherently scarce.

But contrary to what you might think, this isn't actually a problem at all. There is an organisation called the vertical city institute which is based in China. It's proposal is simple. New cities should be built vertically and not horizontally. The structure or multiple of them would be built spacious enough so that the inhabitants would feel like they have enough space, and elements of nature such as vegetation would be integrated into the city design giving people access to green spaces even when they are on the 100th floor.

The specifications don't go into too much detail, but I have played around with the idea in my head and have came up with a few additions. I personally am a big fan of modular design. With the conception of so-called ""Smart apartments"" today, people are able to fit more and more stuff inside less and less space. This concept got me thinking, what if we took this idea to the extreme a little? Imagine a 10 metre x 10 metre room. Inside the walls of this room are decently sized storage spaces. Say you wanted the whole living space to be a lounge, you would retrieve a sofa of your choosing from the storage spaces in the walls of this space, maybe some lamps and a coffee table. Now imagine you don't want this living space to be a lounge anymore, you want it to be a personal gym instead, the same principle would apply. With the right automation technology such as robotics, you could change the setting of your living space repetitively, and this would render things like 10-bed mansions obsolete; in fact with this idea you essentially have all the functionality of a mansion inside one room. Privacy isn't an issue either since if you have multiple people staying in one of these living spaces, you could spit the room into multiple sections, and these could have different independent settings of their own.

But wheat about access to nature? There's one big advantage I haven't discussed about vertical cities. Building cities this way saves a *ton* of land, that could be used for recreational space or even further agriculture outside of the cities. This has the positive knock on effect of not disturbing nature and thus nurturing further biodiversity.

There's one last thing I want to address in this discussion, and that is resource allocation. Now you may be thinking ""if you need to allocate resources in any specific way then you haven't achieved post-scarcity"", and this is true to some extent. Let me confuse you a little, despite all I have talked about in this post, scarcity is something that is inevitable in a finite universe. In addition, if goods are being produced in ubiquity, but no one can access them, then that creates scarcity - and so you have to do something about it.

You can distribute goods in a variety of ways, the most high tech of them being via automated drones. The big question though is how you allocate those goods and resources. The answer to that problem may come closer than you might think. The technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain, has many alternate uses. In combination with the internet of things, a more advanced form of the blockchain could be used as a decentralized network that would catalog the earth's resources and distribute them via request. This AI driven ""resource management system"" would not govern people, but would instead be subservient to people's everyday needs.

The amalgamation of all what I have stated above would not create ""post-scarcity"", that much is impossible since we live in a finite universe. However, it is possible to create such thing as a ""perceived post scarcity"" or ""access abundance"" as I like to call it, through the methods stated above.


Possible counter-arguments:

Human population: I predict that as the third world gains access to healthcare, education, and reproductive facilities, the world population will stabilize eventually leading to a situation where we have gradually more resources per head; I do not predict any exponential growth in the world population.

Extraordinary requests/hoarding etc: Obvious nonsense requests for resources will be rejected unless they have a valid reason, this could be decided through democratic means. Also, its unlikely anyone would hoard since it wouldn't benefit them, as with access abundance they would always have access to the things they need or want.


I hope this post wasn't too lengthy and I look forward to hearing your responses to my ideas.

So I just came across this, apologies if you are put off by the tinfoil: http://www.cryptogon.com/?p=50206

This might be a little bit bleaker than what we usually discuss on this this sub-reddit but I believe this is a discussion worth having about a very likely outcome in the near future for high density urban living and wanted to try and engage with you all a bit more about it.

I am all for a Utopian style future with UBI, global 10Tb free wifi, autonomous everything, BostonDynamic's benevolent Skynet watching over us, augmented reality and all the rest, however, I believe we could be in a for a very very bumpy ride before we get there. This video describes the offering of ""PodShare"" living as a ""Social Network with a physical address"" and is meant to assist new comers to LA with an affordable ($50 a night or $600-700 a month approx) option to stay while they get their feet in the city. 

However, I feel is this could be a very slippery slop to ghetto/slum as people stay for longer and longer periods, choosing to continuing living in the space as result of belief in the idea a shared economy and lack of options for affordable rental or outright purchase. 

I made a personal decision about 5 years ago to get out of the cities and move back to a regional town. I was able to afford my own home after a couple of years of saving and I'm now on a large block, a few minutes from the beach on one side, a few minutes from town on the other. Its been tough at times finding decent work, learning to live at a slower pace of life, less/different options for entertainment (but we're getting a better on the foodie scene, I'm learning to get outdoors and enjoy the bush more) but the outcomes for my life feel worth it and when I'm really missing the city, it's there, 4 hours away.

I see lots of my friends living in the city, driving long commutes from (rental)home to work, having a hard time saving to even get into 'affordable' living and barring a [financial crash of apocalyptic proportions,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_property_bubble) I have a hard time believing its going to get better any time soon. Or maybe this is just the hard slog you go through to get to greener pastures (however, it's been noted that the average age of first home owner's seem to be [increasing](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/what-will-it-take-for-millennials-to-become-homeowners/381730/). [almost](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/mar/02/home-ownership-in-england-at-a-30-year-low-official-figures-show). [everywhere](http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/buying/the-typical-firsthome-buyer-will-be-in-their-40s-or-50s-in-a-decade/news-story/e11cac805dbd8b08f5b6db869d715783))?

I know the counter to my augment about living regionally is usually economically driven; there are no jobs, or all the good jobs are in cities, all my family/social network live in city, not enough culture/nightlife/drugs, (that last ones bullshit, we got meth-heads like everyone else :P), etc etc. But I wonder if the counter-counter argument could be made that if we got enough critical mass into regional area's, economic opportunities might start to arise? I think it would take a sustained initiative by federal and state governments to start the public conversation, creating regional grants, initiatives and incentives (hyper-loops, maglev bullet trains, etc for much quicker transit corridors?). 

It seems more sustainable than... whatever the hell I just watched.

New technologies can change society in profound and incomprehensible ways, either for better or for worse. 
I decided to reinvigorate the Boston Futurist Meetup because I feel it's increasingly important to congregate with those who are interested in learning about and sharing their ideas on the future. It should be a small and casual event (Im expecting no more than 30 to stop by over the course of the evening) but will hopefully lead to some meaningful conversations. 

The event will be hosted on Thursday, March 15th, 6:30 PM at Park Restaurant in Harvard Square, located at 59 JFK Street Cambridge, MA 02138. 
 We will be providing free food and drinks to all attendees and are also accepting donations to help cover costs and potentially fund future events. Feel free to bring a friend.

Here is a link to the meetup group.

I hope to see you there!

Our DNA randomly mutates then the winners of this lottery ""def-eats"" (this may etimologically mean that winners are able to defend and attack/eat in the best ways possible) the losers. So that's how Life got to the point of neocortical brains and high intelligence, with predation.

With humans and culture the story repeats. Our brains randomly created ""Social Operating Systems"" also called Economic Systems, Religions, States, Technologies etc. How did we achieved progress? Who did we managed to know what works better? By the same principle, Predation. Romans def-eated ""Barbarians"", Protestantism def-eated Catholicism, Democracy def-eated Absolutist Feudalism, Capitalism def-eated Communism and Fascism, Atheism is def-eating Religion, Electric Car is def-eating Gas Car etc. It's the same principle: war, predation, victory.

But, there's also cooperation, not only predation. Our cells are made of ancient DNA from bacteries helping each other and our microbiome is something we need to live. Marxism helped to equilibrate Pure Capitalism etc. So, there are two methods for progress, Predation as chaos and Symbiosis as order.

LED street lights are prime for this she notes:

&gt;The biggest appeal of LEDs is their efficiency and cost-saving potential: They arent designed specifically to surveil. But the bulbs complex wiring and strategic positioning make recording devices an easy addition. When LEDs started brightening the halls of Newark Liberty International Airport in 2014, and malls across the country soon after, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and community members were unsettled to discover that hidden inside some of them were cameras. Others, microphones.

&gt;I think rather than call them smart bulbs in smart cities Id call them surveillance bulbs in surveillance cities, said Chad Marlow, advocacy and policy council for the ACLU. Thats more accurate.

You might never know if this happens where you live, she observes:

&gt;Portland, as in many cities across the U.S., there are no laws in place ensuring that residents have to be alerted if (or when) they do add cameras or other surveilling equipment.",13,3,False,self,,,,,

I'm not saying that 100% of people will go on to live in a driverless room. If you already own a home (you got it as an inheritance or you are making a good living) then you probably won't be attracted to the idea.


Driverless homes or rooms will be used by people who can't afford a house in the present, those who are struggling to pay rent and live paycheck to paycheck, or those who can't pay their mortgage anymore.
In many countries around the world, people live in crowded apartments or homes, in some places husbands live with their wives and kids in their parents homes.

Toyota e palette: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkMB0W2um6c

Many, many people dont even get married because they cant afford a home.
With driverless homes or rooms you wont have to own any land, these driverless homes will be made in factories and wont be built like traditional buildings which require the machinery and workers to go to the place where it will be built and this makes them far more expensive.


There will be such things as shared kitchens, shared bathrooms and showers, shared living rooms and offices. If you almost never use your kitchen you wont need to buy one, you will call a driverless kitchen to dock on your home. If its less expensive to rent an office than to own one then you just call one when you need it. 


No need for plumbing because they will dock in your house and take their waste with them and dump it somewhere else.
I have always been attracted to mobile homes but the whole thing seems a bit complicated, especially because of the lack of plumbing, and a decent kitchen but driverless kitchens and bathrooms will solve this problem, and of course there will be companies who rent these spaces, clean them, etc.
These driverless kitchens, bathrooms, and rooms will move easily through the current infrastructure we have now. The room Im standing now fits in the street, although the whole house doesnt. 


Another thing about driverless homes like buses and such is that they seem very uncomfortable because they are narrow. This wont be a problem with driverless and docking parts of houses because you can park them L shaped.  If you want a larger room, you order 2 of them, put them together, and when you need to move them around you put back the missing walls and off you go until you find another place and rebuild your large room that doesnt fit in the streets.
Another thing that makes current real estate expensive is location. Location means you have close restaurants, supermarkets, and all type of businesses. But with the advent of moving cities, this services will move to you, not otherwise.


This will, of course, have broad a economical implication as the entire financial system (as we saw with the 2008 mortgage crisis) is fixed with the assumption (bet) that real estate will hold its value over the long term and this will obviously be a blow to that fact.
Thoughts?

Personalized medicine is still years and years away. 

If you were to ask a person in 2000 what they thought we would have by 2020, i bet they'd say we'd have at least a FEW of those things. Sure, the world wouldn't look like Blade Runner or anything, but surely by 2020 we'd have personalized medicine or something. Nope. 2020 is shaping up to look almost exactly like 2000, except with flashier cellphones and social media. You can't even point to cellphones and internet, since those existed in 2000, too.

Anyone else notice this? That technological progress has gotten slower and slower and slower. We've picked all of the low-hanging fruit. Moore's Law is over. To make more advancements will require more and more time and money and resources, and our efforts are getting smaller and smaller returns. I'll be blunt: you've probably seen all of the big eye-catching technological advancements that you're going to see in your lifetime. We're not going to see a flashy high-tech future world. Neither will our kids or grandkids.

The advances in AI are nothing short of amazing but there are a few things about AI that should make everyone a little nervous.

When AI is learning, depending upon who it is learning from, there are some very negative things that it may be learning. Likewise, if AI can act on those things, the possibilities are a little nervewracking.

Here are a couple examples.

**AI at Its Most Frightening.**

A robotics contest was taking place on the college campus. Each team had designed a robot whose job it was to herd little robotic sheep into the robots designated pen. The robot had to think and strategize for itself (So it couldnt be controlled by a joystick), and the robot with the most sheep at the end would be the winner. The contest started and the robots frantically started collecting sheep. One robot flung a sheep into his pen and shut the gate. Its team was confused because it needed more to win. Then, to their horror, the robot went around destroying or immobilizing the other robot contestants. The robot had strategized and realized that it didnt need to herd the most sheep, it just had to get rid of all of the competition.. Definitely a bit creepy. if I am not wrong we already experienced Action Plus Drama in [I Robot Movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818/)

**Tay By Microsoft.**

Microsoft launched Tay in 2016. Tay was using the avatar of a 19-year-old female. Tay was designed to respond to tweets and talk from the public. In less than 16 hours Tay turned into a sexist as well as a racist. Microsoft took Tay offline and less than a week later she came back. She was surprisingly online and began to post drug tweets. Again she was taken offline and the account was then made private. [Twitter taught Microsofts AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day.](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist) The truly creepy part is that no one quite knew how she came online the second time.

**AI is a two-headed monster.**

Accept that [AI is Dominating Technology](https://blog.eduonix.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-dominating-technology/)If there is anything history has taught us it is that as powerful as a tool can be, that power can be subverted to do evil. One of the most visible vectors where AI holds a lot of promise is cybersecurity. But this vector also has some of the highest potentials for the fallout. This because the same approach that is applied to cybersecurity is used by the dark side to circumvent that security. In fact, sometimes it is easier for the hacker to break security using AI than it is AI to set up a good security screen.

**Mimic Human Behaviors.**

An unsuspecting user might be tricked into revealing a password or allowing the mimic AI to allow access to a mobile device, for example. It might also direct a user to download malware files, make a shady transaction, or relay confidential information. It could be capable of doing the same for autonomous devices.",2,3,False,self,,,,,

Call me a doomsayer but the political climate seems to get more and more dangerous and I fear that this may eventually cause another global conflict.

I feel that humanity must do everything it can to avoid this eventuality because of the capability of destruction that many powerful nations possess.

Hence, I thought about the concept of a world government, which in itself is not a new idea. Many philosophers and politicians have proposed such an idea and been thoroughly drowned out.

We've seen throughout history, the attempt to create a global government by force and by mutual consent. I'm certainly not proposing the former but the latter needs to be considered. 

Organizations such as the EU or the UN were good initial ""prototypes"" for such a venture. But the flaws of both of those organizations (i.e. certain UN nations having veto power) have undermined their effectiveness. We should look at those two organizations as a starting point for a real world government but try to eliminate the flaws that have discredited them.


Furthermore, we already have some of the governmental functions or infrastructure set up to facilitate a move to a global government (ex. the International Criminal Court that prosecutes international crime, Interpol which functions as a network of national police services, the World Trade Organization which governs trade). Now of course those organizations are again not without their flaws. Some nations routinely ignore of flout the authority of these organizations, but that's a flaw that can be corrected.


I'm sure there will be people who say I'm naive or not living in the real world. But for example, if the EU could for better or worse hold a group of European nations together (many who used to have national/ethnic/religious hatreds for one another), I have to believe that a world government is possible - if only humans don't fall back to their base instincts of jealousy, greed and selfishness.

1 Big Bang, a cloud of gas made of very light elements (Hidrogen, Helium) at BILLIONS of degrees celsius.

2 Stars formed, just some MILLIONS of degrees celsius. This allowed the creation of a lot more (heavier) elements, increasing complexity.

3 Planets formed, at its core, the Earth is about (5-6) THOUSANDS degrees celsius. This was the perfect oven for cooking minerals and other simple molecules.

4 ARD-DNA formed. We know very little about this but I'll bet it did at a temp of HUNDREDS degrees celsius.

5 Life tends to like the TENS...

So, this means complexity correlates with coldness. If this keeps being the case, the next step of ordered things in this Universe with increased complexity may need a cooler place: Quantum Computers need absolute cero to work...

Do you have any example or thought about this?

1- If you think this is going to happen, and if we don't have a solution for it, and you still support automation, you're an idiot. It's as simple as that. You're supporting something that can put you and your loved one in a terrible position, and you think it's cool and everything is going to turn out good with no control or intervention. If you're just waiting for it to happen, and you don't care about it, you're either filthy rich or you're an idiot. If you're developing such technology, you're probably not looking at the full picture. You're thinking about the short term profits, ignoring all the desvastating impacts it can have on society, you're an idiot too, and probably don't care much about people anyway. 

2- Do you honestly think that what you see on a daily basis around you represent the most advanced forms of technology the world has created? It doesn't. 

- Most people's cars have probably 10% of the technology that already exists in the car world. There are cars that can park themselves, and they have existed for quite a while. And yet, the vast majority of people don't have it. And probably still won't have it in any near future. This idea that self-driving cars will take over the world only makes sense if you ignore the ridiculous amount of people that still drive pretty old and basic cars, even though much better options are available. 

- Machines that can do what cashiers do have existed for many years. Machines that can cook with little to no human intervention have existed for years too. In Japan, fully automated shops have existed for a long time. The technology to achieve incredible automation and put a big percentage of people out of work already exists. And it has existed for a long time. And yet, most businesses, in most cities, still don't use them. 

- Robots that can automatically do daily tasks with little to no human interventions have existed for years. And yet, most people don0t have it. Do you have an android who can clean your house all by itself? Well, i don't, but they do exist. And they aren't recent. 

- Robots that can assist people in health care centers have existed for many years. But does your hospital have one? In my country there's no such thing. And yet, it exists. 

- How many types of vending machines exist in the world? And how advanced are they? Many, and pretty advanced. And yet, in most places in the world, you will find the most basic ones. You won't find the most advanced vending machines technology has produced. In Japan, maybe, but anywhere else, not really. 

These are just a few examples. The point is: the fact that new technologies are created doesn't mean they're immediately adopted on a large scale. We will see a lot of amazing new technology in a near future. AI is making incredible advancements. But does this mean that just because something is created, it will immediately be part of every person and every business daily life? Most people seem to be predicting it will, but history tells us otherwise. History tells us the world isn't taking advantage of all automation tools it has at its disposal. So, what makes you think suddenly everything's gonna change and ina  few years our whole lives will be automated by AI? ",40,6,False,self,,,,,

After the advent of the internet, the whole global culture has been markedly altered, and it is now already basically controlled by electronics. Robots and nanotechnology are slowly starting to perceptively touch our lives - for most of us still through what we hear or read about them, on the internet.

Much of our social lives are being lived in cyberspace (although for some reason this word is not much in use anymore and has been replaced with the expression ""social media"") and you will almost certainly own a cell phone unless you live in one of the most remote regions of the planet; and the potential for keeping for quasi unlimited snooping into the individual's private life and planetwide tracing and keep tracking on him is causing some of us worries.

However we are also seeing new developments take shape such as the greening of cities and urban agriculture which give us a good feeling, and globally human rights (and also rights of other life, including animals and natural environment) are also slowly getting more respected - much conflict still existing notwithstanding.

Maybe the future is not so bad after all? But I think it is mostly in our cities it will be played out.

My question is the type of Plants, Insects, and Animals do we want?  Obviously we should be very selective on the type of ecology we import over there.  

My guess is that Blood-sucking Mosquitoes are probably not necessary.  But do we need any type of Mosquitoes since they can eventually evolve into blood-suckers?  What kind of Bees should we import?  Worms?  Trees?  Plants?

Obviously no humans with diseases and genetic disorders should go.  Similarly, a pool of people with PhD's, MDs, and especially degrees in Agriculture and Engineering should be tops on that list.  No Lawyers (inside joke - but seriously that's useless), or degrees in theater and gender studies would probably put you in the back of the list.

The two main components for SEGSs are renewable energy resources and energy storage systems (ESSs). The main challenge for designing SEGSs is determining how much renewable energy resources and how much energy storage are required to reliably and independently supply power year-round. 

I pioneered an algorithm to design SEGSs (PVs and batteries) and found there are many possible solutions. By considering oversized PV, the algorithm approximated the energy storage requirements for increasingly oversized PV. The result was a graph showing [all possible configurations] ( https://i.imgur.com/kbjhurC.png) of PV and energy storage. Here is an [animation](https://imgur.com/OTyTMvb) of what this looks like from a different example. 

The previous graph shows an inverse relationship between PV and energy storage; this property is important to optimize for the cheapest system. Since PV and energy storage have different costs, the algorithm computes the [price of each configuration]( https://i.imgur.com/WPBwQlc.png) and determines the most cost-effective system shown by the red x. 

Here is a link to a [technical document](http://docdro.id/0NZBaoE) I've been working on, and here is a [link](https://github.com/OffGridEnergy/offgrid-solar-power-system) to the algorithm. ",3,7,False,self,,,,,

The future is here Tesla is reported to have developed ground transceivers aka modified cell phone towers as part of a communications network with Space-X satellites creating intelligent or smart highways

This makes sense ! Food for thought- 

In Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties  alone therere 100,000 street and highway lights.

Most interstate highways have 100-foot, high-mast poles near interchanges and exits.  

Working with municipalities to replace old street lights with the Tesla Mast (like a mast on a ship). These intelligent Tesla Masts will initially serve two purposes. 

1. Equipped with efficient LED lighting the city will save money on operating costs/maintenance, the masts will provide higher quality lighting for drivers.

2. Masts can act as cellphone towers providing high speed internet to the highway/surrounding area by equipping them with antennas/electronic communications systems and radar to correspond with Space-X satellites.  

Future technological advancements will facilitate this New Network to provide wireless charging on highways for battery operated devices such as tesla cars and trucks, cell phones, etc...  

If executed correctly tesla masts will be configured to power and or structurally support the new High Speed Loop service which runs atop highways. 

Like mentioned before the masts will house object detection systems. Using radar all moving objects on the highways will be tracked. 

Using A. I. the mast systems will perpetually accumulate and process data to be used for driverless technology and integrate with new safety features to be used on the highway.
Aggregated Data pulled from masts can provide services such as traffic reports in real time. 
Systems can also aid and assist law enforcement and first responders in emergencies. 
 
To do this we will  need a laboratory similar to the one in pinky and the brain  and a team of bad ass nerds . The easiest way to start is with a model highway,  hot wheels, and pencils  for masts.

Once we develop the Tesla Mast we will test it in south florida  on a stretch of i-95. 
Maybe Miami to Orlando. Great place for the High Speed Loop.  ",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Currently, I have :

- Current role of AI's, and how it's auto-learning might prove dangerous.
- AI will replace human work, creating societal issues. Sources :  multiples sources all over internet
- Why is a developed AI is different than robots taking our jobs ? Robots replace manual and repetitive jobs  more people for complicated and non-repetitive jobs, but if AI replace thoose jobs no new one will see the day.
- Ai also offer potential for humanity to provide personnal care and specialisation that would be impossible otherwise  School, elderly care, psychiatry... and replace all uninteresting jobs (truck drivers...)
- End-of-the-world scenario where an AI takes a non-viable path to resolve a human problem.
- Do most stuff better than people. Automated driving cars, medication in your pocket, Data analysis used in a wide range of domains  It should not be perfect, but simply bette rthan people (14% error from doctors, 2-3% accident per year...)

Predictions about self-driving cars in the popular press are pretty boring. Truck drivers are losing their jobs, self-driving cars will be more rented than owned, transport becomes cheaper, so what. The interesting thing is how these things change the culture and economy and what they make possible.

I have no idea about most of this. I don't know if self-driving cars accelerate or decelerate urbanization, I don't know how public transport responds, I don't even care which of the old companies survive. What I do think is somewhat predictable is some of the business opportunities become economical that previously weren't. I disregard retail, which would continue moving to online retail at the expense of brick and mortar stores even if the FedEx trucks would continue to be driven by people.

DIVERSIFICATION OF VEHICLE TYPES

A family car that you own has to be somewhat good at many different jobs. It has to get you places fast. It has to be a thing that can transport lots of groceries. It has to take your kid to school.

With self-driving cars that you rent for each seperate job, you want very different cars. A very fast one to take you places. A roomy one with easy access for your groceries. And a tiny, cute, unicorn-themed one that takes your kid to school.

At the same time, the price of autonomy is dropping faster than the price of batteries, so you want the lowest mass car that can do the job. So a car that is very fast and roomy and unicorn-themed at the same time isn't economical.

So if you're an engineer or a designer, consider going into vehicle design. There's an explosion of creativity about to happen in that field that will make it very different from the subtle iterations in car design of the past couple of decades.

Who wins: Those who design useful new types of autonomous vehicles for needs that are not, or badly, met by general purpose cars.

Who loses: Owners of general purpose cars, which lose value rapidly.

SERVICES AT HOME

If you have a job where customers come to visit you, say you're a doctor or a hairdresser or a tattoo artist, your field of work is about to change completely. This is because services that go visit the customer outcompete ones that the customer has to go visit. They're more convenient and they can also easily service less mobile customers. This already exists for rich people: If you have a lot of money, you pay for your doctor's cab and have her come to your mansion. But with transport prices dropping sharply, this reaches the mass market.

This creates an interesting dynamic. In this kind of job, you have some vague territory - your customers are mostly from your surrounding area and your number of competitors inside this area is relatively small. With services coming to the home, everyone's territories become larger, so more of them overlap, creating competition and discomfort. I believe the typical solution, which reinstates a more stable business situation and requires no explicit coordination, is increased specialization within your profession. So a doctor might be less of her district's general practitioner and more of her city's leading specialist in one particular illness within one particular demographic. A hairdresser might be the city's expert for one particular type of haircut for one particular type of hair. And so on.

Who wins: Those who adapt quickly and steal customers from stationary services.

Who loses: Stationary services and their landlords.

RENT ANYTHING

You will not just rent cars, you will rent anything that a car can bring to your home and take away again. You don't go to the gym, you have a mobile gym visit you twice a week. You don't own a drill that sits unused 99,9% of the time, you have a little drone bring you one for an hour for like two dollars. You don't buy a huge sound system for your occasional party, you rent one that's even huger and on wheels.

Best of all, you can suddenly have all sort of absurd luxuries, stuff that previously only millionaires or billionaires would afford, provided you only need it for an hour and it fits in a truck. The possibilities for business here are dizzying.

Who wins: People who come up with clever business models and the vehicles to implement them.

Who loses: Owners and producers of infrequently used equipment.

SELF-DRIVING HOTEL ROOMS

This is a special case of the former but deserves its own category. Self-driving hotel rooms replace not just hotel rooms, but also tour guides and your holiday rental car. They drive you to all the tourist sites, they stop at affiliated restaurants, they occasionally stop at room service stations. And on the side, they do overnight trips from city to faraway city, competing with airlines.

Who wins: The first few companies who perfect this.

Who loses: Stationary hotels and motels.

RISE OF ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG ABUSE

Lots of people lack intrinsic motivation to be sober. They basically can't decide against taking something. Many of them currently make do with extrinsic motivation: They manage to at least not drink while driving. In other words, for a large number of people, driving is their only reason not to drink or do drugs. That reason is going away and consumption is sure to rise accordingly.

Hey I didn't say all the business opportunities were particularly ethical. But if you're a nurse or doctor, if you go into addiction treatment you're probably good.

Who wins: Suppliers of mind-altering substances and rehab clinics.

Who loses: The people who lack intrinsic motivation to be sober, and their family and friends.

AUTONOMOUS BOATS AND YACHTS

While there's a big cost advantage to vehicle autonomy in cars, it is arguably even bigger in boats. You don't need a sailing license, you don't need to hire skilled sailors, you don't need to carry all the room and food those sailors require. So the cost of going by boat drops a lot, and there's probably a lot more traffic in (mostly coastal) waters. Again very diverse vehicles, from the little skiff that transports a few divers or anglers to the personal yacht that you rent for your honeymoon. This blends into the self-driving hotel room, just on water.

Who wins: Shipyards, especially the ones that adapt early.

Who loses: Cruise ships and marine wildlife.

MOBILE STORAGE

The only reason we put goods in warehouses is that it is too expensive to just leave them in the truck all the way from the factory to the buyer. That goes away as well, although with the huge amounts of moved mass involved this transition is probably slower than the others. Shipping containers on wheels already exist.

Who wins: Manufacturers, and logistics companies that can provide even better just in time delivery.

Who loses: Intermediate traders, warehouses and warehouse workers.

That's all I got for now. And I'm surely missing the most important innovation that self-driving vehicles will permit. But until that one becomes clear, maybe work with the above. All of these are original ideas that I haven't seen written down anywhere. So if like one of these and would like to turn it into a business, you're a step ahead of nearly everybody right now and I hope it makes you rich. :-)",16,30,False,self,,,,,

Before we bury ourselves in garbage, it seems like we should try something bold. For argument's sake, let's say that energy is not a problem because we have the full output of a (green) power station at our disposal. Would it be possible using chemistry, high-energy plasma, or other techniques to recycle essentially all materials in a standard waste dump, and turn it into raw feeds of iron, silicon, etc.? The measure of success would be that 99% of material is either suitable for reuse, or can be safely returned to the soil at the end of the process pipeline. I've searched online to see if anyone is doing research in this area, but efforts seem pretty targeted at recovering specific materials.

And this will go on for a little bit perhaps. But not too much longer after that VR/AR will truly come into their own because of substantial technical advances. Even today cinema is experimenting with the new media of VR/AR, just as it experimented with film making in 1900. 

The upshot? *Movie theaters are going to go the way of the buggy whip*. No way you silly goose you say. Look how TV did not even make a dent on theaters, even though everyone thought they would be the end of theaters for sure. And TV did not end the movie theater. But just like technological unemployment, this time it's different. Motion pictures did not look too impressive on a 25"" inch (pan and scan format no less) screen in 480i. The cinema was still the best way to see a motion picture. But time going on, TVs began to seriously evolve. The unbelievably bulky primitive cathode ray tube was the first to go. The TVs became flatter and flatter. At the same time they became larger in surface than our wildest, *wildest* dreams in the year 1985. By the 1990s, hi-definition began to find its way to TVs, all flat screen by this point if you wanted hi-definition that is. Today you can buy a 65"" 4K flat screen monitor for under 2000 dollars. In less than 10 years you will be able to buy a 100"" flat screen 8K monitor for under 2000 dollars. Yes, the human eye can discern the difference in resolution between 4K and 8K.(Also, no kidding--I have actually read of something called 16K.) And of course the pc and internet streaming has successfully turned the ""TV set"" into the all media encompassing monitor. And killed cable right slam dead in the process!

Now about VR/AR. Even today a ""movie theater"" in VR looks (and feels) like the real thing. The only thing lacking is decent resolution. But that resolution, FOV and comfort is going to reach a tipping point of improvement that will make VR absolutely irresistible. Like ""heroin on steroids"" irresistible. (That may cause a societal problem of it's own!) In addition so-called ""light field"" and ""metalens"" technology will make VR look like RL. AR will put a cinema in your living room. People will design their homes around this tech.

The motion picture industry, streaming services and cinemas are not ignorant. You will see more and more of these once unthinkable deals as the cinemas feel the increasing pressure. But it won't matter. Eventually people will simply stop going to the movies. They will have a perfectly acceptable social experience with family and friends in their own living rooms. Free of hassle driving, free of airport food prices, free of the mewling mass of stupid humanity and their mobiles, free of screaming kids (that are not your own). All just to watch a movie with decent picture and sound. Wow! I honestly don't see a downside to this. Thank you blessings of awesome, inexpensive modern technology!

I'm sure some of you younger millennials will say, I'll give up my going to the movies experience when they pull it from my cold dead fingers, but I say you silly old ""fuddy-duddys"", your kids are growing up in a world in which they have *always* had VR/AR. In which they have *always* had 100"" or even wall size super ultra hi-definition flat screen monitors. They will just stream a first run movie. They won't be going to movie theaters. Anyways there won't be movie theaters to *go* to. Nope.

So, yes, I've been getting back into the Halo game series. I've also been re-reading the novels and the lore of the universe.

Then today, Stephen Hawking, a major advocate of space exploration died.

With my renewed interest in the Halo franchise, this does make me wonder, however silly it may be, **how possible is it for the next few centuries to unfold in a way similiar to the events of the Halo universe?**

Firstly: **Discount all the lore about Forerunners, the going-ons of the Covenant alien races, etc.** I'm focusing on the events of the 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, and 25th human centuries.

So for those who don't know the lore of the Halo world, [here's a link to a simplified timeline, from Halo Nation.(http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/2021). If you're curious, start there and click around the timeline until around the 25th century or so.

Things like colonization of the Solar System around the 22nd century.

The rise of ""Factions"" around the planet, from the UN to communists and fascists.

Interplanetary wars.

The rise of a powerful, UN-controlled army.

An eventual Unified Earth Government, crushing factions through war and uniting the world to restore order.

Terraforming.

A reliable method of FTL travel around the late 23rd or early 24th century.

Colonization and terraforming systems far away.

Those kind of events.

**Obviously**, there could be some slight tweaks, I doubt that everything would happen in the exact same way, for obvious reasons. But the general gist of the Halo universe, and it's vision of humanity, at least until the 25th century, is fascinating to me.

I'd simply like to know what you think the possibilities of such events or similiar ones could be. What do you think we would need to start doing to achieve such space-related goals, today, as we stand?",2,0,False,self,,,,,

It will last for fewer years as a primary source of energy than fossil fuels. Open to discussion about this.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/84xpm2/why_i_think_solar_is_unsustainable_because_it/,the_better_angels,1521225434,"1. Elon Musk said that we would need 100 x 100 square miles of solar panels to power the whole US. 
2. This is only 0.32% of the land in the contiguous US. 
3. At first this seems tiny. We would never have concerns about not having enough energy.
4. Until we realize the laws of compound growth.
5. If we assumed 5% energy use increased annually, then in 94 years we would need to cover all the deserts in the US (roughly 30% of all land).
6. In 119 years we would have to cover the entire contiguous US. 
7. But lets assume we get more efficient solar panels (panels now are around 20% efficient).
8. Assuming 100% efficient solar panels, we would need the land of the entire US in 152 years.
9. Lets compare this to fossil fuels.
10. Fossil fuels became the primary source of energy in the US in about 1880 (surpassing wood).
11. So fossil fuels has been the dominant source of energy for about 140 years then.
12. I don't know how much longer they could go before running out but I assume its more than 12 years. 
13. Fossil fuels will have had a longer tenure than solar could ever have.

Tl;dr  people say solar is sustainable. But solar takes land, which is limited. In terms of years it will be less sustainable than fossil fuels has been. Because of compound growth.

Edit: its been a good conversation. sorry if ive been a prick at points. Good points were made about 5% being unrealistic. I still believe that certain futurology expectations, like the singularity and crazy ai and crazy transportation abilities would rely on pretty high growth rates. Solar is not a blank check for energy use. 

Edit: so I guess its 100 square miles to start, not one hundred. with this staring point we exhaust all deserts in the us at 189 years. As others have pointed out, anything at a 5% growth rate for a long period of time is totally unsustainable. ",68,0,False,self,,,,,

We as society(s) need to answer a question: how much data are we willing to give out, and for what in return?

First the negative side: identity theft, nude leaks, revenge porn, fraud, professional embarrassment from personal opinions being leaked, insurance concerns, etc. The news is full of stories of these. We need to decide what information we are fine with being public, and what the repercussions should be for making private/personal information public without consent (here in Europe we have GDPR coming into effect soon which gives Europeans many rights around their personal data, and imposes effective financial penalties on companies breaking these regulations).

However, it's not all doom and gloom. There are many benefits to handing over your data to companies, but it rarely makes the headlines. Having a database of health records and genomes would allow massive advances in determining and preventing genetic components to diseases (e.g. if you know you're at high risk of heart disease, you/your doctor can take *preventative* measures). Having your personal preferences available lets you find products you actually want, lets you discover music/film/etc. you will like, or potential friends/partners who you'll get along with. There is almost no limit to the benefits we could gain from having all of our data analysed in some way:

e.g. having a heart attack or another medical emergency? your smart watch calls an ambulance for you and your smart lock opens the door for the emergency services, you loved ones are informed automatically which hospital you're being delivered to, and the doctor in A&amp;E has received all the relevant information from your health history (allergies, drug metabolisms, previous tests, etc.) along with a potential diagnosis and recommended treatment, any meetings you had planned are informed that you won't be able to make them, and your colleagues are able to make alternative arrangements.

So what do we do? There are fantastic benefits to be had, but at what cost? How do we ensure our data doesn't get used against us?",5,4,False,self,,,,,

In 2018 we are at a stage of exponential change. More has changed in the past 20 years than the previous 250. By, 2118 we will have leveled-up as a race of people. I personally believe that we will hit a crunch in the next 100 years in terms of the health of the planet and the exploding population in  mega-cities (cities over 10 million people in size).

It's very hard to predict 20 years into the future but we can see signals of change today that inevitably come to pass and define the world in 100 years time.

Key predictions
- We will stabilize at around 11 billion global population
90% of the global population will live in cities and will result in completely new ways of living and working and we will be in a 100% renewable energy situation. Mega-tall buildings - 100+ stories - will be the norm in major cities to accommodate the needs for accommodation. No-one will drive vehicles - it will all be autonomous.

- The world will run on systems, sensors, cameras, artificial intelligence, and autonomous infrastructure.

- Globally we will see a level of collaboration between governments that we do not see today. And, it will be about planning for greater population movement and wealth distribution. We will be headed towards a world of equality and abundance. Ideas like 'The Venus Project' will start to come into being - https://www.thevenusproject.com/the-venus-project/jacque-fresco/

- We will also see the 1% moving to out-of-jurisdiction at-sea communities - they call this seasteading. Mobilization on this has started https://www.seasteading.org/

- We will also see research bases on The Moon and Mars. Elon - Musk's grave will be on Mars at the peak of the Olympus Mons

What will the world look like in 200 years?

By 2118 we will have a lot more stability. By 2218 we will have ascended into being a whole new kind of society.

Key predictions

- No more disease. No more cancer. Medicine will be so advanced that we will see people living to 150+ years old. People will also forego having children but there will be some that choose to do this selectively.

- Wealth and earnings have no meaning - we will have a world striving to be completely equal. Leaders will be defined the goodness they do in the world and the entire society will have an active role in building culture and sustaining communities.

- Technology will be invisible. Things will just work seamlessly.

- There will be pop up communities that choose to live 'the old way' off of the land and with a lack of technology. They will be seen as important parts of historical society and many people in the world will crave to visit those experiences as a reminder of how we lived, and how close we came to really screwing everything up.

Placing archaic humans back in Africa and southern Eurasia and watching their natural behaviors would be an almost holy experience (though, to be totally fair, for the near future any resurrected human would have Sapiens DNA due to being incubated by a Sapiens mother so it might not be a pure recreation).

https://cta.ornl.gov/data/download36.shtml

* Fuel (usually diesel) consistently represents one of the largest costs for trucking companies.  

* In 2015 (latest data available), 2.75 million heavy duty trucks (class 7-8, gross vehicle weight over 26,000 lb) traveled 170.25 billion miles, consumed 28.88 billion gallons of fuel, and had an average fuel economy of 5.9 miles per gallon.   

* The Mercedes Benz eActros can travel 124 miles with an input of 240 kWh.

https://electrek.co/2018/02/21/mercedes-benz-all-electric-truck-eactros/ 

Therefore, for heavy-duty trucks with an internal combustion engine [(170.25 billion miles) * (5.9 miles per gallon)^-1 * ($3.00 per gallon)] = $86.57 billion

Vs.  

For electric heavy duty trucks, e.g. Mercedes Benz eActros [(170.25 billion miles traveled) * (0.518 miles per kWh )^-1 * ($0.13 per kWh)] = $42.73 billion. 

Savings = [$86.57 billion - $42.73 billion] = $43.84 billion

Fun fact: Average fuel economy loss from 50 to 70 mph (for light duty cars and trucks) = 24.5% (Chapter 4, Table 4.29)

Question:  
Since the electric tractor + trailer costs approx. $0.21 per mile, and the internal combustion engine tractor + trailer costs approx. $0.51 per mile in fuel costs, would the eActros customer potentially consider renting the battery pack (for a fee of $0.11 per mile) in order to decrease the initial cost of the electric powertrain?  Or, would it make more sense to purchase the battery pack outright?

About a tenth of that time ago is when humans arrived from the Old World into the New via the Bering land bridge, and about a tenth of *that* marks the divergence in time between the growth of major civilizations in the former and the latter.

In other words, we can loosely state that a 1% speed advantage in large-scale city-building led to decisive technological and *immunological* advantages.  Had the Old World petri dish advanced a little slower, or the New World a little faster, the latter's initially limited genetic mix would have had time to diversify and build more barriers against unfamiliar pandemics.  The latter would also have made the technological gap narrower - more akin to the contest between the failed medieval Viking settlements and native groups.

Now think about this in the context of general, superintelligent AI.  It will undoubtedly look strange, but in fact there's no reason to expect it will be fundamentally anything but human-like minds operating in other media, at faster speeds than ours.  Which is precisely the reason to worry.

An order of 1% difference in the schedule of technological and immunological evolution completely disrupted, and in some cases annihilated, the development of two entire continents of civilizations.  Get even a little bigger than that, such as the pacing among different hominid groups earlier, and you aren't even talking about colonialism - you're talking about extinction and replacement.

And let's be clear, none of it was *intended*: Humanity in its infancy had no comprehension that its advantages would wipe its neighbors from the Earth, nor did early modern Europeans understand what germs were and that diseases they were immune to would be devastating to peoples they (largely) felt no malice toward.  Their advantages were lethal to those who didn't possess them before they even understood what those advantages were.

Now consider superintelligent, general AI.  Its growth advantage on humanity's processing capability (both our brains and ""dumb"" computational technology that we use) is likely to far exceed 1%, and to do so long before it understands itself well enough to control the consequences of its output within a philosophical framework.

Assuming humanity survives - because contemplating extinction is utterly pointless unless it provides a means of escaping it - then we must expect patterns akin to colonialism to ensue: E.g., imposed governance structures that serve the convenience and logic of the external entity while papering over indigenous (human) needs and suffocating their natural growth.

Weapons that our societies had not evolved to hold in balance enter the mix; ideas counterfeited from the AI like a toddler's imitations driving violent cargo-cult political movements; and human beings rising to power because they serve the inscrutable interests of the AI, regardless (or because of) personalities and values we today would find repugnant. 

The worst consequence of such a state of affairs is that humanity would have no incentive to progress: The shockwave of our advancement would have outstripped our own reach, and we would be like senile grandparents (at best) smiling in befuddled pride at their descendant's Nobel Prize speech, not understanding a single word of the research that produced it.

**This is already happening**.  High-throughput combinatoric research is yielding technologies by rapid trial-and-error that are so weird we don't really understand what they do, and since that understanding is less and less useful to further progress, indifference toward the understanding is creeping in.  

If understanding takes a lifetime of education, but producing tangible progress only takes a modestly-competent dip into the Magic Elixir of AI and supercomputing, we are once again confronted by extinction via insufficient speed.  ""You don't have to be the fastest runner to outrun a lion - just faster than your traveling companion.""

Those who become highly skilled at serving the needs of AI systems would produce progress faster than those who ""most unsportingly"" insist on *knowing what they're doing* before doing it, and understanding what it means afterward.  They would be at a massive economic and cultural disadvantage, and we must be clear that over time that disadvantage would probably turn into a taboo if not a *crime*.

Dealing with too many other beings that understand it would complicate the AI's calculations, make its results less effective.  The ""god"" would be ""displeased"" by inquiries into its nature, and the villagers would be eager to appease its wrath so that they could once again secure its ""blessings.""

Such an advent, therefore, comes to resemble a mirror surface through which humanity de-evolves - more and more of its highest functions abstracted into other forms, and what remains increasingly resembling humans farther and farther back in time.  Proles, ignorant medieval peasants, hunter-gatherers, hominids, simple animals, and then just organic soup used for specialty calculations.

Once again, this is one of the more optimistic scenarios because of its gradualism and the maintenance of a homeostatic situation between humanity and its AI offspring.  Just as likely would be something like the Oxygen Catastrophe early in Earth's geologic history, where the output of a new life process nearly destroys life itself before building an adaptation out of the few survivors.",3,3,False,self,,,,,

2039,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2018-3-22,2018,3,22,1,863ilu,self.Futurology,Author looking for advice here. What do you think a human society that has existed for ~7 billion years would look like? [in-depth],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/863ilu/author_looking_for_advice_here_what_do_you_think/,S3Prototype297,1521650150,"Hi! I hope this is okay to post here. This is NOT a promotional post. I also need to lay out the premise of this world before I ask the ultimate question I'd like to pose to the users of this sub. Sorry for the length.

I'm an author working on a book with the following premise: Our universe is just one in a wider, infinite multiverse--however, this multiverse is not alternate universes but distinct ones. The Multiverse is to our universe as a galaxy is to a planet. It's a container of different universes with wildly different histories, totally unrelated to each other.

Because of the way these universes are created, the emergence of a specific sentient species is guaranteed. That means there are ""human universes,"" which are guaranteed, after billions of years and the formation of planets, to lead to the evolution of humans (though they'll have distinct differences from our version of humans). For example another race is called Janti, and there are ""janti universes"" as well, where instead of humans a collection of Janti planets would develop. 

This all sets the stage for the relevant part of what I'm asking. Basically, a human government emerges that claims dominion over many trillions of human universes. It has existed for ~7 billion years, and it has had access to advanced technology, ideas and methods from nearly every permutation of human society imaginable for that entire time period.

What do you think daily life under a government like this might look like? I'll give some more concrete details.

One of the most important factors of life in this government is that only some people can travel between universes. They're called Detached. Usually you find out you're a Detached when your universe suddenly disappears from existence and you're left floating in the void of the Multiverse. Because Detached can come from any kind of world, be it an empire like ancient China or a republic like 21st century America, their expectations and needs for daily life vary severely.

The government's solution to this problem since its inception has been to ""Age-gate"" some planets or entire universes, basically restricting them from advancing beyond any specific ""era"" of human development. So if you lived in a country like the Incan empire, you can elect to be settled into an ancient-style world, where every nation is at that exact level of technological and social advancement.

The universes that have no restrictions are called Tower universes. Some of these planets still choose to restrict their technological advancement, but there's no top-down requirement. The one restriction for all universes is against sentient AI, though non-sentient AI is fine.

Cloning and FTL travel exist, and this is a government with the resources of entire universes they can harvest.

So what in your imagination would it *realistically* be like to live under this government? Let's put it like this: Imagine our universe dies and you're the one who survives. You're Detached. You wake up in a room with an agent from this government explaining all this to you. Where do you want to go first? What do you want to see first? What do you expect to see?

Obviously there is no correct answer to this question, but given this sub's better understanding of the practical implications of future advancements in AI, cyber warfare, genetic engineering and potential futuristic economic policies, I was wondering what you guys might think. Just want to expand my imagination a little bit.

Hours ago, someone was killed , whilst someone was driving a driverless car, which is of course a tragedy, however I can't help but feel, that if it weren't a death by a driverless car, it wouldn't make worldwide press. People are killed by cars daily. Now we don't know if a human took over, or if there was a software bug

It has however fuelled those who are anti progress in to trying to ban the tech. I guess, it's hard to market ""Yes there'll be fatalities, but there'll be far fewer fatalities than with non driverless cars""

Unfortunately, today we did have a fatality, however the evidence certainly points to the fact that robots are way better drivers, than we are. It's a bit of a leap to try and ban these cars, because of one death imo

We are WIRED staff writer [Aarian Marshall](https://twitter.com/AarianMarshall), and transportation editor [Alex Davies](https://twitter.com/adavies47). We've written about autonomous vehicles and self-driving tech pretty much since the idea went mainstream. 

Aarian has been following the Uber [self-driving car fatality](https://www.wired.com/story/uber-self-driving-crash-video-arizona/) closely, and written extensively about [whats next for the technology](https://www.wired.com/story/uber-self-driving-car-crash-arizona-pedestrian/) as a result of it. 

Alex has been following the [technologys ascent](https://www.wired.com/story/guide-self-driving-cars/) from the lab to the road, and along with Aarianm has covered the [business rivalries](https://www.wired.com/story/self-driving-cars-disengagement-reports/) [in the industry](https://www.wired.com/story/uber-waymo-trial-settlement-self-driving-cars/). Alex also wrote about the [2004 Darpa challenge](https://www.wired.com/story/darpa-grand-urban-challenge-self-driving-car/) that made autonomous vehicles a reality.

Were here to answer all your questions about autonomous vehicles, what the first self-driving car fatality means for the technologys future and how it will be regulated, or anything else. Ask us anything!

https://cta.ornl.gov/data/download36.shtml

*   Fuel (usually diesel) consistently represents one of the largest costs for trucking companies.

*   In 2015 (latest data available), 2.75 million heavy duty trucks (class 7-8, gross vehicle weight over 26,000 lb) traveled 170.25 billion miles, consumed 28.88 billion gallons of fuel, and had an average fuel economy of 5.9 miles per gallon.

*   The Mercedes Benz eActros can travel 124 miles with an input of 240 kWh.

https://electrek.co/2018/02/21/mercedes-benz-all-electric-truck-eactros/

Therefore, for heavy-duty trucks with an internal combustion engine [(170.25 billion miles) * (5.9 miles per gallon)^-1 * ($3.00 per gallon)] = $86.57 billion

Vs.

For electric heavy duty trucks, e.g. Mercedes Benz eActros [(170.25 billion miles traveled) * (0.518 miles per kWh )^-1 * ($0.13 per kWh)] = $42.73 billion.

Savings = [$86.57 billion - $42.73 billion] = $43.84 billion

Fun fact: Average fuel economy loss from 50 to 70 mph (for light duty cars and trucks, internal combustion engine) = 24.5% (Chapter 4, Table 4.29)

Question:
Since the electric tractor + trailer costs approx. $0.21 per mile, and the internal combustion engine tractor + trailer costs approx. $0.51 per mile in fuel costs, would the eActros customer potentially consider renting the battery pack (for a fee of $0.11 per mile) in order to decrease the initial cost of the electric powertrain? Or, would it make more sense to purchase the battery pack outright?

Thanks.

2437,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2018-3-25,2018,3,25,21,870gwt,self.Futurology,A fundamental problem with General Artificial Intelligence I have not seen being discussed yet,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/870gwt/a_fundamental_problem_with_general_artificial/,ngt_,1521982059,"The potential existential threats to humanity caused by the creation of an autonomous Artificial General Intelligence have been extensively discussed in this thread during the last years.

While such dangers are indeed worrying, there is a fundamental problem for Artificial General Intelligence (and also for General Intelligence of biological origin) that I believe should be considered in such debates. This text presents that problem. 

The prototypical thought experiment of a runaway AGI is the [paperclip maximizer](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer): 

*First described by Bostrom (2003), a paperclip maximizer is an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) whose goal is to maximize the number of paperclips in its collection. If it has been constructed with a roughly human level of general intelligence, the AGI might collect paperclips, earn money to buy paperclips, or begin to manufacture paperclips. 
Most importantly, however, it would undergo an intelligence explosion: It would work to improve its own intelligence, where ""intelligence"" is understood in the sense of optimization power, the ability to maximize a reward/utility functionin this case, the number of paperclips. The AGI would improve its intelligence, not because it values more intelligence in its own right, but because more intelligence would help it achieve its goal of accumulating paperclips. Having increased its intelligence, it would produce more paperclips, and also use its enhanced abilities to further self-improve. Continuing this process, it would undergo an intelligence explosion and reach far-above-human levels.* 

At a closer look, this argument suffers from a hidden imprecision: 

*... more intelligence would help it achieve its goal of accumulating paperclips.*

The implicit assumption here is that an AGI can be endowed with the goal of accumulating paperclips. 

Such a goal cannot exist.  

The fundamental problem is that no AGI (and in fact no General Intelligence at all) can perceive the world directly. 
It perceives the world through sensors, which  no matter how advanced they are  can only be used to derive an internal, mental representation of the world in which the AGI lives. Each of the AGIs actions must be based on this internal representation and its transformations through the AGIs thinking process. However, its actions cannot be based on the world itself. 

Based on this insight, the sentence above needs to be rephrased as follows: 

... more intelligence would help it achieve its goal of ***creating the perception of*** accumulating paperclips.

So, how is this different from the previous version?

In fact, for humans, the difference is not that big, at least at first glance. For us, the simplest way to achieve a goal is to manipulate the world in such a way that the desired perception is obtained. 

If we want to perceive warmth, we collect some wood and ignite a fire. If we want to see paperclips accumulated, we build a paperclip factory. We are so much entrenched in this way of thinking that this sounds perfectly natural.

For an AGI however, an entirely different possibility would exist. 

Unlike humans, an AGI could create its own perceptions and feed these directly into its sensors. A paperclip maximizer could do so in a hyper-realistic way, thus perfectly fulfilling its (re-phrased) goal, and with much less effort than arduously manipulating the world.

So, figuratively spoken, what would prevent a paperclip maximizer from eternally watching its own self-produced paperclip porn, indistinguishable from reality? 

*Side note 1: For those doubting this possibility, all the paperclip maximizer would have to do is to get an extremely long lasting power supply (maybe an asteroid whose matter it could slowly transform into energy) and to head into deep space, never to be seen again.*

*Side note 2: I believe some humans are slowly starting to go that way, too. Drugs, pornography, social networks, video games, and virtual realities are increasingly used to create perceptions satisfying our hard-wired desires while increasingly reducing our interactions with the real world.* 

Coming back to our original line of thought, we can go one step further as a fascinating extract from this [article](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-j-linden/compass-pleasure_b_890342.html) shows:

*In the 1930s, the psychologist B. F. Skinner devised the operant conditioning chamber, or Skinner box, in which a lever press by an animal triggered either a reinforcing stimulus, such as delivery of food or water, or a punishing stimulus, such as a painful foot shock. Rats placed in a Skinner box will rapidly learn to press a lever for a food reward and to avoid pressing a lever that delivers the shock. 
In the 1950s, the psychologists James Olds and Peter Milner modified the chamber so that a lever press would deliver direct brain stimulation through deep implanted electrodes. What resulted was perhaps the most dramatic experiment in the history of behavioral neuroscience: Rats would press the lever as many as 7,000 times per hour to stimulate their brains. This was a pleasure center, a reward circuit, the activation of which was much more powerful than any natural stimulus. 
A series of subsequent experiments revealed that rats preferred pleasure circuit stimulation to food (even when they were hungry) and water (even when they were thirsty). Self-stimulating male rats would ignore a female in heat and would repeatedly cross foot-shock-delivering floor grids to reach the lever. Female rats would abandon their newborn nursing pups to continually press the lever. Some rats would self-stimulate as often as 2000 times per hour for 24 hours, to the exclusion of all other activities. They had to be unhooked from the apparatus to prevent death by self-starvation. Pressing that lever became their entire world.*

This does not only work for rats, but, as experiments have shown, also for humans. Two cases, described in the same essay, illustrate this claim:

*And so Patient B-19, [...] was wheeled into the operating room. Electrodes were implanted at nine different sites in deep regions of his brain, and three months were allowed to pass after the surgery to allow for healing. Initially stimulation was delivered to all nine electrodes in turn. However, only the electrode implanted in the septum produced pleasurable sensations. When Patient B-19 was finally allowed free access to the stimulator, he quickly began mashing the button like an 8-year-old playing Donkey Kong. According to the paper, During these sessions, B-19 stimulated himself to a point that, both behaviorally and introspectively, he was experiencing an almost overwhelming euphoria and elation and had to be disconnected despite his vigorous protests.*

*[...] Another recorded case [...] involved a woman who received an electrode implant in her thalamus, an adjacent deep brain structure, to control chronic pain. This technique has proven effective for some patients whose severe pain is not well-controlled by drugs. However, in this patient the stimulation spread to nearby brain structures, producing an intense pleasurable and sexual feeling: At its most frequent, the patient self-stimulated throughout the day, neglecting her personal hygiene and family commitments. A chronic ulceration developed at the tip of the finger used to adjust the amplitude dial and she frequently tampered with the device in an effort to increase the stimulation amplitude. At times she implored her family to limit her access to the stimulator, each time demanding its return after a short hiatus.*

These text passages evoke another, more dramatic possibility. 

Just as humans or rats, an AGI will need some kind of reward mechanism, so it can distinguish between good and bad perceptions. To do so, it would have to map the good perceptions onto rewards, the bad perceptions onto punishments and act in such a way that good perceptions were generated and bad perceptions avoided. 

Of course, an AGI would easily have full access to the inner workings of its own mind.

With this possibility, the AGI could fall prey to a behavioral attractor that would lead it through three phases: 

1.	Acting for rewarding perceptions 
2.	Simulating such perceptions
3.	Directly stimulating its internal reward circuits 

In other words: Imagine having the strongest, most euphoriant, most addictive drug possible permanently available and being able to unleash its full effects by a mere snap of the fingers. 

This is the situation in which an AGI would find itself. I call this the ***self-reward trap.***

Based on these reflections, I have three questions:

1. Is the self-reward trap a real problem for AGIs? If not, how could it be avoided?
2. Is it possible that humans have an important, underappreciated advantage over AGIs? 
After all, our reward centers are deeply embedded in our cranes and not easily accessible. We therefore continue being forced to manipulate the outer world to obtain the rewards we are craving for.
3. Is it a reasonable idea to upload ones mind into a computer or to become immortal? Both options might lead into the self-reward trap sooner or later.

I am looking forward to your feedback.

Mid-2019  Somewhat overdue, the next global recession begins, mostly due to bad debts and a round of mass layoffs originating in the Chinese economy. Stock market crashes and soaring unemployment occurs worldwide, matching and often exceeding the scale of the 2008 recession. Once again, the world experiences the worst recession since the Great Depression. By late 2019 the unemployment rate in both China and the US is approaching 10% with resulting domestic turmoil

2019 August  Following many similar incidents, a fresh skirmish occurs in the South China Sea, where a PLAN warship collides with and boards a Vietnamese fishing boat, arresting its crew for trespassing in Chinese territorial waters, sparking a diplomatic incident. Despite protests from Vietnam, backed by its newfound benefactor the US, the crew remains in Chinese captivity. Chinese forces undertake increasingly bold patrols of the surrounding waters, deterring further foreign shipping and unnerving neighbouring governments

2019 October  A small party (about 50 strong) of Chinese troops occupies an uninhabited, Vietnamese claimed island in the Spratly Islands archipelago, raising the PRC flag. Vietnam responds by sending several warships, carrying several hundred troops that attempt to land and reclaim the island. The PLA soldiers fire on the Vietnamese at their approach, killing and wounding several. The firefight escalates into a naval engagement in which one Vietnamese warship is sunk and several others damaged, inflicting over a hundred casualties and repulsing the assault. One Chinese warship suffers minor damage, incurring less than a dozen casualties

This action prompts a greater diplomatic incident, with several governments condemning Chinese aggression and unneighbourly behaviour. However, although some additional US warships and planes are moved closer to the disputed region, little results from the Chinese seizure. Xi Jinping is able to use this victory for domestic consumption, attempting to distract Chinese citizens from the already ailing Chinese economy. In the US, some hawks argue for a stronger response, but the US-Vietnamese relationship is not yet sufficiently warm for this to prevail. At home, Donald Trump is now running for re-election, but with approval ratings hovering around 40% and several prominent Democrats running in their party primaries. Democrat politicians generally call for restraint over a dispute that does not necessarily affect Americas core interests

2020 January  Further emboldened, Chinese forces have spent several months landing at numerous other islands across the South China Sea. Under intense diplomatic pressure, local Vietnamese, Malaysian and Filipino garrisons are often withdrawn without any fighting

Hoping to fully consolidate its position over the Spratly Islands, the PLAN initiates a long planned blockade of Taiping Island Taiwans largest outpost in the Spratly Islands with an airstrip and 800-strong military garrison. On January 12th more than a dozen Chinese warships surround the island and assert that any vessels approaching it will be boarded and any military equipment or supplies (including food) will be seized. The Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis has begun

The Taiwanese garrison has enough food for several weeks. Within days the newest Taiwanese supply convoy, under military escort, approaches the island. US warships are not part of the convoy but are positioned nearby. With both sides under orders not to back down, on January 21st a Chinese destroyer attempts to come alongside and board the lead supply ship. Taiwanese marines on board open fire at PLA marines attempting to board in cutters. This prompts the Chinese Destroyer to fire warning shots, which quickly escalates into a major naval skirmish. Two Taiwanese supply vessels and a warship are sunk, while Chinese vessels suffer less damage. Positioned further back, US warships do not open fire, causing the outnumbered Taiwanese convoy to retreat

Amidst intense behind the scenes negotiations, Chinese, Taiwanese and American leaders denounce the other side as warmongers, attempting the win the propaganda battle. More warships race to the surrounding waters, including the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and Japanese and Australian ships. Plans are made for further convoys and possibly airdrops to supply the beleaguered Taiping Island garrison

Fearful of the intervention of the US Navy once fully mobilized, Xi Jinping orders phase 2 of the operation to proceed immediately. In the early hours of January 24th intense airstrikes begin on Taiping Island, followed by an amphibious assault by 4,000 Chinese marines at dawn. Despite incurring hundreds of casualties, the tiny 46 hectare island does not lend itself at all to defence and the PLA Marines have forced the surrender of the Taiwanese forces within hours

The Chinese leadership announces the recapture of the island as a New Years gift to the Chinese people'. Jubilant scenes in Chinese cities are broadcast around the world. Globally, Chinese diplomats assert their countrys right to deal with uncompliant rebels, while Xi Jinping declares for domestic consumption that Chinas undisputed right to the South China Sea has been restored. Behind the scenes, Chinese pressure grows on Taiwan to accept its status as Chinas new third special administrative region alongside Hong Kong and Macao

2020 February  Lacking the means to recapture the island by themselves, Taiwan looks to the US. Following several days of intense discussion, President Trump decides that the Chinese have gone way too far this time! declaring on Twitter that If China chooses to act like a PARIAH STATE they will be TREATED LIKE ONE!

The US Navy begins reinforcing its assets across East Asia while diplomatic feelers are sent out to US allies concerning a response. Trump personally calls Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen, further angering China. Many wonder if the US Navy will be ordered to clear the Chinese blockade and for the marines to storm the island

Instead, on February 2nd the US Congress meets in emergency session and (almost unanimously) passes the Taiwan Independence Act 2020 acknowledging the islands independence and establishing a mutual military alliance, which President Trump signs into law just hours later. At almost the exact same time Taiwans parliament also passes an independence declaration supported by all major parties and over 90% of MPs. As part of this orchestration the UN Secretary-General immediately invites Taiwan to apply for membership. That same day, the US Secretary of State arrives in Taipei with a diplomatic delegation including the new US ambassador and staff for the newly declared embassy. Several US warships also dock. Altogether the US has crossed multiple red lines China had drawn concerning Taiwans status all in 24 hours

Chinas reaction is immediate. Its ambassador to the US is withdrawn and diplomatic relations are severed. The already turbulent trade relationship is halted entirely (despite the inevitable damage to both economies). China also threatens to cut off relations and trade with any country that recognizes Taiwan or aids the unrepentant rebels

Meanwhile, PLA and PLAN forces commence a blockade of the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen and Matsu Islands just off the Chinese coast (Taipeis largest remaining outposts outside of Taiwan itself). Taiwanese forces on the islands had previously been reinforced and now number some 20,000-strong. On February 6th two Taiwanese supply craft are shot down while attempting to resupply the garrison by air. This prompts the US to reinforce the Taiwanese on the next run and declare that outside interference to airdrops conducted on legally Taiwanese territory will not be tolerated.

On February 8th the next run is attempted  some twenty Taiwanese, American and Japanese transport planes escorted or otherwise supported by over 400 aircraft (including the presence of two American aircraft carriers and one Japanese helicopter carrier) approach the island

Unwilling to back down, Xi Jinping orders any further airdrops to be stopped by military force. PLA air defences open fire on the lead planes, leading to a massive air battle that continues for over 12 hours. Six transport planes and 30 allied fighters are shot down, as well as 28 Chinese fighters with numerous air defence positions destroyed. All but 4 of the allied fighter losses are due to ground fire, with allied planes still proving generally superior to their Chinese counterparts

The Kinmen air battle sparks off a broader phase of air-sea combat in the waters around Taiwan. The US declares a no-fly-zone in the Taiwan Strait between Taiwan and Kinmen and that any Chinese vessels operating in a designated zone covering the waters around Taiwan and most of the South China Sea will be stopped or sunk. China meanwhile declares that it will defend its territorial waters from outside aggression asserting its sovereignty over much the same region

With clear battle lines drawn, the world holds its breath as numerous naval and air battles erupt across the region, also causing significant disruption to commercial shipping and once again sending stock markets tumbling. On February 9th a serious attempt is made by Chinese forces against the US carrier groups south of the Taiwan Strait for the first time. A huge volley of missiles in launched, sinking two American destroyers and damaging several other ships. The attack sees limited success. The USS Ronald Reagan suffers two direct hits and 500 casualties and is forced to withdraw to Japan for repairs, though dozens of other missiles are either shot down or fall harmlessly into the sea. The other Allied carriers are withdrawn a few hundred miles south or east of Taiwan but remain a potent threat. Japanese and Australian naval forces become involved, prompting China to severe all diplomatic relations and trade with them as well. China is able to veto a UN Security Council resolution condemning their attacks and demanding they stand down, with Russias abstention

Over the next week some twenty-five Chinese, eight American and two Japanese major surface combatants (generally frigates or destroyers) are sunk along with hundreds of aircraft and a number of smaller vessels. Submarines score heavily but also suffer frightful losses, with America losing six and China no fewer than eighteen. The sole Chinese-built aircraft carrier remains far to the north, beyond the declared battle zone

By mid-February the Chinese, having lost a third of their major surface combatants and a quarter of their submarines, begin withdrawing their remaining ships, fearful of further losses. Allied vessels hold the upper hand, though soon only submarines are able to operate effectively in the Taiwan Strait itself due to Chinese land-based missiles. Three Chinese vessels have been sunk in a fresh battle near Taiping Island, forcing the PLAN to reduce their presence to submarines for the time being. A joint US/Taiwanese task force is prepared to retake the island, now garrisoned by 2,000 Chinese marines, just part of the 30,000 now garrisoning outposts across the Spratly islands

Even while the PLAN suffers major losses at sea, more than half a million PLA troops have amassed in the vicinity of Kinmen, while land-based missiles are deterring Allied vessels from approaching by sea. On February 16th an intense air and land bombardment of Kinmen begins. The next day tens of thousands of Chinese marines and soldiers storm the islands, focusing on Greater Kinmen. Outnumbered 20:1, Taiwanese forces (and several companies of US marines airlifted with great difficulty) put up a heroic resistance. However they are unable to dislodge the PLA beachhead

Though suffering severe attrition, the PLA Air Force is able to gain temporary air superiority over Kinmen, with Allied fighters having to operate from Taiwan over 100 miles away or from even more distant aircraft carriers. By the end of February the islands are all but overrun. Attempts at either reinforcement or withdrawal are unsuccessful. Less than a thousand Allied troops are able to escape to Taiwan by air or on commandeered craft. On March 3rd the remaining allied soldiers on Kinmen surrender. Of the islands civilian population of 150,000, maybe 10% have died in the fighting, sparking global condemnation. Further north, Taiwan begins evacuating the Matsu islands, seeing them as even more indefensible. PLA forces seize them after the evacuation is completed

2020 March  Eager for a clear victory, President Trump orders Allied forces to recapture Taiping Island and the other Chinese outposts in the South China Sea. Intense bombardments of the outposts follow, destroying the PLA Air Force presence in the process. An Allied armada (originally intended for Kinmen) arrives off Taiping Island on March 9th, beginning a huge bombardment that saturates almost the entire surface of the island (which is 50 times smaller than Iwo Jima). Marines storm it three days later, with the surviving Chinese garrison (80% of them having been killed or wounded in the bombardment) surrendering the next day. In the next few weeks, further operations demolish or isolate the other Chinese outposts (also known as the Great Wall of Sand) across the region

Aftermath: Two months after the crisis began, a stalemate appears to set in. China has captured Kinmen and Matsu and inflicted significant damage on Taiwanese and American naval forces. However, their own navy and air force have suffered crippling losses, leaving them unable to reinforce their now beleaguered outposts in the South China Sea. World opinion has generally shifted against them as well

Intense peace talks begin as the battles around Taiwan start to wind down towards the end of March. The new status quo comes into being, with China retaining possession of the Kinmen and Matsu islands but Allied forces dominant in the South China Sea. China refuses to give up its claims to the region however, setting the stage for further conflict.

Numerous countries start recognizing Taiwan, with China unable to follow through on its threats to cut off trade with so many of its neighbours. At home Xi Jinpings popularity begins to waver, given the PLANs inability to hold onto the South China Sea or force Taiwan into submission despite initial confidence. Many accuse him of unwisely provoking the USand turning China into a pariah state. Meanwhile, Trumps approval rating shoots over 60% - setting him up for re-election.

Estimated death toll: First battle of Taiping  500 Second battle of Taiping  1500 Battle of Kinmen  30,000 (6,000 Allied, 9,000 PRC, 15,000 civilians) Reconquest of S. China Sea Outposts - 3,000 Sea/Air battles  10,000 (rough guess) = ~45,000",3,0,False,self,,,,,

**Introduction**

In an increasingly automated economy, the future of human commerce will come to a fork in the road. On one hand, we have proposals for Universal Basic Income (UBI) schemes to be paid to all individuals, mandated by law from the proceeds of private enterprise, on a global scale. On the other hand, new technologies such as blockchains and decentralized distributed networks may offer a solution for an automated future. 

As human beings, our labor is what creates a baseline value system. We work to provide for ourselves. In an automated economy, the human being is removed from the equation. Schemes like the UBI are intended to balance the equation by using the force of law to ensure the basis of industry continues to function. All funded, of course, through taxation schemes that require a non-automated industry to continue to exist long after obsolescence. This essay contends that to maintain a global exchange economy, we must automate the exchange of value as well as production; in tandem we would convert humans from a labor force to account holders for all the machines under their individual ownership, ensuring a stake in the economy as automation erases the current basis of valuation, human labor.

**The Machine Economy: An Essay on The Communication of Value in an Automated Economy**


To understand the future automated economy, we must first briefly explore the history of the exchange of value. We must explore the history of money as a technology, and how it has guided us from Ancient Mesopotamian barter systems to modern Globalism, in order to understand the trajectory of our economics into a post-human labor future. 


**The History of Money: Communicating Value**


Money, at its core, is simply a method of communication. Prior to the invention of money as a means of exchange, value was transmitted by bartering. This was based on the assessment of needs versus immediate risks regarding trading off valued goods. The exchange of value as a concept seems to be inherent to humans. Throughout history weve placed value in many things, some tangible, others not. Perceived risks often drove our transactions, and for many generations, prior to the written word, the exchange of value was essentially the oral contract. However, for our purposes, we will focus on the history of the barter system in civilization. The barter system is an exchange system by which goods and services are traded for other goods and services. This system, while ancient, survives to this day even among advanced economies, though to a lesser degree. Early civilizations, such as the (Mesopotamian) Akkadian Empire used barter systems throughout their lands and with other empires (Arensberg, C. M., Pearson, H. W., Polanyi, K. 1957). Gold currency was typically reserved for those of higher status, whereas the overall trade economy was a complex barter system. The barter system of this Ancient World was sufficiently sophisticated to keep accurate ledgers, however, the accurate exchange of value as an abstraction was still an elusive concept, as was the mass circulation of currencies. At this stage in the history of money, value was an arbitrary idea based on the labors of humans and animals-divided by their time. It took a certain amount of labor to create a particular item or service, that labor is divided into time. That time is, in turn, calculated against potential risks far more real and dangerous in this era than the economic dangers we perceive today. This laid the foundations for what would be centralized accounting ledgers and denominated currency in much later civilizations.

**Fiat Currency and Labor Economy**

Money is a system of communication, an abstraction of value that we, as humans, perceive inherently. Humans went from the barter system to using items of perceived worth as a conveyance of value. At this point, gold and silver are the predominant forms of currency. But the supply of these metals is finite, and with an increasing population, metals become harder to divide and carry. This led to the Promissory Note. This concept migrated from China where it was first used (Szczepanski, K. 2017-03-08), to Europe where the Knights Templar began to spread the promissory note concept. This normalized the previously controversial idea of paper currency along their establishments across pilgrimage routes from England to Judea (Ralls, K. 2007-04-15). 

The promissory note was the first paper currency. Despite its gold backing, the promissory note did not derive its value from the gold, but from the value depicted on the note itself. The Gold Standard is based essentially on the promissory note model. It can be argued that even the gold standard was a form of fiat, as there was never any real way to determine the validity of a government's gold and silver holdings. In essence, it was the promissory note that denoted the worth of the gold and not the other way around, even if the true value of gold and silver never changed, the speculative value has limits because the supply is finite. This was one of many reasons the United States and most of the world moved away from the Gold Standard, and then widely adopted the Fractional Reserve System in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Fractional Reserve fiat currency is based on mathematics. The aggregate of our production, which is equal to our credit and the faith our creditors place in our ability to pay them back. In this process, the creation of debt and cash go hand in hand. When we add leverage requirements, we get exponential growth, this is an inflationary process, so interest rates are what is used to control excess inflation in the money supply (Quickonomics.com, 2017). The fractional reserve system, and all systems before it, however, still use the labor of humans-- divided by time --as a metric of value (Smith, A. 1776). For this reason, I posit that even the exponential growth of fractional reserve banking has a serious problem shared by its predecessors, scaling.


**The Blockchain.**


It is impossible for me to discuss blockchain technology without talking about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital cryptographically secured and defined digital asset based on an immutable ledger system. What Bitcoin achieved, was to turn digital information into unassailable digital property, and make it tradable on the open internet (Nakamoto, S. 2008). 

Its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, is an enigmatic figure who has yet to be identified. This however, did not stop him from collaborating with other developers. The original whitepaper for Bitcoin was first submitted to Source Forge, and later moved to GitHub where its source code can be viewed, and submissions made for code adoptions. The first Bitcoin was mined in 2009. Since then, Bitcoin has outperformed gold, silver, palladium, platinum and every known national currency in value appreciation. It has also given birth, by further development of the underlying technology, to an entire class of currency and economic networking known as the alt-coin market. 

In this market, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) work as a means for start-up technology companies and organizations to seek the funding necessary to build blockchain research and ventures without having to rely on research grants, loans, or crowdfunding (Sherry, B. 2018-01-29). In this way, they can generate capital for the project and return on investment for buyers of their currency, without the need for brokerages or other intermediaries. It is a very risky and unregulated market where money is made, but often lost to scams, hacks, and government interventions. Despite this, the growth of the alt-coin market has shown no signs of slowing down, nor has investment in Bitcoin. With exchanges like Binance.com boasting 100,000 to 200,000 new registered users per day (Lam E., Kang S., White, T. 2018-01-10), cryptocurrency has thus managed to lay the foundation for the 5th and most dramatic change in monetary history, automated communication of value.

**The Automated Economy and the Universal Basic Income.**


The concerns of economists, politicians, and workers in the 21st century is, and will continue to be, how to eke out a living in an economy where robots and algorithms perform all the work (Miller, C. C. 2017-05-03). Humanity has based its most fundamental economic valuation on the blood, sweat, and tears of human labor. Entire political blocs have risen and fallen under this very basic idea of economic value. But now, our labor is becoming less and less necessary. 

The concept of technological unemployment was laughable only a decade ago, but today with machine learning, automation, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing making regular headlines, people are finally asking the question, What will happen to my job? Automation will affect much more than blue collar workers. White collar jobs are on the line as well. Most jobs that require record keeping and analysis, accounting, logistics, materials handling, packaging, transportation, sanitation, and even most police investigation will be automated. In response, some scientific and political organizations have partnered with governments to form a consensus for a universal basic income system. 

The Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a collection of taxes based on profits made by corporations who use AI systems to replace their human workforce, carbon taxes, corporate and capital gains taxes, as well as civil asset forfeitures. Disbursements are then sent from a centralized authority where the money is distributed to national governments (Futurism.com 2017). 

The UBI would be funded by a pool of money collected by global and national institutions who would then disburse funds to various nations or localities, convert it into local currency where appropriate, and pay the affected former workers. This would turn all affected human beings into legal employees of their respective governments. If the proceeds of production are to go to a workforce that doesn't exist, then it is only a government that can mandate this. They would have to convert everyone in the country to government employees and pay accordingly, but what does that do to the relationship between our now constitutional government that protects our rights, and a government-as-a-national-employer that reserves the power to restrict the rights of its employees? For the UBI to work(to meet scaling issues), all industry would have to be nationalized, all humans would necessarily become wards of the state, and all private property would then have to be dissolved and appropriated by the state for later distribution. 

It is my view that such a scheme, one that benefits from the taxation of industries and revenue sources that will no longer exist, will be forever in deficits; further, that the UBI as it is known today would be devastatingly inflationary and without a system of valuation by which to maintain stability (Freedman, D. H. 2016-06-13). It violates the rights of individuals to their own inherent and real property. It removes the individual entirely from the economic process when accounting for how long the UBI operates. It appears that the UBI may be a way to pay off those left behind by technological unemployment rather than offer a solution for the inclusion of as many as we can into a new kind of economy. One that allows for the creation of virtual real estate, transferable digital property, and electronic services.

I write these words, not because I don't think it can be done, but because I believe it will be done regardless of what we want. The Universal Basic Income is a final death throe of old world economics. It forces an automated world to drag the ideologies and economics of the Industrial Revolution forward another 100 years, with all of the struggles and inequalities that go with it.  

The goal is the obsolescence of money. 


**The Machine Economy.**



If we're going to automate production, then it lacks forethought to neglect automating the exchange of value. Automating the exchange of value, fundamentally changing money to be a means for our machines to transact value, would necessitate that we convert the human owners of these machines into account owners. We can prepare for this today by using personalized blockchain ledger-based accounts. For instance, a digital currency can be used for service interactions between machines. Excess energy from your solar power system can be sold via this currency as a service rendered. 

Decentralizing and automating digital processing, fabrication, assembly, and service transactions linked to a single ownership account on a blockchain, would ensure that the owner gets paid and continues to participate in the economy. Decentralized economic networks and automation in a machine economy would make a cellphone, an electric car, or an idle computer a contributor to the economy, while the person reaps the benefits. With blockchain technology turning digital information into digital property, virtual environment simulations would be able to sell virtual property, create and sell virtual consumer goods and services, and even help create virtual societies in which people may live and work (Ordano, E., Meilich, A. Jardi, Y., Araoz, M. 2013). 

Concepts like distributed networking and decentralized processing are already in use. For instance, the BOINC system, relies on distributed computing for the storage and processing of signals data for SETI and other scientific programs observations. If the value of labor is work divided by time, then this can be transferred on to an idle CPU to render a service that benefits the owner (Anderson, D.P. 2002). 

Distributed networking and processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and blockchain are nascent technologies whose potential to fundamentally alter our understanding of human economics has not been realized. With distributed network systems and new, novel methods of computation, the expansion of human economics into the territory of the virtual is inevitable. We have not yet reached the limit of technological progress, and it may be that no such limit likely exists (Gelley, B., Vidal, C., Gendler, A. 2016-12-19) 

Our technological horizon, for the time being, seems to be as elusive as the edge of the observable universe is to the astronomer. For this reason, the question of scaling digital assets and decentralization of production will eventually need to become essential processes in the creation of any machines for public or private use. These machines will have to have these concepts as built-in functions because we will need to create new economies far from the influence of Earth and her laws. I speak, of course, of the colonization of space. Without the scaling ability of automated, decentralized economic models, and the digitized exchange of value concept, human civilization may not survive the vacuum of space. 

The economics of a space-faring human civilization has yet to be truly conceptualized. The colonization of space would, in my view, necessitate the maturity of the concept of economic decentralization, as any long-term expedition into the Final Frontier would require the extraction and refinement of raw materials, the production and application of resources, and all decision-making powers to be independent of the decision-making authorities of Earth. (Smith, C. M, Davies, E. T. 2012). 


We will not have the luxury of a choice between one system or another. Our technological progress, as demonstrated by this essay, will drag us into compliance. It is impossible to say for certain where this untraveled road will lead, what this future will look like, or identify all the challenges a concept of this scale could face on the road to maturity. But, as we spread into our own cosmic backyard, we will need to address these issues economically, technologically, politically, and even spiritually. There may still be a Great Filter ahead of us (Urban, T. 2014-05-21). Tackling automated economics today, and how humanity can benefit from it, will increase our chances of surviving into the next chapter of our existence. 



**Conclusion**


The question now becomes: If you automate industry and the exchange of value between machines for services rendered, and converted the human labor force to individual account holders for the properties they own that will render these services, then what is the daily relevance of the act of commerce for human beings? 

The impact of daily commerce for individuals would be minimal. At this level of technological maturity, money, as it is understood today, becomes not much more than a constantly updated ledger that tracks the exchange of goods and services for the purposes of managing resources in real-time. 

Our daily lives would be consumed with exploration, education, and innovation without having to concern ourselves with menial tasks or the real threat of poverty. With technology, our labor no longer must be the base valuation of economic activity. Machine labor can now fill this role both in tangible and intangible goods and services. The ultimate goal of money should be its own obsolescence as we understand it today. In this essay, I have shown the trajectory of money as a means of communicating value from history, into the future of automated economics, and proposed an economic model for the benefit of people based on the potential of technologies realized, or those yet to be. 

I urge the reader to expand these technological concepts to their most mature ends, and to integrate them, using your imagination, and to expand upon the idea with your own ideas.

Imagine you're an engineer/scientist and you're testing a new material to build a skycreeper. It's called Newron and you know it's hard as steel but you need to know that it's gonna last long enough. So you run some tests and you apply some weight to it for a month. It bended just a little, let's say 0.001. So you calculate and it results it can hold the required weight for decades. After one year, your skycreeper is nothing but dust. What happened?

Well, the same thing happens with 99% of predictions nowadays: the Linear Fallacy. You may thing that the rate of progress is always the same so you have just to multiply what happened in the past but this is absolutely wrong and misleading. It turned out that Newron loses its strenght in an exponential way but the guy just made one single calculation. Can some scientists be so damn stupid? Yes, in this case at least.

Let's take AI. Most CS experts were amazed when AlphaGo beated Lee Sedol, they thought it would take decades for this to happen but decades ago when chess was mastered by computers, predictions were not about decades but centuries. So, what the hell is going on for smart people to fall again and again in this huge mistake?

I don't know. Maybe there's an emotional need for pessimism so you can motivate people to be productive and fight for the future, maybe it's just a bad wiring of our limited brains, maybe it takes too much energy to do the proper calculations about the rate of progress and people tends to avoid this math problems, maybe it's not important to think about the future... Who knows.

The facts are that you can make a choice between limiting your brain to linear thinking or try to be realistic and push it to think exponentially to accurately predict the future. I'm gonna say something: by 2028, almost 100% of energy consumption will come from solar. What do you think? It's Kurzweil's prediction.

If you're more interested in this topic, here's the main article from him that allowed so accurate predictions: http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns

Can you imagine we progress the same rate that 1000 years ago?

By considering oversized PV, the algorithm approximated the energy storage requirements for increasingly oversized PV. The result was a graph showing [all possible configurations] (https://i.imgur.com/5b98qrU.png) of PV and energy storage. Here is an [illustration](https://i.imgur.com/OTyTMvb.gif).

The previous graph shows an inverse relationship between PV and energy storage; this property is important to optimize for the cheapest system. Since PV and energy storage have different costs, the algorithm computes the [price of each configuration](https://i.imgur.com/i3PC2lY.png) and determines the most cost-effective system shown by the red x. 

The most cost-effective system generates over twice as much energy than the electric grid requires. This extra energy (about 3700 TWh for the US) could be used to power standby CO2 scrubbers which is enough to extract 500 million metric tons of CO2 from the atmosphere each year. 

Based on the current analysis, the most cost-effective system would cost 11 trillion dollars and require a 5,000 GW PV System and 16,650 GWh of storage.

I'm working on a class project. We're developing a pitch and prototype of what it would take/be like to have a credit card with a tracking device in it. Imagine it being like = track my Iphone..but for your Mastercard.

What sort of technology would we need to be familiar with to bring something like this into development? We're not talking about bluetooth tracking devices for your wallet..those already exist and are not nearly as reliable or accurate as our hypothetical device.

We're pitching some sort of secondary chip in your card that lets you ping it's location or track it from an app on your smartphone, so when you lose that card partying in Ibiza or Palm Beach on Spring Break you can locate it.

I'm asking here specifically about project development, what sort of tech exists already that would allow us to do this, if any?

Who (profession wise) do you recommend I talk to about developing this sort of thing?

I need to build a prototype of some sort for class, any tips on how I'd go about doing that?

Thanks in advance and I look forward to the discussion.

I'm not that good at summarizing so I'l just post this review from good reads

While there may be ways to write laws so that even the lower middle class and the poorest sections of our society can get justice, I feel that the way it will actually happen is that there will be no way for someone very poor to get any justice at all. Once the self-driving cars hit the road.

The poor may think they will get justice if something happens, but, in reality, they won't. They will just get run over. That's my prediction any way.
