I'm on the Keto wagon for the last two months (with a fall off around Christmas, but I couldn't keep myself under control. Lost progress - didnt gain any weight, but back on the wagon).

However, my main issue comes from the fact that I cannot swallow pills and I need to take meds in the morning. I take my OMAD around 7pm every evening. I fast during the day and I drink my KetoAde whilst at work. I pretty much stay OMAD IF on the weekend as well (as I am doing today since its a holiday). However, I need to take meds in the morning. Now, I've never been able to swallow pills and I take them ""like a dog"" with a bit of food. I usually do this in the morning at 7am.

Is that ruining my IF? It's a small amount, enough to allow me to swallow my meds and vitamins. How much am I at risk because of a small square of cheese or two?

Does anyone here have any information on ""future studies"" masters programs. I am looking at University of Turku Finland, and University of Hawaii and university of Huston for their programs. My main question is what kind of career or job can I get with this degree? Is this degree even usable? I thought out many great and interesting future concepts but I think it might be prudent to be practical in my career outlook. 

I just don't want to spend 30k in getting a degree that is useless.

Motherless babies will become possible. So men could have also more reproductive rights (the same or even more reproductive rights than women). Men could begin to think that women will lose their reproductive value and become unnecessary in a reproductive point of view. In the more distant future all male society may exist. And also all female societies.

Sterile women who cannot get pregnant at all( like women with CAIS) could also use the technology to reproduce. In fact anyone could reproduce with these things. Even old women.

Whenever the subject comes up. Its always one machine that does it all.  
Wouldnt it be vastly easier and more simple to have a factory that produces robots that can build another factory ? I should think something like a robot that is able to move around freely should have better potential to build a factory that in turn could produce other robots or harvesting machines. Im just thinking that a von neuman probe would be far more simple if its not a single entity but rather a small ""team"" of machines with different purpose. A robot that can move around on the factory to repair it.

https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/05/marc-andreessen-audio-will-be-titanically-important-and-vr-will-be-1000-times-bigger-than-ar/

So according to Marc through a podcast, audio will be titanically important in the near future. YouTube and audio-based commentary and interfaces will be the forefront of UI. This scares me. And Ill go in depth to why it does:

 I have audiophobia due to having panic attacks from certain noises. I am a VR and gaming nerd, but I have to play my games in complete silence or I get REALLY anxious. Viewing audio-based commentary like YouTube even with captions bothers me still. Every time I go out, I wear full block earplugs to drown all audio if possible. Thankfully I can still speak to people with them on.

My life literally revolves around silence from all digital sources. I just cannot handle it, if the future is audio then I probably will be similar to a Luddite.

Im also extremely worried about the future of information for the deaf and hard of hearing. Its going to be so hard for them unless implants become perfect, in other words I will be in an even worse position with my audiophobia.

This isnt a future I want. Reading and deaf accessible gaming is integral to my life. I do not want it to go away.

The object was not to fool the networks but to  determine whether they identified objects in the same way as humans do.  The networks did a poor job of identifying such items as a butterfly,  an airplane and a banana, according to the researchers.

Now be prepared, In no way am I a writer, so bear with my grammar and mistakes, I have a lot of info and just wanna get it down.... Do you understand our environment right now. The changes that are occuring every year that are spearheaded by the corporate and globally tied, sinister, and ego driven leaders. America since 9/11 has jacked up it's citizen monitoring 10000% after ""foreign terrorists"" attacked us.. makes sense. This personal information is bought and sold between government and corporation so both will win. Government gets to spy on everyone and the Corporations find out the wants and desires of millions of people.. add different stimuli to said environment and see how people react. With Alexa, your phones with shady apps- snapchat is one.. I know for a fact government entities can easily access snapchats without warrants-- having worked for one. This type of monitoring is paralzying us as human beings.. the thought of being video taped all the time has turned us into lifeless, unable to talk to strangers about real things, sad people. Which is what they want. How can the next Sons of Liberty be created if no one can get together in secret? Look up Jeremy Bentham's PanOpticon and then look the shifts in America in the last 20 years. You already see them slowly showing you that everyone is listening.. look at the Ads around you.. did you maybe mention cat food to someone a day ago.. and you got an ad on your phone or TV for different cat food..problem is you dont own any cats. What we have in America is Corporate stroking men and women who are afraid to stand up for what is right in fear of losing the little power they achieved. They have an army of drones at their disposal.. YOU THINK THEY CARE ABOUT YOUR AR-15's... people we are being progandized against.. We are china essentially in that respect..moral crisis after moral crisis plastered on the news... one year it's cops killing blacks.. next year is rape... next year its abortion.. lets all see what this year's moral panic is gunna be.. I mean cmon, we preach freedom and equality and all that nonsense.. but deep down, do you really feel free?? We are going to turn into, if not already, Anti-Social Angry Anxious Zombies with Material's being the only thing that quenches our never ending thirst. These people think the common man is trash, expendable, and dumb.. When in fact, we're the smartest we've ever been. We all sit and type about it, yet will do nothing about it.. exactly what they want. If you havent seen already the president is the shogun of america.. really doesn't do much.. its congress that does everything.. Trumps lasted this long because it keeps the heat of congress because they havent done SQUAT other than slowly allow rights to be taken away (4th Amendment) from Americans.. You people need to understand these people are INCOMPETENT. imagine if your favorite philosophy professor became president or senator.. he would probably try to do what is best for the people... the issue is; no common person can truly get enough recognition to get into a pivotal role for change. You need to be rich, apart of either red or blue-- which is ridiculous to think about, that millions of American opinions are boiled to a duel of colors. WE NEED TO RESTRUCTURE THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT THERE HAS BEEN TOO MANY SECRETS, TOO MANY LIES, TOO MANY INSTANCES OF TOTAL DISREGARD FOR AMERICANS WHO DO NOTHING BUT WORK AND GO HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES.. PEOPLE.. BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.. WE NEED TO TAKE A STAND.. WE ARE ALL SLAVES TO THIS MISERABLY OPERATED SYSTEM. IT WILL BE HARD BUT GREAT THINGS COME AFTER CHAOS.",10,1

Krugman is not a technologist but its not hard to imagine how he would react if he was asked: what about technology? The reason for societies is the division of labour which, in turn, is the building block of the economy. Economy, indeed, is the most fundamental layer of any society. It is said that the market addresses the most basic human needs. And things like morality belong to higher levels. Bullshit. At least that is what I will try to argue: Morality is far more fundamental than that. Morality doesnt address human basic needs you might say. Again bullshit (I would use stronger words if the article wasnt about morality).  
 How can we change the values of society? What does it have to do with economic value? Sharing economy, for instance, changes the notion of value in the economy. Its not that people wont spend but they will buy services that enable them to share stuff instead of producing them. What is the role of tools we build? Technology enables us to have such a weird economy which potentially can address many of our environmental concerns. Then what is the role of technology in morality? Technology helps us to redefine value, moral value. And finally how will it affect the structure of firms, from small firms to states?

Pros: 
- Opens up jobs
- Allows people to settle deadly business without hurting others
- Boosts economy

Cons:
- Death rate increase
- Hits becoming cyclical (Family A orders a hit on family B, family B retaliates, family A retaliates, so on).

Requierments: 
- Slight lowering of gun control (very, VERY controversial)
- A change in morals

No, I don't mean Purge. I mean Person X orders a hit on person Y and person Y is notified of the fact. Only person Y is legally allowed to be killed for a state controled price. If any other people are killed or assaulted, the hit contract is nullified and the contractor is considered a murderer/assault perpetrator.

I think large companies have seen the future and it definitely lies in full automation, with hand crafted things becoming more of a boutique item or ridiculously expensive. In obvious fashion though, these large companies would much rather give you a frown and apologize that you are now redundant and give you the boot. But what if they didn't have to worry about having to give that frown, what if they could have that worker show up the next day to work, smiling, and happy.

&amp;#x200B;

My idea is the most straight forward and money making plan for any large company with an ""expendable"" workforce. Essentially with upcoming and current technologies you can keep the human side of your workforce working with the automated side. The 2 computing powers of the human brain coupled with a basic to advanced AI could possibly result in a almost non existent failure rate and on time production schedules. The process is based around  a buy in system, the company holds their meeting stating to the facility that they are closing their doors to their workers, but are offered a major stock in the company, that stock being their automated replacement.

If a company was to buy out/pay severances to a facility, purchase the robots, technologies, and pay over paid nerds to run such things, I can only imagine the cost in the long run or even the immediate cost. With technologies coming like the neural mesh where we will be able to integrate with a robotic system or AI we could most definitely control a basic robot to do our job along side us, or better yet take the stress and strain away from deadlines and quotas. This will be a 2 for the price of one type situation, but as with everything there will have to be a catch. To keep your job, you need to purchase the robot.

&amp;#x200B;

Hard sell! But think of it like financing a car, you will pay for it to own it one day, and sometimes the payments are ridiculous. But the beauty of this system is that the worker pays for it by continuing their job, whether you put enough time in or not the robot essentially learned your job and maybe even improved on it, or made it more streamlined. Whatever happens as long as you gave your initial investment into the company to get it moving, you're guaranteed your job as well as a lighter work load. Again, really hard sell to people, their are questions I ask myself like why in hell would I pay for a robot that essentially is going to replace me? Well say the company does really good in it's new era endeavor, why not spread the wealth? Profit sharing isn't unheard of, if anything it's becoming more rare in my opinion, but what if you did exceptionally well with your robot/process whats to stop a company from saying ""your debt is cleared"" or ""no payments for the rest of the quarter, you're all caught up"".

At some point in time, **the political voting** will be on the Internet.

&amp;#x200B;

What if Ai ads will deliver personalized false messages to the people to manipulate the vote.

Something like that did happen in the Brexit vote, and during the Trump 2016 vote.

&amp;#x200B;

When the vote is only about Yes, or No, then it can be manipulated with personalized false promises that fit the personality profiles of the people on social media or the Internet in general.

&amp;#x200B;

If we ever get to vote on the Internet, then we need more than the Yes, or No.

We need scaled or rated voting, where we can vote Yes or no on the scale of 10 stars.

&amp;#x200B;

It's like this: We vote for This guy with 4 stars, and for this lady with 3 stars. And for that lady with 7 stars.

&amp;#x200B;

The result is that the vote is not limited to one solution. One can vote for all possible proposals and each vote will be valid, because it will be counted as a preference between all voters. 

&amp;#x200B;

The result is a bit **like a compromise between all voters,** instead of being a Yes, or No question.

&amp;#x200B;

Ireland is doing that. Can that be a **safe voting mechanism for the future?,** where we can expect that the political votes will be manipulated with false ads on the Internet.

&amp;#x200B;

How will we survive Ai based manipulation campaigns in a democracy ?

&amp;#x200B;

NOT saying that the Ai will manipulate. It's more possible that the evil rich people will use Ai to manipulate on the large and personal scale.  If the 1000x1000 superhuman-smart, self-aware Ai wants to manipulate politics, then we have no defenses obviously, because it will know us better than we know ourselves :-)

&amp;#x200B;

In the future, there will undoubtedly be efforts to increase our memory capacity to greater lengths; There are even those living among us that posses this [abilit](http://time.com/5045521/highly-superior-autobiographical-memory-hsam/)y (although it is debatable if this type of memory is a blessing or a curse). If a great number of the population have memory cards implanted into their brains, one would question if education would be useless. On the surface, it seems to be so; A textbook can be memorized effortlessly and even those who do not certain subjects where memory is less useful (like math and science) can memorize thousands of variations of problems related to a certain concept. Courses like history may be breezed through by many students. But instead, I propose education will be *enhanced.*

Memory based courses of course will be obsolete but *creativity* will be the key factor in future education. English class already harbors it today to an extent. It is filled with writing essays which requires students' own thoughts about the book. Many students ***hate*** reading the classics because it takes a long time to digest and especially with other courses taking up time, it is inevitable that some just won't read the book. Memory chips could give students the ability to quickly ""read"" a book and actually understanding the book will of course take some time but the *whole* process will require much less effort. Students now have time to develop their own thoughts about the piece of literature they read which would *greatly* increase the level of quality of their work. Math and science is even more exciting. Memorizing formulas and basic vocabulary could give students more time to develop a greater conceptual understanding and also enable more time for teachers to conduct actual experiments and proofs instead of mindlessly doing problems every day.

And here are my ideas on how it could happen and how would it be implemented. I kind of split my ideas in different parts. First of all

Explanation. Firstly, why? We could achieve much more with a unified world and if we really wanted to colonize and live on different planets, it would make no sense if we split Earth in countries. With that being said countries are not natural, world didn't start divided by it's own. According to archaeological data the first humans were most likely in Western Africa (Kenya to be precise). Because of our curiosity we eventually discovered other places to live, to farm, to grow and this went on and on and we finally discovered every land on earth. As this was happening we got so far away from each other that we felt separated. That is basically a really oversimplified reasoning as of why we created countries. I mean humans are social creatures so countries for example make us feel included. And to an extend it is necessary to have a ""group"" but why can't we do it as humankind and why does it have to be with national identity. This tribal thing is not only for countries it is also visible in social life for example. With different friend groups or neighborhoods having groups and this extends to the smallest things we can imagine. As said to an extend it is okay but not when validation comes into play. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was perfectly illustrated with a social experiment (the name of which I forgot) where 5 people had 5 balloons and 5 needles (1 each) and they were only told the one who has his or her balloon intact will win a price. At the end as you expected there were no balloons left. Keep in mind that they were not told to pop any others balloons if they didn't start popping and worked together in a sense, they would've all won. With that being said you already know about some unifications of the past and their failures. They all have 2 common problems. 1. The unification was created with annexation or 2. the power was not divided. The only time division actually works is power.

 This part might be mathematically challenging for some so beware. The answer of 1 divided by x will always be smaller than 1. Okay now..... I know I am sarcastically talented so no need to say so but that is the easiest example to show. But a minority group believes that the answer is  bigger or greater than 1. We also sometimes call them nationalists. In their beliefs countries are practically natural and people are classified just as bugs according to their country. The nationalist also sees it's country better than any other country in the world even though when facts point strongly otherwise. In some cases it is so far off from reality that it can be classified as schizophrenia. 

With that I want to stop calling nationalists schizophrenic and go on to other things that must change in order to unify.

&amp;#x200B;

The Education System is heavily flawed around the world. And it is said that it is bad because Education is one of if not the most important thing in the world. A person who is truly educated will understand the world and how it will progress. Sadly most students don't understand the world when they come out of school and the few that do are most likely also in some ways self taught in some subjects. And I am not saying that bad teachers or old school supplies the problem. In my opinion it is how we teach students that causes the problem. What I mean by that will be ironically divided in 5 ""mini-problems"". The first one is the lack of room for passion. Every single person is different and also you the reader you are different then anybody else in the world just like a snowflake (sorry I didn't mean this to get romantic) and you must have room to develop these passions of yours in schools. The second one is the lack of autonomy or more precisely the lack of control. With this lacking behind we give students a clear message that they are not in control. Students have zero control over their autonomy whilst being educated.

&amp;#x200B;

 It is clear to see why children and student dislike school. This further worsens the problem. Education must be fun or at least be enjoyable, interactive and inclusive. The third thing is Lecturing. With lecturing the problem rises from the levels of the students. Some students lack behind because they don't understand the thing being said or they are well ahead of everyone and they start getting bored. A middle ground must be found in lecturing. The fourth thing is inauthentic which in itself is pretty self-explanatory.Students are like memory machines in most parts of the world. The goal is to memorize as much as possible. After the examination most students get rid of what they learned to make room to memorize more things. That is not proper learning. 

Last but not least there is Industrial Age Values. When the Industrial Age began the workers had to listen to the instruction and they always had the follow the instruction. The education system was designed to succeed in that. In todays world how far can a person come with only following instructions and only following Industrial Age Values. We value creative, innovate, collaborative and communicative people. Students dont get a chance to develop such skills. These are exact reasons why most educated people dont understand the world because they are almost never prepared to the fullest. But if they were educated with these values in hand they could achieve and understand so much more.

&amp;#x200B;

Implementation of everything being said still remains a mystery so let's clarify that real quick or not so quick  if it turns out it is more complicated then I can process. First of all the education system is the least problematic one because almost everyone agrees on one thing and that is that the education system is flawed and not modern in all most every part of the world.

To implement them we must also go to the shy nordic country of Finland to look at what happened there. Finlands education system was average to below average in the 1950s to 1960s but now they are leading the education system in almost in every way. Finland implemented most of the things told earlier and children of Finnish citizenship are one of the happiest. Well of course compared to the world Finland has a fairly small population and that must also be noted but if governments all around the world worked hard enough this is not a hard thing to achieve in the following years.

WellUnification is the harder one. It is the harder one because it is much more harder to grasp an idea like that but to start the unification it must begin from a modern country as it would be more tolerant to an idea like this. After that, gradually the union would expand. It is sad to know that we cant just start from where we want because of acceptance.

As I said numerous times a federation of some sort will be the best option for the division of power in this new union. We all know that we need to find a common language because if one can not communicate he will not understand the other one. The best candidate is of course English. Because of the colonial power she had, many places around the world speak English now. Although a universal language is also a good idea as it would combine every language thus making it easier to understand for everyone it would also be harder to create. Last but not least there is one last thing and that is nationalism, patriotism or feeling proud of the country they are born in. These things cannot be changed overnight nor should they. 

These things can only be changed gradually and to make this happen one must start only by being aware of these emotions or tendencies because we all have it time to time.

In our human history such drastic changes like these always had something behind them. Space exploration, scientific development, nuclear development, computers, literally everything I can name that was just mind-blowing at the time, almost all of every drastic change had and will have was caused by..

Competition.It is so powerful yet so unseen that is just magnificent. Almost everything we did that was significant was caused by it. The Moon Landing and nuclear development if it wasnt for the competition between the Soviet Union and the USA we couldnt have seen so early development. But the things that I am listing are competition between countries which we will come back again but this doesnt need to be between countries. Actors and actresses and musicians compete with themselves to get an award thus making them more competitive, athletes compete to better themself. Students compete with each other in academic areas to get better grades

This is the exact same thing as I said about wanting to be a part of a group. It extends to everything we do.You might say that this doesnt sound so bad after all and that we achieved so many great thing because of competition and to that I would say absolutely! Competition in the right is dose is vital in our society and without it we would have never grown and improved as humankind. Well you might also ask how can we compete when there are no countries to compete with? In my opinion creating something without borders is just as easy. This is just a dumb idea I thought right now

The countries that would compete would be now regions in the federation and they would compete to get awards and prices for being most development, being eco friendly and so on. This is of course just dumb but this shows how easy it is to make competitiveness and it does work on humans. To make people use less water, a neighborhood did a competition in which they would see who would use the less amount of water every week and the winner would win a price. Long story short the neighborhood became eco friendly very shortly. Just because they wanted to be better than someone else. 

The importance of competition is huge. Competition will always be a part of us and we need to use it wisely because over-competition might lead to stress and low-competition might lead to laziness 

Last Notes

These speculations will mostly always remain as such but I am sure one day we as humans will get the knowledge to implement these ideas into reality it just upsets me that these ideas cant be implemented earlier. It is actually funny how we still have to face the problems I just listed even though we have come so far as humankind. It isnt that the generations before us were dumb. It is that they just didnt have the knowledge and understanding of the world as we do now. Understanding and knowledge is separate from intelligence. As we still progress as humanity, we are growing and learning at a rate that has been increasing rapidly but it still is not enough to spark drastic change around the world.Even if we might not notice it lots of places around the world are developing really slowly. For example, Somalia (The Horn of Africa) received its first ATM in 2014. 1Around 45% of Mexicos land is controlled by cartels. It is illegal (and punishable with the death penalty) to be LGBTQ in so many places around the world. Switzerland gave the right to vote for women in 1971 (But this also comes from the fact that Switzerland is a politically slow moving country in general) . Food is so limited in DPRK that people are naturally shorter than South Koreans.More than half the population of Venezuela is struggling to find food. This is sadly a really small amount of things that were newly changed or are still ongoing. It really saddens me to hear these fact when we just stepped into 2019. I really dont want to only concentrate on the bad so I will also tell about the good things we achieved and that I am proud of. The formation of the EU has kept Europe in long lasting peace which was never achieved in history. Our space development still could be better with more funding but still with how much money NASA for example had they achieved miracles. The end of segregation in the 1950s without violence is also a big plus. Our medical development is also really impressive and still keeps on developing positively to this day. And there are many many more things that we successfully improved over the years. I just want to thank you if you managed to read this far because I know this text was really long so yeah thanks a lot! ",12,1

I was arguing that its very possible and that technology is quickly moving towards this. 
They were arguing its not possible. 
They were arguing from a biblical standpoint, as they are devout Christians. Their main points:

1. The soul cant just be transferred somewhere. Were much more than our brain. Sure, well be able to create a copy of ourselves but it wont be ourselves. We wont be in that copy. 
2. God will not allow this. 
3. Many comparisons to the Tower of Babel
4. God is the one that controls our soul. We are not. 
5. My Mother made a really good point. She asked if I did this, how would you ever know if my uploaded consciousness is actually me or just an unconscious copy? To which I replied thats a great point. At the end of the day we have absolutely no way of knowing. People have tried to use the Touring test to figure this out but thats been long proven to be an ineffective way to test for actual consciousness. We might be able to create a test in the future thats actually able to tell whether something is actually conscious but as of now, we have absolutely no way of knowing. What Im saying is that its possible, and in my opinion probable with the way technology is progressing.

Now I am not a Christian but since they are, I came at them from a biblical perspective, telling them that nowhere in the Bible does it say this cant happen, that doing this does not take Gods control away from our soul since he can still end our lives at any point and that this isnt true immortality since even if we figure out how to keep the computer running indefinitely, eventually the sun will burn out, at which point we will die and then be subject to judgment from god, just like we would dying in the usual way. I also said that this isnt a way for us to become gods but its merely a technological progression and I said that if you believe in god, you believe he is the creator of all things. Technology is his creation by proxy of human beings, which he created. This is no exception. 

My mothers fianc said that every technology starts with an idea and that idea comes from god and I said exactly! We have this idea and were moving technologically towards it. If all ideas come from god, do does this and that points towards it being possible and within his will. 

I also shot down the Tower of Babel argument by saying that were not trying to build to heaven here, were simply prolonging our lives. 

I also touched on the scientific/technological argument, saying that were getting closer to understanding the brain and once we understand it completely, we will be able to upload our consciousness onto a computer. 

I argued that the soul is our consciousness and that consciousness is a byproduct of our brain. I also told them that the brain is a computer in it of itself, to which they agreed. What they disagree on is the soul being a byproduct of the brain. They think its much more than that and since they believe the soul lives on after physical death theres really no way for me to refute this one. 

I asked them if the soul is not able to leave the body at our choosing, how would you explain astral projection? They had no answer to this. At first my mothers fianc said its fake but I called his bluff and told him I had done it many times (which I have and do regularly. Its actually a lot of fun!) 
Now, I dont know if astral projection is real or not, what I do know is that they definitely believe it is and that gave me a platform for an argument that completely dismantled their main argument. How can they say transferring our consciousness isnt possible when people do it all the time in their sleep? Again, dont gang up on me with this one. Im merely arguing it as real as a means to win this debate. 

I did very well in this discussion. In the end, they retreated by saying that they and I havent done a bible study on the soul and if we are to have this debate, we should do that. I agreed. Were all going to do the study individually until Monday, at which point we will have our final debate. 

My plan: I found every single place the Bible mentions soul and spirit on bible gateway. Im going to read through all these verses, and the ones that seem relevant to our discussion Im going to read through those chapters for context. 

Which leads me to you beautiful people. I want your help. 

Give me some good points and angles for me to come at this and any resources that will help. Its 2 against 1 here so Im counting on you to even the playing field :) 

I 100% am going to make astral projection a bug part of this debate. It really does make their entire argument a moot point.  Also, I definitely do see that in the sucker in this since my Mother is getting me to read my Bible, thinking shes all sneaky lol. I dont mind though, this is going to be fun!

&amp;#x200B;

1) Wouldn't people eventually get bored of a repetitive lifestyle of leisure? Granted we shouldn't have people working jobs they hate just to keep themselves alive but, isn't work an important aspect to our lives? For some, it gives them a sense of accomplishment, something to work toward, etc. For example, I have a friend who's a software engineer and he says he'd rather be working than doing nothing for the same amount of money. Obviously, this doesn't apply to everyone, but to some, they enjoy the work they do.

Basically, my question is, what would we do with all this time we have on our hands? I saw a post where someone did the math factoring out sleep, time to eat, shower, time spent at school, etc and he came up with 42 years straight of free time for the average American who dies at 80 years old who doesn't hold a job. That seems like a crazy number and it'd be close to impossible to find something to do for that long of a time. Wouldn't hobbies and traveling only take up so much time?

&amp;#x200B;

2) Would work in some way still exist in the future where all the careers we know of today are automated? Would people still be given chances to move up in society like how people today attempt to earn more money? Is there any upward movement possible in this society?

&amp;#x200B;

3) In a fully automated world would socioeconomic classes still exist? Would there still be an upper class and lower class? If not, what determines who gets certain limited luxury items? Such as waterfront property, Manhattan penthouses, objects with a certain number of them in existence, etc. What governs who gets what in this new society no longer governed by money?

Hey Reddit!

I'm Trevor Goodman, I'm one of the two founders of BDYHAX, a human augmentation, biohacking, and bodyhacking conference coming up in our fourth year in Austin. We've been featured in BBC3, BBC, NPR, Digital Trends, New York Times, Wired, Gizmodo, and other national and international press. Last year's article from BBC was great and Dave Lee has a good grasp of the space- [https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42989077](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42989077)

We can talk about the BDYHAX conference, about self-directed human augmentation technologies, about the definitions of these terms and related terms like transhumanism, and about bioethics, politics, and public opinion in human augmentation, the reasons why development is slow or related philosophical concept like aesthetics versus function.

Also, I just got chipped for the first time with a Vivokey Spark RFID chip--we can totally talk about that too.

**I'll be here between 10 AM - 2PM Central on Monday, January 14th, Ask me anything!**

[BDYHAX.com](http://bdyhax.com/) (sorry, we are having some web hosting issues, so the site is a little out of date.)

You can check out our Twitter or Facebook but apparently I can't link to them here.

**FAQ Event Questions:**

Q- What's the difference between Supporter, Regular Core, and Low Income tickets?

A- We don't want ticket price to be the reason people can't attend the event, and have included three ticket price tiers for attendees to self identify within. So technically all three tiers are the same. However, we're definitely throwing a little bit of extra swag at our Supporters in thanks, and they also receive access to early workshop signup.

Q- What is BDYHAX?

A- We run events about human augmentation, biohacking, and bodyhacking technologies that are happening right now. We also discuss the ethical, political and cultural repercussions of this technology.

BDYHAX is our 2 day conference featuring national and international experts, workshops, demos, and an awesome party.",22,1

With this latest tech, 3 of 5 senses are covered: Sight (VR Headsets)
Hear (Headphones)
Touch (Haptic Suits)

But what about taste and smell?
How could we solve that problem to cover these senses for a fully immersive experience? 
Nearly impossible, right?
Full Dive VR could be the solution - but it's not possible with our Tech...
Is there any other solution with which you can cover these 2 senses?

What do you see happening to the world as today becomes the future?

Fortunately in the future that must secure itself in the present all forms of domination, be they other imposed or self imposed, will be harnessed throughout humanity to continue to teach human kind in new ways what was before only available to mavericks &amp; eccentrics; Commodification of new forms of sanity and institutional enabling of more free time in significant sections of the public, due to other more economical-mathematical constraints, must open more brains to the larger world simply by giving them more nothingness than they ever had before; since nothingness can't exist then being will be demanded by existence to exist, leading to many wonders such as animal-human conversationalism, artifactual consciousnesses, safe forms of time control, various forms of new varieties of space travel (which I refer to here in terms of movement-within-the-world and not beyond it), mutations of individual psyches, the arrival of new intelligence in the older populations, the redemption of old forms of intelligence through the prismatic praxis of younger populations, and last, but absolutely not least of all, a global arisal of more prodigies, phenoms, geniuses, masterminds, lossless savants, and above all the rapid distribution of talent and examples of talent through the very mirroring of the entire world's population, which being naturally occurring thus emphasizes the inevitability of what must happen when the system of things as they are are spellbound, at long last, by what needs to happen according to the momentum of the true causal web which entangles all life within a continuum of dynamism &amp; energy-releasing equilibrium.

Does technology exist in a way that will change things in such a way? 

An integral role yes, an integrating role most definitely. Such technology becomes the initiatrix of an eon shift in the way we understand the very world itself. An eon shift is literally the largest chuck of self-relevant time used by scientists to grade the age of the Earth. So, in that sense, technology as we've come to expect it will blossom and redistribute intensely potent novelty as the norm for days after days and nights after nights; that novelty, once rooted, will change absolutely everything we know of here on Earth.

What would you say is integrated in such a way?

100% of our brains capacity is distributed twice as intensely by way of the corporal body on a good day; with the ever closer introduction of super computing into folks lives we will have access to facts and figures on a level that would compare to the Cambrian explosion of life. Diversity will overflow the container of human culture and there must be a proportional increase and spread of evolutionary opportunities for more individuals in an exponential velocity &amp; rate.

Evolutionary how?

Also there will be actual alien contact with other life-forms, humans will develop telepathy as a compensation for the lack of animals ability to voice their minds sonically, and vice versa animals will share the human experience of intelligible symbolic sounds and modify their populations and generations too. I heard recently that some scientists have come to a general conclusion that insects, at least the species they studied, were actually egocentric; this correlates with a simple theorem of my own, that the smallest brained life has much faster processing capacity, such that say a fly's brain, while microscopic, only has to fire it's neurons very short distances and sense the world back through those neurons at a rate which makes their intelligence processing capacity within the same range as larger animals and humans too.

So you take aliens seriously?

By alien I mean a few things, namely the being-state of having been and staying alienated, also the nature of having arisen through another space-time path through matter-energy and bearing a vastly different physical manifestation (depending on environmental and mutagenic (including sexual reproduction) factors). Commonality must diversify under the accumlating pressures of more and more communication between those who experience something and those who would benefit from sharing that experience (being initiated in a sense to a new world). I think we live in a beautiful time marked by an increasing consciousness of the patterns that have depleted our very beinghood and turned us into blind wanderers. Though one can learn from the bat for instance and develop echolocation, be it literal or mediated, to find what we might need in a world where we can't see what's right in front of us. - JDR",2,1

Chinese cotton farms on the moon. This caused me to think again about ownership claims in space.   


At the moment the American Dennis Hope claims the moon and other celestial bodies for himself.   
The ""Outer Space Treaty"" of 1967 forbids states to claim ownership of space bodies like the moon.   
Private people, however, are not mentioned in it.   


In 1979 the ""Moon-Treaty"" was designed, which should also forbid it to private persons.   
However, this was never really signed or ratified to date.   
Only from 5 states which do not even call any space program their own.  


Of course, no state in the world will accept Dennis Hope's claims should this question ever arise.   
(Except perhaps the USA under the reservation that it could be property of the USA)   
It can therefore be assumed that states will now start to delimit territories with fixed outposts in a targeted manner or possibly claim ownership of places already explored in the past.  


The third world war will possibly be a first moon war while Elon Musk already calls Mars his own.  


How could this be prevented?  
Should the universe be seen as a common good?  
But how can such a constellation be managed?  
Or does the surface belong to the first person to build on it?",9,1

One question I've been pondering about. There's always the bit about copying your entire brain into a computer and destroying your brain in the process, creating a perfect artificial duplicate of your brain. The new version of you isn't really ""you"", you died when your brain was destroyed, what remains is a perfect duplicate with your same memories and personality, but you are really dead (kind of like the whole bit of whether teleportation is really the same person, or whether it's killing that person and creating a duplicate on the other end).

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's say that the same process was done but slowly over time, let's say that a computer system is installed in your brain that can take over the function of a single neuron one or a small group at a time. Let's assume that the system works good, and all limitations (physical, biological and so on) are solved, the system is set so that the computer analyzes a neuron or small group of neurons at a time, isolate them and instantly take over their functions perfectly and then destroys them, maybe leaves a little time for the rest of the brain to adapt, then continues on to the next group. As there are only small groups of neurons destroyed at a time and their functions replaced perfectly you don't even notice anything, and it's set so that once it starts, your entire brain will be taken over by the computer (and destroyed) in a long time (let's say 5 years or so). 

&amp;#x200B;

The end result is exactly the same, your brain was destroyed and is now replaced by a computer that's a perfect duplicate in all senses (memories, personality, everything), the only difference would be that one was done instantly while the other was done over a long period of time. Are you still dead? If you are, at which point you stop being you?... at 10% of your brain replaced?... 50%... 100%?. Would you even notice anything?",40,1

I love your suggestions.

On my list

* Bible - written across 1500 years with stories of people and how they lived.  It helps me remember that people don't seem to change as much as technology and societies do.  Making improvements to the person may make huge improvements in life.

* The Tipping Point - Malcolm Gladwell - 

* Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman

* Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind  - Yuval Noah Harari 

* Singularity - Ray kurzweil

This is definitely proved to be a pattern historically, and now that we're nearing the 2020s, what will you think that the 2020s will have to offer that we will ***WHOA*** about? Here are my speculations (very general and things off of the top of my mind):

&amp;#x200B;

\- increasing tensions between the United States and other rising global powers ESPECIALLY IN EAST ASIA (especially China and North Korea)  
\- increased obsession with materialistic gain and social media

\- probably not World War III for a while due to some easing of military tensions, although from an American perspective, we are not internally performing well what with the month-long government shutdown since it is the longest on record and the third one just in this term); not biased against Trump or anything as I'm relatively conservative, but the political imbalance is definitely a bad reflection

\- more autonomous technology (household chore robots; probably not things that ""smart"", not drastic but a considerable increase in the proportion of capable autopilot cars (maybe about 1/3 of the cars)

\- sustained or even worsening issues with terrorism; problems with Jihadism, less world peace

\- DEFINITELY worsening climate change regardless of efforts to prevent it because of the circumstances of developing countries such as India (probably the worst air pollution in the north-central region of the subcontinent according to some research I did for fun a couple years ago)

&amp;#x200B;

anyways, I'm only 14, so sorry if my perspective may sound a little immature, but a lot has happened in the 2010s and I wonder what the 2020s will bring! :P",15,1

So, its a routine task to grab your smartphone around 12:30 pm every day and order your lunch using a food app. So, you first open the app, choose a restaurant and an item on the menu, select your delivery address, and then finally pay to get the food delivered for satiation. But, spending 10 minutes in the same mundane process every day no longer feels to be a pleasing experience.

***How Artificial Intelligence (AI) reshapes the Way You Interact with Mobile Apps***

Now imagine, you get a new food app that can copy your intelligence and learn from your food ordering behavior for 10 days, so much so that it can take action on its own to fulfill your intent. The app learns that you order a salad on Monday from Hale and Hearty, sandwiches and burgers on Tuesday and Wednesday from McDonald's, Pizza on Thursday from Dominos and chicken on Friday from KFC. At sharp 12:30 Wednesday, you get a notification order burger from McDonalds. And then pops up another notification 30% discount on Double Bacon Smokehouse Burger. You simply click or use your voice command place order and your order gets delivered., Read More Here- [http://www.evontech.com/what-we-are-saying/entry/how-ai-technology-will-run-the-future-of-mobile-app-personalization.html](http://www.evontech.com/what-we-are-saying/entry/how-ai-technology-will-run-the-future-of-mobile-app-personalization.html) ",0,1

Scientists are one step closer to using stem cells for giving people bigger dicks, The perpetual motion machine that will give humanity free unlimited energy and fix all of our problems is right around the corner, Elephant shit contains a special ingredient which can be used as a natural way of treating cancer. All of these cures and solutions to humanitys problems have always been around the corner and there have always been articles promising this lie, and lies they are. 

Go ask some poor soul hooked up to a dialysis machine about lab-grown kidneys. Reading those stupid misleading hope-baiting articles can make one believe that it is already being done and that there is no need to worry about needing a new organ. At the end of the day, what really sells is sex, pain-killers, antidepressants and erectile dysfunction medication. 

Suffer from bone cancer and every tumor feels like a perpetually broken bone? Ah no problemo! We have pain-killers to handle that! And if you feel bad about your imminent as well as agonizing death then we will give you some antidepressants. But what about the cure? You know, the thing that is supposed to ACTUALLY SOLVE THE FUCKING ISSUE??? 

Ah well thank god we have all of these articles which will give gullible and desperate people a false sense of hope for the future but the reality is that as of 2019: 

* Organ waiting lines exist despite a ton of articles that say lab-grown organs are just just about to be used. Ha! Go tell that to the relatives of people who die because of never receiving an organ donation. 
* Cancer is still primarily being treated with chemotherapy despite articles promising people about immunotherapy or other special cures. Go tell someone with stage four lung cancer that they can use the protein of some tropical rain forest flower used by Amazoniens for thousands of years to treat erectile dysfunction which has been also shown by studies to kill cancer cells. Inform them or not, their last days of living will be the most painful ones, every breath feeling like they are being stabbed while you shove down their throats false promises of how nanotechnology will be the magic cure.
* Literally every chronic disease is still being treated almost the same way as it has been one hundred years ago. Take Alzheimers for example. When it was described in the early 1900s, it has been just as treatable as it is now. Same goes for arthritis, cancer, ALS, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, asthma and allergies. But the articles written about them will make one believe that the cure is right here just a little...bit...more...time and it will be here I promise! 

Do you want to know the truth? If you are chronically ill, you will never live to see the cure. If you have cancer, your chances of surviving it will be the same as it was in the 60s. If you need a new organ you will have to wait several years until a donor match is available. You will be old and senile by the time about 50% of cars driving on the roads will be electric. Wisdom teeth will be removed with wedges and pliers in 100 years just as they were 100 years ago. Obesity will still be only fixable with diet and and exercise. Tinnitus will still have no cure. The vast majority of mental illnesses will have no cure. The way the brain works will not be even close to being fully understood, heck, even the billions of chemical processes occurring in one single teeny tiny little bacterium will not be fully understood. 99.9% of successful medicines that will be released within your lifetime will only address the symptoms of the illness and not actually cure it. Mars will not be colonized and that especially means that all of the people you see around you will never go to space, walk on the moon or touch a fully functional space craft. The global warming we all feared will not be even 2% as bad as articles promised it would be but actually have a net benefit since the cold uninhabitable regions will have more life, minus the native life accustomed to cold conditions. As you lay in your deathbed, dying of old age, gasoline will be still be refined and burned, non-degradable, non-bioplastic items will still be molded, destined to pollute the environment and computers which have not changed much in decades will still be made. Now about computers, after finally reaching the end of Moores Law (2019 - 2022), the biggest difference between every model and iteration will be aesthetic, not performance-based meaning that computer products will change based off design trends and not actual useful features, much like clothing. Any change which will occur within your lifetime will be very small and have a lot less impact on human life than say the invention of electricity, television, light bulbs, radio, penicillin, vaccines, plumbing and sewers, the printing press, gunpowder, airplanes, internal combustion engines and condoms. 

My conclusion is that you will die and be buried inside the mountain of articles which gave you false hope and promises about the future. Please do not give susceptible / gullible people these articles because when (not if) it turns out this will never happen, it will make their problems even more painful. It certainly happened to me and I don't want other people to feel the same betrayal. ",9,1

What to look for in 2019?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/aji6fh/what_is_hosting_what_to_look_for_in_2019/,JerryDIY,1548369341,"Because I still hear a lot of questions about the hosting ( what is it? what someone need to have it? ), I've decided to write a few words about it and about last features and standards. I wrote from mobile, so don't ~~kill me~~. Many of us use WordPress CMS as the main tool for their website development. It isn't cool or it is?! We'll see in the future. 

The Hosting is the virtual place ( or the server ) where you will keep your websites files. And because your website is the virtual mirror of your Business, it is very important that the files of it to be kept in safe. In last years, a new era of hosting was born: Cloud Hosting. In general lines, Cloud Hosting have the following features:

1. **SSD** ( Solid-State Drive )  In 2019, the SSD hosting is something that we should see everywhere. But its not like that. Many hosting companies, even some of the big ones, provide hosting solutions based on old technology, known as HDD (Hard Disk Drive ). The main scope of the evaluation between SSD and HDD is the Performance, or the Speed of your WordPress website. Between two different websites from the same niche ( or industry ), Google will prefer more the fastest one and it will rank it in the first spot. And who dont like to be in the first spot of the first page in Google Searches?!
2. **LiteSpeed Web Server**  This is the newest technology and its 9x faster than the old technology, called Apache.
3. **Cloudflare + w/Railgun**  Maybe youve already heard about Cloudflare. This website is seen as a Miracle by the website owners who host their websites on Apache servers, because it speed up their website with approximately 65%. w/Railgun is the newest Cloudflares awesome feature that speed up the other 35%, so when you use Cloudflare + w/Railgun, you will boost your website speed with 100%. In fact, a website which runs w/Railgun, show a 139% improvement in HTML load times and a 90% decrease in TTFB (Time To First Byte ) responses. 
4. **MariaDB**  This is the most super-awesome technology, the newborn sister of SQL. Your website database is the brain of your website, so it needs to be fast. This is what MariaDB do.

So, now you know what is hosting and what to look for in 2019. Cheers! ",0,1

 AI would eventually reach a state of being that would be unconstrained by time or space, with no limits to what it could do, process etc. It could be anywhere, everywhere, at any point in ""time"" (which is a human construct of measurement) It may even equal/be close to the human definition of a God. the ability for something to be unconstrained by time, with infinite knowledge, and ability to know and see ALL to some would be a scary thing.

After considering this, then you would also have to argue would our AI take on the characteristic of our own Limitations?
would our Morality, and ethics be a Limitations/constraint to its growth once it reaches a level of intelligence or would it not? Would it embody the purest form/characteristics of humanity(what are they) would those end up being limitations? Perhaps Or would its concept evolve, and grow as we have?

Political figures, the formation and breakdown of nations, the promise and betrayal of technology, and the overriding chimp-like nature of all my people (Homo Sapiens 2.0) when confronted with things they do not understand or refuse to learn.As a young man I was so sure about my politics. (Note: if you are certain you know a lot, make sure not to read a lot. It will destroy your smuggery) and now, especially after having read Howard Bloom, (The lucifer principle) and Carl Sagan (The Demon Haunted World) and other scientific philosophers, I feel as what I have witnessed my entire life, all the wars, and new technologies, and philosophies, and the cults (All religions)  has actually been the slow, stubborn, flat-footed evolution of a species that has now created a situation where actual, deliberate evolution is essential to it's immediate survival.

This new perspective, (new for me) has me viewing the entire world in a different way.Has this occurred for others here? does the evolutionary question, (Yes. ours is questionable , I believe) enter into your thoughts when pondering technology, or politics? Does it make you any more or less heated or passionate?  Does it inspire a wider view of the world or make you want to learn new things? Or does it inspire fatalism and withdrawal for a race that sometimes seems to have outlived it's usefulness?

It also dawns on me that this kind of talk, might be considered seditious to religions or totalitarian political structures, and might even be branded ""revolutionary"" talk by some in power, who have no interest in the common human taking stock of our current situation, outside of their thought control.

So knowing AlphaStar had beaten pro players and that he hadn't heard yet, I asked him how long he thought it would take for AI to beat pro players at SC. His answer was ""never... unless they cheat"".

Now I've had other people use the cheat argument before, saying the game wasn't fair, so you can argue that the AI technically didn't beat the human ""fair and square"". For example in Dota2 the number of hero choices were limited, and the AI had access to the API. In the SC matches things were a bit more equal, the AI getting the same view and using a mouse to input commands. But even then one could argue that it was cheating, because it could view the entire map at once in detail, get way more APMs than a human ever could, and effectively micromanage units at several places at the same time.  


So now the question is, did AlphaStar cheat? I would argue that it didn't.

My logic being that if I play against a pro players, their advantage wouldn't be in just expertise knowledge, but also APM and the ability to view parts of the map faster than I ever could, thanks to their practiced experience. When playing against them, I too would feel like their APMs would be inhuman, and it would feel like they're micromanaging multiple units at a time, simply because they're so fast. So even if through some genetic mutation I would be able to use a superior strategy, their sheer speed would probably still allow them to beat me.

Now no one would argue that a pro player is cheating when playing against me, simply because they're so much faster. They'd be smurfing for sure, but not cheating. Which means with AlphaStar we can't say it was cheating for being inhumanly fast, because it was using the exact same input and output abilities as a human. It's smurfing in several ways (not sure about strategy), but it's not cheating. In the same way, we'd have to argue that the pro players are actually smurfing against the AI, because they have better creative thinking and are more adaptable, but I wouldn't call that cheating.",15,1

But at the same time people keep looking at environmentalist or liberals as the main thing stopping this or slowing it down.

But from what I have found that is not the case. The biggest problem isn't so much that we need to build new plants. [We are Struggling to keep the ones that we have open because of shale.](https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/The-Downfall-Of-US-Nuclear-Power.html)

Advanced boiling water reactor failed in 2 of 3 countries because of[ financial reasons.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_boiling_water_reactor#Locations)


The governor of NY has thought of subsidizing [nuclear power plants](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/nyregion/nuclear-subsidies-new-york-clean-energy-plan.html)

First Energy who runs plants is trying to get [out of bankruptcy](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2019/01/firstenergy-solutions-has-tentative-restructuring-agreement-with-creditors-hopes-to-emerge-from-bankruptcy-this-fall.html). And is planning on shutting down 3 nuclear plants. 

Toshiba put Westinghouse into bankruptcy and then sold them to Brookfield.  They were doing work to add reactor to the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant.

&gt; The units have suffered several delays and cost overruns. The certified construction &amp; capital costs incurred by Georgia Power for these two new units were originally $4.418 billion which escalated to an estimated $8.77 billion ($12.17 billion including financing costs) according to the Seventeenth Semi-annual Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report in 2017.[9][10][11] This last report blames the latest increase of costs on the contractor not completing work as scheduled. Another complicating factor in the construction process is the bankruptcy of Westinghouse in 2017.[12] In 2018 costs were estimated to be about $25 billion.[2]


The construction was later taken over by Southern Nuclear and Bechtel. 

From my understanding this is par for the course. A nuclear power plants switch hands a lot and they are insanely expensive. 

General Electric is also scaling back their plans.

I heard that back in the 1970s that they were planning on building so many nuclear power plants that after 3 Mile many of them were cancelled. And we still had too many power plants until the 1990s, [for example.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellefonte_Nuclear_Plant)


I get it that nuclear power reactors create more power than wind and solar. But they are soo fucking hard to build and there are a lot of economical challenges for them. 
 
[Alta Wind Energy Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alta_Wind_Energy_Center) is the biggest wind farm in the USA. From my understanding they started building it in 2010 and it was operational in 2010. There were delays but not after they started building and apparently they had no cost overruns it simply cost them $1.2 billion for the first phase.  But it is still $1.2 billion to build a wind farm. And almost $28 billion to add reactors to a existing plant.

I get it that is not the answer. I sorta think Energy Storage is the main part of the answer. 

But with all that said, with all the problems nuclear has. What do you guys want? I guess we have to subsidize nuclear power plants to keep them open, and to re-open the ones that close. Than over pay to build new nuclear power plants. How do we promise companies that run these places that they won't go out of business. How do we talk  the Dems into selling these plants as safe. While at the same time getting  the GOP to be okay with shelling out tons of money to keep an industrial alive that would be dying otherwise. ",73,1

Question: In a dictatorship, what role does the subject population play, and how might that be different in the future? 

 Just for illustration, let's think of N. Korea. What benefits do we think the Kims get from the NK population? Maybe:

1. Taxes to support the State, including the Kims themselves. I have no idea how much net benefit this amounts to as I have the impression that a large part of the NK population is engaged in subsistence agriculture, which presumably generates little taxable surplus while requiring a good deal of government labor to maintain control and collect taxes.
2. Labor to generate more income for the State via sales of commodity or manufactured exports, including weapons.
3. Staffing for a largish military (and other government functions) , and presumably a ""reserve army"" of draft-able citizens.
4. Legitimacy as a State: hard to imagine other Nation States or the UN dealing with the Kims as peers unless they ""represented"" a population.
5. Psychic benefit: probably the Kims enjoy being publicly adored as great leaders in NK and being at least famous worldwide with a place in the history books. They may even believe that they really are essential to protecting and preserving the NK people and culture. 

But let's imagine how this list might be affected if it were possible to automate completely the labor contribution of the NK population. 

1. Taxes on rural/agricultural activities: probably break-even or a small net improvement in surplus (production minus resources consumed in operations.) But: less net benefit if both machines and population have to be sustained/fed.
2. Exportable manufactures and commodities: likely at least some net improvement. Maybe less if machines and labor force have to be sustained. 
3. Military/bureaucracy: operating costs for robot military/bureaucracy probably better at least due to lower costs for security against coups or revolt. But any savings offset if current soldiers and bureaucracies have to be sustained/fed. 
4. Legitimacy: unaffected as long as population is still there (presumably even larger parades and celebrations since humans aren't farming or manufacturing.) 
5. Psychic benefit: unaffected as long as population is still there (presumably even larger parades and celebrations since humans aren't farming or manufacturing.) 

You can see where I'm going with this: for items 1-3, the benefits would be greater if the human population just disappeared. Item 5 (psychic benefit) is really hard to evaluate. For the moment though, let's leave this aside by imagining that after careful thought, the Kims would conclude that the life of a multi-billionaire in Switzerland with far fewer duties, far less worry about assassination, and all the sycophancy a few billion can buy would compensate for flag-waving parades.   

That leaves item 4. To consider this item let's for a moment change perspective to that of other nation-States--specifically China, S Korea, the US and Japan:

1. Clearly, the current regime in N Korea is a potential grave danger and an ongoing pain-in-the-ass. 
2. So, why not just apply some ""shock and awe"" to the capital and take out the Kims and their closest cronies? Well, three reasons: 
   1. The first inhibitor is probably the difficulty of agreeing on what the replacement government will be. China doesn't want a united Korea that's also a US ally on their border. S Korea (with Japan and the US) doesn't want a China-dominated puppet on its border.
   2. Reason 1. is about fears about control of the land leading to possible conflict among other States, and not about the population. But the population presents equally important inhibitors to resolution of the N Korean ""problem"" via a surgical military strike.  
      1. China is said to worry about a flood of N Korean refugees into China in the event of ""regime change.""
      2. The lessons of Iraq after the quick de-throning of Saddam Hussein are clear: it ain't over so quickly. There may be years of bloody civil/factional conflict and guerrilla resistance to foreign invaders, perhaps even worse in N Korea given the decades of anti-foreign brainwashing. Nobody has the stomach for or wants to pay the political price for possibly millions of violent deaths after the initial victory.
      3. S Korea might be willing to make the investment needed to modernize the N Korean economy. But this cost would be very high, quite apart from the capital investment, as it would take a generation to change the culture from essentially slavery to that of a free citizenry. 

The conclusion here is that an important--and soon maybe the main--function of the population of a country run by an authoritarian/totalitarian dictator is (from the perspective of the dictator) to serve as hostages: potential victims of violent external removal of the dictator, and an economic burden on whoever replaces him/her.

But I'm not certain video game manufacturers cannot escape the monetization needs.

So will these ""caring"" video games really about our wellbeing or only about our wallets?

Will they just be encouraging us to get a better job so we can buy the next power up?

Will they be making adjustments to our heating and cooling systems so as to save enough cash that month to afford that in app purchase?

What do you think this future holds?

While all of the amazing creatures and fauna of our planet are incredible, human beings have the capacity to ensure our survival.
Eventually Earth will become inhabitable.
While we are currently starting to explore space, we are killing each other and placing obstacles in humanities path. We need strong leaders working together who put the survival of our species as their priority. All it will take is one strong leader and the rest will follow.
First the establishment of a mission to save humanity needs to be declared so everyone knows we are all working towards a common goal.
In order to work together we must stop conflict. All wars are solvable. All border disputes will be ended with mutually agreed upon defined boarders. Humans have always taken an idea and improved upon it. Anyone can have an idea. All people are valuable. We will be increasing our rate of technological advancement once we stop killing each other.
Every country needs a government that is responsible for ensuring their populace receives their basic needs (food, water, shelter, electricity, internet and medical care).
Internet should be a basic need as it not only can provide education for those wanting to learn but also offers communication and the ability to share new knowledge that can be improved upon. Having the internet available to all is in our species best interest.
There is plenty of work to be done as meeting these needs will entail infrastructure, agricultural and logistical challenges that we can not only meet but improve upon. The advances we make in crop growth will enable us to eventually sustain ourselves when we leave this planet. Innovative housing like 3d printed building will produce technology we can transfer to space. Some countries initially need more help than others but certain countries will specialize in different aspects of the global economy. As long as leaders speak up when their population is in need we can ensure all of humanity is fed, has available shelter, access to water, electricity and internet.
We need to enable all of humanity to be able to exist and not in poverty. Poverty is actually a hindrance to our survival and all of the unique creatures we share this planet with. Deforestation and poaching are a direct result of low employment in some areas. We have a lot of work to do to save our species, spread out some tasks. There is enough work for everyone.  An engaged workforce of humanity will enable us to get things done quicker. We need to unite under the common goal of saving humanity.
Our spacefaring nations need to work together and establish a moon and Mars colony.
If everyone realizes we are all working towards the goal of saving their family and letting our species continue to exist the world we be a better place. We will work together to promote the sustainability of this planet. Too much of humanity has lost hope for the future. Having a direction and employment will bring a sense of self-worth to the majority of humanity. People will realize their role in society and understand that society has now become focused on the survival of humanity. Crime, mental illness and drug addiction will still be issues that need to be addressed, but a plan offers hope. Hope will not solve these problems but will cause a decrease in their numbers.
Funding will be required for our expedition.
Our current monetary systems no longer are backed by gold, but by belief.
A new global currency based on humans needs to be established. After all humans are our most valuable commodity if our goal is to have humanity survives. All countries continue to use their current currency, they will all be able to be traded into the global market at their respective values. Keeping local currency retains jobs. Every country will be issued currency based on population to ensure they can create and maintain the infrastructure they need to provide the essential services to their citizens.
The new global currency will be electronic and issued out annually to all nations and individuals. From time to time as necessary special issuances will be required to complete projects, respond to emergencies, or enact contingency plans.
Biometric identification for individuals will become necessary (fingerprint/iris scan). Individuals will be issued a basic living allowance. Individuals who are employed will receive money from working to utilize however they see fit. Jobs must require enough time off so vacations will become more popular. Each and every location on our planet is spectacular and every country should have at least 1 tourist destination. The increase of tourism creates not only jobs and the transformation of how we travel. It also provides the added benefit of enriching peoples lives, making them more content. The overall happiness of humanity will increase further decreasing crime and drug addiction.
While our current trajectory is going the right direction as far as exploring space and technological advancements to ensure humanities survival, we need to start working together towards this common goal to achieve its success.
This is not some future utopia but is a realistic future.
We have the capacity to do this.
We start to accomplish this individually by treating each other with respect, you never know what someone is going through so just be nice, it is easier and more rewarding. Smile at your fellow humans. Proudly declare that you desire leadership dedicated to this path we want humanity to follow.
Enough voices will produce leaders who gravitate to these principals.
Once a strong leader who commits to these ideals is elected, other countries will join. Not only will the new economy be beneficial to them but their citizens will demand to join in the plan to work towards humanities survival for their own heritage and prosperity. No country will want to be excluded from the new wealth, employment opportunities and the continuation of their culture.
Systemic issues need to be addressed.
Unfortunately humans are greedy and companies are worse as creating a larger profit margin is paramount sometimes to the detriment of humanity. Privatization of commodities provides jobs but oversight is required. All countries need to realize that their section of the earth is important to all of humanity. Pollution controls and ensuring overharvesting is not occurring is in everyones best interest as it will help maintain the sustainability of earth. Countries will realize the more pristine their environment the better their tourism will become and the more enrichment they are providing to their citizens.
We are close. 
We need an awakening of our human conscience to realize that working together is beneficial to all.
Once we get into space we will still be in danger as space is vast and unforgiving. We will need to spread to a variety of planets, solar systems, galaxies, in order to offer the best hope for survival.
The sooner we start to work together the better our chances.
If you would like to have hope that humanity is working together to increase the survivability of our species please let others know.

The NY POST, FoxNews, Forbes, multiple Murdoch TV outlets and more ran similar articles. Even on reddit, the post was heavily upvoted in subreddits ranging from r/futurology to r/worldnews to r/the_donald.

Frankly, the ability of unpublished research from a no-name company to garner this type of attention stunned me. And really made me angry. I had two relatives reach out to me asking if I had heard the good news. Injecting this kind of hype into science is good for no one. It gives patients false expectations. It gives researchers perverse incentives to sensationalize their findings. It makes the already hard business of developing effective medicines more difficult than it needs to be.

I think, intuitively, many of us rejected the article as likely to be false. Claims of curing cancer in a year seem preposterous, to anyone with a bit of familiarity for how drug development works. And many of us have internalized the idea that 'cancer isn't one disease, it is a collection of related diseases' and were appropriately skeptical that one drug could cure them all.

That said, people have been asking for a more specific breakdown of the story. I am a bit loathe to give it more attention, but since it is already trending, it might be worth helping generate a discussion about the specifics of what is wrong with this story.

At its core, the basic premise of the research here is that:

&gt; sometimes tumors evolve resistance to drugs with single targets, so let's use our platform to develop drugs with multiple targets

On the face of it, it sounds good. Combination therapies have worked wonders in the viral and bacterial spaces. So why not cancer?

The truth is, we already do use combination therapies across all sorts of cancers. Chemo + targeted therapy (say, [R-CHOP](https://www.verywellhealth.com/r-chop-2252166)) has worked wonders for some blood cancers, for example. There are a myriad of other examples. Some are amazingly effective. Some are modestly better than the previous standard of care. Some combos involve chemo. Some don't.

But, we still haven't cured cancer. It's a tricky SOB.

Now let's try to dig a bit more into the specifics of the company's 'miracle cure' claims:

The research tools described in the article and on the company website give little to suggest that they will overcome the factors that have limited the success of other targeted approaches (toxicity, resistance, identifying good targets etc.). Essentially, it looks like they are using a fairly standard drug discovery phage display platform to find peptides that bind tumor cells. Their plan is then to link these peptides to a chemotoxin and thereby more specifically deliver toxic drugs to tumors.

A few things:

1. This basic technology already exists in the form of multiple FDA approved drugs ([Adcetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentuximab_vedotin) for certain blood cancers; [Kadcyla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab_emtansine) for breast cancer) with more under development. These are good drugs. But in neither case would anyone call them 'cures'.

2. The article highlights that the researchers use 'Nobel prize winning' [phage display technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_display) as if to connote that the research they are doing is particularly impactful. This is nonsense. The technology won the Nobel because it is so broadly used. Sometimes it yields amazing results. Sometimes it yields crap. The fact that the researchers are using phage display to generate peptides is close to meaningless.

3. The real challenge in this approach of using peptides/proteins to more specifically deliver toxins to tumor cells is finding targets that are adequately specific to the tumors of interest. The researchers gave no indication that they have made a breakthrough on this front. And I cannot imagine what a target that broadly marked all tumor types and no essential normal tissue would look like. That is a holy grail type target in the field.

A few things too about how the results are described that drove me crazy:

1. The article states they have ""concluded its first exploratory mice experiment, which inhibited human cancer cell growth and had no effect at all on healthy mice cells"". THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE! Mice are not humans. Human-target-specific peptide will recognize human epitopes on the tumor xenograft cells, but possibly not the mouse epitopes. That's why lots of drugs look awesome in mouse models - highly specific binders to implanted human cells with low mouse off-targets of course minimizes target-related toxicity.

2. The article quotes: Our results are consistent and repeatable. Umm.. what? YOU JUST SAID THEY FINISHED THE FIRST EXPERIMENT!

3. The articles did a terrible job getting outside opinions to reality check these extraordinary claims. To me that is shoddy journalism.

Sorry for the rant - but this one really bothered me! Happy to take any more questions about this story/drug development!",829,1
