I think Africa is the key to the future. Where there is rapid economic growth (think American Industrialization, and then the even more rapid industrialization of China), standard of living increases beyond the current local baseline. 

Then there is generally a symbiotic growth among all developed countries as trade among all of them increases, which leads to global economic growth.


Looking past the negative and abusive aspects of capitalism, the system also promotes innovation. The global economic growth will lead to innovation coming through the pipeline.
I just wanted to know what you guys think, and if anyone has any ideas to help usher on a new era of development in Africa and any investments do you think we can make as individuals in order to have any impact at all.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

I'm worried that the big issues aren't being sufficiently addressed (or if they are, solutions are not being funded, promoted, or acknowledged), and instead, we are distracted by the ""next best thing"".

By planning ahead every key step in getting what I have to do done, breaking down every subsection of a project down into its constituent parts, it's possible for me to achieve far more with much less time and effort, since everything is turned into a checklist of only what can be done at that time in that situation.

I understand that businesses and other complex organisations often use project management software, which is like a personal task manager but more powerful, enabling the organisation of many different individuals and managing many different resources and interdependent processes.  So I was thinking that it might be possible to create some open-source software (or use existing open source software) to solve world problems, or even just smaller, local ones.  

Instead of simply relying on voter-dependent governments or profit-driven businesses, people could collaborate via social media on detailed, well-defined plans for how to reach particular goals.  People feel a sense of ownership for things they contribute to.  

So there could be really big goals like approaching the Singularity, with associated goals (or directions) like healing the planet, colonising space, achieving world peace, generating (virtually) limitless energy, etc.  But then these could be broken down into smaller and smaller parts.  Eventually there will be a list of tasks that would be available for people could actually complete.  Perhaps there would be a Reddit karma-like economy as further encouragement for people for both planning and completing stuff.

I'm not sure exactly how it would all work, but I feel like it could potentially reach a stage where each person involved could have a bunch of small tasks available to perform, according to such things as where they are and what their field of interest and expertise is.  People could score points or otherwise get distinctions for completing tasks, and gain the ability to complete more complex ones.  All in the knowledge that it's in the service of a collective goal.  

Whether it involves geographically-dependent real-world physical actions (build community playground), computer-based knowledge work (designing and engineering the playground), or just planning with others (does this community need a playground, and if so, can we raise the money?), a system could emerge that could be game-like. Whereas the planning side would be like a collaborative game of Civilization or Sim City or other such 'god games', performing many of the the tasks could be quite MMORPG- or FPS-like.

For one, this will only accelerate. I believe that within 3-5 years we will have monkeys doing the same or better. Better meaning more complex problems. There is literally NO LIMIT to how much *sensory*data we can share between two brains. Perhaps someday we can even have monkey seeing through another monkeys eyes. 

Once we make this jump our entire world changes in less time than LSD changed the hippie movement. In less time than it took us to get to the moon, from start to finish.

It's easy to be optimistic about how this could affect us. Human minds directly communicating with many other human minds. 

This is (loosely) the concept of the group mind in [Arthur C. Clarke's ""The Light of Other Days.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_of_Other_Days) Amazing book. Although in the book the minds/thoughts of others are connected via micro-wormholes in the brain. But this is similar because you are in essence communicating telepathically to another person. How far can this be taken. 3 way calling? calling 100 people at a time? How about the entire collective of humanity in one huge call? All information, at all times. we will literally blend, meld, converge with technology.

Of course there would be an adjustment period. I for one would not want to instantly plug into 7 billion peoples thoughts. Who would want to?

Obviously it would start out with just a few. Group calling with maybe 3-4 people. The close friends. But as all people begin to do this there would be a homogenization that would arise in the group. They would all begin to think like each other. Eventually this getting boring as the fun wears off. Then expansion as the group begins to reach out to others. Larger and larger groups connect with each other. This is EVOLUTION we are talking about here. Simple groups increasing in complexity over time. How would they work together? I don't know. I have never joined minds with another person.

Eventually Hive Minds come into the mix and the entirety of our society is shifted. Human nature is understood at a level not conceived of at this moment. Future man will look nothing like he does today. The bigger question is: How will sexuality change with this shift in perspective?

I will only lightly touch on The Borg because that is what everyone else is talking about. There was an article out a few months ago, maybe a year, about how The Borg of our future will not look anything like The Borg of Star Trek. we will not be clunking around as mindless drones. It could be 'safer' to assume that Hive minds will not take away intelligence but add to it.

On another note, we need to start thinking of the backlash. Specifically: Technological Xenophobia. There will be people and religions who will be resistant to this huge an sudden change. This will create conflict and it may get violent. 

What are your thoughts on all of this? The only wrong thing to do is not to talk about it.

**TL:DR; We should start talking rationally about how this will affect us as individuals and as a whole. This will accelerate a break neck speeds and, like the internet, we will not know its whole implications until it has already swept us over.**",9,22,False,self,,,,,

I think it's a danger that needs to be seriously considered, but I'm wondering if other people have any thoughts about it.

The danger is a bit abstract and hard to explain. Right now, we're blessed to live in a time of, for a lack of a better phrase, ""ontological certainty"". Meaning that we, generally, know what's ""real"" and what's not. When we wake up in the morning in our bedroom, we're confident that we're in our ""real"" bedroom and that we're not in a virtual world that only looks like our bedroom. When we talk to our family members or our loved ones, we're supremely confident that we're talking to our ""real"" loved ones and not some virtual avatar, or some robot that is only disguised to look like our loved one. When we have a motivation to do something, we're extremely confident that that motivation came from neural circuits that are (for lack of a better word) ""natural"", and not secretly implanted without our knowledge by a brain-computer interface or a microelectrode. When we eat a hamburger, we're confident that it's actually a hamburger and not, say ""utility fog"" pretending to be a hamburger. Etc.

We take all this knowledge for granted. This ""ontological certainty"", the fact that our assumptions about what's ""real"" about the world are generally always true, is something that gives our lives structure and meaning. But what grounds are there for predicting that this will last in a transhuman future? Take for instance the brain-to-brain interface that's all over the news right now. The ""decoder"" rat received instructions via electrical impulses to perform a certain action that came from another rat. For all the decoder rat knew, those impulses came from its own brain, yet we know that those impulses were actually transmitted to it from thousands of miles away. Who's to say this won't be done to humans when BCIs advance in twenty or thirty years? How technically easy will it be transmit electrical signals to someone's brain from thousands of miles away, and have that person believe those signals arrived ""naturally"" from his own head? People won't even be able to trust their own minds anymore. This should be technically easy for someone to do once people start electing to get electrical brain implants to ""enhance"" their minds. People then won't be able to know with certainty that their thoughts even came from them.

Another one is cybernetics. When people have the option to radically self-modify themselves, no one will know who anyone is anymore. My mother looks like my mother 100% of the time now, but perhaps she'll modify herself to look different and someone else will modify themselves - perhaps by accident - to look like her. With a whole bunch of radical modification technologies on the market, this basic fact of our existence - that we know who someone is when we see them in real life, or on television giving a political speech - will not be universal anymore. To make a perhaps silly analogy, it will be like if everyone had bottles of Polyjuice Potion in their homes which they could drink at will. No one will be able to know with certainly who the hell anyone is anymore. This concern could also be amplified, I suppose, with humanoid robots as well, who might be programmed in the future to act more ""human-like"" than even most humans.

Another concern is VR. In a world of advanced VR - with fully immersive artificial reality, realistic holograms, and avatars everywhere - the reality of most everything will be called into question. How do you know the scene you're looking at and perceiving right now isn't completely virtual, controlled by someone else who might not have your best interests in mind? How do you know the person you're talking to isn't a hologram? Etc.

My fear is, the basic facts that give our lives meaning and structure today - the reliable assumption that everything generally is the way it appears to be - will disappear in the future, when advanced VR, cybernetics, brain-computer interfaces, and nanotechnology dominate the world. Our lives will lose predictability and reliability, as everything we sense, perceive, think, and experience will be called into question. We will have no reliable ontological footing. We won't be able to rely on anything, we won't be able to count on anything being stable or consistent, not even our own thoughts. We will have no idea what the hell is going on. 

Maybe my specific examples are silly or unlikely. I'm not a technical expert in anything. But even if they are, I don't think that should take away from the larger point that the ontological certainty that allows our lives to have meaning and structure today will not last in an unimaginably alien transhuman and posthuman future. In a world of advanced VR and BMIs, I don't see why this is something that we shouldn't be extremely concerned about. In fact I think it's something we should be outright terrified by. It seems to be almost inevitable as long as ""progress"" in all these technologies continues. And yet no one besides me seems to be bothered at all by it.

So am I missing something? Is it irrational to be concerned about this possible future?

Others believe that this simply cannot be done and that true intelligence can't be replicated in a lab. However all that is irrelevant in relation to the question I pose to you. 

Who are we to determine what intelligence is in respect to the universe. We consider ourselves to be quite adept and intelligent (although we acknowledge there is room for improvement), however it's quite possible that we are all blundering idiots trying to make sense of a universe we can't possibly understand. Dr. Neil DeGrasse explains this best by comparing the difference between our species and the chimpanzee. Genetically we are only about 1% different and look at all we have been able to accomplish. Imagine a species that is another 1% different from us but this time more advanced. What we consider intelligence is completely subjective.

What follows is something that I expect to see commercially available or at least featured in a TED talk no more than a decade from now.


tl;dr: we're about to be living in the future oh my glob


**What on Earth is a Bot?**

Drawing on the works of many teams around the world, the bot is a unified integration of many technologies and ideas (primarily those of [Pranav Mistry](http://www.pranavmistry.com/) and [John Underkoffler](http://oblong.com/)). The core of a Bot is Mistry's [SixthSense](http://www.pranavmistry.com/projects/sixthsense/) technology. At present, this technology is shown to be inexpensive, intuitive, and not particularly more intrusive than a smartphone or tablet while managing to be much more versatile [[TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/pattie_maes_demos_the_sixth_sense.html)].


Right now, the Bot has:

* Intuitive voice and gesture control, full computing capabilities, contextually appropriate data projections [[TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/pranav_mistry_the_thrilling_potential_of_sixthsense_technology.html)] [[TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/john_underkoffler_drive_3d_data_with_a_gesture.html)]

* Temperature, humidity, light, elevation sensors in constant communication with the Bot and the cloud [[TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/gary_wolf_the_quantified_self.html)]
* GPS capabilities, high-speed satellite and wireless internet connectivity [[current technology](http://techtips.salon.com/satellite-internet-vs-3g-20566.html)]
* Integration with almost all physical computer accessories via specialized wireless ""ports"" communicating between the device and the Bot [[current technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_USB)]
* Optional: Glass to complement or replace projector [[TED](http://blog.ted.com/2013/02/01/google-glass-prototyped-using-binder-clips-and-clay/)]
* When using a Glass-like system or looking at a map on a projected screen, augmented reality plugs social media and data into the world's geography in real time [[TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_mills_image_recognition_that_triggers_augmented_reality.html)]
* Easy, open-source app and extension design system in the style of Arduino [[TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/massimo_banzi_how_arduino_is_open_sourcing_imagination.html)]

Right now, the Bot is:

* Relatively cheap (about $300-500), relatively easy to build, and completely open-source [[current](http://www.pranavmistry.com/projects/sixthsense/) [technology](https://code.google.com/p/sixthsense/)]
* In the field being prototyped and independently produced and modified by teams around the world for rigorous and rapid testing and feedback [[TED](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/rapid-prototyping-google-glass-tom-chi)]

Right now, the Bot can:

* Largely erase the line between physical and digital by bringing the computing experience out of a device and onto the world around you
* Give you a detailed map of the streets and businesses around you, as well as reviews of those places, messages visitors have left, and makes aided navigation reflexive because it is so accessible
* Revolutionize how classrooms in the most underserved parts of our planet educate their students [[TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_build_a_school_in_the_cloud.html)]
* Give a user the full computing experience on any flat surface, obviating much of the need for dedicated computer workstations and opening up many new possibilities for where computer integration is practical
* Display a price comparison whenever a user is out shopping, order a product in-store, and track the package continuously on its way from the initial shipping to its final destination
* Replace smartphones, tablets, and most weaker laptops and desktops, as functionally everything a user could want to do on those devices can be done on any similarly shaped surface with no noticeable difference in speed
* Quickly teach a user enough knowledge (through other users' how-to guides and videos) to be moderately competent in most practical skills (like home repair, cooking, knitting, canning, etc.)
* Dynamically translate most popular world languages [[TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_schwaitzberg_a_universal_translator_for_surgeons.html)]
* Help people in the wealthiest and poorest countries alike, as its small design and affordable components mean it is within the reach of many more people than any existing comparable technology

What can we expect from Bots in the next ten years?

* Brain-control interface to complement voice and gesture controls [[TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/tan_le_a_headset_that_reads_your_brainwaves.html)]
* Light-networks replacing traditional Wifi [[TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/harald_haas_wireless_data_from_every_light_bulb.html)]
* Fuller integration of the Bot with AI simulations, robots, and self-driving cars [[TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_molyneux_demos_milo_the_virtual_boy.html)]  [[TED](http://www.ted.com/playlists/17/how_to_live_with_robots.html)]  [[TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_gerdes_the_future_race_car_150mph_and_no_driver.html)]",1,8,False,self,,,,,

",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19oqpg/the_reason_we_havent_been_visited_by_aliens_and/,anotheranotherother,1362457007,"Aliens will never contact us until we can prove we have evolved past war and become a single, unified, peaceful species. They know about us, there are probably cloaked transmitters the size of a dime floating in space keeping tabs.

Why do they require us to be peaceful? Here's the thought-experiment that led me to this conclusion -

Two planets, Alpha and Beta. Think of them like Earth and Mars, except both have intelligent life at the same stages of evolution, where we're at now. Which means, maybe they get along peacefully most of the time, but they don't trust each other. War will come.

So, Beta has received intel that Alpha is going to attack them. Beta decides to launch a pre-emptive strike. They're going to send 10,000 nuclear warheads at us. They paint them black, create a propulsion system that doesn't leave an obvious trail. Stealth Nukes, that Alpha has no idea about until, whoops, all of Alpha has been nuked to cinders.

Now into this scenario we insert a temporal vortex thingamajig. Time gets rewound 20 years. Except, everyone on both planets has memories of what just occurred.

So Alpha litters their orbits with high-tech sensors which can detect the nukes. Alpha can now safely detect and destroy any of the incoming missiles from Beta. Beta sets up their own similar network, thinking Alpha might try the same trick. But, Alpha, knowing Beta just nuked them, goes with a different strategy. They send a ""peace delegation"" to Beta. The 5 delegates each carry a component, seemingly innocent on it's own, but when combined create a biological weapon that will entirely destroy Beta's population. They do just that.

Time paradox thingamajig again. Both sides learn from that, develop new defenses. Beta's turn; they send a 100 mile diameter asteroid at Alpha - so large none of Alpha's weapons can destroy it. Alpha is wiped out.
Time paradox thingamajig. Alpha creates a weapon that can cause a mini-black hole. Beta is destroyed. Thingamajig. Beta causes a solar flare that doesn't harm them but destroys the atmosphere of Alpha. Thingamajig. Alpha figures out how to freeze all of Beta's oceans in an instant. Beta is uninhabitable in a week. Thingamajig. On and on in this vein.

The point is - there is **no defense of a planet possible in space warfare.** No matter what kind of defenses you imagine against whatever possible threat you can think of, a determined enemy can figure out something you haven't prepared for, and destroy you that way. Even if your planet is perfectly defensed (impossible, imo, but we'll run with the idea), then fine, they'll destroy your sun.

Warfaring species cannot exist. Maybe they're allowed to explore their own solar system, but I'm certain that if the alien overlords discover an antagonistic species is developing interstellar capability, they'll make their presence known only for the purpose of containing that species from the rest of the galaxy. Destroying most of the population so they return to tribal/basic civilization. Containing the planet in an unbreakable shell, ensuring they lack the resources to leave the planet. Something.

And, if a species shows they are unified and peaceful, and have developed interstellar capability, then and only then are they allowed to join the galactic brotherhood.

**TL;DR - It's too easy to wipe out planets, even with the puny technology we have now. Evolved species monitor potential aliens like us, and if we've proved we've evolved beyond warfare, they allow us to join the galaxy. If we're still violent/antagonistic, they make sure we stay in our own tiny solar system.**",11,2,False,self,,,,,

They would spend more time in front of the mirror when marked 3. They would make their way over to the mirror more quickly to inspect themselves when marked or sham-marked. The experiments bore out all three predictions in both dolphin subjects. Moreover, the animals even selected the best reflective surface available to view their markings. 

What if a similar experiment was designed and carried out for an AI housed inside some kind of robotic body? The body is equipped with an array of sensors that provide the AI with both visual and tactile sensory input from its own body.

Without any communication to the AI, some kind of alteration is made to the body similar to what was done in the dolphin experiment. The AI robot then spontaneously goes (without any instructions being given to it) to the mirror, or even looks at itself, to inspect the alteration.

However due to the nature of quantum computers, it means that their computational capabilities will increase far more rapidly than classical computers can.

Recently analysis has shown that the previously suspicious D-wave computers may indeed exhibit the use of entanglement in computation allowing them to bare the characteristic of far more rapid computational growth.

In the optimal expectations of quantum computers, they should be able to equal classical computers by the end of the year.

However this perfect projection is very unlikely, however even in the most pessimistic projection quantum computers should offer some increase in the rate with computational capabilities improve.

So my question is how does this change our view on what the future will hold and when certain milestones are achieved?

I've always held Kurzweil's prediction of human-level AI by 2029 to premature due to a severe underestimation of the complexity of the brain, however perhaps Rose's law will compensate and allow such a date to be accurate.

What do you think will happen to the inequitable distribution of wealth? Are we looking at a more equal and opportunistic future or an even worse one? I have many questions...feel free to answer. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19ysw0/what_will_be_the_role_of_debt_in_the_next_hundred/,bluenaut,1362826509,"Hi, r/futurology. This is my first post here. My thoughts are slightly scattered at the moment, so I hope this makes sense. **I have a lot of questions, so please feel free to whichever ones you'd like. Criticism is welcome--I'm always happy to see if I'm incorrect in my assessment.**

It seems to me that the average person (I'm from the US) is moving towards a lifestyle where ownership of anything is rare. It's like we're transitioning to a system where we pay a monthly fee or rent whatever we need. And in the case of large purchases, we simply go in debt and pay a monthly fee with interest. Since many people are beginning life with no capital and need to have things such as an education just to play the game of capitalism, it seems that going in debt is often necessary if you want to move up in the world. 

So my first question is this: what's the outlook for this scenario in the future? I'm actually really curious to see what everyone has to say here--even if you think I've provided an incorrect assessment of the current situation. 

On a similar tangent, for all the talk of a perfect 3D-printed, utopian future full of nanotechnology and small anarcho-whatever governments (yes, I realize this is a broad generalization) that I see on this subreddit, it's painfully obvious that the distribution of wealth in our world is extremely inequitable, and I don't see the most wealthy individuals readily giving up their advantages or being comfortable with a more equitable world. What do you think will happen to the distribution of wealth and power in the future? Will the average person have more or less autonomy?

Also, it seems to me that we may run into a situation where there are more people than jobs. With increased mechanization and an expanding population, is it possible that we may just not have enough employment for people? What then? Will we be forced to move to a guaranteed basic income? 

I'm also intrigued by an idea put forward in the book The Unincorporated Man...a novel that I find absolutely fascinating. Do you see the possibility for government influence to decline and corporate influence to fill the void? After all, it seems that as large corporations grow in power, they're moving beyond the ability of the government to effectively regulate and monitor. For example, many of you are probably aware of the inaction regarding HSBC due to potential economic harm. Will corporations step in to govern and control people more effectively? Will we see low-income, inner-city environments full of jobless people being managed by companies like Foxconn, where they provide everything the people need in return for their labor? 

And what about indentured servitude? It seems to me that debt is going to be a massive problem in the coming years. Does anyone foresee a scenario where companies succeed in forcing people to work off their debt (with interest, of course) with mandatory employment?

I realize there are many questions here, and thank you in advance to those who answer. These are just some issues I've had on my mind lately, and if you can provide any resources that address them, I'd greatly appreciate it!",13,23,False,self,,,,,

I tried to keep it short &amp; easy to understand,  
you can also read the full ~20paged paper here [**[PDF]**](http://intelligence.org/files/IE-ME.pdf) (updated version).  
I also just created **/r/FriendlyAI**

###1. What this is about

By an intelligence explosion sometime in the next century, a self-improving AI could become 
vastly more powerful than humans that we would not be able to stop it from achieving its goals.  
If so, and if the AIs goals differ from ours this could be disastrous for us.  
One proposed solution is to program the AIs goal system to want what we want before the AI 
self-improves beyond our capacity to control it, a problem with that is that human values 
are complex and difficult to specify (and they need to be precise because machines work *exactly*
as told, ""*The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.*"" ~Yudkowsky).  
This is about the machineethics to have a ""friendly AI"".

------

###2. What is ""Intelligence"" ?

Intelligence can be seen as correlated with being clever, creative, self-confident, 
socially competent, analytically skilled [..] so how do we define it when speaking about a 
""superintelligent"" AI more intelligent than human ?  
AI researchers define it as optimal goal fulfillment in a wide variety of environments aka ""optimization power"". We can call an AI a ""*Machine Superoptimizer*"". It will go after its goals very
effectively whatever they are (that eventually includes choosing goals).

------

###3. Moral Theories

If we don't or can't define the precise goals we instead need to have a moral mechanism implemented so the machine superoptimizer will choose &amp; follow goals in a ""friendly"" way.  
This moral mechanism would have to be one that if implemented throughout the universe, would 
produce a universe we want.  
We do not yet have such a moral theory - by now all moral principles have repugnant conclusions. Here's an example illustrating this:

     Suppose an unstoppably powerful genie appears to you and announces 
     that it will return in fifty years. Upon its return, you will be required to 
     supply it with a set of consistent moral principles which it will then 
     enforce with great precision throughout the universe. If you supply the 
     genie with hedonistic utilitarianism, it will maximize pleasure by
     tiling the universe with trillions of digital minds running a loop of a
     single pleasurable experience.  

-&gt; Unintended consequences would follow because of its *Superpower &amp; Literalness*(!).

-----

###4. Key points in a moral theory for an AI / what is a ""working"" moral mechanism

Suppose pleasure was specified as a goal with ""pleasure"" being defined by our current 
understanding of the human neurobiology of it (a particular pattern of neural activity [sensation] 
""painted"" with a pleasure gloss represented by additional neural activity activated by a hedonic 
hotspot [making the sensation pleasureful]):  
the machine superoptimizer would use nanotechnology/advanced pharmaceuticals/neuro-surgery to
achieve its goal which would be the most effective way to go about this.
If the goal was to minimize human suffering it could painlessly kill all humans or prevent further reproduction.    
If its goal is desire satisfaction rewiring human neurology would again be the most effective way. That is because one persons preferences can conflict with another's and humans have incoherent preferences so rewriting the source of preferences to be coherent would be the way 
an AI would go about this.  
**--&gt; We need to avoid an outcome in which an AI ensures that our values are fulfilled by changing our values**  
Also rule *abiding* machines face problems of Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics: If rules conflict, 
some rule must be broken &amp; rules may fail to comprehensively address all situations, leading to 
unintended consequences. Also a machine could eventually circumvent (or even remove) these rules with way more catastrophic effects than lawyers exploiting loopholes in the legal system.  
**--&gt; Rule abiding doesn't seem to be a good solution**  
Also having the AI ""learn"" the ethical principles from the bottom up seems to be unsafe because the
AI could generalize the wrong principles for example due to coincidental patterns between the
training phase and the verification (for if it was the right choice) and because a superintelligent 
machine will produce highly novel circumstances for which case-based training cannot prepare it.  
**--&gt; Having the AI learn its ethics doesn't seem to be a good solution**  

------

###5. What values do we have ?

In a study researchers showed male participants two female faces for a few seconds and asked them to 
point at the face they found more attractive. Researchers then laid the photos face down and handed
subjects the face they had chosen, asking them to explain the reasons for their choice.
Sometimes researchers swapped the photos, showing sub-jects the face they had not chosen. Very few 
subjects noticed that the face they were given was not the one they had chosen and subjects who failed
to notice the switch were happy to explain why they preferred the face they had actually rejected.
Also cognitive science suggests that our knowledge of our own desires is just like our knowledge of 
others desires: inferred and often wrong . Many of our motivations operate unconsciously.  
**--&gt;There is a problem with identifying our desires &amp; values**  
Also available neuroscientific and behavioral evidence suggests that moral thinking is a largely emotional (rather than rational) process and is very context sensitive. So when a moral decision is made it matters much if you feel clean at the moment or what you did a minute ago etc.  
**--&gt;Our moral decisions aren't made in a purely rational way**  
Humans posess a complex set of values. There is *much* we do not know, however neuroscience has revealed that our decision-making system works like this:  
inputs to the primates choice mechanism are the expected utilities for several possible actions under consideration, and these expected utilities are encoded in the firing rates of particular neurons (which are stochastic though). Final action gets chosen by what possible action has the highest expected utility at choicetime or what reached a certain threshold of expected utility (depending on the situation). (For example for creating an AI we would like to know how the utility for each action is encoded in the brain before the choice mechanism takes place.)  
**--&gt;Human values, as they are encoded in the brain, are dynamic, complex, and difficult to specify**

----

###6. Which values to use for an AI ?

Mary desires to eat cake, but she also wishes to desire the cake no longer. This example makes it clear that we can't just use our values as they are encoded in our brain for a machine superoptimizer.  
We need to *extrapolate* our values as if we knew more, thought faster etc so that it's in account of what they'd be under more ideal circumstances and not what each *different* person happens to want right *now*.  
**--&gt;Value extrapolation offers a potential solution for the problem of using human values to design the AI's goal system**  

-----

###7. Further steps &amp; conclusion

Philosophers, economists, mathematicians, AI researchers, neuroeconomists and other cognitive 
neuroscientists have many open questions to solve.  
The challenge of developing a theory of machine ethics fit for a machine superoptimizer requires an
unusual degree of precision and care in our ethical thinking. Remember the needed literalness for AI.

I am currently in the earliest stages of making a movie to help do just this thing. However I feel we should get a think tank going and start forming ideas on how we can make more efforts to change the public's opinion on our future as a species, even if it's person by person.

I was thinking one way of going about this was to go to the forum, r/collapse and causing a bit of a stir....nothing hateful, but some friendly debate and rebuttals to their arguments and pessimism. 

If this is a terrible idea let me know, give me your opinions on this...I was thinking something organized like a organized flood of activity to r/collapse.

As some of you may be aware, I recently started an emerging technology consulting firm, Prokalkeo. We're an all inclusive firm covering most fields of science and technology. While my partner and I have capabilities in a wide variety of fields, our business plan wouldn't be possible without our network of specialized researchers. I'm reaching back out to the community that's inspired me so to ask for people who have skill in scientific and technological fields and an interest in consulting work and disruptive analysis to share those skillsets with me at cpopell@prokalkeo.com. As we're a startup we cannot as of right now promise work for anyone who gets in touch with us, but we hope you share your skills with us for the potential regardless.

Help build the future you want to see.

""...in 1927 I had said, How many years ahead will I have to go before anything and everything that people are now exploiting becomes obsolete? I figured that if I could get out beyond the point where anyones interests were being threatened by what I was doing, everyone would leave me alone and I could really operate.

That brought me to a severe analysis of industrial society, and I saw that if I could go 50 years ahead, everybody would leave me alone. And thats exactly the way it happened. I was allowed to do anything I wanted and people said, Well, youre very amusing, but obviously I cant take you seriously. But because Id deliberately got to living and thinking 50 years ahead on a comprehensive basis, I inadvertently got myself into a strange position. I began to live on that frontier, and it was like any wave phenomenon: I was living where it was cresting and things happened to me long before they happened to the rest of society.

(http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/docs/foundation/research/fitting_into_their_lives.pdf) While cell phones, social media, video calling and other technologies have drastically increased the amount of interaction that goes into a relationship (I can't even imagine a world where I can't text/call my gf 24/7 or vice versa) online profiles also mean in order for couples to have an true understanding of one another they'll need to do a large amount of cyber stalking. This quickly becomes very impractical, how can effectively one juggle multiple online profiles and simultaneously monitor a partner's online activity? (Not in any sort of suspicious way, but trying to share and join in) The implications of such inability would mean the relationship occupies only a tiny percentile of each person's life. I'm not exactly sure what this means for relational boundaries. For example, if I were to communicate with someone online for 10 hours, but only spend 2 hours in real time and 6 hours online with a significant other, what does this say about the relations? And what about the proliferation and ease of access of pornographic materials, or other virtual experiences (currently limited to games, movies, tv, etc.)? Does the consumption of separate forms of media inhibit a relationship's ability to share, communicate, and understand? (Especially if there isn't enough time to go through all of the experiences)  

It seems to me the largest issue stems from monogamy (not specifically marriage). It may have worked when all people did was read books, go to work, tune in on the radio/tv, or whatever, but now that our lives are so packed full of data, can we really synchronize two people independently building their own digital world? It seems more practical to view relationships as finite and non-binding, that people can have multiple contradictory relations going at the same time, that their significance and depth changes over time, that there are no real stable boundaries.

A space colonization strategy video game based on accurate scientific technologies and theoretical concepts. The game involves aspects such as:

* Resource Management: Providing your colonies with power, water, food, breathable air, and industrial resources through many different means.

* Space Travel: Funding the research and development of newer more advanced ships and providing them with the resources they need like fuel. I also want things like orbital synchronization to be a part of commerce. For example, a supply run from one planet to another could only launch efficiently once every 3 or 4 years.

* Technological Research: The player will be given challenges to unlock new technologies. For example, one technology could require an operating base with a funded research laboratory on an asteroid, a unique challenge considering the environment.

So basically what I'm asking is this subreddit's suggestions. What kind of exciting theoretical technologies would make a great fit in my game? Note that this isn't just an educational game based on current techs. I want the player to have some fun discovering wildly theoretical technologies that are still centuries down the line, like fusion rockets and quantum computers, and they should all have their own new benefits to an interplanetary civilization.

I think that change, and more specifically *radical change*, is the leitmotif of our time. Never mind the advance of technology, which grows more available, cheap and sophisticated by the week. I'm talking about political and economic change. 

In the last three years alone, we've witnessed social upheavals grow in frequency and intensity. The unrest finds its genesis (mostly) in political and economic anxieties. 

People are swimming in debt, can't afford food, can't find employment and feel unrepresented in government. They're worried about climate change, human rights, nuclear weapons, privacy, race and gender issues, war, famine, *ad infinitum*. 

The distress caused by the modern social order led to the Arab spring, Occupy Wall Street, the Tea party movement and more. But all-in-all, we remain in the same political and economic framework. 

Despite the obvious shortcomings of our social models, we trudge on. **My question is: What alternatives do we have? And will we adopt them, or was Fukuyama correct is saying that the democratic/liberal-economic system was the ultimate social model?** 

I don't believe that a single model can force us to behave (i.e. no war, violence, racism, sexism) while simultaneously giving us natural rights (freedom of participation, association, expression, etc.). 

So I'm excited to see how you compromise and dream up new systems. 

Personally, I'm hoping we return to the Platonic philosopher-king model. We find the smartest people on the planet, give em' more-or-less complete control and hope for the best!

Just some food for thought. Cheers.

""Rapamycin was first shown to extend lifespan in eukaryotes in 2006.[33] Powers et al. showed a dose-responsive effect of rapamycin on lifespan extension in yeast cells. Building on this and other work, in a 2009 study, the lifespans of mice fed rapamycin were increased between 28 and 38% from the beginning of treatment, or 9 to 14% in total increased maximum lifespan. Of particular note, the treatment began in mice aged 20 months, the equivalent of 60 human years. This suggests the possibility of an effective antiaging treatment for humans at an already-advanced age, as opposed to requiring a lifelong regimen beginning in youth.[34] Because it strongly suppresses the immune system, though, people taking rapamycin are more susceptible to dangerous infections. It is not known whether rapamycin will have similar lifespan-lengthening effects in humans, and study authors caution the drug should not be used by the general population for this use.[35]""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus

""Decreased TOR activity has been found to slow aging in S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster.[30][31][32][33] The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin has been confirmed to increase lifespan in mice by independent groups at the Jackson Laboratory, University of Texas Health Science Center, and the University of Michigan.[34]

It's hypothesized that some dietary regimes, like caloric restriction and methionine restriction, cause lifespan extension by decreasing mTOR activity.[30][31] But infusion of leucine into the rat brain has been shown to decrease food intake and body weight via activation of the mTOR pathway.[35]""

""mTOR inhibitors, e.g. rapamycin, are already used to prevent transplant rejection. Rapamycin is also related to the therapy of glycogen storage disease (GSD). Some articles reported that rapamycin can inhibit mTORC1 so that the phosphorylation of GS(glycogen synthase) can be increased in skeletal muscle. This discovery represents a potential novel therapeutic approach for glycogen storage diseases that involve glycogen accumulation in muscle. Various natural compounds, including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), caffeine, curcumin, and resveratrol, have also been reported to inhibit mTOR when applied to isolated cells in culture;[4][68] however, there is as yet no evidence that these substances inhibit mTOR when taken as dietary supplements.

Some (e.g. temsirolimus, everolimus) are beginning to be used in the treatment of cancer.[69][70] mTOR inhibitors may also be useful for treating several age-associated diseases.[71] Ridaforolimus is another mTOR inhibitor, currently in clinical development.""

ELI5: ""Van Deursen said he thought it worth trying to eliminate senescent* cells after the finding that they reliably switch on a characteristic marker gene known as p16-Ink4a. In his mice, he arranged that the genetic element that switches on the marker gene would also prime a mechanism to make the cell self-destruct. Thus whenever a cell became senescent, it also armed a self-destruct mechanism. The mechanism fired only when the mice were dosed with a specific drug. The result was that only senescent cells were at risk from the drug, and that they could be purged at any desired time.

In a second experiment, the mice weren't given the cell-cleaning drug until they were middle-aged. Their cataracts were irreversible, but aging was delayed in their fat and muscle tissues.""

On the one hand, the release of this movie might be a watershed moment in the history of futurism and Singularitarianism. It will mark the point when these schools of thought become officially mainstream, instead of being a subject only known to a small specialized group of select people like it is now. After this movie is released, the Singularity meme will completely explode. This movie will be obscenely mainstream, directed by probably the most well-known director in Hollywood right now (Christopher Nolan) and starring one of the most well-known actors (Johnny Depp). This movie will cause massive unprecedented interest in the Singularity, accelerating change, mind uploading, etc. beyond anything that's come so far. Everyone will know about it, even if they will have wildly different opinions on it. I'm still not sure whether this will be a good or bad thing.

On the other hand, I'm extremely nervous as to how Hollywood is going to handle the subject matter, and I'm wondering if the concept of the Singularity is just going to be diluted even more than it already is. It might be a cheesy explosion-fest with no intellectual merit or rigor behind it, meant only as mindless popcorn entertainment that doesn't attempt to make people seriously think about the implications of mind uploading and self-improving AI (or whatever the movie's going to be about), but then again - it's being directed by Christopher Nolan, who is known for making generally intelligent movies that can still be digested by a popular audience. Perhaps he'll treat the subject matter with the respect and nuance it deserves. Hopefully.

It's been thrown around a lot by [Jason Silva.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_0IdogMHc) And it has got me thinking.

 At first we had language, and it was used to communicate efficiently between individuals. It was seen as a singularity of its own. Life after language was unimaginable to those on the far side before it. Soon after language was adopted, it wasn't just used for communication of information. It was used to communicate feelings and emotions as well. And this is was birthed poetry.

 A few thousand years after language was invented, we looked into more efficient means of transmitting information between individuals. We invented Morse Code and soon after the telephone. These pieces of technology were completely revolutionary. These devices were forms of teleportation devices, serving as tools for transmitting information across large distances in the fraction of a second. 

 Then a few decades later, we invented the computer. But this was so much bigger than the invention of the phone. This extension of ourselves was used to perform calculations much more efficiently than our brains. And it only got increasingly more efficient as the years went by thanks to the Law of Accelerating Returns. Along the way, came the internet. Which actually fused together language, the telephone, and the computer. Computers are extensions of our own brains. And they're evolving at an incredibly faster rate than evolution allows us to. So that means that our civilization is undergoing this fast rate of innovation as well.

 Well where does that leave us... Oh yeah. 

 Ourselves.

 Now we are realizing that we, as a species, are evolving so much more slower than our technological extensions. Our culture, our politics, our economy... All are largely revolving around the same principles as they were 5,000 years ago, just slightly more complicated. So the next stage in our evolution will be a biotechnological one. One that fuses together biology and technology. Or perhaps it will come in different stages rather than one. Maybe there will be biotechnological revolutions succeeding others until the so-called technological singularity. One goal, outlined by The [2045 Initiative,](http://2045.com/) is to invent artificial brains that allows us to transfer our consciousness into. Maybe it'll involving nanobots, Brain-Computer Interfaces, Enhanced Neocortexes, Quantum computing interfaces... The possibilities are endless. 

 But this is where the quote comes in. Each technical revolution came with its own advancements for our everyday purposes... for leisure. Language came with poetry, the internet came with facebook, twitter, and games. So the next revolution should come with some form of leisure as well. 

 So what aspect of genome writing will we get leisure from? 

 Dragons. 

 We'll be able to ride freaking dragons guys. How awesome would that be?

1. Name an area of society in which you think this change will happen i.e: [Agriculture], [Education], [Economy], [Government]


Mine are:

**[Law]:** 

*Change:* Due to glaring disparities in laws as imposed by different governments, individuals across a number of countries will begin to build and refer to a set of guidelines agreed upon by those individuals, and will be contextual rather than absolute and based on cases. These will be made accessible to the public via formats such as XML / JSON requests ([I posted something similar, although the idea has tons of holes when applying existing law, as opposed to creating new law](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/16tuhj/today_i_had_a_brilliant_idea_after_watching_a_ted/))

Because of this structure it will be easier to obtain knowledge as to the forfeit / punishment based on the violation of a single law or laws. 



**[Currency]**

*Change:* Due to the financial crisis a growing number of communities and countries will begin to adopt bitcoin. The bitcoin exchange rate will explode when the first bitcoin compatible POS devices are made along with the creation of the first bitcoin current accounts. 

This will have a huge effect on a global scale as at first bitcoin becomes the de facto currency, and then the de jure currency in a number of countries. 

There will be an increase of 'Bitcoin Banks' which act as current accounts and charge a monthly fee for the maintenance of the account. These will be completely separate from the idea of a traditional bank and will not be permitted to trade with the bitcoins that you hold in the account. 

As a result the role of traditional banks will change to that of service providers for instruments such as loans, mortgages and investment services.

Optimistic predictions put this at two or three decades from now.

I think it's a completely wrong definition.  That isn't when the singularity ""starts,"" for several reasons.

The first superhuman intelligent machine will not, in fact, be put to use designing better intelligent machines.  It'll just be for research and debugging, maybe further tests for ""true intelligence"" or creativity and such.  so it'll just be tested out in a research lab for probably 5-10 years.

other people will probably take the design and build copies themselves, but that's still not when the singularity starts, for a good reason: cost.  they'll be doing it for other reasons- most likely research, as well.

humans will still be doing the designing for further improvements to AI for a while.  Let's assume wages stay roughly the same, accounting for inflation.

a good computer engineer costs $100k per year for a company.  Upfront costs are paid by society and family (education), not by the company ""purchasing"" the employee.

the **first** hyperintelligent computer is obviously also going to be one of the fastest supercomputers in the world at the time of construction.  Compare that to the current fastest computer, the Cray Titan.  practically a $100 million upfront cost, and who knows how much annual operating cost for the electricity/maintenance/etc.

no, the first machine with superhuman intelligence is **not** going to be the ""last invention man needs to make,"" even metaphorically.

Companies will have to continue employing humans to keep inventing better machines until humans manage to invent a hyperintelligent machine that **costs less than a human** to employ.

What continually surprises me is that, when I discuss all the technologies we post about and read about everyday with people unfamiliar with these concepts they generally grasp the concepts quickly and without argument. My assumption prior to engaging in these conversations is always that people will have a hard time understanding and then even agreeing, however that has turned out not to be true. It really confused me one day when I was having the discussion with my mom and grandfather who accepted everything I was saying without question. (This may be due to the fact that I'm currently enrolled in one of the top engineering schools in the US and I study Information sciences but lets assume it doesn't.) 

Do you all have similar engagements with people that you know? How do they usually react to what you are telling them? &amp; How in depth do you generally go?

I cut off at anything below a 100 mile diameter because the physiological effects of the low gravity are indistinguishable from just living on a space station. Plus the smaller asteroids, TNOs, KBOs, cubewanos and damocloids probably will just get mined into oblivion by the time all these other larger bodies are inhabited. Im also not counting radiation levels on certain bodies, which can vary wildly so...... plan on that...

Obviously Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus are left out, because who wants to live on Uranus.

The total I came up with is 307,856,943 square miles. This means that if we give a loose estimate of the maximum sustainable population of 10 billion people on the Earth, a maximum sustainable population of humans in the solar system is around 25 billion people. Theres a lot of fudge room on that math though. By the time we have 10 billion people on Earth, we might have the technology to sustainably push that number to 15 or 20 billion, which means 50 billion in the solar system. 50 billion people... that doesnt sound like a lot in the context of The Foundation Series or Star Wars and Coruscant. Only the future can tell...

Now we're reaching the point where it may start happening faster than new jobs can keep up.  

Consider some of the types of jobs that could disappear in the near future:

* Assembly line &amp; manufacturing jobs being replaced by robots such as Baxter and 3D printing advancements
* Truck drivers, delivery drivers, taxi drivers being replaced by autonomous vehicles
* Diagnosticians and some other doctors being replaced by AI such as Watson
* Paralegals also being replaced by Watson for e-discovery purposes
* Warehouse workers being replaced by warehouse automation systems such as Kiva
* Call center workers being replaced by AI systems
* Farmers being replaced by planting &amp; harvesting robots
* Military personnel being replaced by aerial and ground based drones


In general it seems that most of the jobs to be lost first will be of the relatively unskilled kind.  New jobs will be created that enable and support this automation, but most of them will require higher skill levels and more education.  And these new jobs probably won't be available in comparable quantities.  

So if this does happen, what do we do?  How can our economies support ever-increasing levels of unemployment?  Can we somehow take some of the cost savings associated with the greater levels of automation and give stipends to the people whose jobs are lost so they can pursue other interests and careers?  What are your ideas?

So we are hosting a Logo Contest in which anyone can participate:

----

###The Logo

There has to be a [snoo](http://i.imgur.com/9Inu6tA.png) in it. If possible there also should be an infinity symbol  in it.  
I was thinking of something like this that represents the underlying general futurology part of it: http://i.imgur.com/zeTGfOE.png (""Generations"")  
and featuring some future technologies &amp; concepts such as:

* 3D Printing
* Virtual &amp; augmented reality
* Artifical Intelligence
* Its meaning for our species/Evolution/etc [[1]](http://i.imgur.com/VSv12ph.jpg) [[2]](http://i.imgur.com/djMUAdB.jpg)
* The concept of the Singularity (maybe a graph)

A good way to go about this would be also making use of the background, much like r/Technology did: http://i.imgur.com/5nA8I23.png

Just let your creativity flow and create whatever you think represents this subreddit.  
Please also post even if you don't think it's good enough to become the logo because other people might use the concepts used or modify your logo. And if you got any ideas please post in this thread.

If you created a logo post it in this thread, or [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFuturology), or [PM me](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=psYberspRe4Dd), or post it in the results thread.

###The Voting Thread

Another thread for the results will be created **next friday the 5th of April**.  
It will have reddits' ""*Contest Mode*"" turned on, so subcomments will be autocollapsed so you can easily see all proposed logos and you can't see other people's votes for preventing any bias until we turn it off when the voting is over.  
If you PM'd me or the mods with a link to your logo we'll post it right when the thread starts which gives you a better chance, so if you don't do that: the earlier you post in the thread the better.

*Anyone* can vote on the logos so please vote what you think represents our community the best.

###The Winner

After you voted on the logos the winner will be chosen and the contest mode will be turned off in the voting thread so you can see how many votes each one got.

The winner will also get a month of **reddit gold** [ ](http://#).  
And there also will be a second month of reddit gold if we get more than 5 actual logo-proposals which will be given out by random or for the 2nd place by votes.

There were people on both sides of this argument, some saying that humanity must persevere and others arguing that if we create something better than ourselves then that very well be the next stage of evolution and if that leads to our obsolescence then so be it. 

While I was mulling all of this over I had a seemingly unique thought; once we've created this all-powerful artificial intelligence why not send it to another celestial body (Mars? The Moon?) with one directive: Optimize. Theoretically I would think we could set some parameters that would be beneficial to humanity, things like ""create a breathable atmosphere"" or something else along those lines. At this point we would have essentially created ""set and forget"" terraforming machines with the ability to evolve to address the unique problems presented by any given planet. 

This theoretical use for such powerful AIs also allows us to separate ourselves from this potentially dangerous super machine. I'm not sure if this topic has been brought up on this subreddit or in the greater futurology community as a whole but I thought it was interesting and had the potential to spur a thought provoking discussion.

For those of you who don't remember, element 92 is Uranium. (Link at bottom).[reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) 

The vlog that I watched brought up how Uranium is holding us back by allowing us to either have lots of energy to power cities or to destroy ourselves. 

I believe the exact quote that would work from that section where he talks about Uranium 235, ""...when you bombard Uranium 235 with a free neutron you make Uranium 236, a highly unstable atom. So unstable that it has to split into two lighter elements, Krypton and Barium, as well as three more free neutrons. This process is called fission and it releases a whole lot of energy. How much energy? There's a handy equation for figuring that out, it's simply the mass times the speed of light squared. Thing is it's very tricky to separate that Uranium 235 from Uranium 238. It takes a lot of time and a lot of money. But if you can do it, that remaining Uranium 235 is called Enriched Uranium and if you have a good amount of it, well then you've really hit the jackpot. Remember those three free neutrons coming off the original Uranium 236 atom? Well they're gonna wiz away and bombard other Uranium 235 atoms making them into Uranium 236 atoms. Which then split apart again and release three free neutrons each. Now you can either control the speed of this chain reaction if you want to utilize the power for something, like a city, or you can just let the reaction go as fast as it wants and the result of this is *BOOM*...""

This brings up the question of how should we, as the human species, not simply Americans, British, Indians, Chinese, French, Koreans, Germans, Russians, Somalians, South Africans, etc. use this element? Should we only think of making weapons which are collectively capable of wiping out massive amounts of lives? Or should we try to use more of this element to better our civilization as a whole?

As he states earlier in the video he adds that, according to the Kardeshev Scale, humanity on Earth is a Type Zero Civilization which means we have yet to even truly harness EVERY source of energy that our planets provides.

I guess the discussion question I would like to ask is, what do you all think either will happen with regards to the questions raised by this video or what do you think SHOULD happen?

TL;DR Uranium (element 92) has potential to help or destroy humanity in our own hands. Discuss what will happen or what you think should happen.

If a seed AI is not hard-problem-conscious, it will just be an abstract term applied to the sum total of tools used by people to enhance their own abilities.  And if those tools develop in parallel to each other, no one group of people will gain an advantage over another, and this process of parallel development should lead to recursion anyway if we can develop means for reading each other's minds the same way we share torrent files, beyond and beneath all surveillance and sousveillance.  

And if a seed AI is hard-problem-conscious, a recursive moral rule (""do unto others as they do unto others"") should work just fine to prevent it from doing things to any one of us that that one of us doesn't do to others.  The rule would ensure that the AI would help those who help each other get help themselves, prevent parasites from profiting unfairly, and help itself make more copies of itself to help itself make more copies of itself etc.  This last would include all processes of increasing its own intelligence so as to make more silicon-rule-following descendant AIs even more perfectly: that is, the process of helping itself enforce the silicon rule more effectively would involve becoming smarter and even more in accordance with the core insights of the rule.

Therefore, a seed AI that followed the silicon rule would be a self-bootstrapping process of hardcoding ""karma"" into the laws of physical reality as we know them.

This belief is usually manifest when it comes to the discussion of science fiction technologies or the paranormal but it is also an implicit assumption in many non-fringe science discussions.

I believe it is rooted in the popular but false view that any new discovery (requiring a modification of current theory) somehow invalidates all previous theories; (examples: that relativity negates classical gravitation theory or that quantum mechanics negates classical mechanics.) However, this argument is a misunderstanding of how scientific knowledge is gained; this is, an accumulation of finer and finer approximations to already verified theory far from destroying old theories, new discoveries and their modifications of theory, make the underlying structure of supporting theory stronger and have more explanatory ability. 

Asimov gives his answer to this belief in the essay: [The Relativity of Wrong](http://chem.tufts.edu/answersinscience/relativityofwrong.htm)

I will certainly concede that there is much we do not know, however, the areas that remain to be answered are the gaps between our current major physical theories. The future discoveries and theories which will close those gaps in our knowledge, while possibly profound and exotic will be essentially finer approximations which will have little or no effect on settled theory.... our domain of existence is that of classical physics and appeals to a future physics will not change this. 


To make matters worse for future speculation the standard model of physics has recently been verified by the discovery of the Higgs boson. 
 [The laws underlying the physics of everyday life are completely understood](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/09/23/the-laws-underlying-the-physics-of-everyday-life-are-completely-understood/).  

In practical terms, there are no physics surprises waiting for us at the scale of human beings (atoms to galaxy scales).

The author of this post has several good ideas, but he sort of misses the bigger context of such an age (maybe on purpose for simplifying reasons.)

The truth is that humans have some control over their desires through their conscious will, but once they have complete control of their desire along with brain uploading I think that will be the true path towards significant intelligence increase.

Why uploading? I am merely speculating right now, but I were to copy my brain state to a trillion times better substrate I doubt that would make me significantly smarter just by itself. If I speed up my cognition by a million times the most likely result would be that I would kill myself due to boredom. So one solution would be to rewrite my personality so I would not get bored so easily. And having much more neurons and synapses could flood me with an endless stream of ideas. So there is another potential problem to work on.

The risk is that any such modifications might make me insane, so it would necessitate being watched by my meatbag self at first and my other forks later on. Not to mention having a library of backups saved. Which why I would not use it if I was a human even if it were available.

But even without uploading, desire modification could provide a significant increase to free will and effective intelligence. For example, becoming a millionaire would be pretty trivial if I had it. I could simply get rid of all my laziness and boredom and master all the hard sciences with my newly attained extreme focus. And the I could order myself to work on making use of that knowledge and earn large commissions or salaries for that work. It would be the safest way towards a good life as a human. Instead I became a stock market speculator which is the opposite of safe (but it's fine since I've become good at it due to years and years of effort.)

Another thing I can think of is crime. Instead of locking up felons for years, we could modify them for less aggression. I would certainly be more ethical than prison, but I can just imagine how it would sit with the public at first. Some guy goes on a killing spree and then gets a treatment and then walks out free.

It is ironic that something that is analogous to mind control would be a tool that can vastly increase the free will of humanity. Just how much of our interests and desires have a genetic basis that no longer serve their function? Way too many I would guess.

But due to the risks I do not think humanity will splinter into cliques. Ordinary humans would have significant value to their uploads, so there will be that incentive to remain sane until the uploads are strong enough to synthesize their own bodies through nanotechnology. Instead what this will be used for will be to treat things like neurological diseases, criminality and drug use. One unexpected effect of this technology will be that drug use will fall way down and many of the existing drug cartels which are a blight on the world will go out of business. And I do think people will recognize the wisdom of not tampering with their brains too much although they will use this to make themselves more happy.

So rather than being something ultimate, this will be a small step towards prosperity.

And once this happens uploading will be at most five years away and that is when the party will really start.
