Result of spending too much resources to better the lives of billions.

Sure, there are unlimited amount of resources aggregately. However, if the effort is not worth the benefit, these resources will stay there and won't be used.

Someone said there is a virtually unlimited amount of lithium in the sea, and lithium is very vital for today's tech. However, at some point, trying to extract minute amount of lithium from a huge body of seawater becomes no longer worth the energy spent for it.

Wouldn't it make more sense to ration the future to the 'right' people so unnecessary resources are not spent?

I think that if we can ration the resources being spent so only 20% of today's consumption takes place, the world can gain half century's tech resources, and by then we would have reached singularity, outer space, etc.

---
Collectors: These are human individuals who collect information from the real to put into a computer system (this is all they do).

Decision Class: They are our judges (some level of police) and makers of the computer systems that are being used. They decide what needs to be kept and what doesn't. 

Automation Class: These of course are the computers that need inputs to help create fast automation. This class works well with the collector class. This class includes humans+robots working together.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Class: This class is a system that brings information from many automation centers and work hand and hand with the Decision Class to make the world better. They of course don't need humans to decide but are programmed to understand humans. 

Creationists/Destroyits Class: These are the people and mechanics (humans+robotics) that actually repair, destroy, create, and recycle items from robots that we either use or don't use. 

Society Class: This class includes the jobs that we need to keep humans useful like teachers: knowledge and human interaction. There will be social hubs solely for humans. Money is not important because a Universal Basic Income will be in effect.

Tell me what you think. Please help me create realist world that will be created with jobs that will be created and a society that will happen. Look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Currently, there is a lot of discussion on driverless cars.  Everyone seems to be jumping on the bandwagon, but I fail to see why people think this is the future of travel.  It's a tangential, shortsighted departure towards an inevitable deadend, as it is now.

I drive my daily commute each day and its very easy to look at the roads I travel on and see, to my distaste, how shortsighted we are as a society in how we maintain and 'improve' our lives on the go. 

'Roads' in their current form, are the limiting factor preventing true innovation in travel.  They are a nightmare to maintain, they are limited in geography, they forcibly disrupt nature.  The advent of driverless cars doesn't do anything to solve these problems.  In addition, driverless cars must still adhere to rules of the road, avoiding pedestrians, stopping at crossings and intersections, and avoiding other potentially dangerous situations.  

With that said, I can state fairly assertively that driverless cars are not the route (no pun intended) we should be headed in terms of autonomous travel.  Or rather, they are only a small part of it!

I personally would love to have a discussion about alternative, more innovative solutions to the issue of futuristic travel.   

I will start the discussion with my own thoughts on the subject.  Feel free to debate, critique, or add to it!  My goal for this thread is to think outside the box and develop a better foundation for innovative thought in regards to futuristic travel.

So what do I believe is the future if not driverless cars?

Well, to start, I do think driverless cars have a place.  But they are only a small part of the larger solution.

Firstly, imagine walking through city streets, not worrying about stop lights, or crosswalks, or any kind of motorized vehicle blocking your way, or potentially running your over.  Each block you walk down is wide, filled with carefree people, comfortable benches, lush vegetation, beautiful fountains, etc.  Shops have large areas for outside seating.  This isn't just a single street, its every street.  

Driverless cars are not a part of this picture.  

The direction we should be headed is actually back to the novel idea of transportation on tracks!  Think PRT(personal rapid transport), but with a twist.

The main goal would be to replace major highways and main streets with elevated tracks.  Picture large monorails spanning high above our current roads, hovering over treetops, rivers, and through city buildings.

Individuals would travel on more typical roads, inside automated self driving(pods) vehicles essentially in the same fashion that is currently predicted for self driving cars.  You could order a pickup, they arrive promptly to your address, and begin taking you to your destination.  Instead of driving on a highway, they would drive you to a loading platform, enter you into a queue, where you would eventually be loaded onto the main track of the PRT, where your destination is now limitless.  You will stay inside the same vehicle you entered at your home, the entire time!  

I'm positive this is the direction we should be headed.  I'd be curious to hear why you don't agree, or where you see areas of improvement!  ",10,4,False,self,,,,,

Today we had a small chat with my GF about the evolution of the price of gold and about the impact the new virtual currencies could have on it. Almost 80% of gold consumed each year is made into jewellery; which is a poor use (in my opinion) of a rare metal with such interesting properties. And so I would like to ask you to help me find new uses for gold once (or if) its price will collapse. Obviously, we already use gold in microelectronics, medicine and aerospace. But if its price was just a fraction of what it is today, maybe we could use it in surface treatment for its antibacterial properties. Just imagine golden doorhandles in public toilet or golden grab handles in subway trains etc. If you have other ideas I would love to read them. Thank you.",12,1,False,self,,,,,

Advancements in science had rendered the world a more peaceful place. In fact, It was the first time in human history where no man, woman or child had died as a result of war, starvation, or curable diseases.  

To commemorate this historical achievement, the United Nations decided to launch a vote. The purpose of this vote was to replace the 12 ""Inappropriate"" words of the calendar months for words that embodied humanities collective universal ethic, the same ethic inherent in all cultures and all major religions. 

Like the Olympics, all people of all nations were invited to participate. As a result of the vote, the twelves words deemed by humanity to be most worthy of our attention and hence the new names of the months were as followed; Tolerance, Compassion, Courage, Patience, Honesty, Hope, Gratitude, Wisdom, Optimism, Diversity, Equality and Humility. 

The worlds citizens were also given the opportunity to vote on the name of this new calendar. And, on New Year's Eve 2030, after all the votes were tallied up, humanity was introduced to its new official civil calendar;  The Virtue Calendar.

In this hypothetical scenario; through the act of a single vote, humanity had effectively created a dual purpose instrument called the Virtue Calendar. Dual purpose in the sense that the calendar not only served its original purpose of organizing days and synchronizing events, but also served a new secondary purpose of promoting universal virtues.

The premise is that there was an auto-management AI with a female name that initially replaced middle management jobs (ie rostering and stuff) and expanded, taking over more and more tasks. 

This included things like giving voice commands to low-skilled workers in warehouses and fast food joints. It became entrenched and joined up between organisations, leading to a second class of people that it would not employ, who lived in massive public housing lots.

This took over the whole world, except Australia. The protagonist is invited to go to Oz, where it's like a big commune with ultra high tech. It's pretty great.

Does anyone remember this story? I really would love to re-read it, and it ties in well to mu course at the moment. This might not be the best sub, but I couldn't think of a more relevant one.

Every other 'nominally' independent countries were that way because various European powers decided to share influence over some countries rather than carve them for themselves; for example Persia was a joint playground of Russia and England, while Ottoman Turkey was turning into an appendage of Germany.

Social Darwinism was the strongest at that time too.

After the Great War, the presence of millions of lower class with military experience forced the elites to co-opt them, and after World War 2 social darwinism became passe.

However, in the future, there will be no jobs except those who are very, very, very smart who will have jobs pertaining to the needs of the New Civilization.

Those who lack the skills to secure a high-paying position in the new civilization will be in very bad shape, and will be in no position to propagate.

I think that as resources are consolidated in the hands of the most able and and most ruthless, they will probably stop caring about the less able, less intelligent, less wealthy , etc since these people no longer affect their wealth, well-being, existence , etc.

The future is brutal. The financialization of everything means there is no more 'slack' for the less able to get 'lucky'; everyone will live like Singaporeans, who know they can never be closer to the family of Lee Kwan Yew, who set up things so his descendants would be the richest in Singapore for ever, but will make peace with it and will try to live their their lives according to their positions.

I think that barring any kind of unforeseen catastrophe such as resource shortages (something I have talked about here a few times), the displacement of the less able, less intelligent and less wealthy by those who are more able, etc will be completed before Singularity.

https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/history/events/nice-day-for-a-genocide-shocking-quotes-on-indians-by-us-leaders-pt-1/

Immortal words said by America's greatest men. By displacing the natives they created the greatest civilization on earth, so what they did was a good thing in a utilitarian way although the natives did not like it too much.

William Henry Harrison's immortal words :
Is one of the fairest portions of the globe to remain in a state of nature, the haunt of a few wretched savages, when it seems destined by the Creator to give support to a large population and to be the seat of civilization?

--
Such philosophy drove civilization, and by concentrating all resources to the more able, we will hopefully reach the space before it is too late.

As I have said a few times, maybe 40-80 million people, with a cap of no more than 500m as the inscription at the Georgia Guidestones says, of the world's better people will get to enjoy the future, although at least 7 billion people won't like it too much.

It is evolution. trying to stop it is not beneficial, and might destroy the Future altogether. Instead, it is important to educate the people of the world that some are more able, and more deserving, than others and the rest of the world should defer, and sacrifice, for the better ones, like the people of Japan and Singapore have learned to do so.

The only regret is there is no way to recover the resources the world's 7 billion people had wasted. A century of horizontal growth, instead of vertical growth which is the only way to advance civilization, has destroyed too much resources and may actually cost us the best chance to conquer space.

If you can link a reputable article suggesting that perhaps robots can be creative it would be appreciated.

I'm Amrit, [the accidental journalist](http://amritsharma.com/portfolio) and I've the incredible honor to sit down and interview Ramez Naam this weekend at Singularity University's India Summit in Mumbai. Ramez is an award-winning author for his NEXUS books (fiction), The Infinite Resource: The Power of Ideas on a Finite Planet (non-fiction) and More Than Human: Embracing the Promise of Biological Enhancement (non-fiction). He lectures at [SingularityU](http://su.org) on clean energy, environment and innovation. And much more. You can read his [full bio right here](http://rameznaam.com/about/).


I will ask him questions about clean tech, artificial intelligence, his [clean energy AngelList syndicate](http://rameznaam.com/2016/02/22/why-im-starting-the-first-angel-list-cleantech-syndicate/), why he changed his mind on EVs to now believe that they're a major disruptor, and some questions out of left field.


I will ask him the most upvoted questions here. Ask away in the comments.

http://greyenlightenment.com/gnons-wager/

&gt; There are one of two outcomes: societal collapse (IMHO, unlikely)

or

transition to type-1 civilization in which the aforementioned companies [i.e. GOOG, AMZN, etc] dominate and capital continues to grow relative to total global wealth.

==

Current trends won't change - the advantages of today's winners are too great for any new competition to overcome.

Hopefully, the world will literally sleepwalk its way into Singularity and the next level of spacefaring civilization, with no change of status for most people. Today's standard of living for most people is set, with most people facing penury and destitution. But the winners of the Techno-feudal civilization will conquer the space.

However, again, resource is the one and only remaining limiting factor, and if we continue to spend current amount of resources while not reaching the next level of civ, we will meet a sudden, irreversible collapse which will probably do away humanity by 2040 or so.

Since current trends won't change and nobody is going to implement my idea of pricing out most of the world's pop from future gadgets, we will probably hit an iceberg by 2035-40 if the new tech to take us to the next dimension is not there yet.

We can't just 'muddle along' for a long time, because resources are getting consumed as of this moment while infrastructure laid out in the last half century will fall apart sooner or later.

So the world must either supercharge to reach the next level of civ, or face collapse. It is like a poker tournament in which a player cannot sit still for a long time, since the rising blinds will consume the initial number of chips.",16,1,False,self,,,,,

Eventually, either for military, city, or civilian purposes, a dedicated exosuit production factory may be built. For the project im trying to create the most realistic looking and functioning model exosuit factory. So the question is, what currently mass produced product is most closely related to an exosuit? That is materials, size, assembly, and other factors that go into mass production. 

My guess is a mix between motorcyles, bicycles, and computers.

The exosuit design in mind would range from simple leg braces, to full body suits for firefighters.

Im aware some plants are broken up, having parts manufactured somewhere and shipped to another plant, but i want to try to include just about everything in production of a suit down to the raw materials. (unless said part is a lot more efficient to buy pre-made from a separate company.) Im trying to go for the most efficient production rather than money saving.

Thanks. Hope this sparks a conversation.",9,7,False,self,,,,,

I see things being done with neural networks that I didn't expect to see computers doing any time soon, if ever.  All of this is implemented in consumer grade hardware.  I wonder if I'm feeling a little bit of what other hominids did when they first encountered modern humans... a sense of the unknown, and the real possibility of becoming obsolete.

This makes me wonder how far along an organization like Google is in pushing these boundries, given their vast resources.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, and I don't think they are hiding AI slaves (yet).  If and when something finally ""wakes up"" in a research lab, though, it is likely to be months or years before the public learns of it.  A large company has literally NO incentive to let that information out sooner.  This means that the rest of humanity is likely to be that much further behind the curve in responding to a technology that is likely to change the face of our world. 

One thing we could do to shift those incentives is finally define a way to determine if an intelligence is sentient (even if it was vague... like giving judges or a special committee the ability to declare something sentient based on their own criteria), and to pass mandatory reporting if something wakes up, as well as mandatory reporting of things likely to present a danger to humanity.

Laws can be broken, and this would be nearly unenforceable in real time, but it would change the incentive landscape.  If Google were to reveal tomorrow that they had sentient AI for the last ten years, there is literally nothing bad that could happen to them, even if that AI did terrible things (or terrible things were done to it).  On the other hand, if they had been breaking the law by harboring such a thing secretly, they could face consequences.  This, in turn, would increase risks and create an incentive to bring world-changing developments out into the open.

I'm not trying to pick on Google here; I mention them because I think they are likely one of three or four organizations that will spawn the first true artificial mind.  We don't know when this will happen, but we are getting to the point where ""tomorrow"" is a distinct possiblity, if a remote one.  We can't legislate technological change, but perhaps it is time to start setting some expectations for the behavior of organizations with respect to these new technologies.",0,2,False,self,,,,,

Trump is now showing signs of walking the 'right' way, just like George W. Bush and Obama.

The course for the future is now set. Nothing can change it, since the powers of status quo is too much for any kind of power to challenge.

Today's tech giants will appreciate forever, since there is no more competition which can challenge their power. It is like the Great Powers being set ; no Great Powers have been added since 1905, when Japan became the final Great Power to be added into the roll after beating Russian Empire.

Today's tech darlings will grow forever, today's social status will be there forever, and today's losers will be there forever.

The end of history has arrived. Trump's white flag over the issue in Syria means the course of history will flow without any surprises.

The resources of Middle East will be exploited, Russia will be dismembered so the world can have a bonanza like the 1990s, and North Korea will be annexed by the weak South Korea so NK's rare earths can be used by the West and China will lose its monopoly for a lot of rare stuff needed to continue the tech civ. (NK has quite a lot of rare earths and metals, something which is not well known to the West. It also has lots of uranium ; the first Soviet nukes were built from uranium mined from North Korea and refined by the Japanese)

Only the high-IQed people, and some lower-IQ people who somehow can function in this cutthroat, ruthless and merciless world which is winner-take-all favoring the intelligent, the informed and the adaptable, will have a place - the other people will just end up like the folks in the fourth chapter of Marshall Brain's Manna, warehoused in some remote place waiting to die, or worse, like the folks in Bengal in 1943 where up to 7 million died but no one outside that region knows about it.

That fate is unavoidable, because the future has NO place for those who can't function in there and will have no jobs for them.

Everything is inevitable.

I don't know who caused Trump to see the 'light'. He was a good distraction, but he puts the safety of his clan before anything else. Maybe John McCain.

Most people will live hand-to-mouth or worse, like their great-g-grandparents did. Drifting from one gig job to another, they won't be able to settle down to raise a family. Like many younger sons in the old days who had two career choices - clergy if they were bright, and soldier if they were not. Neither not very likely to propagate one's genes, although the smarter ones did somehow manage.

And the winners of future will not have any feelings, sympathy, remorse or even pity to the losers, since HBD and social darwinism will be the norm, and

&gt;Now brains are more important. Biological determinism is real in our competitive post-2008 economy. IQ is becoming a sorting mechanism for who succeeds or fails.

&gt;This means that the successful and society should not divert too much attention to them (losers), but instead focus on the winners. Maybe this is unfair or mean, but its economic and biological reality that some will be better than others, that some will have more than others, and those who have the biological potential to succeed should have priority over those who dont.

It may not be fair, and it may not be 'just', but it is what it is and those who can adapt to it should do it.

The British Raj and local Indian elites had no mercy, remorse or feelings when lower-caste Bengali dropped dead on their environs back in 1943, and the Gurkhas guarding grain storehouses did not stop from bayonetting the walking skeletons.

Such will be the future when about 1-2% of the 'more able' will live in unbelievable luxury, abundance and stability, while the rest will live like animals into extinction.

Again, I curse Chuck Fitzclarence, whose f'k up at Gheluvalt at Oct 28, 1914, prolonged the Great War by 4 years, killed 9 million of humanity's best, and armed too many millions of lower class and colonials whose demands had to be listened by governments after the war , and caused untold amounts of resources to be wasted over the century (1914-2016) to try to lift them up.

1. Already, Postmodern thinkers and artists speak about the isolation and alienation the individual feels in fast technologically changing world. If we add robots to this thought then isolation and alienation would be the norm to live in a society.

2. Dehumanisation. If you think about, robots would take all the dangerous menial jobs that would be dangerous for humans. We give these dangerous job because they are not human and therefore they do not feel pain. Possibly, we might loss our empathy and compassion towards other beings. We already see this with animal cruelty and a disgust for homeless people. The pointing out of difference is an extremely dangerous tool for a justification for violence.

3. Abuse and lack of respect. This point links to the previous point. Not sure if you a hectic YouTuber, but if you are then you probably have come across the sex robot. The sales people say it would reduce STD among the population BUT they forget the social implication. Again, difference, if the robot is not human then I dont need to treat it like a human. But, people will be socialised to think that disrespecting others will be fine. Domestic violence will skyrocket. Most of the prototype robots are female, which is not good. If they create female robots to become docile and subservient then human women are in trouble in social relationships.

4. On a less serious note, robots could take over the world and kill off the human race.

As for drones:

1. Drones offer scary new surveillance capabilities. People are pretty much a fixed size. You cant make a manned aircraft smaller than the person manning it. Drones, however, can be tiny. Super tiny. The size of bugs, in fact. When it comes to surveillance (and potentially assassinations), this makes drones much more of a threat than manned aircraft. You wont miss the chopper hovering outside your window; you will miss the fly on the wall.


2. Drone warfare is bad for the drone pilots. Dropping bombs by remote control allows drone operators to be thousands of miles removed from their targets. Its inherently uncertain and minimizes the very real psychological cost of hitting the kill button. Said one former drone operator, We always wonder if we killed the right people, if we endangered the wrong people, if we destroyed an innocent civilians life all because of a bad image or angle. When the American military is already suffering from a tragic suicide epidemic, adding the psychological strain of drone warfare can only make matters worse.

3. Speaking of the victims, the ratio of civilians to terrorists killed may be as high as 50:1. In Pakistan, a major target for US drone strikes, as few as 2% of those who die by our drone strikes are high-level terror suspects. As for the other 98%, its difficult to determine whos a civilian and who isnt. Thats because the Obama Administration classifies every male from 18 to 60 who is killed as a terrorist, regardless of evidence. This guilty until proven innocent rule gives the President free reignall while pretending that every kill is a success. Many of these men are simply poor farmers in the wrong place at the wrong time. Some estimates put the civilian to terrorist kill ratio as high as 50:1!

4. Drones first victim is the Golden Rule. The high rate of civilian casualties contradicts the drones are super precise narrative we often hear. Conor Friedersdorf poses this thought experiment about drones, ""''Were often told how precise drone strikes are. Obama Administration officials have called them surgical. If a surgery were happening in the building next door I wouldnt be worried about getting nicked by the scalpel. Would you be worried for your safety if you were 100 yards away from drone strike? Say youre lying in bed one night, and in the house next door, a terrorist is lying in his bed.

Would you want a drone strike to take him out?

If next door is too close for comfort, do you think the U.S. military or the CIA should be allowed to carry out drone strikes on terrorists with innocent people next door?''"".

5. Many drone strikes kill women and children. The 50:1 statistic is awfulbut it gets worse. Even putting aside the dubious classification of many male victims, US drone strikes also kill a high percentage of women and children. Our government has even deliberately targeted wedding celebrations, and it has also hit weddings by mistake. And the most horrifying part? Theres a technique called double-tap droning, which is where the drone bombs a target, waits a few minutes, and then circles back to kill the first responders as they rush to help the victims.

6. Drones are creating a culture of fear and hatred. We live in fear day and night, said a Yemeni man whose area has suffered drone strikes. Our children and women cannot sleep. Their fear is more than justified: In 2013 the Pentagon actually got rid of its ban on civilian casualties. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani girl who survived an al-Qaida attack for her pro-education activism, says of drone strikes: It is true that when theres a drone attack the terrorists are killedBut 500 and 5,000 more people rise against it and more terrorism occurs.

7. In fact, drone strikes make Americans less safe. Unmanned drones can seem like a good way to keep US soldiers safe, but they ultimately put more Americans in danger in the long run. In places like Pakistan and Yemen, Drone strikes are causing more and more [people] to hate America and join radical militants; they are not driven by ideology but rather by a sense of revenge and despair. In other words, when we send drones to kill terrorists, we actually radicalize people who otherwise had no ill will toward our country. Our drone policy is making terrorists out of ordinary people.

Miya Jan is an Afghan man whose family, including his 18-month-old nephew, was killed by US drone strike. He said: There were pieces of my family all over the road. I picked up those pieces from the road and from the truck and wrapped them in a sheet to bury them. Do the American people want to spend their money this way, on drones that kill our women and children?

Surely our answer can only be No!

As for self-driving cars:

NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- There is a very specific reason why self-driving cars will not become successful or acceptable until we completely get rid of the human being behind the wheel. As a result, self-driving cars are further out into the future than currently anticipated.

Those of us who are technology geeks find self-driving cars fascinating. It's almost a goal in itself. Others are simply lazy or bad drivers and just want to be relieved of their duty to drive, just like other people are lazy in general and don't want to work.

Let's start with this premise for the self-driving car future on the horizon: There will be a human being behind the wheel who must be ready to take over on a split-second notice, if the car's computer can't handle the situation.

With this premise in mind, ask why people want a self-driving car in the first place. They say they want to focus on other things, such as doing work or engaging in social media.

We immediately encounter contradiction number one: If you are doing something else (reading or writing or equivalent), then you cannot be adequately prepared to take over the car on a split second's notice. You have no idea of the traffic situation.

One of the things we do when we drive our current cars is we look around constantly. We look in our side mirrors, in the rear-view mirror, we survey the cars, pedestrians, bicyclists and other traffic actors so we can anticipate any sudden and irrational moves by others.

For example, by constantly looking in the mirrors, I know if there's a car approaching from behind in the lane beside me, so I can know whether I can make a sudden maneuver into that lane if a (motor)bike were to suddenly fall in front of me. If I don't know what's approaching me from behind in the lanes to the right and left, I don't know what kind of sudden maneuver I can make to avoid the new emergency surprise. A bad accident could result.

In the self-driving car scenario, the point seems to be that I shouldn't be engaged in any such monitoring activities. I'm supposed to be reading or writing or something of that kind. But then I can't be prepared to take over on a split second's notice!

As for genetically engineering humans:

The main debate around human genetics currently centres on the ethics of genetic testing, and possibilities for genetic discrimination and selective eugenics. But while ethicists and the media constantly re-hash these issues, a small group of scientists and publicists are working towards an even more frightening prospect: the intentional genetic engineering of human beings. Just as Ian Wilmut presented us with the first clone of an adult mammal, Dolly, as a fait accompli, so these scientists aim to set in place the tools of a new techno-eugenics, before the public has ever had a chance to decide whether this is the direction we want to go in. The publicists, meanwhile are trying to convince us that these developments are inevitable. The Campaign Against Human Genetic Engineering, has been set up in response to this threat.

Currently, genetic engineering is only applied to non-reproductive cells (this is known as 'gene therapy') in order to treat diseases in a single patient, rather than in all their descendants. Gene therapy is still very unsuccessful, and we are often told that the prospect of reproductive genetic engineering is remote. In fact, the basic technologies for human genetic engineering (HGE) have been available for some time and at present are being refined and improved in a number of ways. We should not make the same mistake that was made with cloning, and assume that the issue is one for the far future.

In the first instance, the likely justifications of HGE will be medical. One major step towards reproductive genetic engineering is the proposal by US gene therapy pioneer, French Anderson, to begin doing gene therapy on foetuses, to treat certain genetic diseases. Although not directly targeted at reproductive cells, Anderson's proposed technique poses a relatively high risk that genes will be 'inadvertently' altered in the reproductive cells of the foetus, as well as in the blood cells which he wants to fix. Thus, if he is allowed to go ahead, the descendants of the foetus will be genetically engineered in every cell of their body. Another scientist, James Grifo of New York University is transferring cell nuclei from the eggs of older to younger women, using similar techniques to those used in cloning. He aims to overcome certain fertility problems, but the result would be babies with three genetic parents, arguably a form of HGE. In addition to the two normal parents, these babies will have mitochondria (gene-containing subcellular bodies which control energy production in cells) from the younger woman.

Anderson is a declared advocate of HGE for medical purposes, and was a speaker at a symposium last year at UCLA, at which advocates of HGE set out their stall. At the symposium, which was attended by nearly 1,000 people, James Watson, of DNA discovery fame, advocated the use of HGE not merely for medical purposes, but for 'enhancement': 'And the other thing, because no one really has the guts to say it, I mean, if we could make better human beings by knowing how to add genes, why shouldn't we do it?'

In his recent book, Re-Making Eden (1998), Princeton biologist, Lee Silver celebrates the coming future of human 'enhancement', in which the health, appearance, personality, cognitive ability, sensory capacity, and life-span of our children all become artifacts of genetic engineering, literally selected from a catalog. Silver acknowledges that the costs of these technologies will limit their full use to only a small 'elite', so that over time society will segregate into the ""GenRich"" and the ""Naturals"":

""''The GenRich - who account for 10 percent of the American population - all carry synthetic genes... that were created in the laboratory ...All aspects of the economy, the media, the entertainment industry, and the knowledge industry are controlled by members of the GenRich class...Naturals work as low-paid service providers or as labourers, and their children go to public schools... If the accumulation of genetic knowledge and advances in genetic enhancement technology continue ... the GenRich class and the Natural class will become...entirely separate species with no ability to cross-breed, and with as much romantic interest in each other as a current human would have for a chimpanzee.''""

Silver, another speaker at the UCLA symposium, believes that these trends should not and cannot be stopped, because to do so would infringe on liberty.

Most scientists say that what is preventing them from embarking on HGE is the risk that the process will itself generate new mutations, which will be passed on to future generations. Official scientific and ethical bodies tend to rely on this as the basis for forbidding attempts at HGE, rather than any principled opposition to the idea.

In my view, we should not allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security by this argument. Experience with genetically engineered crops, for example, shows that we are unlikely ever to arrive at a situation when we can be sure that the risks are zero. Instead, when scientists are ready to proceed, we will be told that the risks are 'acceptable', compared to the benefits. Meanwhile, there will be people telling us loudly that since they are taking the risks with their children, we have no right to interfere.

One of the flaws in the argument of those who support the possibility of HGE for medical purposes is that there seem to be very few good examples where it is the only solution to the medical problem of genetic disease. The main advantage of HGE is said to be the elimination of disease genes from a family. Yet in nearly all cases, existing technologies of prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing of embryos allow the avoidance of actual disease. There are only a few very rare cases where HGE is the only option.

Furthermore, there is always another solution for those couples who are certain to produce a genetically disabled child and cannot, or do not want to deal with this possibility. They can choose not to have children, to adopt a child, or to use donor eggs or sperm. Parenthood is not the only way to create fulfilment through close, intimate and long lasting relationships with children. The question we have to ask is whether we should develop the technology for HGE, in order to satisfy a very small number of people.

Although the arguments for the first uses of HGE will be medical, in fact the main market for the technology will be 'enhancement'. Once it was available, how would it be possible to ensure that HGE was used for purely medical purposes? The same problem applies to prenatal genetic screening and to somatic gene therapy, and not only are there no accepted criteria for deciding what constitutes a medical condition, but in a free market society there seems to be no convincing mechanism for arriving at such decision. The best answer that conventional medical ethics seems to have is to `leave it up to the parents', ie. to market forces.

Existing trends leave little doubt about what to expect. Sophisticated medical technology and medical personnel are already employed in increasingly fashionable cosmetic surgery. Another example is the use of genetically engineered human growth hormone (HGH), developed to remedy the medical condition of growth hormone deficiency. Because of aggressive marketing by its manufacturers, HGH is routinely prescribed in the USA to normal short children with no hormone deficiency. If these pressures already exist, how much stronger will they be for a technology with as great a power to manipulate human life as HGE?

Germ line manipulation opens up, for the first time in human history, the possibility of consciously designing human beings, in a myriad of different ways. I am not generally happy about using the concept of playing God, but it is difficult to avoid in this case. The advocates of genetic engineering point out that humans constantly 'play God', in a sense, by interfering with nature. Yet the environmental crisis has forced us to realise that many of the ways we already do this are not wise, destroy the environment and cannot be sustained. Furthermore, HGE is not just a continuation of existing trends. Once we begin to consciously design ourselves, we will have entered a completely new era of human history, in which human subjects, rather than being accepted as they are will become just another kind of object, shaped according to parental whims and market forces.

In essence, the vision of the advocates of HGE is a sanitised version of the old eugenics doctrines, updated for the 1990s. Instead of 'elimination of the unfit', HGE is presented as a tool to end, once and for all, the suffering associated with genetic diseases. And in place of 'improving the race', the 1990s emphasis is on freedom of choice, where 'reproductive rights' become consumer rights to choose the characteristics of your child. No doubt the resulting eugenic society would be a little less brutal than those of earlier this century. On the other hand the capabilities of geneticists are much greater now than they were then. Unrestrained, HGE is perfectly capable of producing Lee Silver's dystopia.

In most cases, the public's function with respect to science is to consume its products, or to pay to clean up the mess. But with HGE, there is still time to prevent it, before it becomes reality. We need an international ban on HGE and cloning. There is a good chance this can be achieved, since both are already illegal in many countries. Of course it may be impossible to prevent a scientist, somewhere, from attempting to clone or genetically engineer humans. But there is a great difference between a society which would jail such a scientist and one which would permit HGE to become widespread and respectable. If we fail to act now, we will only have ourselves to blame.

As for AI (and AI-related robots):

I, for one, do not welcome our new robot overlords.

Let me elaborate.

Writing about Artificial Intelligence is a challenge. By and large, there are two directions to take when discussing the subject: focus on the truly remarkable achievements of the technology or dwell on the dangers of what could happen if machines reach a level of Sentient AI, in which self-aware machines reach human level intelligence).

This dichotomy irritates me. I dont want to have to choose sides. As a technologist, I embrace the positive aspects of AI, when it helps advance medical or other technologies. As an individual, I reserve the right to be scared poop-less that by 2023 we might achieve AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) or Strong AI  machines that can successfully perform any intellectual task a person can.

Not to shock you with my mad math skills, but 2023 is 10 years away. Forget that robots are stealing our jobs, will be taking care of us when were older, asking us to turn and cough in the medical arena.

In all of my research, I cannot find a definitive answer to the following question: How we can ensure humans will be able to control AI once it achieves human-level intelligence?

So, yes, I have control issues. I would prefer humans maintain autonomy over technologies that could achieve sentience, largely because I dont see why machines would need to keep us around in the long run.

Its not that robots are evil (to most people's point of view), per se. (Although Ken Jennings, Jeopardy champion who lost to IBMs Watson might feel differently.) Its more that machines and robots are currently, and for the moment, predominantly, programmed by humans who always experience biases.

In a report published by Human Rights Watch and Harvard Law Schools International Human Rights Clinic, [""Losing Humanity, The Case Against Killer Robots""](http://www.hrw.org/reports/2012/11/19/losing-humanity-0), the authors write: In its Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap FY2011-2036, the U.S. Department of Defense wrote that it envisions unmanned systems seamlessly operating with manned systems while gradually reducing the degree of human control and decision making required for the unmanned portion of the force structure.

The ""unmanned systems"" refer to fully autonomous weapons that can select and engage targets without human intervention.

Who is deciding when a target should be engaged? Come to think of it, whos deciding who is a target? Do we really want to surrender control for weaponized AI to machines, in the wake of situations like the cultural morass of the Trayvon Martin shooting? How would Floridas Stand Your Ground Law operate if controlled by weaponized AI-police enforcement hooked into a citys smart grid?

Short answer: choose Disneyland.

I am a Master's student in the U.K. and for one of my courses we are looking into the supply chain management/operations side of the expected 4th industrial revolution. Since I am not exactly knowledgeable on the topic, I would like to learn more and I figured where else to ask than in r/futurology.

Basically, I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction where to read more about the core challenges/opportunities that the 4th Industrial revolution (automation, additive manufacturing, big data analytics, internet of things etc.) will have on certain industries. Especially industries that are expected to be completely disrupted by these technologies!

Thanks a ton :-)

Assuming that automation displaces a large number of workers in the coming years from employment, or at least traditional 40 hour/week employment, what can we do on a community-by-community basis to alleviate or prevent certain effects of this change in our local economies? 

I believe that one important thing we need to do is to prevent, as much as is possible, economic leakage, where resources and money leave a community when it should be kept in. Sourcing more local food in stores, instead of importing it, is one example. Other materials and services could potentially be substituted for food in this example.

Worker cooperatives could simultaneously do something to prevent economic leakage, and also help to ensure that when a business becomes more automated, it's owned by a number of workers, not a single owner.

Non-market economies could play an important role. Ideas like time-banking haven't really taken off in big way yet, but are becoming increasingly popular.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-11/tesla-s-valuation-called-inexplicable-by-top-u-s-auto-dealer

Isn't there a reason why demand for Tesla's vehicles is so great that they don't have the current capacity to make them fast enough, yet demand for GM and Ford's gas guzzling cars and trucks is so weak (comparably) that they have to furlough their workers and idle their plants every year?  Doesn't the 1st quote above offer a clue?  

It is already so much cheaper to drive EVs (once the vehicle is driven off the lot) that there is a very strong case for increased demand in the future.   Why don't traditional automakers heavily advertise this fact to consumers?  Why are they still creating ads hawking more expensive to drive gas guzzlers?

While I agree with most of them and I really like the solutions he has given concerning most of the problems that we are facing today in capitalist  society there are few then stood out to me.

Firstly, he thinks that if society wants to achieve goods that are not  basic need ones, then they have to work harder in order to earn them. However in a state where we have automated economy, i.e in 20-30 years from now when the general AI/something close to that was invented and the jobs that didn't become automated are on the verge of becoming then, how would be that possible?


He also mentions that capitalism produces luxury high end goods and it encourages people to work more in order to afford them. I agree with that, however in long term I would argue if we would have any means of doing that. Maybe I understood him incorrectly and he thinks luxury goods of such goods as we are not really focusing right now like art, music, culture.


Or maybe Im misunderstanding him in general and what he described as 'good' healthy capitalism would not be viable for the automation/AI based society in the future? And those things are applicable on towards todays society and economy in short term?",0,3,False,self,,,,,

Basically, the idea is that because you're accelerating downhill halfway, you only need a little bit of extra energy to make it all the way to the other end, so it's very efficient and fast on a per-use basis.

However, the up-front cost of building such a tunnel - even a very shallow one that only dips a little bit into the mantle - would be monstrous, especially for the first generations of the technology.  The economic risk of the first project would be so huge that it would seem unlikely ever to occur, let alone produce multiple systems that would have a chance to recoup the fixed costs.

But there is one thing that might - ironically - serve to fund pilot projects at some point in the future: Communications.  Quite simply, a fiber optic cable in a perfectly straight line is a little bit faster than one traveling a curved path over the Earth's surface.  There are already highly profitable business reasons to squeeze *every...last...millisecond* out of a communications system, and as time goes on, the value of these seemingly miniscule advantages keeps increasing.

One obvious application is stock trading.  If a business has a massively automated trading algorithm, *any* time advantage - no matter how small - can increase their returns substantially.  This is considered dirty pool by the exchanges, but it's technically not insider trading, so all the big institutions already do it.  For instance, it's strongly suspected that Goldman Sachs owes its dominant position to having gotten in the signal-racing game early, and there was a scandal when some of their signal gaming was exposed, but it's still not illegal.  

As long as they aren't interfering with other traders' signals, it's just sleazy and adds to market noise rather than being outright corrupt.  So unless that changes - and possibly even if it does - there would be a substantial economic incentive to physically shorter signal pathways.  It doesn't even have to be fiber, since the speed of fiber signals is significantly slower than light: If the tunnel were built straight enough, and with the ability to adjust itself to stay straight despite movements around it, you could shine lasers through it.

And *that* in turn means the tunnel doesn't even have to be significantly sized - it could have the diameter of household pipe or even a straw.  You don't need much bandwidth at all, because you're only sending very simple pieces of information. 

Other possible users of such a system would be militaries, whose increasingly automated defense and weapons systems would seek out ever smaller time advantages in detection and response, since the slightest edge might allow a blinding electronic first strike.

So that's where it could start: Straight-line lightspeed communications that allow for faster signals than the longer pathways of a satellite or a great-circle fiber optic network.  The returns on such projects could be quite lucrative and ongoing, and from there you would see larger-diameter chords for more bandwidth, and also competition for deeper chords because they would arrive more quickly than systems of several chords needed to travel longer distances.

The ultimate science fiction idea is the ""core tube"" that goes straight through the center between antipodes, but let's assume that's probably never going to be worthwhile if you could just have a few mantle chords instead of building to the absurd tolerances needed to go through the core.

So that's an interesting possible economic pathway to chord tunnels over the next couple of centuries or so: Faster communications to drive sleazy stock manipulation and military brinkmanship.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

than the years 1918 - 2016, when a lot of resources were wasted to lift up 2-3 billion humans (the number of people using smartphones now) into the modern age.


The expulsion of the Natives in the new world, and the colonization of non-West, were justifiable since they secured the resources needed to fuel civilization at a very low cost, without having to share it with the natives.

However, before the non-civilized people could be excluded altogether from civilization once for all, the unnecessary prolonging of the Great War by a few 'heroes' (who should be branded as 'criminals against Civilization' later) necessitated sharing the wealth with the colonials, who turned into Third Worlders, which has been the source of all problems the world faces now.

And, man, they did consume a lot. The world is running out of phosphates, because we have to feed 7.5 billion.

However, despite of all the consumption, progress is made by a handful of the world's pop, mostly in the advanced world. And, whether they like it or not, most of the people researching the tech to lift humanity up are white, with some smattering of Japanese, Chinese, (mostly higher-caste) Indian and Middle Easterners (the later two groups technically Caucasians in most cases) thrown in. Chinese contributions are limited to people coming from a few coastal provinces, and India from mostly a few Brahmin castes, so they are easier to identify. And these countries have a much colder view on non-elites than many Western countries do.

Technofeudalism, in which all of the world's properties are owned by the few, and the rest having reverted into serfdom (if they have some use) or ended up like the folks in the 4th chapter of Marshall Brain's Manna

http://marshallbrain.com/manna4.htm

and are no more relevant than the lepers of Father Damien's colony,

simplifies the problem by giving different rights to the owners, who are naturally the winners of the tech civilization, and the non-owners (with degrees of rights for the 'serfs' and the 'lepers').

http://greyenlightenment.com/the-earnership-society/
&gt;post-scarcity society where everything is provided but no one (except for the elite and a handful of others) owns anythingeverything is on loan (some have likened it to neofeudalism).

Technofeudalism ends consumption for the masses not likely to advance civ, and concentrates the world's dwindling resources to where it would matter the most, and those who would create the greatest economic value.

There will be no community, no social support net, no nothing and everything will be to the individual. Injured on the job? too bad, you were not careful. Hit by a train? too bad. ""Too bad"" is the mantra of the more advanced people, who will not have any moments to waste to those who are not as advanced as theirs.

In an automated future, the need to treat humans as humans has disappeared. I predict human experiments will be legalized again if collapse does not occur before. Like the Japanese civilians in 1945 who were all expect to die for the Emperor, the losers of tech civ will be expected to sacrifice themselves for the betterment of humans and genetic engineering.

We are at a crossroad to reach the space, and conquer a lot of new worlds. However, current democracy and other economic systems are ill-suited to handle the challenges, and a massive readjustment of human rights, economic rights and other rights is necessary to enable the journey to the next step of human existence (although it will be transhumans and no longer what we can call homo sapiense sapiens).

--

Technofeudalism enables:

No compensation for industrial disasters
No compensation for human/animal experiment gone bad
No compensation or prosecution for any economic activity gone bad

http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/26/e-bikes-are-becoming-a-hit-with-consumers/

""A 2016 report from Navigant Research suggested that by 2025, e-bike sales could lead to annual revenues of $24.3 billion globally.""

There is also an interesting link that discusses the efficiency of ebikes:  

https://www.electricbike.com/watt-hours/

""An average electric bike consumes between 20 and 30 Watt-hours per mile at 20 mph.  If you have a 500 Watt-hour battery, then you would get an estimated range between 17 and 25 miles per charge. ""  (thanks to matt2001 for reminding me how efficient ebikes were in relation to EVs)

Therefore, at a relatively expensive 13 cents per kWh (retail), it would only cost ebikers 6.5 cents to travel 17 - 25 miles, correct? 

My questions are:  wouldn't it make sense for a large company with lots of resources such as Tesla to manufacture and sell electric bicycles?   What would the demand for Tesla's ebikes be in China or India?  Also, if Tesla did sell them, would global demand for ebikes increase, decrease or stay the same in the future?  ",5,0,False,self,,,,,

Increased automation is the fruit harvested over generations of human labor and ingenuity, and a natural blessing of technological progress. UBI, and a fiat financial capitalist economy altogether, are unnatural constructs and artificial institutions that we have created to facilitate markets and allocate resources (albeit inefficiently). The issue lies in the fact that Modern Monetary Theory, Keynesian economics, the infinite growth paradigm and profit maximization have warped the very definition of **economy**, or specifically *economization*.

""Waste not, want not"" is the wholly ignored golden rule of socioeconomics. The definition of 'economize' is as follows: To practice economy, as by **avoiding waste** or **reducing expenditures**.

Think about this for a minute in the context how our world leaders and academia currently define economic success... GDP, inflation, spending, production. It is entirely backwards. Economization is the *reduction of expenditures* and *elimination of waste*, yet we're only happy with our economic data when we create jobs that waste people's time, waste money and resources creating wasteful products that people don't need, waste talent and attention on problems we're created for ourselves, print more money to be wasted on solutions that don't' solve the root problem in the first place, and leave piles of waste to ruin our environment and climate. We call this **economic growth**. GDP is a measure of our collective waste, not created value, and if we're still spending money to solve a problem, **we haven't solved it**. A valuable example is the [Planned Obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) phenomenon whereas a light bulb manufacturer creates a light bulb that last forever, effectively putting itself out of business for lack of repeat customers. Businesses are incentivized to create less efficient products to generate sustained profits, and in the infinite growth paradigm, if you aren't growing, you're dying. This is the very antithesis of economy, and when large stakeholders in industries or countries are in dire straits due to the contradictory nature of our economic system, we bail it out in one way or another. Waste, creating waste, forcing a solution that creates more waste in the future.

This is the basic essence of UBI: nothing changes on a wholesale level. The planet is still bound to the perils of artificial monetary policy, the hidden tax of inflation, money suppliers maintaining control of the economy and greater concentration of wealth &amp; power. Sure we may be able to stem inflation by paying for UBI with overhauling the tax code, health care, social security and welfare, though in the end the public is left dependent on a monthly allowance that no matter how hard we try, in relation to costs *will never be enough to live comfortably*. We'll always argue for a higher allowance, and the fiat currency provided will always inflate prices higher, and the struggle continues into a dystopian society locked in a fiat economical wasteland under a small group of corporate oligarchs.

In true economic theory, a business should strive to put itself out of business, or to improve upon providing your goods or services so efficiently over time that you no longer need to. The time given back to us through automation accomplishing tasks humans otherwise would have been forced to do manually is a economical blessing, and an indication that we're approaching a post-scarcity society.

UBI is a dangerous philosophical roadblock that prevents society from progressing the thought paradigm beyond asking if income, or money itself is even necessary. If the majority of public necessities are met through automation, the economy should be redesigned as a resource based system rather than supply side fiat financial capitalism where society is still bound to the limits of what they can buy with their artificial income. Post-scarcity economics shatters the paradigm altogether, on a political, business, and individual level, where we require a whole new way of organizing ourselves to peacefully transition through the automation age. UBI is not the answer, only a continuation of the same old problem we currently face.",59,8,False,self,,,,,

In the end, human needs are infinite, so there should be infinite possible jobs/work. However I dont think that will be that easy for these reasons:

**1) we wont be able to satisfy our new needs because of insufficient technology**

when our needs become satisfied we always develop new needs, so the displaced workers should work at fulfilling the new needs. However these new needs might be impossible to satisfy due to insufficient technology (a realistic VR would be a good eksample today).

Judging by history this will be a minor problem because while there most definitely are impossible-to-currently-satisfy needs, our needs are also created by companies` marketing departments for useless things - things which do already eksist though. 

**2) we wont be able to satisfy our new needs because of finite resources**

to say there are finite resources is not really accurate because we can utilize the resources better with scientific progress. However in short term we can treat environmental resources as fiksed. This means we can only build so much shit. If this shit is built by robots humans will be out of their jobs. In the end, the magnitude of this problem will depend on the ratio between the progress of automatization and progress in technologies that help us harvest our environment better (like recyclation, renewable energy, asteroid mining...). 

Simply put, automatization skyrockets the productivity. *Economic output = workers  their productivity*. If we want to at least maintain the number of workers while their productivity goes up the economic output must go up as well. For that we need resources. Another possibility is that economy will ekspand in the non-materialistic areas like media, SW and services which brings me to the final point

**3) the jobse left will be either social or high-end**

robots first take over the jobs which are easy to describe and structure (create algorithms for). With the rare eksceptions of accountants or some investments analytics these are mostly low-iq jobs. Thus in the future the jobs open for people will be mostly 

a) higher iq which we cant automatize (yet)

b) social, where the human contact itself is the added value

In the past the point a) wasnt a problem because people moved from one low-iq job (agriculture) to another (factory); hell, the industrial era factory jobs where workers literally did one thing all day were probably even lower iq-heavy than their previous jobs. That is not the case now. Workers for future jobs will need to be smart and by smart i dont necessarily mean educated. You can raise peoples education to some point but you cant raise their intelligence. 

So the lower-iq people will probably need to work in social jobs like caregiving, which with heavily aging first-world population seems like a win-win solution to a double problem. The question is if men will be content with such jobs or even willing to do them. Even if they simply have to coz of lack of other choices, i have trouble believing they would be content in such case and its nothing new that masses of discontent men = problems for society. We can already see that now (Trump) and more ""fun"" will come in near future when all the truck drivers and deliverers are displaced by self-driving cars. In other words to maintain societal peace there will still have to be some blue-collar jobs but its hard to imagine why there should be as almost all ""blue"" work will be, well, automated.

Let us suppose that we now have the tools to bring dogs - or any higher animal - to full sentience, the ability to speak, use tools, and become equals to humans and join our society, even going to college. David Brin supposes a similar action with dolphins and chimps in ""Sundiver"", as a general good and a galactic norm.

But intelligence brings its own baggage. Simpler animals have fewer worries. Arguably dogs have today a ""dog's life"", of relative safety and ease. Making them smarter would likely also install worry, intellectual stresses, etc.

So, was it ethical to bring dogs out of the Wild to their present state? Would it be ethical to go the next step? Are we ethically mandated to uplift other species such as dogs, dolphins, and chimps? Or is uplifting fundamentally evil? Or something in between?

As a secondary question, we might also retain the drive for dogs to want to be our servants, essentially genetically engineering the perfect slave.  If we breed slaves to _like_ being slaves, what is the ethical situation?

(Maltreatment is a separate question, as that occurs already to animals of all types.)",10,0,False,self,,,,,

There were so many little coughing babies a dog bit victim (just a flesh wound) and a lot of non-critical ""sickies.""  

For the ER visits that don't require x-rays or EEGs or CAT scans why can't there just be a Doctor/Nurse team that drives around in a nicely equipped van taking vitals and providing meds in an expedited manner?


Edit:

Hi!  I've learned quite a bit here today!  Despite the overwhelming evidence that the way things are presently done is super unsatisfactory and the fact that algorithms are *revolutionizing* complicated systems in every industry, it's apparently extremely controversial to suggest a way that algorithms could help revolutionize emergency health services.  

So, when we complain about ""how things are"" who do we have to blame and complain to?  

I suppose the people who would argue that suggestions for improvement are somehow pigheaded.

1819,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017-4-17,2017,4,17,10,65stnc,self.Futurology,Idea for massive job losses due to automation: UBI (largely funded by a carbon tax) with incentive bonus payments for socially constructive activity and personal advancement (i.e. behavioral economics).,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/65stnc/idea_for_massive_job_losses_due_to_automation_ubi/,AtomGalaxy,1492393860,"So here's my speculative solution to the coming job-pocalyse. Please let me know what you think. 
Every poor citizen gets UBI at an amount that keeps them from starving or homeless in very minimal public housing or with a housing voucher to rent an apartment. The UBI would be funded with a carbon tax, so right away by having a low-carbon lifestyle (i.e. public transit and minimal red meat, you can live okay on just the UBI). 
Already this is likely a net savings over the status quo since a person on the street or in jail costs society many times more than UBI. 
If you don't get in trouble with the law, if your kids have good attendance in school and get good grades, you earn an annual bonus. If you seek to better yourself by proven achievement in free training programs for valued skills, you get a bonus. If you are meeting doctor-prescribed health goals (thus saving society in universal healthcare costs), you get a bonus parceled out by your FitBit like device every time you exercise. Need $20 to buy beer for a party Friday night? Better go for a run. Maybe your ""job"" becomes coaching little league or painting over graffiti. 
If you're caring for an elderly relative, you get a bonus. If you want to earn extra income, you can do online tests and an AI will evaluate your talents and match you to tasks that need doing in your community. Perhaps you wear a monitoring device that gives you $0.10 for every piece of trash you pick up. 
On the higher end of human capability, the same AI would take a problem like curing cancer or improving a software program and break it up into 1,000 different incremental tasks that each pay $1,000 each. This puts plenty of smart unemployed graduate students to work. 
In this way, we will have more people contributing. Less people in jail or on the streets costing a fortune. Everything is voluntary. If you don't want the UBI, you are free to get a job and work in the capitalist economy that now has the incentive to pay you more than minimum wage since you're not a wage-slave and have choice. If you don't like the Big Brother aspects of the socially supportive incentive payments, don't participate. Take the UBI, go live on a low-cost commune away from the cities, grow your own food, and perhaps earn extra money through an online job maybe tutoring kids over the Internet. The point is that everyone is given the freedom to find their purpose and optimize their talents rather than the ""freedom"" to be exploited by race-to-the-bottom capitalism. What do you think?

Every election is pretty divided between urban and rural. Here are [two maps of the results](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C0O5RW9VQAAT1ko.jpg). One represents the majority of the population, the other represents the majority of the land. I see this problem getting worse as time moves on. 

Communities that rely on a single industry are falling apart. Cities that act as talent pools with a diverse mix of industries are spilling out into suburbs that often dwarf red state populations. New mom &amp; pop industries often organically pop up to serve these growing populations.

There is a possibility that automation and off grid technology could disrupt this trend. But it's a wild card that could go in any direction. So I really wouldn't count on the population sprawling back out.

The popular vote and electoral college gap will widen further and further. The house will never amend this folly. They're more likely to cut blue states loose.

So I think it's possible that by the end of the century, America will split up into separate parts. Especially if the EU continues to break apart and creates a successful model.",25,20,False,self,,,,,

When everyone 'uses' something and not many people really 'own' anything, eventually the owners will be able to name their rent, denying the use from those they do not think is profitable.

Pareto's principle shows that 80% of profit comes from the 20% of customers, and the rest could be disposed if they stop being profitable.

Article which inspired the above post:

(Interestingly, the Telegraph's science editor wrote that piece)

===

Technofeudalism means the owner of property has a life-or-death power over the tenants.

Since very few property will be owned by the people and the techno-'gods' will own most of the land and buildings, they can name their rent.

House prices falling won't help the propertyless too much. Those who can raise cash will buy the old houses, tear it down and will keep it out of the reach of the houseless.

The property owners (rentiers) have no reason to lower their profits so poorer people could have better housing, and soon the situation will develop in a way where the houseless will envy the tenements of the 19th century, described by people like Jacob Riis in ""How the other half lives"". In the new world it will be like ""how the other 98% lives"".

Birth rate will fall for the 'middle' class, who will have to struggle as best as they can to pay the rent. The rentiers do not care since they can get rent from foreigners, since every foreigner who can afford to 'better' countries will do so.

Not a scientist nor engineer. However I wanted to hear other peoples their thoughts on this.*

This is something that has been running through my mind recently mostly due to the fear rising about the advancements in AI which I do see the risks of. But what if we could build a machine with an AI so advanced it would maybe even surpass humans then that machine would be superior to us in every way. We only made up what constitutes a life form to begin with anyway.

I've been fascinated by space for years but it is a frustrating hobby because we as humans seem to be limited in the exploration of it, instead using machines to do it for us. But if we cut out the middleman and create machines that can build a society of their own, wouldn't that be our greatest achievement and perhaps as far as our species will be able to go?

We always assume that superior life forms would wipe us out or would turn us into slaves but wouldn't that be at the risk of thinking from our own limited perspective? We are not able to comprehend what a superior life force would do at all and if we look at our own species we only become more compassionate the more educated we get.. but that is getting beside the point.

My point is: Machines would be able to travel further, are able to withstand space, have the potential to be much smarter and much more compassionate and peaceful, are likely to be less selfish, are less limited by age, can be self sufficient in power without wasting any resources, don't have downtime like sleep,  would be able to control their own evolution process, and the list can go on and on but you get the drift.

Heck, it would even be possible that an alien life form we discover would be a society of machines once created by an organic life form..

Anyone else ever thought about this all? Just wondering what others think.",10,15,False,self,,,,,

Was just watching an episode of Brain Games where they mentioned that the Earth is moving roughly 67000 miles per hour around the Sun but we don't notice it due to being accustomed to it.

Is that really the reason we don't notice or is it more to do with how small we are in relation the Earth and probably something about gravity? 

If it is remotely true, does that mean that when we eventually colonize Mars and other planets, we will have to adjust to those particular planets' orbital rates and rotation speeds or whatever they're called? Like will we be stumbling around and feeling vertigo and stuff?

http://greyenlightenment.com/the-slow-presidency/

A lot of people who are valuable feared that he would 'rock the boat' and create disruption, but for the sake of Civilization, he appears to be tamed, although it would not make his prole supporters happy.

The thing is, the ""Swamp"" helps technology grow. 

Today's tech giants and the funding systems are all linked to the status quo, and changing that arrangement creates huge disruptions.

Today's social and financial system is more or less perfectly situated to fund the most amount of money to the most promising tech, although it would be better if it is profitable.

Whether the masses like it or not, it is well-situated to separate the less able from resource usage, and concentrate all wealth (i.e. the privilege to use resources) to the people who create the most economic value.

Changing this arrangement for the benefit of some poorer Americans, or punishing the value creators just because they f'k over the hoi polloi, slows down economic growth, and rob the chance to allocate the resource into the future creators' hands.

In a utilitarian way, the ""Swamp"" is more beneficial to civilization than the self-righteous people who want to destroy it.

A rule by corrupt, greedy, ambitious but coveting high tech elite is better than a rule by 'nicer', but non-innovative elites, who will stop being nice when wealth is no longer provided. Ancient China is a perfect example of that, as well as China under Cultural Revolution.

Some people might argue that the Swamp is toxic by itself and hinders civilization. But what is the alternative? Only the Swamp can mobilize trillions of dollars for huge projects.

Reality is cruel. Advancing Civilization is never a 'nice' or 'fun' task; a lot of pains, and a lot of choices, will be necessary and such choices, no matter what way, will tend to be cruel, since that's the reality.

Today's tech is perfectly adapted to the current political, economic and social order, so no matter whether some people like it or not, not disrupting the order will be beneficial to develop technology.

Resistance is futile. There will be no changes to the status quo, at all. The end of history has been reached.

So why not put these on the sides of highways and in the floors of buildings? Does the amount of kinetic input need to be extremely massive or is it the technology too expensive or something? 

I can only imagine companies would love the idea of paying a lot less in their electric bill if their floors could generate power just from people walking. Electric companies could pay way less for gas by utilizing vehicles already in use by collecting their kinetic energy. 

Power companies spending less for gas for electricity would inevitably drive up the price of fueling up at the pump, encouraging people to purchase cars that don't require you to fill up as much or remove you from needing to fill up on gas entirely. All the while still gaining electricity from all that movement we're making. Tack that onto increasing solar and wind capabilities and utilization and then part of the world would be solved. 

In my perfect world at least.

Could anyone point me into why my approach may be flawed or if this is already being used in some way?",15,6,False,self,,,,,

Any trait remains within the evolutionary tree only because it manifests in multiple mutated branches - and then, when some branches die, others carry the trait on. 

The trait we should seek to preserve is human consciousness. The branches we should use to transmit it are whichever ones are humane and practical to create. This means, most obviously, space colonization - diversifying where we live. Less obviously, I think it means cultivating alternative visions of human life - diversifying who we are.

Let's get specific. A vocal and talented minority of our society believes mankind's destiny will be fulfilled only if it continues to maximize its intellect and power, through artificial genetic selection or artificial mechanical intelligence. An overwhelming but passive majority assumes mankind's destiny is plenty fulfilled already, thank you very much, and does not require such novelties.

Both groups should be allowed to test their hypotheses, eventually in separate communities on separate planets. This could yield two utterly distinct humanities incapable even of mutual understanding. It could also yield one humanity and one mass extinction. It could also yield two humanities that prove to be one humanity, not so very different after all. It could also yield two mass extinctions.

The earliest mission I've seen is by an independent somewhat ""tourist based"" company that is saying they will send people in 2024 but I don't know how seriously to take this as the amount of criticism this project has faced. 

The next earliest mission I've seen is by a private company advertising for an earliest launch of 2024, with cargo launch on 2022. However there is already talks of this being potentially pushed back to 2026. 

Then there is NASA which has a policy of sending people to Mars in the 2030's at the earliest.

So it look likes a private company in 2024 is most likely to be the very earliest. 

How likely do you think it is that this timeframe will actually be met? How many years do you think it will be changed by? Do you think there is any chance of it happening sooner, how much by?

What are people doing to train for it? What sort of candidates are likely to actually be picked?",35,34,False,self,,,,,

My expertise on the current machine learning landscape is extremely limited, however I'm aware of a few developments in the last year or two such as [Googles offline voice recognition](https://9to5google.com/2016/03/11/google-accurate-offline-voice-recognition/), [syntaxnet](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html), [TPU chip](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/) and Deepminds approaches to AI like Alpha Go / [A3C](https://deepmind.com/blog/reinforcement-learning-unsupervised-auxiliary-tasks/) etc. What I cannot figure out is when these different developments will lead us to an acceptable conversational AI (text based not necessary using synthesized speech). I used Googles Allo chatbot when it came out last year and while I saw an improvement after a few months there were still many instances where it sent me to third party search results instead of direct answers. This seems to be a problem for most chat bots at the moment including Alexa etc, does it stem from their inability to understand basic concepts / themes and form hierarchical structures of objects / how the world is viewed by people? For example writing book reviews / article summaries for lengthy papers seems to be out of the realm of current AI.

Bonus question, just how much overhead does a voice recognition chatbot for a single conversation use on a TPU chip? [Power usage / Tops/s](https://6lli539m39y3hpkelqsm3c2fg-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Google-TPU-report-Table-2-768x176.png).

Assuming that's mostly true, and jobs are becoming more and more useless with time, and we still seem to create a lot of them, maybe one future scenario(with automation), is that humans will work for a living , their jobs will be mostly useless , but they would be such that they wouldn't be replaced by robots ?

Doing things, creating Wealth and making dreams a reality: that's a wonderful part of Human Consciousness and it's a marvelous manifestation of the aim of the Universe, of his evolution, of the exponential complexity that looks for an awakening of matter... But there's another dimension, the sense of being: the peaceful realisation throught our perception of the Present Moment, of what we are, of what we feel. When you lose the balance between both, a problem appears: if you go to much deeper into yourself, forgetting about the creative part of you, you become a plant and the purpose of your existence, flowing accross of the existant things is stopped in a singular Consciousness; if you go too much outside of you, identifiying yourself only with what you're doing, then you lose the sense of being and the illusion of it can lead you to various mental problems and even horrible events in human history.

This is happening today. We have lost the balance. Our societies are so focused on augmenting GDP no matter the cost that our citizens have became their jobs, their social positions, their obssesions, their adictions... Even we have created the illusion of ""phantom money"", giving birth to a giant mountain of debt on which our insatiable Egos keep the pain of hunger in our minds, even when we have enough for everybody.

But let's be more scientific now. Maybe you know perfectly what I'm talking about: you feel it when you go outside your home, when you get tired of absurd thoughs, when you see your pairs drowning into depression or when you heard how hard life is and how painful a bullshit job is. You can also watch the news: terror, fear, clickbaits, wars, poverty, bizarre politicians etc. The world is changing, that's something we know.

My thesis is next. ""When you focus on GDP growth no matter what, a disturbance occurs and the inner balance of human nature falls apart, giving birth to all the bad things we don't like"". We are on the verge of destruction, and that's a fact: meanwhile we are richer than ever, we keep this wealth under the lonely mountain no matter if our brothers are poor or suffering with no limits. We must do something about it, we must solve this radical inequality arising, because the balance is what gives sense to our social group, to peace, to love between peers.

Look at this chart: http://www.motherjones.com/files/income%20share%20saez.png

If you know about History, you may remember that the most terrible condition of Menkind took place in the first half of the 20th century: we killed each other, we hated each other, we did horrible things in behalf of ""Doing"". It's not a coincidence that this phase was correlated with a huge period of inequality: today we have returned to this state but now we know we can do better.

What can we do?",6,19,False,self,,,,,

""xxxx has been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) paired with multiple transient ischemic attacks (mini-strokes). Would your company be interested in a volunteer test participant for a trial study or for research? Our family would not ask for any compensation and would be willing to sign any waiver necessary.
xxxx is significantly impaired mobily, but he is still working post-retirement as an aeronautical engineer for a leading international aerospace corporation and has a perfect and unhindered mind. His ability to communicate results during a study would be very thorough and intellectually sound.

All in all, to prevent further weight gain from him sitting in a wheelchair, being depressed by being 'locked away' in his own home, and all the other things that this brings, I came up with the grand idea of exosuits.

I think the vastness of the concept of forever isn't humanly comprehensible because we cannot possibly have a point of reference for it. In a future where death is not a guarantee short of the heat death of the universe, do you think people would willingly continue keeping on with life indefinitely?

Some religions do speak in terms of eternities with afterlives, but it allows one to offset the trouble of trying to think in terms of forever. Given enough time, everything has been done. Depending on who you ask, it doesn't even take 80 years for the mind to be fatigued, nonetheless 800 or 8,000.

I feel like in the future, people will adopt a habit of simulating death and rebirth to prevent this sort of fatigue (if the sensation isn't hard coded out of the human mind in the first place) by periodically removing all prior memory of themselves and starting over.",6,2,False,self,,,,,

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-24/the-electric-car-revolution-tesla-began-faces-its-biggest-test

The article argues that only when electric vehicles' sticker price is less than or equal to internal combustion engines, will they sell in significant quantities. However, the author barely even puts it in a footnote that EVs are cheaper to drive than ICEs.

My questions are: Why doesn't this author mention that it is 50%+ cheaper to drive the EV once the car is driven off the lot? If your local gas station offered 50% off the price of a gallon of gasoline, wouldn't the queue be around the block? Why don't all news articles and product reviews of EVs shout this information from the top of their lungs? 50%+ off the cost to drive each mile isn't chump change. Or am I missing something?

 *   Internal combustion engine-- [(x miles per gallon) * (y dollars per gallon)-1]^-1 = z dollars per mile. Plug in electric vehicle-- [(a miles per kWh)^-1 * (b dollars per kWh)] = c dollars per mile. If z &lt; c, then the internal combustion engine is cheaper to drive, if z &gt; c then the electric is cheaper to drive.

They will live like the tenement dwellers of the 19th century in the more advanced countries, and, like primitives in the less advanced countries. Sorry, no more TV, no more smartphones, no more trucks. They will drive oxcarts, which will be their 'luxury' vehicles, and mostly walk.

The 'tenementers' will be housed in places like Paris' Banlieues

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-other-france

with only one point of access for each 'neighborhood', out of the sight of people who do matter. If food is short, the only entrance will be blocked and patrolled by armed drones, and no one will hear about what happened in the neighborhood and it will be 'pacified'.

With all the resources firmly in the hand of the elites, and the rest having virtually nothing, we will avoid the resource-shortage which is likely if things do not change by say 2035.

Democracy, ""Equality"", or 'social welfare' will disappear, mass shooting, renamed 'cleanup' , of protersters will be normal, and the people who do matter will be given rights to shoot anyone not in their rank , like the samurai who could kill any commoner they felt like in Japan which has culled all seed of rebellion and has made a docile race which will quietly go to their deaths rather than protest, if things go rough (like the folks back in 1945).

The people who do matter, the intelligent, the rich, the well connected, etc have no obligation to the world's downtrodden. The latter are destined for extinction by evolution.

Wouldn't it better to have the better genes expand, and the less fit genes culled? We do it to the horses, cows and dogs. 

Eugenics will be the law, and people who try to save a child who will be good for nothing will be punished. Actually that was the case in virtually every civilized country, until a certain corporal with a funny mustache made it not too cool . Thanks to that Austrian, a lot of families are stuck with monstrosities who will not function in the real world, and whose existence will burden the family to prevent having better children. Such insanity will end.

With society pacified, and resources used only for those who can create value, we will probably achieve all goals for the future by say 2050. a few years after Kurzweil's predictions. 

But it is only possible by making sure to deny resources to the world's masses, deny them the abundance, comfort and security normally reserved for people who do matter. Sorry.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

The debate was whether or not we'd reach 10^13 calculations per second in a $1,000 device by 2019

The good news to those of you still hanging around from that thread? He was right. You can reach 10 TeraFLOPS using 2 AMD r9 390 GPUs right now for $800 and still have funds for the rest of your PC.

But the gap between these two predictions is much larger than the gap presented in 2014. This is three orders of magnitude in calculation power per $1,000. Do you think it'll happen? If not, how far do you think we'll manage?

An interesting thing to note is that posters in that thread three years ago seemed to make some guesses, incorrect as we now know they are, about CPUs, when the technology that allowed the prediction to make the deadline was actually in GPU advancement. We still don't run 128 core CPU's for example. ",31,26,False,self,,,,,

I guess what I'm asking is, can we have a choice in the matter? Or will this be forced on us? What do you think?

**EDIT**: I just wanted to add a couple things. First, even though I only have three responses, I wanted to say that this has so far been the friendliest sub I've been on for someone with an opposing viewpoint. I think you all so much for hearing me out and taking the time to explain it to me.

Second, I am not against technological advancement at all. But I get nervous when I can't drive myself. Heck, unless it's my mom or dad, I get nervous with HUMANS driving that aren't me, let alone a computer. That's where I'm coming from.
