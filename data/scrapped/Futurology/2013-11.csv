0,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013-11-1,2013,11,1,9,1pnlti,self.Futurology,Some back-of-the-envelope calculations for terraforming Mars using existing technology that has been scaled up.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1pnlti/some_backoftheenvelope_calculations_for/,virnovus,1383264916,"While sitting around waiting for trick-or-treaters, I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations for what it would take to terraform Mars, using mostly technology that we already have, but scaled up.

* The atmosphere of Mars is 25 teratonnes.
* The atmosphere of earth is 5000 teratonnes.
* A teratonne is 10^15 kilograms.
* The atmosphere of Titan is 1.19 times the mass, and 1.45 times the pressure of Earth's atmosphere.  So total atmospheric mass roughly correlates to surface atmospheric pressure at a 1:1 ratio.  (This is surprising, but convenient.)
* Kuiper belt objects' composition varies widely, but most are comprised of a combination of methane, frozen ammonia, frozen nitrogen, frozen water, frozen CO2, and silicates.
* Assuming 1/3 H2O, 1/3 other volatiles (methane, CO2, nitrogen, ammonia), and 1/3 silicates.
* Mass of the object would need to be **roughly** 15000 teratonnes, or 1.5x10^19 kilograms.
* [A comet may hit Mars next year](http://www.geekosystem.com/comet-to-maybe-hit-mars-2014/), but it would be too small to significantly change the atmosphere.
* Halley's Comet is 2.2x10^14 kg.
* The object would need to be about 60,000 times the mass of Halley's Comet.
* Pluto's moon Charon, by contrast, is 1.5x10^21 kg, or about 100 times too large.  (Pluto is 10X the mass of Charon)
* The object would need to be approximately 0.1% the mass of Pluto.  (That is, 1/1000 the mass of Pluto.  Many such objects exist in the [Kuiper Belt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_Belt) and [scattered disc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattered_disc)) 
* Pluto has a mass that's 2% that of Mars.
* Mars would be about 50,000 times the mass of this theoretical object, so a collision would have a negligible effect on its orbit.
* The [largest nuclear explosion ever created](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba) produced over 200 petajoules of energy.
* It's a safe assumption that nuclear warheads could be created that are 10X that, or 2 exajoules.  (The Tsar Bomba was far too large to be practical, but it could have been built larger)  That is, 2x10^18 joules.
* 2 exajoules of thermonuclear energy applied to a comet made of ice and volatiles, would impart the majority of its energy to the comet in the form of kinetic energy, by vaporizing the volatiles and ejecting them at a high velocity.
* Assume 50% of the energy imparted to the comet is kinetic, so 1x10^18 joules.
* One thermonuclear bomb 10X the size of the Tzar Bomba would impart 1 joule to our theoretical Kuiper Belt object (KBO) for every 15 kilograms of its mass.
* Kinetic energy = 0.5mv^2
* So each warhead would impart about 0.15 m/s to our theoretical KBO. (Not very much, but enough to use to tweak its trajectory, like the hydrazine rockets on space probes, assuming a large number of bombs planted strategically over the object's surface)
* Assuming that the ejected mass is negligible compared to the mass of the object.  Also, assuming that the majority of the radioactive fallout is ejected.
* There are 1,850 documented cases of [retrograde comets.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_notable_asteroids#Retrograde_and_highly_inclined) (That is, comets and asteroids going around the Sun in the opposite direction as everything else.)
* Deflecting one of these objects would be much easier than deflecting the KBO.  It could then be induced into a collision with the KBO in order to push it into an orbit in which it eventually enters Neptune's gravitational field.
* Neptune frequently disrupts the orbits of KBOs, sending them into the inner solar system.  Our goal would be to ensure that this happens in a controlled manner.

Now for some assumptions:

* Assuming that the gases ejected from the Martian soil and the gases already comprising the Martian atmosphere would be about equal to the amount of volatiles lost to space. Or at least, they'd be similar orders of magnitude.  I have no idea if this is a valid assumption.
* Assuming that there would be enough water in the KBO to create a hydrological cycle.
* Assuming that Earth would be able to react in time to any large objects ejected from Mars.  That is, some sort of asteroid defense system.
* Assuming that Mars would cool after the collision, within 1-10 years, to an environment that could support single-celled anaerobic photosynthetic life.
* Sunlight on Mars is roughly 40% of the intensity of sunlight on Earth, similar to an overcast day.  Assuming that's enough to support photosynthesis.
* Assuming that atmospheric losses occur on the scale of millions of years, and that the atmosphere would stay in place for some time.  See Titan for an example of a body with a small mass and dense atmosphere.

Past that, I'm not really sure.  I guess manufacture enough [carbon tetrafluoride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrafluoride) or [sulfur hexfluoride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_hexafluoride) to create a very strong greenhouse effect.  These gases are nontoxic, and would have negligible effects on organisms.  This would have to be done before Mars became too cold to support life.

Robots are supposed to have human intelligence by 2029. I will finish my engineering degree, probably in software, in 3.5 years. 

How do I plan for an economy that does not exist yet? I have read that jobs are being replaced by automated systems and that new jobs are being created in highly skilled areas, but how will this work? How will we retain full employment if low skill jobs are discontinued and replaced with high skill jobs? Only some people are capable of doing high skill jobs.

I am aware that 2/3 people used to work in agriculture, but those were average people and average people can do information-service jobs. What happens when every single coffee shop, food store, grocery store, and low skill information job is automated? We already have Siri and automatic checkout, so retail and clerical jobs will probably be a thing of the past soon. Theoretically, new jobs will be created when these jobs are destroyed by some new technology, but people can only spend so many years becoming educated and retraining. As technology's exponential improvement speeds up people may be unable to adapt to the ever changing job market fast enough to live normal lives. 

###deflation and quality of life

The one thing that I eagerly anticipate from singularity is falling prices. If education, medicine, and food become cheaper the way that entertainment has become cheaper then it will be possible to live well on a moderate amount of income. 

Do you think information technology will lead to price deflation? The prospect of future massive deflation really takes a lot of worry out of me. I almost feel like I have joined a singularity ""cult"" and I am anticipating the end of days and the beginning of paradise. That's what I get for listening to two Kurzweil lectures I guess ;-) ",6,11,False,self,,,,,

Whether this long and tortuous development could have followed a different, more benign, course is now irrelevant. The development is largely behind us. Perhaps like the mythic apple, which, once bitten, had to be consumed completely, hierarchical society had to complete its own bloody journey before its demonic institutions could be exorcised. Be that as it may, our position in that historic drama differs fundamentally from that of anyone in the past.
We of the twentieth century are literally the heirs of human history, the legatees of man's age-old effort to free himself from drudgery and material insecurity. For the first time in the long succession of centuries, this century and this one alonehas elevated mankind to an entirely new level of technological achievement and to an entirely new vision of the human experience. We of this century have finally opened the prospect of material abundance for all to enjoya sufficiency in the means of life without the need for grinding, day-to-day toil. We have discovered resources, both for man and industry, that were totally unknown a generation ago. We have devised machines that automatically make machines. We have perfected devices that can execute onerous tasks more effectively than the strongest human muscles, that can surpass the industrial skills of the deftest human hands, that can calculate with greater rapidity and precision than the most gifted human minds. Supported by this qualitatively new technology, we can begin to provide food, shelter, garments, and a broad spectrum of luxuries without devouring the precious time of humanity and without dissipating its invaluable reservoir of creative energy in mindless labor.

I'm like ok. I understand the concept right. You load up the source program file and the 3D Printer builds it piece by piece or molecule by molecule however you want to say it. But WHERE do those pieces come from?

I haven't been able to find anything that talks about this.

You can't just create say, a metal vehicle without having the metal say, aluminum, the resources that make the plastics, the fabrics, the other stuff. So where the hell does it come from? Is everyone just going to have canisters of all the common elements stashed underneath their house or something, feeding into the 3D printer?

Nothing has explained this and I find it is a very important thing to be answered.

I'm working with a developer to split it into about 150 lots for individual sale.

I've been toying with the idea of building a permanent installation somewhere on the land. I'd like to provide internet service to all the lots. I'd like to use the most cutting edge technology to really do something cool, so I'm hoping for some ideas from you guys.

Here are a few of the things that have crossed my attention, although I've had pitiably little time to delve into them too much.

* Light-based information networks. Including point-to-point and the very interesting ""Li-Fi"" - how long till this stuff is available?

* Aquaponic system. Low-maintenance year-round production of food. Could waste heat from servers be recaptured to heat fish tanks? Would it get too hot in summer?

* Internet service. From what I gather, I need a fiber line to an upstream provider, and local servers to take care of all the packets. The [success stories](http://www.open-mesh.com/success-stories.html) for Open Mesh products had me pretty convinced, although the logistics might be escaping me.

* As far as construction of the building, I was picturing using the highest point on the property, and building an in-ground facility with a greenhouse roof. It could be 2-stories deep and it could be tended by a [farmbot](http://inhabitat.com/the-farmbot-is-an-open-source-hackable-farming-machine-designed-to-bring-technology-to-agriculture/) with command over a certain chunk of the XYZ-space of the building. I think that a semblance of an ""AI"" could be built using crowdsourcing such as Amazon Turk. IE the farmbot places its scissors and takes a picture, and if the crowd opinion says that it will successfully harvest the tomato with this snip, it executes the snip. Gamify it and now you have the whole world tending your farm for you, for free...

* What are the most efficient ways to harness energy from exercising humans? I could provide a free exercise facility where the energy helps run farm systems. IE their resistance training somehow helps pump the aquaponic system water from low to high so the cycle can continue.

If you have professional/business interests  in any of these areas, feel free to get in touch. I'm very interested in financing experimental tech and I'm looking for good people who can help me get stuff done, because my attention is way too divided at this point for me to give all these ideas the focus they need.",8,14,False,default,,,,,

Politically, what will happen when old age ceases to be a factor in mortality? Over the last few centuries there has been a lot of progress in the areas of human rights and tolerance that we might take for granted as being inevitable, but will those trends really continue?

The reason I ask is this: how much of that change was due to the older generations dying off, and taking their archaic attitudes with them? What if practical immortality leads to an actual stultification of society, where archaic attitudes and prejudices NEVER go away, because the people who hold those positions never go away?

It's easy to see the progress we've made as a species and assume that it's an inexorable march towards tolerance and equality (on a macro scale, at least) but is that only due to relentless churn of mortality? What happens when that churn ceases, and the generational relay race of history becomes a marathon?

This questions cuts on a macro level, in terms of society at large, and a micro level when individuals in key positions just don't DIE (for instance, supreme court justices).",19,8,False,self,,,,,

Suppose someone were to create a website or program in which members were linked and able to easily specify what resources they have available for exchange, which resources they are good at/enjoy creating, as well as a score system for keeping track of who is contributing and who is 'leeching.'

If this system were activated within a few small corporations who decided to sign up as well, how much mutual benefit would be achieved even within the status quo where we operate on a fiat currency centric system.

Take for example, several small companies:

Company A (family owned) operates a farm, growing wheat, creating dairy products, and other edibles.

Company B (say, a small limited company) operates a trucking company. 

Company C (a fairly large corporation, but still not Fortune 500 size) owns a chain of hotels.

Company D (mid size to small limited company) is a small digital agency.

Company E (mid to large company) owns a chain of restaurants.

Within these companies, the benefits achieved by these companies exchanging resources between themselves and their employees is beneficial not just for the lifestyle of the employees of the companies, but also for owners and directors within a current capitalist system.

It is in the interest of a trucking company to be able to have free hotels for their drivers. It is in the interest of a hotel to have free food sources for the meals they serve to their customers. It is in the interest of a digital agency to do some online marketing for a hotel chain in return for all their employees getting free places to stay when they travel. And it is within the interest of a restaurant chain to get free online marketing, free food deliveries, free travel accomodation for employees, all for offering free meals to employees of partner companies.

How many people would it take to get started? Could it work just with a few thousand normal people initially on the service?

What are your thoughts?

What specifics could be implemented to ensure maximum effectiveness of such a system?

AI is grounded in Computer Science.

- I think there are two important revolutions approaching. The first is the reintegration of AI and robotics...

- In terms of hardware, it would be hard to rule out unpredictable breakthroughs as I feel the space for innovation is much larger (innovation which software can then exploit). For example, the (unforeseen) appearance of the Microsoft Kinect has had a huge impact on what robots can sense, and therefore on what they can do.

I especially enjoyed the most recent AMA from Peter Diamandis
http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1onkop/i_am_peter_diamandis_founder_of_xprize/

Everything he and others talk about sounds great, and I hope it all comes true, but there is one truth most (all?) of them ignore IMO.

What will make the wealthy and powerful allow this transition from today's world to tomorrow's world happen?
What is going to make them essentially give up their power to have a healthier and technologically advanced world?

Also being into politics leads me to believe the answer is, nothing will get them to give up their power.

I have thought about this, and discussed it with a wide range of people, and we all kind of agree that nothing short of a tragic, massive global war will change the world to what it can and should be, and it's a damn shame.

I am curious what you all think the transition period will look like, how long it will delay the goals of futurists/technology, and how costly to humanity it will be.

Freeman Dyson

Does God exist? Well, I would say, Not yet. Ray Kurzweil

[What if the evolutionary successor to the biological human species is God? The verification of the God hypothesis thus defined is a progressive endeavor, but it may become increasing obvious. The Singularity may be the point at which God has evolved.](http://www.suicidenote.info/) page 43.

Im quoting the paper,

""A first pitfall in the plan to create God-AI is the belief that an attempt to build God amounts to an attempt to build an infinite being. Human intelligence  including the intelligence of the human authors of the Bible  was and is of finite capacity. This means that the finite intelligence of the human authors of the Bible was able to convince other finite intelligences of the existence of an infinite being. Just as infinite intellectual capacity was not required to produce the Bible and the very conception of God, God-AI would not have to be of infinite capacity. God-AI would have to be of qualitatively greater capacity, but not of infinite capacity, to convince humans of its God-status. 

The real question here is: how superior to biological humans would a postbiological being have to be to begin to qualify as God? From a contemporary scientific, cosmological perspective, the infinite God of the Bible created a universe that is remarkable, not for its infinite vastness, but for its remarkably finite provinciality. A vast, thirteen billion year old universe wherein the Earth is not even the center of its own solar system in a galaxy among countless galaxies almost humiliates the little four corners of a six thousand year old Biblical Earth. This Earth-centered infinity turned out to be remarkably finite. 

The raw contradiction between the pre-Copernican universe of the Bible, and pretensions to divine infinity, illustrates the point that God had to be only relatively superior to humans, not infinitely capable in all respects (even though God was conceived through aspirations toward infinity).""",7,0,False,self,,,,,

We trusted banks to allocate capital to those projects and individuals that were productive and advanced society's goals. Interest was charged on loans to motivate people to keep advancing the system. For over 100 years, it was the game we played and the system we trusted.

However, today, with the efficiency and productivity of technology, it is getting harder and harder for banks to find outlets or individuals to make sound loans. Productive technology is reducing the need for capital and the need for people to create output.  Banks are increasingly resorting to fraudulent and improper behavior to maintain sufficient lending to protect their ""profitability."" 

Since money is merely a tool for people to peacefully claim the things they need from our companies, as technology makes production hyper-efficient and increasingly autonomous, we must question whether it's logical for banks to issue debt for people to obtain the things families need for survival.  Such thinking seems ancient when we can now use technology to directly distribute money to citizens. We can build a new abundant economy where people prosper by rewarding those that advance the goals of a new highly efficient, sustainable, and productive society.

If we move beyond our current thinking and systems, we could pay anyone to go to school. We could pay people for research. We could pay individuals for new innovations and inventions. We could reward those that advance knowledge and the arts. Everyone could compete and collaborate globally.  The potential for success would be unlimited and the opportunities open to all.




When The Systems We Trust No Longer Serve The People,
It's Time For Citizens To Move Beyond The Current Thinking

All of the above systems were based on controlling people to produce output in one way or another.  They were a product of the time and technology.

Simply speaking, an Automationist believes that it is our fundamental duty to automate or try to automate as many human labor functions as possible to promote the freedom and progress of people.  Systems should be optimized to serve people, not people serve systems.

Just like advancing technology in farm implements was a key driver in eliminating the need for agricultural slavery, new technology will be a key driver in eliminating the need for many boring industrial labor jobs.

Is a minimum or low wage job today really that much different than slavery?  With cost of everything from housing, health care, and food skyrocketing, can people/families making minimum wage even afford the basic necessities of life anymore?

Further, if technology can produce stuff for us efficiently, do we need to force humans to perform tasks that can easily be automated?.....and produce much more sustainably with much less pollution or waste.

As part of my personal goal to advance this thought, I created the website Reboot Our Planet and I am beginning to avoid businesses that employ people at minimum/low wage whose jobs can easily be automated....I hope I would have avoided buying crops that used slaves to bring produce to market.  

As a former investment manager, this kind of thinking is new to me, and I am not close to perfect.  But the first step to any destination is knowledge of where you are going.

Automationism is uncomfortable for many.  I truly do understand the resistance.  We have been nurtured how to think and act while the media has reinforced our current beliefs for many years.  But in the same logic, advancing from slavery was not easy either. 

If we move beyond our current systems and apply the advantages of amazing innovations and advancements, this time we can proceed forward peacefully and prosperously. With liberty and justice for ALL.   

Any thoughts and input is appreciated.

The same goes if you are a multimillionaire, you can't probably afford an 80 million dollar mansion if your total assets are 90 million dollars.

For the design, I'm looking at alternatives to rockets but I've come to a bit of a standstill in terms of what I'm visualizing.

Imagine a skyhook-like system combined with launch loop technology.  But in terms of scale and action, it acts similar to [JP's dark sky station](http://www.jpaerospace.com/art.html). It is basically a facility that is shaped similar to a tower, with one end being the launch loop, and the other some method of maintaining its altitude.

A secondary goal for this system is to be able to hover over a city in order to exchange goods and services.


How would it be done? I've considered space shaft like designs, but I'd prefer for it to be a bit more hardy than a giant balloon. I've looked at atmospheric skipping as a method of flinging itself back into space for launches, but I'm wondering if this can be done without a giant mile long wing attached to it.

**TL;DR**

What technology, theoretical or current, allows a space station-like tower to gently come up and down between ultra high atmosphere and maybe a few miles above a city, in order to use ambient forces and energies to act as a bridge to space. A crap-ton smaller than a space elevator, but a crap ton bigger than a space plane. A skyhook system mixed with a launch loop.",15,16,False,self,,,,,

I think this is a false philosophical question. The proper way to replace a body is to retain the consciousness while moving across the air gap gradually, using brain-computer interfaces.

Picture the eyes. Right now, we have two of them. There's nothing to stop us, however, from getting another one; we're already working on them to solve blindness, and studies have shown that our brains intuitively rewire themselves to interpret new stimuli. You could, 10 years from now, conceivably stick a third eye on your forehead. Or your dick. Or that wall over there. Forget the long term; even in the medium term, there's nothing to stop us from having multiple neural inputs, connected only through wireless transmission, except processing power limitations.

We're working on those to, though. On the front page of this subreddit, we have an article about a computer featuring neural connection patterns. Eventually (and understand this might be later than sooner) we'll be able to add raw computing power to our brains, and we're probably going to end up storing that power in a databank somewhere secure. Our bodies could even become little more than flesh avatars, each carrying around enough power to run themselves and coordinate with our other avatars. Right now, we're excited about not having to control our cars, but forty years from now who can say we won't be excited about *being* our cars? I can think of at least one fetish subculture that would get excited over that. 

This brings me back to cloning and whole-body replacement, and you can probably see where the argument is. If your consciousness is spread out over multiple areas of hardware; if you're sitting in a University class in NYU, a hot air balloon over Newark, in your home garden, speeding down a freeway and sitting in a vault in a warehouse on Long Island, is it really going to be that bad if your classroom blows up? Probably not. You'll lose some processing power, a dozen data inputs, maybe a few seconds of short-term memory. Not that bad, in the long run. 

tl;dr You'll have one consciousness shared with your clone. But you could also be [this guy.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Aeryon_Scout_In_Flight.jpg)

And what is really exciting is there seems to be growing awareness of this in the mainstream conversation.
 
The primary constraints to abundance are limited resources and excess pollution.  When overcoming scarcity, people must think about the consequence of consuming too much stuff on the sustainability of our planet. It is the only planet we have at present.  Without a sustainable planet, we are stuck between a rock and empty space.
 
If we advance the functions of life from a board game to a video game, the above limitations are obliterated.  Anything that can be digitized and automated, can be delivered globally with essentially unlimited supply, unlimited distribution, and very little consumption of resources and pollution.  This is becoming more evident as technology gets smaller and more powerful.  

The easiest example of a world advancing beyond scarcity is eMail vs. the traditional Postal Service.  Just the resource savings of not requiring the manufacturing and shipping of paper by millions of people driving globally is material. eMail's accessibility is universal and the speed at which people communicate is unprecedented, and getting faster.  Other easy examples are books, music, movies, and games. 

Increasingly, as algorithms get more sophisticated, and processors become smaller and more powerful, areas like education, finance, law, accounting, and medicine can increasingly be automated and available to everyone. The implications are profound because essentially all traditional economic, political, and legal systems assume scarcity and the need for human labor in their logic and structure.
 
Now that technology is rapidly eliminating scarcity, futurists will have to increasingly think about Rebooting our current systems to accommodate advances in technology. If we futurists unlock thought, we will unlock any limits to a better future.",10,10,False,self,,,,,

If we can transport nuclear waste cheaply by elevator and then fly it to the moon. Then we can dispose nuclear waste without harming the environment.

We trusted bankers to allocate capital to projects and individuals they felt were productive and promoted society's goals.  Interest was charged on loans to generate profits for the bank and to motivate people to continually advance the system.  For over 100 years, it was the game we played and the system we trusted.
 
However, with new, more efficient technology, it is becoming harder for banks to find businesses and individuals to make sound loans to.  Automation and digitization is reducing both the need for financial capital and the need for people to make things.  As a result, banks are increasingly resorting to speculation, fraud, and improper behavior to perpetuate the existing economy and protect their ""profitability,"" while the old basis for creating sound capital crumbles.
 
Since money is just a tool for people to get the goods and services they need from our companies, we must question whether it makes sense to continue our current system of creating money through bank loans.  Such thinking fails when we can now use powerful technology to directly distribute money, and therefore goods, to citizens.   If we change our thinking, a stable, abundant economy can evolve where everyone can prosper and be rewarded for advancing societal and personal goals in a new sustainable and productive world.
 
By moving beyond our current systems, we could pay anyone to go to school. We could pay people to conduct research. We could pay individuals for new innovations and inventions. We could compensate those that advance knowledge and the arts. Everyone could compete and collaborate globally.

It struck me immediately that the idea was so powerful, that no-one would really see all of the ramifications for a very long time.  But one thing I thought was really interesting - he implied that the roads themselves would be independent economic actors.  There was something about that I couldn't put my finger on until just recently.

I remembered [Solar Roadways](http://www.solarroadways.com/intro.shtml).  You see, if the roads are just charging vehicles that drive on them to repair themselves, that's one thing.  But if they are also collecting solar energy to sell to the grid then they become *major economic actors*.  They will have a LOT of money on their hands.  So it seemed to me that one obvious thing they could do would be to expand themselves.  Moving into deserts would be an obvious option, but they could even purchase land and expand that way.  It's key that the ability to collect solar energy gives them the ability to expand into areas where they don't need humans to make money.

It's also key that humans *help*.  So once they've spread to an area, another way to make money is to try to convince humans to live in that area.  So the roads spawn ""mutant"" children.  It pays for fully autonomous vertical farms, it pays for autonomous apartment buildings to be built, it could have fleets of autonomous cars built, perhaps pay for it's own hyperloop.  

Obviously it couldn't do all of these things at once, but once it starts getting humans to live in an area it will have more and more funds with which to work with, until an entire city has bloomed out of largely autonomous economic activity (but supported by human activity).

And I think I've only scratched the surface here, but the question is, have I lost my mind?  Cause if not, the time between the first Autonomous Corporation and most of the global economy being swallowed up by them is going to be surprisingly short.

Today, they are still important in the freight role, hauling freight around the world, and many passenger trains, even in the United States, are still used to travel long distances.

So with recent developments in the field of Ariships, Self Driving Cars, flying cars, the Hyperloop, and airplanes, would trains still have relevance?

Here are some interesting things to consider:

*the Bering Strait Tunnel, a proposed rail tunnel that would link Alaska to Russia, has the potential to be a strategic rail link between the Americas and Asia, meaning that freight, as well as travel between the two continents, could be cheaper (and faster).

*MagLev trains are a more recent development. Some have even suggested that this could be useful beyond earth, such as being used on the Moon to form a strong freight and passenger link between destinations on it.

*Mass Transit projects involving trains are on the rise, as more cities begin planning and building light rail, heavy rail, and metros.

I remember watching a documentary a couple of years ago about AI and a then executive at Google talked about merging the efforts of Google Translate with the automatic transcription of voice mail in google voice. I guess I had a whoa moment as I thought ""There goes job security"". I also see something similar in the glasses that auto translate foreign text that I saw on here not too long ago.

I guess my real question is am I over estimating the impact these translation technologies are going to have on the labor market or can I look forward to more severe competition internationally when this becomes mainstream.

I think is may be common for people to see the US military and think that the money and resources used for it are not looking into the future, and are wasteful. For instance, it's common to see opinions about more money into education, NASA, renewable energy, and what have you. 

I don't disregard these opinions, but I am always troubled about how I really don't see shifting money and resources away from the US Defense realistic. The military is so strongly embedded into US politics, society, and economics (for good or for worse). For example, the Pentagon over the years has spread out military manufacturing business in every state they can, instead of having it in one place, so it reaches out into has many political representatives as possible. 

You an disagree with me, but for the sake of my idea, I'm going to assuming that military defense spending will never decrease substantially. 

*Mark*

If military were to be set up were it obtained it's own resources (that being energy and food), I envision the technological advances, techniques, and tools that were needed for such a set up to be later obtained by the private sector, aiding in a more efficient United States. 

For example, I imagine the NAVY having something like massive algae farms out in the middle of the Pacific, used for creating oil which would be refined into fuel. Even aquacultures and and hydroponics (or both in the same system), along side with cheap desalination using something as cool as graphene. Their ships could be fueled by wind, electricity, and algae-fuel. Their planes would be full electric drones, charged by solar, wind and algae-oil power plants. 

Much like how NASA contributed things like memory foam and satellites to the private sector, these military advances see themselves trickle-down into the private sector. This set up would, in my mind, probably makes us actually see an economic return from all the military spending, while also reducing the US carbon footprint. 

This is just something that has been on my mind. What do you think? ",8,8,False,self,,,,,

The goal is to develop a r/futurology set of predictions about the future based on the massive wealth of knowledge and evidence us internet experts all have. 

The sub has something similar [in the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/wiki/timeline), but that is languishing and unloved. Most of us would know of several others, like [future timeline](http://www.futuretimeline.net/), but these are spotty and dubious at best.

That is because they are *human* predictions. We need superhuman, parahuman, transhuman predictions. A gestalt. The combined knowledge of the r/futurology borganism.

So, this thread is for planning how to approach making a solid timeline if that makes sense?

My suggestion:

1) We create a thread where people can post their favoured technology predictions.

2) We agree on a standard description method. I favour (using random example):

&gt;**Description**: level 4 (fully automated) self driving cars

&gt;**Date first available**: 2015

&gt;**Date widely in use**: 2018 in industry. 2020 for consumers.

&gt;**Expected stumbling blocks**: Legal hurdles, expect earlier uptake in less regulated regions and areas less attached to legacy car companies.

3) We **will reference** predictions where-ever possible. Business plans and direct research links favoured over blogs and futurists where available. Each line in the above example is reference-able.

4) We upvote the good 'uns, and downvote the rubbish.

5) I (or someone else) will collate the top predictions using some arbitrary cut-off depending on the popularity of the idea. Any that clash will be sent to a sudden death cagematch, either a new thread or an online survey.

6) We all agree to make this a global thing, and not just about America. Think big! Of course genetic medicine is getting approved in China before the USA. The [BRICS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) are wealthy, growing, and far less ensnared in cultural inertia. Factor that into the predictions. 

7) This will be controversial, but I think it could get unwieldy. I think we should keep the focus relatively narrow, and focus on just technologies that will significantly disrupt or change the world.

So, that is my thoughts so far. This thread is the critique the plan and method. Leave the predictions for the next thread.",19,100,False,self,,,,,

Most developed countries spend half of their tax revenue on social programs and have effective tax rates of roughly 50%. 

If my math is roughly correct something will have to be cut. Military, schools, or healthcare spending will have to be eliminated to make room for the basic income initiative. In my country of Canada I think we would probably eliminate socialized medicine to free up revenue for the basic income initiative. I think that the cheques themselves would cover most people's medical expenses.

Can we knock Ray Kurzweil off his pedestal with the power of the crowd? Outperform the portfolio predictions of Steve Jurvetson? 

The earlier thread explaining the general process can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1qg6i8/planning_the_rfuturology_prediction_project_aka/)

This needs to be broken down into chunks to prevent unwieldy thread of death problems, so the first step will be to generate a set of technologies we can predict about. 

**THE RULES OF THIS THREAD**
&gt;1. Top level comments are *only* for technologies. All children can be about any refining or arguments/discussion

&gt;2. Check the other top level comments before posting yours. If they are slightly different, that is cool, post it. We will decide afterwards how to combine it all. But don't just repeat everyone else.

&gt;3. Upvote each and every technology you think deserves the Futurology Prediction treatment. 

&gt;4. Downvote any technology you think is inappropriate. Your reasons could include (but are not limited to): the technology is silly or impossible, the technology is pointless, the technology is unlikely to make a difference to the world, the technology already exists and so on.

&gt;5. After an arbitrary amount of time (ie when interest dies down) I or someone else will cull out the major topics and we can all start the prediction thread.

&gt;6. Ideally, most of the technology will be in the near future, so we can actually find out how we did while Reddit still exists (Reddit disappearing would be a good topic actually!). But don't limit yourself to the near future. Anything up to a Singularity is fair game. After a Singularity even, if you want to define a set of things we cannot achieve without superintelligence, but should otherwise be achievable.

&gt;7. Be clear about your definition of the technology. If it has multiple levels or forms, define which one you mean.

As you can see, the rules are really open and non-restrictive. The goal is to get an relatively unbiased look at the community opinion rather than a few expert's ideas on the topics.

So, have at it!

**EDIT**: I should be clear, this thread is *not* for the predictions themselves, just for brainstorming things to predict about. If you have any idea just chuck it in the ring. A number of low hanging fruit remain, although _trendspotter seems to have had a burst of energy!

As an update, I will leave this thread open for at least 24 hours longer, so get upvoting/downvoting to help decide what we should be considering.

**UPDATE 2**

I will start gathering the tech suggestions today (the 15th). Be sure to up and downvote to decide what will go into the prediction thread.

We have a LOT of tech offerings now, I think it will need to be heavily culled just to make the final predicting thread manageable. I doubt many people will be bothered going through a list of a few hundred technologies, and the goal is to get as many people involved as possible.

Anyone who has advice on how many to select from the top of the voting pile, PM me or go to the original planning thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1qg6i8/planning_the_rfuturology_prediction_project_aka/)

**FINAL UPDATE:**

This thread has finished. Head to the final [predictions thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1qqe0m/futurology_prediction_project_insert_predictions/) to get involved with the augeristic prognostications.

I grew up highly interested in science and read many books on theoretical physics and futurism. When I discovered Kurzweil, I found I strongly agreed with his views and have applied them to my life ever since. I thought back on the 90's tech boom and realized that despite catching the world off-guard, it was quite predictable from a futurist approach. I've always wondered why everyone didn't invest in computer companies then since computers were 'obviously' the future, and its because most people don't think like futurists. What that means for my generation is that there is money just sitting on the table for anyone who recognizes the technologies of the future and invests in them. At 20 I was getting money from school so I started investing with this mindset despite having only a cursory knowledge of investing. I wanted to invest in every future tech I could think of, robotics, 3d printing, solar, genetics, ev's, google. After buying a basket of stocks, I lost money immediately and for most of the first year in was a little in the red. Thankfully my successful 3d printing stocks offset most of my losses. I realized I needed to dump the dead weight and invest only in the most relevant technologies of our time. Nanotechnology is going to be HUGE in the future, but is not a very good investment right now. So I held on to mostly 3d printing and solar stocks, with a chaotic and haphazard method that makes me cringe to think back on. I choose companies that I believe understand the ""why"" aspect of their business, seeing the big picture instead of just profits. I plan to hold stocks for years as the growth in their industries is only just the beginning. I only own what I KNOW to be a solid company in high growth industries. Despite my first year being a mild loss, my performance since has been phenomenal! Since January, my total ROI is 220%, I don't even know anyone who has had a similar performance. And I am a novice when it comes to investing and have made many terrible, costly mistakes. My ROI would be much higher had I not made some avoidable mistakes. I try to imagine what a pro investor's performance would be if they adopted my approach or what super stocks someone with a specialized knowledge could find. I encourage anyone who thinks like a futurist to constantly be thinking about what industries are going to be huge in the future and how to make money from that knowledge. I believe that another market boom similar to what happened in the 90's is on the horizon given the emergence of new techs that are about take the world by storm. Someone who thinks like a futurist has a better chance at successfully navigating those waters than a seasoned investor who doesn't. I believe investing should be of greater discussion here at r/futurology.

TLDR; Started invested because of futurism, made 220% in a year. Every futurist should consider doing the same.",21,10,False,self,,,,,

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXQrbxD9_Ng&amp;feature=player_embedded#t=0

The only reason people got paid for ""jobs"" in the industrial economy is because others had the ability to pay with money.  If people didn't have money or buying power, people didn't have jobs regardless of how much stuff the businesses could produce or how many people needed the output.

Although the industrial economy had many shortcomings, it was better and more efficient than anything before it....now automation is transforming industrialization as the latter did to agriculture before it.

Economics is the study of how goods and services are allocated among people.  In an industrial economy we use money created by banks issuing debt out of thin air to control the allocation of goods and services.

With breathing air, nobody thinks about borrowing or paying for it.  Or the fact that it is universally owned by government is Communism or Socialism or any other ISM.

Why?  Because air is abundant, available to all, does not require labor or the consumption of resouces to produce or distribute.  

However, unless we change direction, our unsustainable current industrial system may destroy fresh air as is presently occuring in China and India with rapidly deteriorating air quality.

Going forward, couldn't digitally produced/distributed goods and services take on the same qualities as air in the future economy?  And the more we produce digitally, the less pollution and consumption of resources.

The cost to distribute digital products would be minimal, especially if energy was renewable.  It would not require much, if any, human labor as a single server could produce for everyone globally.  And it would be available and abundant to all for anyone with internet access.

Here is the idea that I proposition; as our lives become more and more intertwined and obviously public, I think it's important to realize that people are going to make choices you don't necessarily agree with. That being said, I think the communal paradigm needs to shift more towards acceptance and understanding. We can see this reflected through large civil movements (the two obvious being the racial equality and gender equality), but that eventually won't be enough.

Life has become so specialized and complex that often we have to simply trust others and our systems.  It is very hard for people who have been nurtured to be specialized thinkers to venture beyond their comfort zone of their immediate systems.

These systems include agricultural,  technological, legal, health,  economic,  political,  religious, educational, and media to name a few.  But failure to consider how the human systems impact the biological and other planetary systems could lead to total systemic failure.

What is amazing for such an important and complex subject as the future, there are very few channels in education or otherwise to have competent socratic discussions about our SYSTEMS and how they impact people and our planet as we advance into the future.

The question people ask is, ""Why money?"" 

Well, it's not ""the root of all evil"" or some other trivial rhetoric that brings me to this point of view. Rather, it's the basic premise of ownership, that things ever really ""belong"" to us, that we need to address. Because let's face it. If it needs to belong to some body, be it a person or a government, then it WILL belong to them. Whoever needs it is at the mercy of whoever owns it. There's no sense in perpetuating a system that already assumes this condition if our aim is to make a society abundant and, ultimately, free. 

For example, say we achieve this automated society where resources are managed through automation, where problems are addressed ""empirically"" rather than ""democratically"" through reasoning and innovation rather than popular vote, and so on. Suppose I go to play a round of golf, where I find the latest, most well-designed golf clubs ever made are available to everyone there to play a round that day. Not just one set. Not an infinite number of sets. Just enough to serve the number of players playing a round of golf on any given day, probably determined by some sort of sophisticated probability algorithm that, in all likelihood, already exists today. If this can apply to Golf Clubs, could we apply something similar to using a Yacht? Think of the really expensive things that only the privileged few (with lots and lots of money) enjoy. Do those things need to be denied to everyone else if enough can be produced in abundance for anyone to access them when needed? Visit a marina sometime and take a look at all the boats that sit, unused. 

Now, imagine this across the full gamut of possible experiences where we use resources. Today, vehicles spend nearly 80% of their life cycle parked and unused. Not only is this a waste of resources, it's a waste of space! Imagine a solution to this being an automated transportation system where you simply book a trip and a car arrives at your habitat to take you to your destination. Maybe it won't even need to stay parked at your destination. It can go on to fulfill other transportation needs, and another vehicle can pick you up when you're ready to return home. 

Even more disgusting than cars are the number of vacant habitats that exist today following the housing market crash. Entire neighborhoods, condominium complexes, and so forth stand entirely vacant, unoccupied. Various ""vacation"" homes owned by wealthy individuals that only see limited use throughout the year. The worst case I've read about are the ghost cities in China, each built to accommodate several hundreds of thousands of people or more that became too expensive for a majority of people in China. [Hundreds... of Thousands... of vacant habitats.](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-21/chinas-ghost-cities-are-multiplying) 

Imagine a scenario where any kind of preference for a living habitat exists, from a high-rise condo to a rural habitat, and you simply book it like you would a hotel or a cabin for as long as you want. No need for buying, renovating, maintaining, or otherwise bearing any kind of commitment to it if it's built modularly to be replaced if somehow ruined. 

Of course, there's the potential problem of ""overcrowding,"" which is already a problem in some areas of the world. But then, I'll point out that there are some evident ""economic"" reasons many decide to live in major metropolitan areas, especially ""low-income areas,"" many of whom would very likely decide against such an area if it weren't for a job. Or distance from family... which is another matter to address. Transportation.

I live within the same regional area as the rest of my family, save a few extended family members who live on the other side of the US. Imagine the possibility of traveling from New York City to London England in roughly 25 minutes. What about New York City to Los Angeles in under 18 minutes? I'm not even sure these figures are small enough, as I've read of shorter travel times than these being possible with updated railway transportation systems. Heck, I'd be lucky to reach the hospital from my home in under 18 minutes. With an ideal transportation system, families can achieve further distance without requiring ridiculously long travel times for periodic visitation. 

_________________________________________

None of the above is in place at this moment. Fine. But let's not pretend like this is never going to happen either. Does money get us to a point where we're able to access any location on the planet in the time it may take us to travel from one metropolitan area to another today? Does money get us to a point where everyone has shelter? Does money get us to a point where everyone has access to the luxuries that only the privileged few (with lots of money) get to enjoy today? For the sake of time, I didn't expound on growing food or pursuing renewable energy (important subjects, though this is not part of the point I'd like to make). 

* With money, we have more barriers to the resources necessary to innovate. 
* With money, we have more barriers to agreement on how to implement various innovations for distribution (who gets what piece of the pie). 
* With money, we have greater dissent among political lines.. about money (a total waste of time and legislative resources). 
* With money, we have homeless people and people-less homes. 
* With money, we have luxurious items and lifestyles for a few with excessive labor and poverty for many. SURPRISE: We've ALWAYS had this with money.
* With money, we have leadership decisions motivated by profit, not a future vision for the world. 

Until we're weened off our antiquated system of money (or any system of acquisition, be it bartering, trading in gold, whatever), forget about anything resembling a genuinely ""free"" society. Money is the ""wheel"" of the stone age everyone seems interested in updating, setting right, revolutionizing, or otherwise reinventing. 

Money DOES NOT contribute to a future society of equality at the highest quality of living for all people. Forget about money, we'll be better off without it. Just my opinion, and I've admittedly done an awful job of trying to boil it all down to something this short. There's plenty more I'd say, but this will hopefully get my point across and stimulate discussion. Maybe. ",28,27,False,self,,,,,

[For Us, The Living](http://www.heinleinsociety.org/newsFUTL.html) was the first book [Robert Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein) ever wrote, and because it was deemed unpublishable all copies were thought to have been destroyed. 

The book is really just a series of discussions that explore what the future might look like and hence does not really have a plot, which explains why it was considered unpublishable, however the economic section is perhaps the best explanation of [MMT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory) economics that I've ever read.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Yiw8Lyw1XGc#t=531) [skip to 8:50] is a really interesting interview with [Stephanie Kelton](http://stephaniekelton.com/) that discusses MMT.

She claims that in the US alone, because of unemployment, that about 35 *billion* man hours are wasted every year. To put that in perspective: It took *less than* 1 billion man hours to build the Great Pyramid.[^[1]](http://books.google.com/books?id=v48kiVG9vdwC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=%22great+pyramid%22+%22man+hours%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_haLcZsPMY&amp;sig=meRc9TyXQpclp7osNabOYWCKBHI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HuGEUtGQDufesATlwoJQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22great%20pyramid%22%20%22man%20hours%22&amp;f=false)

&gt;The other bonus is another gift to us. The money earned by this novel will be going to directly and substantially support Heinlein's dream, and the dream we, Heinlein's Children, share. Earnings will be going to the advancement of human exploration of space. When you purchase ""For Us, the Living"" you are also contributing, in a real and meaningful way, the furtherment of this dream. Yet again, Heinlein 'pays it forward.'

Or how _c___ got ""beliebers"" to shave their heads. Sure these hyper connected masses are trolling now, but what will it develop into?

Anonymous got me thinking about hiveminds. It's steered by participation. The consciousness of the hivemind is expanded in the direction of content that's shared most thoroughly through the vast nodes. When I was down at OccupLA I had 'hope for humanity' being around so many informed people. They seemed to be a hivemind that wanted to steer their government in a direction. Rather than people rioting outside a sports arena. I felt like what the other nodes at OccupLA were sharing things I would share. I realised it wasn't the system but the lack of informed participation that was the problem. If Mr. Lastname doesn't like politics, but votes all the time, he's muddying down the decision. What I like about Anonymous is it's controlled by those who care enough to hack, create videos, dialog, etc... Those are the people that steer it, not Mr. Banker whom wouldn't give up 20 minutes to try and steer the trolls over at Anonymous. Those participating in Anonymous are as powerful as the whole, when their ideas resonate. This is going to be important in the hyper connected future.

Sure we don't utilize the internet in our governments at the moment, but with this awesome tool you'd have to be stupid to not see them tango in the future. Decentralized of course. 

People's views can be vaguely assumed based off the content they willfully consume. Could democracy be ran off of follower count? How will the hivemind of Humanity be read in the future? What hiveminds do you participate in? How will the internet be utilized in social organization of the future?

One that I've had (and forgive me if it's not a new idea, I'm sure someone else has thought it up before me, after all it is the internet) in my head now for awhile. I always thought, why don't we just get rid of physical money ENTIRELY? No, not the idea of money, just MONEY. No more pennies, nickels, dollar bills, any of it. 

Here's my basic premise:

The government would send out to anyone who is citizen of the country a credit card. This card can be attached to a personal bank account with your own bank or it can be attached to an account with the government itself. 

**what if it gets stolen/ I lose it?**
call a government number, give your info, have it cancelled. You can pick up a new one at a local government office.

**what if I'm here on a visa/ here on vacation from another country?**
They will give you a temporary card to use. This card will expire when your visa expires. If you are here on vacation, the card expires after a maximum number of days you plan on being here.


If there are drawbacks to this system that I am missing, what would they be? From what I envision, the pros would far outweigh the cons.

Pros:
-More tax revenue. No more under the table employment. All currency would be traceable. 
-Decreased thefts. Less personal thefts if thieves know that there's no money in wallets and purses. 1000 wallets and purses are stolen every 2 minutes in the U.S.
-Lowers illegal immigration. 
-No more drug infested, bacteria infested dirty money (ugh)
-Government spending would be lowered substantially. The cost to produce currency and coin for the U.S. in 2013 is $797.6 million.

Cons:
I've tried thinking of some but the best I could come up with is more government ""intrusion"". There will always be the conspiracy theorists who will cry foul at the slightest idea of have government more involved in their life.",12,15,False,self,,,,,

I've seen similar articles about ""future soldier"" systems in the past and while I'm not sure how much of it is closer to becoming a reality, it's definitely something they're pouring tons of money into researching, so it will be realized in some form, some day. The implications are interesting to think about.

What would the US (or other similarly well-funded militaries) do if they could outfit hundreds or even thousands of soldiers with a suit that made them super strong and bulletproof (in addition to a bunch of other upgrades)? 


Comic books and sci-fi (except  those that take place in the distant future) almost always focus on a single supersoldier or technology, like Iron Man's suit, that is so expensive that it couldn't be mass-produced. But what if we could effectively mass-produce superhumans? How would that change the world and way we wage war?

Perhaps it wouldn't even have that big of an impact, seeing as how drones and other remote controlled vehicles are playing a larger and larger role in modern warfare. But I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts.

Can we knock Ray Kurzweil off his prognosticating pedestal with the power of the crowd? Outperform the portfolio predictions of Steve Jurvetson?

This project is an experiment in [collective intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence). Can a group of interested layfolk outperform the professionals?

We are now in the home stretch. The community decided on [the FPP process](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1qg6i8/planning_the_rfuturology_prediction_project_aka/) and brainstormed [a list of future expectations](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1qj1wa/futurology_prediction_project_brainstorming_thread/) to make predictions on.

Now comes the fun part. It is time to make our predictions.

I have culled the top ranked technologies and social changes from the previous thread (all ranked above 5 upvotes). There are around 40 in total, which I think is probably the limit of what we will be able to manage.

I have also modified several of the predictions slightly for clarity. If you go to the previous thread you will see I queried several authors about the intent of their offerings.

**THE RULES FOR THIS THREAD**
&gt;1. Top level comments are for technologies only. Since I am transcribing these from the other thread **don't use top level comments**. Also, there is not much point upvoting and downvoting the top level comments. Save your karma.

&gt;2. Each prediction should state a defined time or time range if appropriate. If you do not think it is possible in the near future, a comment like ""not in the next 50 years"" is acceptable.

&gt;3. Upvote the prediction you most agree with. Downvote the ones you disagree with.

&gt;4. Since you are trying to convince the audience your prediction is right, provide evidence for your assertions. A non-referenced prediction should be treated with suspicion.

&gt;5. Do get involved. This is a big community, we need to use that for the project to succeed. We need you!

&gt;6. Remember the weakness of collective intelligence is [groupthink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink). If you disagree with a prediction, make sure you say it! The more discussion and evidence used to support arguments, the better.

&gt;7. Play nice. Play the argument, not the person.

&gt;8. Publicise the project. The more people the better. Mention it in other subreddits, on forums, on blogs, or even to your meatfriends.

&gt;9. **DO** imagine each prediction to be uttered by a [world-spanning borg-mind](http://project-apollo.net/mos/img/char-mars.jpg). Now, where is my vectored air-shield?

**THE AFTERMATH**

The plan will be to keep this thread going for as long as it needs and people are still interacting. 

Once complete I suspect we can plug the info straight into the futurology wiki [timeline](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/wiki/timeline), but developing some nice visualisations/infographics etc. would be cool too. 

The results will be freely available for anyone to do what they want with.

**RESOURCES**
/r/futurology is your best resource. If you want supporting evidence for your prediction, search the subreddit first. It is all here!

/u/_trendspotter kindly put together this list of other useful links in the last thread to get your predictive juices flowing.

**EDIT 1**

I notice a lot of people are giving ""in a decade"" as an answer. Try to be as specific as you can, the point is to use the best data to *accurately* predict the timeline of the future.

A few people have posted new technologies in top level comments. While it is against the rules, if they get upvoted enough I am happy to accept them. If they are silly, downvoted them to oblivion.

Remember to vote! And if you downvote (which you should), try to have a think about whether you could do a better estimate. If so, add to the conversation as well!

**EDIT 2**

Well, we had a good turnout. I will collate the data when I return home in a few days. Anyone who wants to address the currently unspecified elements, feel free to do so still. Remember you will be unlikely to get upvotes to beat an existing prediction though.",200,71,False,self,,,,,

I think in the future we will expend, use up and discard limbs and organs the way we treat cars today. sure some people like keeping old 1950's era cars running and people love to see it. for those who choose it, good for them. but the rest of us? we will upgrade when the price comes down (which it will very quickly). as such doctors will be a interesting cross between a hobby and profession. it will still take years to get it, 12 or 15 years of post secondary or some similar equavilent i will bet (as the body of knowledge expands and life expectancy does aswell). for real problems, watson and his robotic arms will provide. for the hobbyist, some will keep certain systems ""origional"" ""authentic"" or ""natural"" for fashion or hobby purposes. ""look, i have biologicial calfs"" but most will move beyond and with it, move beyond regular need for a md. 

next, a little bigger:
ever read what it was like in ancent greece or the renasance? we often tend to read about the great works of the pholisophers or the various arts consumed by the wealthy. criticisisms of works of art were done purely to explore ideas. why did this chereter have to die? what does it symbolize? what does that song mean? what is this painting say if we were to use formalism to examine it? feminisim? communism? today ""critics"" are just well versed movie or game buffs who tell us which movies and games are worth purchesing with our limited time. but in the future: everyone will live like a citizen in an acentent democracy. 
remember that the vast majority of people in sparta were not citizens (or any ancent culture) the majority of the population was to busy being slaves and doing work now left to combines and computers. in the future we will all be free. we will be able to build a true direct democracy. no need for coruptable representatives, we will not be so busy with tedious work consuming our lives that we can fill it with meaningful activities. for many, this will be informing politics. deciding who gets to go on the next space ship, who gets the next run of mri and robots to run them on which scientific project. 

tldr: everyone will live like a citizen of sparta or the renasaunce, spending all there time, making, discussing, consuming art and democracy. and medicine will be a hobby, not a profession.

I would love to contribute my resources to the development of science or helping people in some way. Or just having interesting and amazing apps on my phone to help me out through my daily tasks. I think google maps is an example of an app that is very useful.

Venus or Mars? By colonizing I mean the species *Homo sapiens* will **permanently** settle down on a desired object and live there for decades/centuries, by terraforming I mean shaping the planet on the global scale so it could support life (different plants and animals) in a long-term. Don't confuse colonization and terraforming, those are two completely different concepts.

**Venus**

* has Earth-like mass, therefore a similar gravitational pull of approximately 0.9 g

* is closer to the Sun, on the inner edge of the so called ""habitable zone""

* the pressure of the atmosphere on the surface is 90x higher than on Earth (~ 9000 kPa compared to 101 kPa on Earth)

* because of the high pressure and greenhouse gasses in the Venus' atmosphere, the surface temperature is the highest in the Solar System (average of ~450 C)

* Venus' year lasts 224 Earth days, Venus' day lasts 243 Earth days (Venus' day is thus longer than Venus' year)

* has very weak magnetic field which would protect it from the Solar wind and cosmic radiation

* has very little water resources available

**Mars**

* is further away from the Sun, on the outer edge of the so called ""habitable zone""

* has mass of approximately 0.1 Earths (the gravitational pull is about 0.3 g)

* the atmosphere's pressure is about 0.6 kPa (Earth has 101 kPa)

* the surface temperature can vary from -140C (polar caps in winter) to 35C (near equator in summer)

* Martian days lasts 24h 37m, Martian year lasts about 686 Earth days

* has plenty of water resources available in form of the polar caps

* like Venus, has a weak magnetic field

Source for these facts - http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/

Both planets have their cons and pros when it comes to colonization/terraforming, for example Mars has much water available, Venus has virtually none, Mars has very low atmosphere pressure, Venus has it very high, etc.

Now, I think colonizing Mars is easier due to its surface temperature and water available but terraforming it would be very hard. The biggest obstacle for terraforming Mars is its low mass/low gravitational pull which wouldn't support much life (however some life forms could adapt to it). Venus however would be easier to terraform because Venus has the right mass. Also, it'd be far easier for our great grand-children to depressurize the atmosphere than to repressurize it (compare to Mars). And last, because it's closer to the Sun (receives about as twice sunlight as the Earth), life wouldn't have to stick only to the planet's equator (compared to Mars), it could theoretically live also in polar regions where (after making the surface habitable) it could be theoretically cooler and easier to live (compare to Earth's temperate climate). I imagine that the atmosphere could be depressurized by liquifying most of the carbon dioxide into a solid form (dry ice). The biggest problem for terraforming (and colonizing also) Venus would be water. The first human colonizators would solely have to rely on supply of the water from the Earth as the planet itself has no water at all (there's actually some water in the atmosphere but it's very low). The first life-forms on newly terraformed Venus could drink the Venus' very own water (made through Bosch reaction from carbon dioxide and hydrogen) and so on and so forth.

What are your views on colonization/terraforming Venus or Mars, fellow future enthusiasists?",20,20,False,self,,,,,

* Wireless Power - I've worked with a company doing WP before, as well as the Wireless Power Consortium - I'm lead to believe that the inefficiencies of wireless charging (largely, conductive) won't be played as such negatives if power is more affordable).

So modelling the European Union, all the world nations will have a gradual strengthening of bonds, currency and language will slowly be the same, it'll take forever with how stubborn we've been with the metric system.  But once this universal economy is close enough, there would be no reason for the Nation.  Cities would have all the trading power, and if food and energy systems are self sufficient, all that would be needed is a third party to regulate commerce and keep the peace. Like a cross between the Jedi and the World Bank/UN, but would have to have heavy protection against corruption.  

This system would support the Corporation, unfortunately.  But it could also support an alternative to Corporation.  Not too sure on the economics of self-sufficiency, but it'd be nice if these cities, and the people in the surrounding land, could produce the food and wealth they need locally.  

Just my thoughts, let me know what you think, and please, educate me since I haven't read up much on the subject.

Here's the relevant passage:

&gt; Stigmatizing female promiscuity  a.k.a. slut-shaming  has often been blamed on men, who have a Darwinian incentive to discourage their spouses from straying. But they also have a Darwinian incentive to encourage other women to be promiscuous. Dr. Vaillancourt said the experiment and other research suggest the stigma is enforced mainly by women.
&gt; 
&gt; Sex is coveted by men, she said. **Accordingly, women limit access as a way of maintaining advantage in the negotiation of this resource. Women who make sex too readily available compromise the power-holding position of the group**, which is why many women are particularly intolerant of women who are, or seem to be, promiscuous.

This company is changing the market space for blood testing but I can't see it lasting.  Surely this tech will quickly make it to the home market in a similar fashion to Scanadu.  I like how this Theranos test works but you still need referral from a Doctor and you still have to go somewhere and pay per test.  It seems to me what Theranos shows is the viability of such new technology and as with all tech it will become smaller and cheaper.  What we really need is Theranos for the home, a Scanadu like device for $99 that can test everything in our blood and give us results via a smartphone app.  I think this is possible in the next 7years.",2,4,False,self,,,,,

Those payments are just like Basic Income, but if one has enough of them, the amount is anything but basic.

In 2010, [Warren Buffett](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/opinion/17buffett.html) admitted that all stocks and bonds would have failed absent a PUBLIC bailout.  [The Levy Economics Institute at Bard College]( http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_698.pdf) estimates the bailout potential at $29 trillion dollars.

$29 Trillion dollars is more money than all welfare payments combined throughout history and this amount was allocated to relatively few.

In a world where PRIVATE wealth is a product of a PUBLIC bailout, shouldn't everyone be bailed out with Basic Income, especially as more and more jobs are being replaced by technology?

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. 

There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another. ""

We tend to get used to the things that we do day in and day out, and we forget about just how cool this stuff is. I don't realize it from day to day, but the fact is that literally every day I do stuff that would have been **impossible** just a decade ago. 

So here is the specific wow moment that hit me today. 

I took a plasmid of DNA which we ordered ready to use from a company. A plasmid is basically a small circular piece of DNA code, literally a small chunk of the raw code of life. 

*What I am specifically using this plasmid for is also very interesting too, but for the sake of brevity I will skip the details. Suffice it to say that we want to change the level of a specific protein in the cell. To do this we will put another piece of DNA into the cell that will inhibit its expression.*

The really interesting part about this plasmid is that if I combine it with a few other DNA codes and put it into special cells then they will start to produce viruses that I can use to infect other cells. I will then use the viruses to deliver my plasmid into the cells which I want to experiment on (which cannot be injected with plasmid normally). 

So I am putting this DNA into the cells and it struck me: **I just took the raw source code for a biological virus and compiled it using an immortal cancer cells, and out the other side will come a live virus which can infect any other cell.** 

Every part of that is fucking amazing. The fact that I can order the source code for a virus. The fact that I can put it into a cell, and it just starts producing what I tell it to. The fact that I am using immortal cancer cells that came from a person decades ago. 

Here is the kicker - this experiment is pretty routine these days, it would not even be considered particularly cutting edge! There are probably 10 000 or more labs around the world that could and do do these kinds of experiments.

Money is simply a claim for the output and production of society.  If that society continues to produce, then that money is also a store of value.  Pretty simple if you think about it and why Disney bucks in Disney World as just as valuable as any currency to the holder while at the park and the park remains open producing fun for the visitors.

Actually there is a step A to simplify life before we get to the 5 steps:  Forgive ALL debts to publicly bailed out companies, forgive all student loans and debts to governments, eliminate all forms of taxes, eliminate all forms of entitlement payments including welfare, food stamps, and unemployment, eliminate all forms of retirement and investment accounts relating to any claims to the publicly bailed out public companies, and eliminate social security.

Step 1.  Deem ALL publicly bailed out companies the legacy of and owned by the public.  Today, publicly traded companies are the vast majority of the productive output of the world.  Basically the stuff we want.

Step 2.  Create a new digital currency that is backed by the current output of the publicly traded companies.  How about if we call them Reddit Credits?  Since the money itself is directly backed by the output people want, it will be a highly trustworthy form of money.  And the more automated and efficient our economy becomes, the more we can trust the money.

Step 3.  With advanced technology monitoring productivity in real time, create new currency each time new output is produced and destroy currency each time output is consumed.  This will mitigate any inflation effects with too much currency chasing too few goods.  And the more productive society becomes, the more currency will be issued.  Thus we now incentivize productivity and efficiency instead of manipulated profits and people are rewarded directly for productive gains.

Step 4.  Distribute a base amount of money to all citizens in the form of Basic Income or an Automatic Dividend via credit card or smart phone to allow them a dignified claim against the output of the companies they now own.

Step 5.  Pay people additionally to engage in productive activities that promote the well being of society including but not limited to education, innovation, arts, etc....

And then watch the world advance at speeds few dreamed possible as we sustainably connect 7 billion people to collaborate and compete in the most dynamic and progressive economy in history.

Step 1. Deem ALL publicly bailed out companies the legacy of and owned by the public. Today, publicly bailed out companies are the vast majority of the productive output of the world.

Step 4. Distribute a base amount of money to all citizens monthly in the form of Basic Income or an Automatic Dividend via credit card or smart phone to allow them a dignified claim against the output of the companies they now own.

Step 5. Pay people additionally to engage in productive activities that promote the well being of society including but not limited to education, innovation, arts, etc....

And then watch life get better as the world advances at speeds few dreamed possible by connecting 7 billion people to sustainably collaborate and compete in the most dynamic and progressive economy in history.  There are additional details to be addressed, but the above gives a basic framework.

But now with 7 billion people being nurtured to consume and pollute with Industrial Capitalist ideals, pollution, resource depletion, and growing conflicts are threatening our future.

Due to scarcity, are more people becoming self-centered Zombies focusing only on themselves and their immediate surroundings disregarding those around them and the consequences to any future for others, and even their own children?

There have been quite some studies on how to better government to be better equipped at dealing with new technologies and how to better invest in technologies that will be relevant in the future. As ""Futurologists"" who can't wait to see a glimpse of the future ASAP I thought it would be a good idea to introduce an idea/movement that would actually help the proliferation of science, as opposed to the UBI.

MAUNIMO, an organ of the European University Association. Where they mapped university mobility in the European union. I would like to focus on the European Union as it is a more hospitable place than the US when it comes to collaboration, no offense.
There are two kinds of mobility, physical and virtual mobility. We are currently all experiencing the latter as we are part of the reddit community and are introduced to a variety of ideas and opinions, a true accumulation of different identities. However, can we all agree that it is not the best forum for deep scientific discussions or fostering continual relations needed to produce anything of substance in the material world. As shown in the: [reddit!] (http://www.reddit.com/r/redditspaceinitiative/) , for such efforts you need a physical location and a lot of funding to get it going. 

Currently there is enough funding and there are enough people to get the Reddit Space Initiative to launch off, but their allocation, even though detrimental, is done poorly in the scheme of things. We live in a world where borders start to matter less every passing moment, still these borders and distances stand in the way of greater collaboration, even if theyre only figments of the mind. 
So how could greater mobility benefit scientific progress? Lets start off with a definition.  Although MAUNIMO focuses more on physical mobility, this is their ""inventory"" of mobility^1:

1. Physical  international (e.g. cross-border) mobility of
*students at different stages of their study (e.g. including PhD)
*academic staff
*administrative staff

2. for purposes such as
*academic teaching and learning
*professional practice
*research
*joint projects
*internships, language learning

3. which could be for students
*Programme Mobility ('vertical mobility' or degree mobility)
*Credit Mobility ('horizontal' mobility)
*Other forms of mobility, that are relevant at your institution

4. For staff
*Sabbaticals if spent abroad
*Research visits
*Staff exchanges

Their study was on the mobility between universities, while relevant they employ only a fragment of all scientific staff and an even smaller percentage of the patents^2, with only 5 percent of those being licensed^3.  Thus, I would like to expand the conversation to the entire  academic spectrum, including corporations and (entrepreneurial) societies . With both entities being rather exclusive, the first hiring only as long as it is profitable and with the latter you need to know the people inside personally. 

The benefits however are quite include, but are not limited to Improving knowledge flows, stimulating new ideas, creating networks, developing cooperation for joint research and fostering innovation. The best thing yet is that the funds are already widely available in the forms of Horizon 2020 project or the Life-long Learning Project  both endorsed by the European Union. 

Now, I am not here to recruit you to my cause, Im just there to provoke a discussion. Asking: Is greater mobility ideal? And if so how do we promote it? What could be the arguments against it? And if it was institutionalized, who should take control over it? 

Personally, I think it would foster new efforts in niche scientific fields.

This is something I haven't really anyone talking about on this sub before. Lots of people here seems to lust after the singularity as if it's the best thing that could ever happen but yet I've barely seen any discussion as to the potentially extremely negative aspects of the idea. I think movies like iRobot and The Matrix raise valid points that AI could decide to act in ways that would harm humanity. Michio Kaku has a good metaphor about alien life that could translate over to AI:

*""lets say we have an ant hill in the middle of the forest. And right next to the ant hill they're building a 10 lane super highway. and the question is ""would the ants be able to understand what a ten lane super highway is? Would the ants be able to understand the technology, the intentions of beings building the highway next to the ants? Lets say you go down to the ants and you say to the ants ""I bring you trinkets. I bring you beads. I bring you knowledge. I bring you nuclear energy. I bring you dna technology. I bring you utopium. take me to your leader."" Is that what you say when you bump into ants? No. Most people simply, step on a few of them.""*

If you imagine that but replace the aliens with AI it would still apply, however, we would share the same space (planet) with those beings; they would regularly come across ants instead of having diverge off a super-highway to find them. 

I would be very, very cautious about the idea AI being able to independently think for itself. The singularity is a truly scary concept, it is not something to recklessly rush towards.",26,20,False,self,,,,,

Cloning is an excellent idea.  It can allow us to bring back extinct species, and slowly design animals, plants, and even ourselves into 'better' forms.  So this isn't against cloning, it's merely against the idea that we will ever use cloning on humans on a large scale.  I should also note that I'm talking about growing humans Brave New World style, not erasing diseases or giving health or intelligence bonuses.

Cloning humans isn't likely for three main reasons.  

The first is that advance cloning techniques are likely to follow the singularity.  Also following the singularity will be technologies that will enhance already living humans into perfect forms, forms we can choose and change at will.  Genes will be edited constantly and most humans will begin to receive implants, and some will even abandon biological bodies completely.  Why would cloning even be necessary, let alone effective, when genes can be changed anyways?  The only groups could potentially even have a need for cloning will be luddite like cultures that will likely oppose cloning as well.

Next is the more obvious: socially unacceptable.  Deciding value based on genes is not likely to be accepted by a large majority of people especially as the ""we're all equal"" world view spreads.  The singularity will happen long before we even got twenty percent of the population to consider it viable.  People are far more willing to give birth, then let their children choose what's important to them based on their own choices.

Finally, because robots.  The technology to make a robot with a perfect human body *and* implant the kind of personality you want will likely arrive around the same time as these cloning techniques anyways.  Why create a clone when you can simply have perfect robots?

In the current financial system, money is simply the evidence of a loan FROM a bank to a person, business or government called a note.  The more banks loan, the more money.  The more banks pay interest for savings, the more money.   The higher the cost to borrow, the more NEW money must be created (loans made by banks) to pay the NEW obligations created everyday.

The biggest irony is a ""savings"" account is not really savings but legally an UNsecured loan to a bank suborindated to credit default swaps.  The bank can loan generally up to to 10X savings.  So if just 10% of loans fail, the bank has no capital and savings can't be repaid.

Since the efficiency of technology started making it harder for banks to make loans, credit default swaps were invented to insure loans that banks made.  The idea became so popular that now there is over 10X the credit default swaps compared to debt outstanding.

So let's summarize this, and the numbers are not exact but give a good illustrative picture of the game:  There is 10X the number of loans as savings and 10X the amount of credit default swaps as loans.

Since the loans are increasingly suspect on their face, credit default swaps have eclipsed the loan game in terms of size and importance.  So now, even if a loan was going to fail, those holding the swaps would prevent it so the swaps/insurance wouldn't have to pay off.

Swaps are very similar to insuring a $100K house for $1,000,000.  The insurer would be much better off buying the house $500K than letting something happen to it.  In the end, the house no longer matters as the insurance becomes the economic priority.

Today, due to the rise and dependence on credit default swaps, there is much more debt outstanding that can ever be paid back.  And currently, interest obligations are suffocating many people, businesses, and governments around the world.


More and more people are being negatively impacted from this everyday.  Making loans that you know or should know can't be paid back is fraud, and essentially no different than a Ponzi Scheme.

Today, we are seeing lots of evidence that this game is unraveling around the world.  Higher unemployment, rising poverty, and fewer jobs to name a few.  And what is remarkable is there are some people suppporting this Ponzi system despite the obvious mathematical failures yet mocking Bitcoins and other crypto currency.

If my calculations and estimates are right, we could see this entire system implode upon itself within a few months, and then everyone in the world will acknowledge and accept it is time to [Reboot Our Planet](http://www.rebootourplanet.com) on how we allocate the goods and services of the world.",12,0,False,self,,,,,

As this new generation of kids is growing up only knowing the ""tech age"" is it possible that their kids will see their parents hooked into a subreality and re-discover what life without smartphones and computers is through the typical teenage rebellion phase that everyone goes through?

Or will current equipment merely be automated instead, without any major advanced designs?

A number of the technologies did not have predictions made or the predictions were downvoted, so I have culled those from the results. I have linked to any discussions or explanations for answers/predictions. If there is no link, it is because there was a straightforward number given without any comment.

Some of the answers *do* have supporting evidence in the discussions, but that wasn't common.

The results are listed below in no particular order. Links to each comment chain is contained within. How do you think it went? Agree with most of it? Disagree and kicking yourself you didn't get involved?

&gt;[AI] Artificial intelligence near-completely replaces ""cognitive"" workers including doctors, lawyers and engineers.

Estimates of 40-80 years. (No real winner).

&gt;[CONSUMER PRODUCTS] Terabit internet speeds are commonplace.

Within the next 40 years. (No discussion, but some agreement around this sort of timing).

&gt;[CONSUMER PRODUCTS] Synthetic (lab cultured / in vitro) meat products in supermarkets.

Estimates range from 8-40 years!

Yet, so many can't seem to grasp the possibilities of this and they chant the ""it's only a copy of you"" mantra.  There are several scenarios which could provide continuity of consciousness.  For example each neuron replaced by a machine counterpart and one by one the original is turned off.  At several moments of this procedure you would have the biological and digital counterparts working in parallel with one shifting completely to the other.  You would not even be aware this happened and would not experience death so to speak.  You would not necessarily be a copy because you were self aware during the entire process, never a moment of death so to speak.  Another scenario might be brain prosthesis that prove so efficient our consciousness begins to slowly exist in the prosthesis instead, in which case this gradual change makes for continuity of consciousness as well.  I'm not so much touching on original biological matter vs. digital matter therefore one must be a copy, I am trying to explain how that does not matter as long as ""you"" are self aware through the shift from one computing structure (brain) to another (machine).

Here's what we know:

The environment is going to shit. 1% of the population on the planet has all the money. 99% of us are getting fucked by that 1% of the population.  Virtually every government on the planet is too corrupt to fix the problems, which lie deep in the roots of our economic and political systems, to fix the problems. If radical action is not taken, we eventually will succumb as a species to environmental catastrophe.

Since these issues cannot be fixed from inside any existing government, maybe we need a government of the people to work on these issues from the outside?

Wouldn't it be a cool game, or simulation, to elect a world-government elected by the world election i describe above? 

Who would you vote for president? Economic leaders? Parliamentary leaders? Science and space exploration leaders? Law enforcement leaders?

No politics. No running for office. You get your pick of any person of merit. Thanks to the internet, there are many people who have become famous in all these areas through speeches on TED and YouTube, blogs, twitter feeds, articles, recorded lectures, viral videos, not to mention books and e-books.

Without a PUBLIC bailout of $29 Trillion Dollars, Warren Buffett admits every public company would have gone bankrupt. Bankruptcy would not have impacted the productive capacity or output of these companies, simply who or what owns them. If we Reboot Our Planet, everyone can own the PUBLICLY bailed out companies and everyone can receive a dividend every month sufficient for a dignified life to claim the output of the companies they own....just like Warren gets.
 
In the Industrial Era, bankers create money out of thin air by making loans. Whoever they make a loan to gets money. We trusted bankers to allocate capital to projects and individuals they felt were productive and promoted society's goals. Interest was charged on loans to generate profits for the bank and to motivate people to continually advance the system. For over 100 years, it was the game we played and the system we trusted.
 
However, with new, more efficient technology, it is becoming harder for banks to find businesses and individuals to make sound loans to. Automation and digitization is reducing both the need for financial capital and the need for people to make things. As a result, banks are increasingly resorting to speculation, fraud, and improper behavior to perpetuate the existing economy and protect their ""profitability,"" while the old basis for creating sound capital crumbles.
 
Since money is just a tool for people to get the goods and services they need from our companies, we must question whether it makes sense to continue our current system of creating money through bank loans. Such thinking fails when we can now use powerful technology to directly distribute money, and therefore goods, to citizens. If we change our thinking, a stable, abundant economy can evolve where everyone can prosper and be rewarded for advancing societal and personal goals in a new sustainable and productive world.
 
By moving beyond our current systems, we could pay anyone to go to school. We could pay people to conduct research. We could pay individuals for new innovations and inventions. We could compensate those that advance knowledge and the arts. Everyone could compete and collaborate globally. The potential for success would be unlimited and the opportunities open to all.
 
Excellence is not an endpoint, it is the result of relentlessly pursuing something you are passionate about. Due to the failure of our existing systems to meet the present needs of society, people's passions are evaporating. With purpose and proper motivation, potential is unlimited. Imagine a world where nobody fears scarcity and everyone has the opportunity to access knowledge without constraints. Just because someone can retire, does not mean they will retire. There are lots of people that love to pursue their passion regardless of money. With the opportunity for self improvement open to all, excellence will be the natural destination from where all journeys begin.
 
With advances in automation and communication, we can build a new dynamic and sustainable economy. One that allows 7 billion people to be incentivized to collaborate and compete in open systems designed to advance the productivity and the efficiency of global needs. Based on current technology, such an environment can be reality today. Implementing it would not only serve society, but it would promote individual freedom and development at a rate never seen before.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

I am using a throwaway account, because I know I am expecting too much from Reddit to gain any realistic discussion about the future, anyway, let give this a shot.

**Would Human ""evolve"" into something else even if it is artifical?**

It seems obvious that we would attempt to achieve immortality, increasing mental capacity, and becoming stronger like superman. Those have a limit, because human itself is fragile to a lot of things. So eventually, human can choose to become an entirely different being to amplify their characteristics. If you see Furry characters on the internet, it wouldn't be too far fetch that such anthromorphics would be attempted on Human. A relatively easier way to go would be merging DNA of advantageous species into our DNA to amplify our characteristics. If this is successful, human would face socially artifical evolution.

**Would time be different for every solar system?**

One simple answer, HELL YES. [There is General Relativity in Global Positioning System](http://www.phys.lsu.edu/mog/mog9/node9.html) which proves this. A solar system can be going by 1 day while on Earth, only a 1 minute had passed. I guaranteed you that the fastest solar system will be the seat of any galactic government especially for immortal people. With the fastest solar system, you can create ships faster, breed faster, research technology faster, and response to any crisis faster than anywhere else. On top of that, many solar systems will be buying technologies or receiving the distribution from that planet while exporting tons of resources including many luxuries. If there is going to be an advanced alien civilization, this is where we need to look for. This is often overlooked by just about every space related games, story, or movies.

**Can we watch any event in the Universe if we travel far enough to look back?**

Same idea can be said for Mass Effect series when Commander Shepard should have the human alliance fund the astronomy project to record the Reapers invasion in the past and prove it to the councils. The galaxy have a diameter of 100120 **KILO**-light years (That is 120,000 years for light to travel across the diameter of the galaxy.) That is more than enough time to watch the Reaper invasion unfold if given advanced enough telescope which is easily feastible in a Type 1/2 civilization.

Finally, after about three links I looked at, I saw a post from one guy who simply said: ""Are you using the same adapter that came with the tablet? It's more powerful than a cell phone charger.""  

Well I wasn't sure. I hunted around, found one of the other chargers around the house, and plugged that in. And it worked! That random internet dude figured out my problem for me, and *I hadn't even asked him*.  

The whole routine, start to finish, was about three hours. The google-fu at the end was maybe five or ten minutes, tops. So I wondered, *what if the internet was just in my head?*  

A problem arises: the tablet won't charge. My meat brain thinks about turning it off and off again, maybe try plugging it into the lap- DING! Google Idea ^tm suggests making sure you're using the same charger that came with the device. *Oh yeah, this isn't the only charger we have knocking about, I'll try one of the other ones*. Success!  

Total elapsed time: less than a minute.

I hope this is the right subreddit to discuss this on. If not, please go ahead and ignore me. The act of writing this down is just as important to me as finding out that there are other, like minded people who feel the same way.",52,114,False,self,,,,,

You can create teams within the program and in the past I have hosted contests among my team members where cash prizes where given to the members that crunched the most data.

My problem is I know these data crunching programs will not take off until they can show they have found cures or treatments for diseases directly from this data and I'm afraid that might be decades away. I currently have about $1500 between my amazon account and some physical items I have bought that are slowly appreciating. Lately I've been thinking that this is a drop in the bucket and I am not really making a difference. 

I know that at the very least I am contributing to scientific knowledge because there have been over 100 peer reviewed papers published from grid computing research but I am getting impatient to see real results. Do any of you guys run one of these programs on your system?
