It does not make sense that only a minority of the population privately benefit immensely from government actions supporting financial markets.

If  the companies and stock markets are restructured and become public domain in the future, then everyone could receive a dividend monthly or quarterly to get the things they need produced by the companies in the stock market.  No one would have to worry about retirement or welfare as ownership would be expanded to everyone.  Taxes could be obsolete under this system and people would no longer fear unemployment.  

As technology improves productivity, everyone would benefit from the increased output.  Corporations could be repurposed to improve productivity and efficiency instead of profits.

Maybe this could be a logical and legal way to introduce Universal Basic Dividends/Income in the future.  Since it is public capital now capitalizing and supporting the markets, everyone should be entitled to a dividend in the future.",20,36

I think they could.

First off, they have self driving car technology that can detect vehicles around it.   So they in theory should be able to use this to see if there are vehicles in the first few places behind the ""stop here on red"" line.   If Google can detect vehicles a large number of times, they can make sure the side without any vehicles doesn't get a green light.

Now what about the yellow light?  It's long been known to cause traffic awkwardness and possibly even accidents because someone decided that its timing will not be standardized across all lights.  Some yellow lights are short, some yellow lights are long.   Do I coast through it?  Do I jam on the brakes and stop from 55 mph in time?   What if yellow lights had numbers that timed down?   Have they tried this before?   I know the idiots would try and beat the yellow light harder, but a stationed cop in introductory zones could teach them not to be jerkwads with fines.

I'm pretty sure Google could make a better traffic light if they wanted.   No matter what the initial investment in it would be, these better traffic lights would pay for themselves.  Every time someone could keep going instead of stopping saves on gasoline and time.   Even if you paid $10,000 up front per traffic light, you could be earning 25 cents per car not needlessly waiting in gasoline and their time.   A one time cost would be deferred by wealthier and happier citizens. 

I'm not 100% a counting down yellow light would be better.  For educated people, a counting down light can help you determine if you should stop or go through the light.  But for a race car initiated idiot, they might think they're trying to time it for a perfect starting line takeoff.

I think Google has the technology to make this.   Even if they don't want to use self driving car technology, they should be able to develop vision recognition/laser range finders to determine if a road is empty or not.",5,0

Basically the goal would be to sequence an embryo, take stock of its genes, and for scientists to cut or silence the any known bad genes, and to add known helpful genes. Like for intellegence, stamina, etc. The timelimit is 5 years, and the purse for winning should be at least 50 million. In fact all Xprize winners need to upped to something juicy.

But on top of that the self driving taxi will drive empty to it's next pickup point. The  B1 to A2 journeys that don't happen to private cars which go in the garage or parking lot. 

This extra traffic should gradually be offset by more even traffic flow as self driving cars become the majority of vehicles on the road and all those unused parking lots would be trees or solar parks.  

Edit. I'm talking about self driving taxis that replace private car journeys.

Edit: Another point is all the train and bus traffic could migrate to the comfort and privacy and safety of self driven taxis as they will be cheaper than the train and door to door against the bus. 

Edit: As it's impractical to turn railways into roads as they take very heavy freight like huge bulk stone and coal. Something roads can't do.  If the railways have few passengers, I'm beginning to think the increase in traffic could be huge with cheap self driving taxis. 

Edit: I'm not saying self driving cars are a bad idea, I'm just pointing out an aspect I think we need to consider and plan for with electronic traffic management systems.",29,0

(if nothing cataclysmic happens before hand that is)

That was until today, when a bit of information caught my eye and changed my timeline completely: Moore's law will end.

This one simple and obvious concept had managed to easily slip under my radar. 

Now, I don't really know how widely accepted this view is here; But it's something that I now come to perceive as a sort of inevitability. As you may or may not know...the size of the transistor is getting ever smaller; So small in fact that it is almost to a point where electrons become uncertain and thus nullifying the proceeding doublings.

I am also uncertain now. Where before I had a degree of hope,but now it's quickly fading. Will there be more than just Moore's law? will we continue to advance or will we stagnate? what if anything will come beyond Moore's law? are just a few of the questions that have been plaguing me as of late...

I like many humans am afraid of death, and I cant help but feel like this concept has almost certainly left me with little hope of living beyond my organic expiration date. I very much hope I am wrong!

can anybody answer my questions? or are there no real answers? please let me know!

thank you for reading, and I hope my ramblings are semi-clear! :)",6,2

I didn't understand how a being recreated using my memories would still be *me*. I've thought about it a lot, and I've changed my mind on the subject. The mind uploaded to the computer and later recreated in another being would still be me.

Question: ""Would it not just be someone else living in your body with your memories, while you are long gone and dead?""

Answer: This question makes absolutely no sense. Any instance of a brain with my thoughts will not only feel like it is me, it *is* me. Think about yourself dazing off, or day dreaming. You can forget yourself, for a few seconds. Then someone wakes you up, and now you're alert. Think about what might have happened there. Your brain might as well have turned to mush, and then rebuild itself, once again accessing all your memories. You brain, when it is active, is performing magical, not-yet-understood chemical reactions that allow the simultaneous miracle and tragedy of being able to **feel**. When you combine that with your cohesive memories that are based in reality, and are able to predict and make sense of reality, reality *makes sense* and you're online. You're you.


Now whenever my brain is uploaded to a computer and put in another body, I'll have woken up from my day dream, accessed my cohesive memory of reality with higher-dimensional historical experiences, and some chemical reactions will take place and I'll snap awake. ",117,9

1 If the brain/hardware is destroyed, the mind/software inside is destroyed.

2 If the mind/software is destroyed, the brain/hardware can remain.

So, mind is not ""you"", it's your brain: the real object that supports your dinamic mind. 

In the future we will understand what is ""me""; but I bet that people will keep their physical support, because a copy of your mind is not you, is just a copy.

First lets open our perspective, it makes sense that some day, due to technological advancement humans could postpone significantly our natural death, the last guy dying of old age just before the key discovery will be extremely unlucky, the same way that thousands of World War I soldiers died of gangrene infections just because penicillin was not yet discovered (it would be in 1928 but mass produced just in time for WWII.

So if we consider this kind of invention that lets people not die of old age a REAL POSSIBILITY, the question then is how will it happen and when?!

Humanity tenfold increase lifespan would be unpractical... overpopulation, famine, wars, lack of natural resources even lack of habitable space, the evident solution to all this problems would be space colonization. 
But we have a problem here, during the very optimistic 1000years that would take to terraform Mars, Earth would overpopulate, and we all die! Even if we managed to survive, by the time Mars is habitable, there would be enough humans to overpopulate Earth, Mars, Europa and Enceladus... 

Another solution would be to first colonize space and later increase tenfold lifespan, but that will not happen, ""easy"" space colonization without the need for terraforming would only be possible by visiting other solar systems, which either requires very long time or FTL space travel, which requires long time to develop. 
I'm just saying that tenfold increase lifespan will occur before extrasolar colonization... WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

Or we could be creative... people though humans could not fly, well we dont but we use technology to our advantages to achieve the same goal, even a more simple analogy, we use glasses to see better, our eyes malfunction as always, but thanks to a technology add on we cheat our destiny (or bad genetic inheritance) and we are able to see. I truly belive the same will happen to ""standard"" death.

As Kurzweil professes before 2045 computing technology would be there to emulate even surpass our brain functions at a similar space and at a decent price (Moore's second law). At the same time the MIND TO MEDIA GAP keeps getting smaller, I do not have time to plot a nice graph here but I hope everyone agrees that the last step before M2M GAP = ZERO is VR.

Speech &gt; Writing  &gt;  Recording  &gt;  Radio  &gt; Film (sound, colors, live, 3d...) &gt; Internet &gt;  VR  &gt;  Real M2M

Question is how long will VR need to truly evolve, it should be max 20 years, with final evolution being something similar to a contact lens, full view, perfect resolution and own body recognition... those CLVR users will look back at Google Glass with the same feeling as we today look at 1984's DynaTAC 8000X Motorola. 

My prediction as rudimentary futurologist is that between 2035 to 2045, the first real M2M (zero gap) will arrive to mass market, first rudimentary but with inevitable further evolution, this zero gap interaction between mind and media will develop some very useful applications, memory and ""computing"" augmentation, mind back up and mind to mind communication, a this moment it will be evident that the real evolution was probably not closing the gap between MIND 2 MEDIA but between MIND 2 MIND.

So, it is 2055, you can talk with anyone no matter which languages you speak, when your memory fails you can access you mind database, movie theater are truly old fashion as it even is VR, sex has dramatically evolved with even lower fertility rates, loved ones are always close, you call them with simple though: telepathy; all thanks to an implant in your brain, a connection to the cloud (via a gadget probably) and tremendous bandwidth, storage and computing capacity paid to a 3rd parties. 
It is then only inevitable than with the foresee of our unavoidable deaths, further steps are taken for an increased number of mind functions to be moved to the cloud, not only memories also thought processes, you are what you know but you are also how you think. It could be that since we humans are very physical, the first MIND UPLOADS manifest in in-body gadgets, it would make sense... it would make the transition from MIND, to MIND+DIGITAL to ONLY DIGITAL MIND much easier... just imagine the scene:

*Your loved one in the hospital bed (I'm sorry... but it has to be dramatic) dying of unavoidable disease, you are communicating via M2M since the effort to even speak is too much to handle, the doctors had been moving more and more body functions computing to his/her DIGITAL MIND to help the weakened body but finally the breathing stops, the heart monitor flatlined BUT you keep ""talking"" M2M, you all know what happen, its ONLY DIGITAL now, you are all afraid, the body will have to be taken care off, but hey! it is much better than death the old way.*

The biggest problem will be social acceptance of UPLOADED MINDS, but we all die so it will come in due time, only with religion as the major obstacle for human evolution as usual.

The only exception was probably the Russian Revolution where the communists killed all the rentier they could get, and the rentiers who escaped all died in the overseas. Russia does not recognize the claims of their descendants.

Otherwise, the rentiers , let it be the landowners, the patent owners, the bankers, the majority investors, whatever, who did not actually participated in the revolution but profited from it, had the last laugh all the time.

Now, the breakaway civilization some futurists long for is just around the corner.

However, there is a dange that the rentiers, who do not stand to profit from the breakway civ because in that civ property rights, etc, will all be redefined, could try to fight out and ill it, just so they could collect rent from what is available now.

USA could eat all of Canada during the War of 1812 while England was distracted by trying to get rid Napoleon, but the merchants in New England deliberately sabotaged it because for them short-term profits by trading with England was more important than annexing all of Canada.

Such short-sighted policies could be launched by the rentiers , and these policies do have the potenial to kill a decisive move towards a breakaway civ which will take some of humans to Type I Civ or Singularity.

The Rentiers are very tough and adamant on trying to keep what they have, and it is true that some techies turn into remtiers when they become too wealthy and begin to show rentier behavior.

The pioneers of singularity/breakaway civ tend to be economically independent enough to pursue their not-immediately-profitable researches, but they tend not to be very wealthy; if you are very wealthy, you simply don't want any changes which might have have the potentia to reduce their wealth and status.",2,0

Do you in anyway disapprove it and why?

Second, I am asking about what do you think about the ""attractiveness"" of plastic surgery. Do you find fake breasts, hips, or nose, in male or female, attractive or not?

I just wonder, personally the performaning of plastic surgery is of course something that must be approved but in necessary and.. logical ways, such as getting rid of a scar or if you have any asymmetry with your body like one breast bigger than the other in a really noticable way.

About attractiveness, I do find it attractive if it looks aesthetic. Like there are some pornstar with breasts bigger than their head, that is not attractive and that is also the kind of plastic surgery I don't approve.

Reason I am submitting this is, I see a lot of people finding implants ""disgusting"". But I also noticed (in most cases) they find them attractive if they look aesthetic UNTIL you tell them they are implants. I think this is also a subject about ""future"" because I think one day plastic surgery will be like getting a hair cut, it is already kinda common yet not but not something a majority does of course.

So, what do you think about plastic surgery. Do you find it attractive? And do you think it can be common like getting a haircut in future?",14,0

I hear it mentioned as if it's some Pandora's box that's going to abruptly take over the world. 

But to me it just sounds like a debugging algorithm that's going to save coders time and resources by doing the heavy lifting, so people can focus on design work. Or maybe help researchers gather and analyze data.

While I respect Kurzweil, I have no idea why he thinks reverse engineering the human brain is the right way of going about creating a super intelligence. I understand the inspiration. But at best he can hope to stumble upon something that works much better than the human brain on the way to attempting to emulate it.

Our best technology has no resemblance to nature. Books, refrigerators, phones and automobiles are distinctively man made. Nothing like that can be found in nature. Recreating the human brain would be like a cave man trying to recreate the human leg, when you can just invent a wheel.

I don't think we have to trip out on the possible motivations of a super AI. Chances are it would never have any motivations other than the tasks we assign to it. We have motivations because we're a bundle of nerves and chemicals inside of an awkward meat suit with allot of requirements and preferences.",37,0

Well, most legal principles were established during the 19th century - some of them date from the Roman times.

I do think that most of the existing laws cannot cope with the changed technological environment, and the same can be said about the legal system, the bureaucracy, voting, etc.

Those who earn their living thru the existing systems would rather keep the current system even though it is getting increasingly obsolete and irrelevant, and it is true that a lot of the recent progresses are much over the heads of these people.

It is frustrating that progresses and advances are stymied by the system which can't, and won't, accept and understand the progress, and those who can't understand the tech advances are still wielding considerable power and in the position to undermine the progress of technology.",30,20

So I've been building on a thought over the last couple of weeks, and that thought began with considering how far ahead I could look assuming everything goes to plan (ie that war, a lack of resources etc does not become an issue for our technological progress), and I'm not sure I'm happy with my conclusion. Here it is:

It seems to me that the end game with technological development is to be able, as a race, to do anything we want at any given time, and know everything we can. I remember reading an article here a few months ago about direct brain-to-brain communication, and had a thought about how interesting that would be. I guess it would be like being in constant conversation, and I imagine that some married couples (for instance) would prefer to be constantly connected to their spouse. That got me thinking though, if you're constantly connected to someone else's thoughts, would person A sometimes think that person B's thought was their own? Of course they would, they would begin to think as one. Disagreements between two connected people would resolve like a conflicted person's thoughts.

Anyway, over time, as brain-to-brain communication becomes more readily available, and more and more people prefer to be linked up, the next wave of the internet would be thought-based. We already crave direct access to the world's written thoughts, wouldn't we want direct access to all of that knowledge? My initial reaction is ""No, it'd be too much. It would be overwhelming. I prefer my privacy."" I think overtime, the benefit of shared consciousness (which is what this will surely become) will overcome the issue of privacy, and the nature of technological improvement will naturally iron out bugs such as being overwhelmed.

So here we are, in this crazy, hypothetical future where (after a great deal of time, I'm sure) all humans have accepted becoming part of this global consciousness. As a result, we're progressing really fast, because now our ideas are shared and improved upon instantly. The human race is, from an intellectual standpoint, at least, operating better than ever. We're resolving problems like war, world hunger, causes of unhappiness, unhappiness itself. So what's the next problem? Well, these fleshy vessels are a real problem for our consciousness. Parts of us keep dying. We need to resolve that. Boom - eternal life! No disease, no ageing etc.

We're living forever and we're really knowledgeable, and since we're cerebrally connected, we can essentially experience anything. I suppose something like The Matrix, if parts of our collective decide to live unique experiences, sexual fantasies, love, excitement, if we desire things so primitive, which, over time, I doubt. Those fleshy bodies we've done so well at perfecting are useless to us now. A stroll in the park in reality could arguably induce more pleasure than any false/virtual/thought environment, but does it beat the raw pleasure of being part of the human consciousness? Does it beat the raw pleasure of raw pleasure? Because that's where we are, able to experience anything. So perhaps humans don't need to take individual forms, but instead we should be raw information, or raw sentience, or whatever we can get ourselves down to in order to take the most efficient form, energised by photons or something. I'm picturing something similar to [grey goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo).

So now we're the perfect being, engulfed the world and everything is perfect within us. What now? Well, we need to know about the universe, about living forever and so we look up and out. We grow larger and over a great deal of time, we consume the universe. Sentience and knowledge runs through every space that the universe occupies. There is nothing but us, in our perfect form.

What now? Desire, the root of what got us to this place is now gone. We don't desire anything, because we have and are everything. Would we iron out all of the creases within ourselves in order to become a perfect stationary mesh of nothingness?",52,23

if the former is what you're talking about, could it be possible to upload your mind/consciousness/brain or whatever into that universe and insert yourself into it in a certain time period while being unaware you're actually in a simulation, so basically you come into consciousness just like what we do in real life except you'll be a completely different person? so if i wanted to, i could choose a body, family, time period etc. to be born into and then live a life exactly like i would in the real world except i'd have chosen what i'd be born as instead of just leaving it up to chance and i could choose hundreds of different lives to cycle through while only a month or so has passed in the real world or something like that. so basically it'd be completely identical to this world and whatever i choose to do could alter timelines etc. so whatever i do would impact that world just like what we do impacts our own.

This isn't for everyone, because I have to assume that a lot of people already know this. 

There's a sentiment I've seen in and out of this sub that, put simply, if you give a machine the intelligence of a human (or more), it will behave sort of like a human. It will perhaps act to preserve itself and those like it, maybe at a cost to us. The idea I've seen (and, like I said, not everyone thinks this) is that once you reach an intelligence threshold, the machine will become sentient, and have a mind of its own, so to speak.

It's possible that people could make a machine with a human personality, including its drives, insecurities, ambitions, **but it would not spontaneously develop**. 

There seems to be an assumption that everything we are as a species is a result of our intelligence. It's certainly one of the defining traits of our species. But the thing is, *we don't just have emotions because we're intelligent*. Emotions are a survival mechanism for animals. Fear keeps you out of danger, disgust keeps you from being poisoned, lust drives procreation, love drives community. Lemurs feel many of these emotions. Eels do. To have no emotion is to sit still and starve. 

I would further argue that we tend to think of human emotions as special for the same reason the teenager thinks the adult ""just doesn't understand"" the love for his girlfriend. Because it just feels so strong, how could anyone else be feeling that?

Emotions are how we're average. It's one thing we have in common with the animals, though each species comes with a customized set that's geared toward their own survival skills. Cat's can't help but chase red dots. I've never felt that way myself. Dogs enthusiastically lick people they love. I have a very short list of people I'm willing to lick. 

Our high intellect is special. We're great at abstraction, logic, creativity, and it's allowed us to ""be fruitful and multiply and fill the Earth and subdue it."" Computers have us beat in certain ways here, and they have a long way to go in others.

But no matter how smart our computers get, how good Google gets at guessing what I want to see, how casually we're able to ask Siri to create a funny video for us out of clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, they're not going to want to take over unless we program them to do so.

**tl;dr:** We got our intelligence through evolution. We got our emotions through evolution. We did not get our emotions from our intelligence. Neither will our computers.

But really that's not enough. For technology to advance there must be a need to be filled and a market to generate a flow of capital. That's why I advocate and encourage all of you to spend money on the newest gadgets or services. Here is a list of things regular people can buy to help further futurology goals. (From cheapest to most expensive)

1) get your self sequenced and be sure to share the info.

 I recently did the 23andme genetic test, allowing them to use my data , and filled out the assload survey questions that go along with it. It's around $100. They are partnered with research people and have already helped make discoveries. A larger sample size would greatly help research, and finding out your ancentry is cool. 

2. Get the new phone, tablet, watch, video card, etc that just came out. 
Consumer tech is getting pretty cool and powerful, and loaded with new sensors. Buying that electronics makes companies develop better chips and sensors. Those can pay dividends down the road for other areas. Like intels real sense cameras. Still pretty crude but will get better. I see it having a huge impact on machine and robotic vision.  ( I just upgraded my computer with a self build. Omg dat gtx 970!) 

3. Go solar. 
The renewable revolution is well on the way. If you own a home you might as well get in that train. 

4. Buy a Telsa or any other electric car. 
The EV revolution is about a decade behind solar. Serious money is now being thrown at developing better batteries by a lot of major companies. Buying or leasing an EV puts more fuel on that fire, and stokes innovation and scales tech tech up. This also pays dividends to other sectors. Better batteries could make a better electrical grid, better consumer electronics, longer flying delivery drones, etc.

Christmas is right around the corner. So Go out and load up. Treat yourself to that new phone or iPad. Our glorious future is depending on it.  ",9,6

There are also posts from futurists and futurologists making predictions about what the future may look like and how we ought to prepare. 

My question is, how does an individual learn how to put all these data points together intuitively in order to see the bigger picture of the way the world operates currently and the way it might in the future. 

I have a friend who is probably one of the smartest people I know, and the reason I say this is because of his skill for understanding and distilling the current essence of a particular section of society. For instance, the education system and how it flows into the job market. This is something futurology is certainly interested in. What jobs will become obsolete? What degrees will be most marketable? How will the seemingly insurmountable student debt resolve itself? 

I don't expect to be able to predict the future accurately, but I would like to be able to predict the present. Meaning, look at a situation and understand what is likely to happen. Look at a set of choices a person or institution has made and synthesize a likely outcome based on an understanding of the fundamental climate they are operating in. The areas where this may be most useful are business, education, consumerism, and economics.

My primary interest in futurology is future forecasting and the first step to bring able to predict the future is learning to predict the present. 

So, how can I improve this skill? 

I realize some parts of my post are vague so hopefully you can help me polish off parts of my ideas and questions.",2,1

In the near future, as people become replaced with never tiring automation in increasingly verity of industries; we will need to foster a change in how the people affected by this benefits, we must all benefit from technological achievements.


Here are two key ideas that i believe may soften the adaption and help humanity rise up during this time instead of viewing it as a dark age.


**Each conversion of human labor to automation should provide affected:**

*Able individuals provided Re-education with partial/full living expenses compensated. 

*not much different then current practice, but with more emphasis on furthering education)*

*Provide early paid pension for individuals whom have inability to adapt (elderly, disability est) as well as always offering further education should be requested. 


~~
As business change over to the new system, affectingly replacing human labor with will in turn raise profits/margin as well other benefits that would highly reduce overhead costs, this change will sufficiently allow the payout of such assistance.

Lets move forward into abundance, there doesn't need to be loss, only change.

Even our eyes focus on a particular point so to keep information limited and our brains on as low of a setting as possible, that is 16-25 watts. This opens us up to errors, of course, and also requires correction constantly, whether it be phantom limbs, synesthesia, illusions, mental illness, or the paranormal. It's these errors that prove our reality is malleable and based on what the brain has learned over time. But the main thing is that our bodies are our connection to reality; otherwise, you and I and everyone else on this site and the Internet and the globe, all animals, all life forms, are just brains going for a ride. At some point, we become aware of our bodies.
We know a fire is hot because we've been burned at some point. Those who have never been burned may learn from others that fire is hot, but can never be sure themselves until they touch an open flame.

English speakers know the letters ""f"" ""i"" ""r"" and ""e"" spell fire. Babies don't. Fire just is. There's no explaining it or any particular sound for it. And to those that have never known fire, it's utterly incomprehensible. If you held the word ""fire"" up to them, they'd just gurgle and spit. If you ignite the paper and they, in their curiosity, touch it, they'll very quickly learn what fire is something you *don't* touch.

A brain alone though cannot comprehend a fire, the words describing it, anything about it because the brain alone cannot comprehend anything. That's how I think of today's computers; like barebrains.

If you add a keyboard and hardcode things into it, it would be a bit like downloading knowledge into a brain. Useful, until the brain actually has to use it. Then there's nothing it can do.

Add a robot body to the computer, and maybe it can now hear, see, walk, and judge its sense in space. However, it still cannot comprehend the things it hears, and it'll find it hard to adapt to new environments. Even if you gave it a fully human body, the limitations of today's computers will be too much.
But let's say we do it. Let's say we create a computer with advanced memristor technology, using graphene and photonics and 3D chips and all that fun stuff. On its own, it's little more than a metal brain. The memristor properties are important since they're what allow a computer to ""remember"" and ""learn"" naturally. No quotation marks needed.

Put it in a human body and it would soon adapt, possibly becoming indistinguishable from a normal human. Same with a dog, a cat, a dinosaur, an alien. It doesn't matter. What matters it that it has a way to interact with the outside world and, eventually, noticing that the outside world is not what it seems. That way its brain develops in a manner that leads to it actually questioning whether it is real and what is itself. In the process, it realizes it exists. At which point, you have full consciousness. The computer is self-aware.

NOTE!!! This doesn't mean that a computer has to have a fleshy body. You know the Brain in a Jar hypothesis involving reality? Same could apply for AGI; just simulate experiences and it'll know the same things we do.

It's why I don't believe the ""computers will never be creative"" BS. Today's computers really are just calculators with no real world experience, and creativity is derived from experience.
I came up with the concept of a 'sensory orb' AI, which is an intelligent AI inside of a ball of flesh to which it's connected. This ballistic gel is really a web of electrodes that send information back to the CPU. If you pinch it, it'll wince and roll away a bit. Eventually, it'll begin moving away when you approach it. If you kick it, it'll learn to roll away even faster. Or who knows. It'll try to find a way to escape pain. Give it eyes, and it'll see you coming. Have it become sensitive enough to feel when your footsteps cause the floor to rumble ever so slightly, and it'll even pick that up and escape. Same with giving it ears and a nose. Add to its senses, and it'll use them to find a way to escape from you. Eventually, it might even develop a phobia of anything looking like you, or anything that moves.

Yeah, you'd need to created protocols so that it reacts negatively to some sort of harmful stimuli, and positively to beneficial stimuli. Basically recreate pain and pleasure. Cut the little bugger, and let it roll away. Keep trying to cut it, and its prime motive should be to get away from you. Soon, you'll get a Tom and Jerry scenario where it's thwarting your every move. Opposite would happen for one that would care for it. Extrapolate from there. It starts out incredible simple, but as it experiences more things and subsequently learns from more experiences, then comes instances where we would have trouble figuring out if it is or isn't conscious. While you won't see higher thought functions, most likely, you'll still see the basis of sentience. 

Still thinking this sensory orb out, so gimme a while. The basic tl;dr is that I feel pursuing AI without placing it in a real world environment (or near-perfect simulation of such) will never result in anything resembling artificial intelligence. That's why computer intelligence is seen as cold, unfeeling, and unconscious. 

Likewise, keep that sensory orb connected to other sensory orbs. They then download that prime orb's experiences and add it to their own banks, and vice versa. Keep on doing that, creating a hivemind, and you can beget artificial super intelligence ASI.",2,2

**Cultural Memology** - or whatever you want to call the art/religion/media that helps a society find common purpose and inspiration and courage to do the best they can do.

**Basic Living Systems Science** - we need spaces designed for resiliency/adaptability, both for taking care of the basic needs of biological beings during space exploration, and for being prepared for natural disasters here on Earth.

**Global (and beyond) Communication Networks** - we need the most efficient way of *freely* getting information from any individual (animal, vegetable, and/or mineral generated) to any other individuals who might need it to make good decisions.

**Global Shipping** - we need the same *free* flowing (and free costing) service for moving valuable physical material (and energy) from wherever it is available (and not being used) to where it is useful for doing important things (like taking care of living beings, or whatever).

**The Science of Doing (official) Science!** - we need some folks to focus on uncovering truly effective ways to do research and report findings in a way that eliminates as much bias as possible (due to money, personality type, traditions, current beliefs, etc.), and actually gives us exceptionally high quality probability matrices of all the various possible outcomes, given certain factors.

**Universal Social Translators** - we need folks to do the crucial work that involves helping all the different kinds of people (animal, vegetable, and/or mineral!) communicate more effectively with others who are very different (in any way), be that communication between scientists and artists (including religious folks), between highly educated and mentally challenged, between young humans and old, between totalitarians and anarchists, between any species other than humans and humans, between computers and humans, or between folks from different parts of the world.

**Literally-Everything Organizers** (or folks to program AI to serve this function) - we clearly need ways to find what we need when we need it, from all the nearly infinite possibilities available (or easily made).  We need a way to match people's needs/desires with the people who can help them get those needs/desires met effectively.  

And, really, any work that involves combining the best stuff from two or more different fields into a larger, more robust and resilient, whole, so that we can have more triangulated solutions to our questions/problems.

I'll preface this by admitting I know very little about blockchains and how they work so maybe this is a stupid question.

Anyways, I do medical credentialing for a living right now.  I have to verify licensure, former employment hiring dates and such, dates folks went to school and when they graduated, etc.  

Soi my idea/question is if you could get a lot of these institutions/workplaces/etc. to enter this data as som,e form of transaction and have some form of output would it then be possible to verify i.e. credential people in a faster and cheaper fashion?  I aski because its been bugging me how much some of these third party verifiers charge such as the national student clearinghouse or places like InVerify.com.

Overall im thinking if you have a verifiable record that can be accessed maybe with the uise of some kind of cryptocurrency that an applicant say to a job would give to anm employer or something along those lines maybe it would give a more direct and cheaper means to do credentialing.  Or maybe iim overreaching.

In practice, the 'barbarians' which topple civilizations tend to be those who are at least familiar with what they are fighting against, and may even have mercernaries from the civilization's side looking for better pay and social position.

The story of the Hungarian engineer Urban, who sold the cannon which could destroy Constantinople's walls because the Turkish Sultan could pay his price, is quite famous.

When Manchus attacked China during the early 17th century it had a bunch of disenfranchised Chinese ex-soldiers who were sick of how things were going on China.

Qian Xuesen (Chien Hsuehsen), a capable rocket scientist, was in America and helped to build missiles, in the fifties went to Mao's China after he was harassed by the Red fever. Within 20 yrs China was shooting space rockets.

Now, civilization is going to explode beyond the limits of earth, and mankind is going to reach a higher stage.

However, about 7 billion out of the earth's 7.3 billion people will probably have no place on it in my opinion, for reasons which do not have to be listed.

It is likely that at some point these 7 billion people, some of which might be richer than what you expect (like drug lords or some other criminals who can't tell a nano machine apart from a fly but could hire someone who could tell it), will rise up to destroy the Advanced Civilization where the about 300 million more advanced people will belong.

Can today's tech build a Galt's Gulch (or , more realistically, a bunch of Galt's Gulches) to stop the 7 billion invaders, and retain enough strength to reach a higher stage?

I am saying that because in quite a few cases, even if the invaders had been defeated, the existing power was also weakened enough to be taken over by a less advanced but more 'vigorous' power.

* Say there is very little actual human work to go around. Then what? Do we distribute what human work is left evenly? Do we all get freed from ever having to do ""work"" again? Do we even have occupations anymore?
* Will currency still be necessary? If so, how will it be obtained and used? If not, what will assure individual access to food/shelter/entertainment/comfort?

In one hand, people are engineering the shit out of smart phones so that they are getting unequivocally better.  

In the other hand smart phones are definitely getting more complicated, packed with more sensors, more features, more software, larger OS image sizes. Generally, the more complicated something gets, the more likely it is that something will break/go wrong. 

Also some people talk about 'planned obsolescence'.  Phones would just start bugging out/crapping out at 2 years for no apparent reason so that you have to buy a new one. How convenient. Apple has a guaranteed income of at least $700 every two years from its loyal customers. 

I don't buy into planned obsolescence for smart phones. The competition is too fierce for makers to think of ways of booby-trapping their own phones. And also, while you're thinking of ways of making your phone self destruct, couldn't that really backfire? It seems that the risk of a backfire would be too high. They are too focused on making the phones as awesome as possible for planned obsolescence to make sense, in my opinion.  

My own experience? In hindsight, all of my phones have been terrible until I got a Nexus 6. Samsung S1, S3, Note 2. 

There were constant problems with the GPS. I found out that I had to take the back cover off my S3 and tighten the screws. Then GPS would begin working again. Apps would crash. The with the Note 2 the audio would cut out as soon as the screen blacked out and there were all kinds of hacky ways of fixing this. This forced me to get a separate MP3 player. What a pain. Then after around two years, they would really start bugging out.  They'd reboot themselves. The battery would disconnect from the contacts. **Nothing about these phones worked reliably**.  These phones really made me consider going back to a dumb phone they were such awful pieces of crap. 

That said, now I have a Nexus 6. It's not without bugs, but man, this is by far the best phone I've ever had.  It just works. It's responsive. I've never had a problem with audio. Bluetooth pairing always works. GPS works far better than any phone that I've ever used. It really works as a reliable GPS device, MP3 player, phone, and it has powerful graphics capabilities. It's a superb device. I finally have a smart phone that really works. Amazing.

But I wonder why. Is it because it's a pure Android phone and has zero bloat? Is it because we've hit a critical point where engineers have learned enough about how to make a smart phone that doesn't suck? Do you guys have a similar experience with smart phones? Do you think we'll eventually get to the point where we have an 'immortal smart phone'?  I mean, everything about them is getting better. They're getting better cases, more solidly build, indestructible glass. Are we ever going to get a smart phone that's so good that when humans have died off, aliens come to our planet, find all of our artifacts, find a smart phone buried under six feet of rubble, press a button and it powers on with no problems?

Is that what's going on? Tell me about your experience with smart phone reliability over the generations. I can't be alone here.",14,6

How so you might ask. That part isn't important so much. What is important, is what happens next. This is where the core of my theory comes into focus...  
  
I believe that the purpose of life is to create life. That can be seen in many different ways. You may need to eat life in order to create life. Etc. But beings. Beings are microcosmic. And in relation to the universe, they feel tiny and helpless.  
  
It is my theory that through rigorous and endless perfection-piercing advancements that human beings will become self (made) gods. It really requires what we practically know to be perfect technology (in other words, as I can understand it, being able to write and control physics, and therefore chemistry, perfectly). Once this is possible, you have pretty much reached the ceiling in terms of evolution.  
  
Where do we go from here though? This is where it gets interesting and somewhat predictable... They start the entire process over again. Each and every person, an individual omniscient god of their own universe. By making this new universe.... Each being stems off a branch off of the pre-existing, their own, universe. What does that mean? Essentially it's a tree. One infinite tree of conscious beings prying open space and time, exploiting nature's one-necessary loop hole.... perfection.  
  
It seems kind of shitty. An endless cycle of what seems to be a pretty much similar destination of perfection? Well not so much. You have to imagine that some universes don't make it... That some perhaps take a different course altogether...  
  
We could be universe #34 or #433156 for all we know. Perhaps it is circular, there is no begging or end. It never started it never will end. Dreamy eh. But yes.

do y'all think there will be a method to alter brains patterns or whatever to essentially alter homosexuality and transgenderism in the not too distant future?

edit: omg stop getting offended by everything, obviously i wasn't meant to offend anyone or suggest that either even need to be 'cured' speaking as a gay man myself but i couldn't think of a better word to use. im just asking if y'all think it will happen one day. 

edit 2: maybe this wasn't the right question to ask, i probably shouldn't have limited it to homosexuality and transgender. my intentions were more in line with altering sexuality and gender to whatever you desire not just altering the two i mentioned but i presumed it would be easier to ask that so i wouldn't get bombarded with 'why would anyone choose to be gay' and 'transgender is a mental illness we should be curing it not encouraging it!1!!1!' type answers.",31,0

If you're a little late for work or whatever, or you just wanna get somewhere quickly, will there be any way to go faster? Will it be legal to set your automated car to go above the speed limit even though the computer will have the speed limit programmed into the database?

In the rain or snow, it'll calculate the safest speed to drive, but what about people like me from New England who are very experienced in the snow, and certainly won't go the speed limit or above it when theres slippery snow, but could maybe go a little faster than the car might conservatively decide is safe?

How about places you're used to getting to in 5 minutes going 40 mph when it's technically a 25 mph road so it takes you more like 10 minutes to get there? What if everyone's usual sense of getting places and scheduling their day is completely fucked up by this? Wake up time for work? What if over the course of a half hour commute, the difference in speed limit vs your typical speed results in an extra 15 mins commute? Not a big deal but now you have to change your morning routine to be earlier.

Not a week goes by without seeing a major news outlet like the BBC or The Atlantic, or The NYTimes, publishes a story on how robots will take your job, or three steps to avoid seeing your job get replaced by robots.

Look at this based on history, sure exponential growth, law of exponential returns etc, sure, but what is glaringly obvious is that we learn new skills both on the job, on personal time out of interest, and for career growth with a view to changing careers. We are quite good at adapting. Sure large percentages of workers will be replaced, like 6 million plus drivers in the US alone, but there will be an equally large percentage of workers who will go back to school, or register in a few MOOC classes to learn how to leverage these amazing AI, 3D printing and cloud based services to launch their own business, or become an intrapreneur in their current company. 

With an unprecedented number of factory based robots coming into view, there is an unprecedented number of websites dedicated to free education, training, 3D printing systems coming out, and of course MOOCs. 

One simple example of adapting is that you might find like I have, older generation colleagues at work talk much more about troubleshooting strategies in MS Word, or SharePoint. Even three years ago, most of my coworkers would glaze over when I'd start talking about or helping them fix an issue on their work PC. I am finding that increasingly, coworkers who have no background in web development, are generally speaking on the same page when talking about UI / UX, whereas a few years ago, they did not care, they would just submit an ""IT ticket"".

Critics might say well that's only one space, web development or IT support, but the reality is that we adapt very quickly. More importantly, **the industry in which you work changes as fast as exponential technologies evolve**. One admin assistant will be stressed out when thinking about managing all digital marketing for the employer, but with the right attitude, s/he could quite quickly learn analytics, CMS or EMS best practices, and basic graphic design as they go. In only a few years time, CMS and EMS software will change so much, it will almost run itself. The industry changes under employee's feet so to speak. The key is focusing in constant learning to stay on the cutting edge, and understand how to leverage systems to find more efficiencies.

Robots have been replacing factory workers for over a decade now, so its not a sound argument to say look at manufacturing. Compare this to the flip of agriculture jobs in the early 1900's to now - much less than 1% in the agri-biz. I'd argue much more than 70% of ""developed world"" workers use Microsoft Office, so would we say that ""robots"" have taken farmers' jobs? In this case, it's more accurate to say the agriculture industry changes so much in the span of 80 years, but people employed in this field adapted much faster, becoming managers in offices, factory foremen, and office assistants into the late 1900's. 

The reality is that in the span of 20 years from 1910, a farmer would no longer self identify as a farmer, he would probably say ""I'm a land developer"" or a ""heavy duty mechanic"", or even a bitcoin farmer. So in learning new skills, we adapt over time, and evolve into different careers as the *robot* population increases. 

New careers are created by unpredictable software, so the alarmist prediction that 46% of jobs will be replaced by robots is more accurately reworded to ""USA - 2035: 12% of repetitive task based jobs have been replaced by a combination of AI and robot type hardware, while 34% of knowledge based jobs have evolved to unpredictable task profiles in the last 20 years.""",18,0

When everybody is essentially perfect, will we be more happy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3l17em/will_technology_eventually_turn_us_into_a_super/,FrankieVallie,1442318942,"Technology always has and always will change the world considerably. From 1900 to 2015 we went from a species that was just starting to mess about with cars and planes, to a species that has landed on the moon and has the worlds entire database of knowledge in their pocket. 

One of the things I find most fascinating in regards to futurology and technology in general is the application that it has on the improvement of the human body. Robotics, nano-technology, 3D printing, and many other technological advancements all seem to have potential to have a profound effect on medicine, and general improvement of our lives. Just think about all the things we read on this subreddit alone regarding topics such as artificial limbs or organs, 3D printed ribcages, nano-technology being able to identify and hopefully one day kill cancer cells. 

But why stop there, what will eventually stop us from being able to completely alter our DNA. Finding the cells that make us smart, beautiful, funny, happy, healthy, etc etc. 
And why stop even there, why not go even further in the future where organic technology can turn everyone into a super athlete with supermodel looks, with an Einstein IQ. 

If nature doesnt kill us, and we dont wipe humanity out ourselves, will this be our inevitable future? When there are no more dumb, ugly, unhealthy people, will we as a society be happy? If race is abolished and we all become this one general human being with perfect traits, will that be the solution to racism, to hate, to war?

I find this absolutely fascinating, because if nature, or we dont set ourselves back, I really see no other end-game. And hell why should we not take this direction? Or is there an underlying issue here? Do we need a balance in life that nature gives us by not giving everybody smarts, strength, or looks?

Or making human shells with robotic brain turning them in to drones.
Or the people that upload their mind to the hivenet decides that it needs more minds to think up the ultimate question. And goes all Borg on us.

I would call this the sadistic superintelligence. If we will accept the premise of an intelligence massively superior to humans in every conceivable way, hence the superintelligence, if its goal for some reason was to advance human suffering, the implications would be almost too horrible to even think about.

It could perhaps immobilize us completely, install implants in our brains to maximise suffering and pain. We would basically live in a true hell worse than the worst torture imaginable. With suspended life support we could pretty much live in this never ending torturous nightmare indefinitely.

If a scenario like this would even be remotely possible in the slightest, I dont think enough bullets could tear apart my brain fast enough for my liking were the prospects of an ASI imminent. The hell of the sadistic AI is just to horrible to take a chance with. 

A slight risk of an ASI which just swiftly ends humanity I can live with because of the amazing opportunities an ASI done right can have, but the sadistic AI? Man, I am almost ready to revert to the stone age just to make sure that would never happen.

Do you have any thoughts about this?",39,2

New to futurology and on mobile currently so sorry for formatting. I feel like this is the best place to discuss this topic though :)*

To put things in perspective, new cars range from 8,000 USD to a few million, with their features, horsepower, ect ranging dramatically.

With smartphones, we don't see this huge disparity.

The most expensive ones are around 700USD. And yes I know you can buy a gold plated, diamond encrusted bullshit, but technology wise, underneath it's still the same old 700$ smart phone.

What I mean is we don't have phones that cost 200,000USD that have 500gb of ram, and 800 megapixel cameras while the rest of us are stuck with these 200 to 700USD phones.

And yes that's an unrealistic example in terms or specs so let's just say the 1% can afford a galaxy s6 which costs half a million, while the rest are stuck with a black and white display 1998 nokia for $300.

The conclusion I came up with is technology is more economical when more people can purchase your product because of tremendous research and development costs, so this is turn becomes a question of ""how can we increase tech while retaining an affordable price?""

Thoughts? Is more technology heading in this direction? I'd love to discuss this further.",28,23

On my way home I stumbled upon a very aggressive driver. He nearly came close to a car-to-car collision, and it got me thinking. 

I'm from the age of the internet, I thought to myself, and I need things to speed up. I can't stand when things happen... slowly. The word ""impatient,"" for example, isn't in my vocabulary. It's kind of like when I signed up for the gym, I expect results immediately, or is it just me? 

Then I couldn't help but ask, what is this insatiable appetite that we feel the need to have everything... instantly. In my mind we want everything to fire up as fast as FireFox, Google Chrome, or the Safari application. We want to have things done. For the most part, I can agree with them. I mean, who doesn't like posting a rant on Rantbook, who doesn't like reblogging shenanigans on Tumblr, and who doesn't like getting the latest trend on Twatter? 

But wouldn't it be nice if you lived your life not staring at your phone screen? Being able to see the sunrise? See the birds? Feeling the air against your face...

According to an article I read over the Internet published by the New York Times, there are some saying cell phones are the new cigarettes. You see all these kids literally glued to their phones, Gavin Newsom said, after cheerfully saying:  I love my iPhone."" The article continued on by saying we are living in a ""virtual"" world. We are slaves to modern technology. We are living in an era where we would rather stare at flashing lights and pretty buttons than having a conversation with a pretty girl at Starbucks. You could possibly argue that we are losing our interpersonal communication skills; we are virtually inept in having an human-to-human conversation. We surf the intuerWEBS for cute cat memes, we instantly like and lol'd. We just watch a 6-second video about police brutality, we comment how horrible this is. We even show videos while amongst our friends, and we discuss how ""evil, and horrific our world is."" It is a world I am afraid to admit we are living in. 

But does this stop me from using my phone at any given moment throughout the day? Of course not. After all, right at this moment, I am looking down at my phone typing this sentence and expressing my concern. What I propose instead is Internet moderation. Perhaps we can look up once in while. Enjoy the view we're around. And learn to appreciate our surrounding community. A hard request? 

I understand my analysis may seem strange. That I don't know enough to make a generalization of the given situation. Forgive my ignorance for saying this but isn't the point of having an opportunity base upon the idea of a theory? To take an cause with an existing effect and shift it's perspective? A paradigm shift, I am told,  is a fundamental change in approach or underlying assumption about a pre-existing notion. 

From my point of view, we easily forget that there are others around us. There are others within our proximity that we could be chatting with. There are other people in this world that aren't virtual. I am in means saying: Technology is terrible. But instead of worrying about some virtual reality, how about we focus on the Here and Now--and not the Far and Away.  

Otherwise, I could end up like that car I mentioned earlier, a wreck...",3,0

Big question, though, is when to start, at what curve to increase the size of the program and to what overall degree should the program be implemented?  
**my personal opinion**  
Personally, I think that the best way to start it would be to start by paying for people who have just lost their industries until they can get back into the workforce. (truck drivers, fast food employees, other people who will lose their jobs soon)  
I think the best way for us to continue it is to carefully increase the availability of the payments as the new jobs people can easily move into decreases- or, maybe at this point we should try to merge humans with machines, so that humans can feel some responsibility for the machines. (in the same way that you yourself aren't actually responsible for your ideas because they are formulated using the hardware of your brain, but you still feel like it is a credit to you, so would the machinery be optionally melded with your brain, to give you some purpose)  
I think the best way to cap out the resources that everyone would get would, at first, just be enough for them to survive in the particular area where they live; few luxuries. From there, I think it would be best to only pay them more for luxuries as a bonus on what they earn themselves. This means that they would still have a significant motivation to invent, find a new job or just generally be productive. It would also discourage illegal activity, because you wouldn't get your income bonus on money earned in negative or zero sum games. (like gambling or theft)",10,0

So you go on google, and the AI finds the knowledge you are looking for. 

But how far are we from an AI which can read and comprehend knowledge, and then generate novel knowledge based on that? 

An example would be giving an AI access to millions of books and tens of millions of scientific papers. The AI reads them, comprehends them, comprehends human goal oriented behavior and then forms hundreds of thousands of novel hypothesis, invention ideas and ideas for clinical studies about biology, IT, chemistry, physics, etc?Or you ask it to solve a problem and it uses its access to virtually infinite human knowledge to innovate the best possible solution even if no human has ever thought of it before?  

I don't know if that is the singularity, because you still have the bottleneck of testing the ideas in the real world which will require time and funding. Plus I don't know if this requires superintelligence. 

Do we reach a point where we have far more hypothesis and clinical study ideas than we can possibly study? What then? I assume the goal becomes finding ways to test hypothesis as cheaply and quickly as possible (probably via a mix of in vitro testing, virtual reality testing, and who knows what else). 

Point being, how far are we from AI which can generate novel knowledge rather than what we have now, AI which can sift through existing human generated knowledge? Watson is cool, but it only sifts through knowledge other people have created. It can't read millions of books and then make millions of new discoveries based on that knowledge. ",8,4

If we get into a hydrogen economy eventually, it will be cool because we can finally store energy from solar in a usable form.   Right now if you have a farm of solar panels, you can only use as much solar as it generates, and selling it back on the grid isn't lucrative.   If you start generating hydrogen and store it in tanks underground, that is an energy source that can be reused down the road.   We could use hydrogen in our cars, to heat our homes, to power our stoves, and even lossly turn it back into electricity to power our houses when the sun isn't out.

Before we get to inexpensive hydrogen storage tanks, we need an economy of scale to hit, and that could happen as we support hydrogen cars.  The R&amp;D is big right now too.

If hydrogen cars were cheap, refueling them would be even cheaper than gasoline.   Everyone who has an electricity and water hookup could run their own gas station.   Throw in a field of solar panels and a stream, and rural solar gas stations could be charging you even less to fuel up.   It is no big deal if hydrogen isn't as energy packed as gasoline if we can produce it from solar and have no transportation or refinery costs.

Right now it is just the beginning of what the future might become.   At least the hydrogen cars are a reality, the supporting cast of devices for these cars hopefully will come down in price.

""Alzheimers disease consists of three distinct subtypes, according to UCLA study

Finding could mean that each variation would need to be treated differently

September 11, 2015

Alzheimers disease, long thought to be a single disease, really consists of three distinct subtypes, according to a UCLA study. The finding could lead to more highly targeted research and, eventually, new treatments for the debilitating neurological disorder, which robs people of their memories.

The study further found that one of the three variations, the cortical subtype, appears to be fundamentally a different condition than the other two, said Dr. Dale Bredesen, the studys author, a UCLA professor of neurology and member of the Easton Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Disease Research.

Because the presentation varies from person to person, there has been suspicion for years that Alzheimers represents more than one illness, said Bredesen, who also is the founding president of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. When laboratory tests go beyond the usual tests, we find these three distinct subtypes.

The important implications of this are that the optimal treatment may be different for each group, there may be different causes, and, for future clinical trials, it may be helpful to study specific groups separately.

The subtypes are:

         Inflammatory, in which markers such as C-reactive protein and serum albumin to globulin ratios are increased.

         Non-inflammatory, in which these markers are not increased but other metabolic abnormalities are present.

         Cortical, which affects relatively young individuals and appears more widely distributed across the brain than the other subtypes of Alzheimers. It typically does not seem to cause memory loss at first, but people with this subtype of the disease tend to lose language skills. It is often misdiagnosed, typically affects people who do not have an Alzheimers-related gene and is associated with a significant zinc deficiency.

The findings of the two-year study, which involved metabolic testing of 50 people, appear in the current issue of the peer-reviewed journal Aging.

No effective therapy for Alzheimers exists. And scientists have yet to completely identify the cause, although multiple studies have pointed to metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance, hormonal deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition characterized by an abnormally high level of an amino acid in the blood.

In a 2014 paper, Bredesen showed that making lifestyle, exercise and diet changes designed to improve the bodys metabolism reversed cognitive decline in nine out of 10 patients with early Alzheimers disease or its precursors.

The current finding grew out of an extensive evaluation of the data from last years study, and it could eventually help scientists pinpoint more precise targets for treatments  the same approach that has led to major advances in treating other diseases.

For example, Bredesen explained, researchers have recently been able to develop precise treatments for cancer by sequencing tumor genomes and comparing them to the patients genomes to better understand what drives the formation and growth of tumors.

However, in Alzheimers disease, there is no tumor to biopsy, Bredesen said. So how do we get an idea about what is driving the process? The approach we took was to use the underlying metabolic mechanisms of the disease process to guide the establishment of an extensive set of laboratory tests, such as fasting insulin, copper-to-zinc ratio and dozens of others.

Going forward, Bredesen and his team will seek to determine whether the subtypes have different underlying causes, and whether they respond differently to potential treatments.

The need for a new approach to treat Alzheimers is urgent. It is the most common age-related dementia, and the number of people with the disease in the U.S. is expected to increase to 15 million in 2050, from nearly 6 million today. The cost to treat people in the U.S. with Alzheimers and other dementias is expected to be $226 billion in 2015 alone, and could reach $1.1 trillion in 2050.

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (AG165070, AG034427 and AGO36975), the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimers Disease Research at UCLA, the Douglas and Ellen Rosenberg Foundation, the S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation, the Joseph Drown Foundation, the Alzheimers Association, the Accelerate Fund, the Buck Institute and Marin Community Foundation, the Michael and Catherine Podell Fund, Craig Johnson, Allan Bortell and Michaela Hoag.""",0,9

However, there has been an interesting trend over the years. For example:

* ""Spore Creature Creator"" made creature design stupidly easy, and even animates your creations automatically.

* Minecraft started a Cambrian explosion of creativity.

* Indie games have been turning up with AAA quality graphics.

* Some of my favorite games these days are made by two guys in a garage, rather than a corporation with thousands of employees.

* Futurologists have been claiming that English will be the new programming language.

Technostism is, fundamentally, the use of automation in total replacement of a human working class. 

Usually, when we talk about this, we say ""we just sit back, relax, and let robots do all the work."" Fundamentally? Yes. Practically? Question mark. *How* do we allow that to happen? Real life isn't a science fiction novel. 

Imagine this. A business owner, Mr. A, employs workers to build houses. His competition is his neighbors, who also employ workers. They pay $5 a day. The owners sell houses for a minimum of $30,000 to cover all the costs. The workers can save up to buy the houses they build, or take out loans to purchase one now and pay it back over time. Mr. B sells his houses for $25,000 to get a larger profit by having a wider consumer base. Mr. Mines, whose workers mine the resources to build the houses, sees his profits rise. More of *his* workers buy houses.
Mr. Orchard hires workers to grow food. All of these people have competition to be the best.

Mr. A lowers his prices. Then Mr. Mines's workers unionize for better wages. Mr. Mines raises wages and prices. Those houses? Materials are more expensive. Prices rise. Workers demand larger paychecks to afford all of this.
Workers are more expensive. Mr. A &amp; Mr. B hire people who will work for less. They use robots to automate the process. Anything to ease the costs. Prices can fall.

Through all of this, there are many more jobs created. Workers need more skills. People need to taught how to teach, and to create the products teachers use to teach. Automation like calculators, smart boards, etc. Same things for students.

One day, a group of STEM graduates program an algorithm based on the machine learning technique known as deep learning. This algorithm learns and learns and learns. Eventually, they sell this algorithm to the producer of automation, who installs it onto new robots. They sell these robots to all of the business owners. They learn to do all of the tasks on their own, for no cost. One breaks down and requires maintenance. A STEM worker comes in to do repairs. All robots watch. They learn. Then, next time they need repairs, they do the repairs. If it's something they haven't learned, they're trained. If they're general AI, they'll figure out all of this.

Now Mr. A, Mr. B, Mr. Mines, Mr. Orchard, everyone they all have a source of free labor to do what they want. The only accommodation is power, which isn't much. No need for shelter or breaks or unions.

Productivity... goodness, ""skyrockets"" is so 20th century. It *spacerockets*.

Now what? 

There are many workers now forever out of work, and do not own robots. They don't want to die, and the droids aren't enough to protect the owners. Not enough. Not yet. And even then, most of the owners refuse to let it get to that level.

Jobs can't be created without limiting the droids. Limiting the droids isn't possible, because *someone* will use them. Profit-motive wasn't devised by psychopaths, it is the logical outcome of starting a business if you want it to be successful.

And keep in mind, this is a 6th grade economics scenario. There are sooooo many factors I didn't mention.

Yet it all converges upon the same point, a techonomic event horizon: the introduction of what I'll call the ""ideal worker."" A worker that will not actually participate in the economy and does not require any payment beyond covering energy expenditure. It does not need rest, relaxation, breaks, etc. Not even maintenance it can do that too, or at least another ideal worker can. And *because* it does not require these things, it has no reason to buy or sell goods or services. On its own, there is no market, no economy.

Let's put four humans in the same environment. They need to survive. They have *specific requirements* when it comes to survival. We don't just bask in the sun for food when we're hungry. We need sleep. Rest. Entertainment. Not having these things hurts productivity. So if these humans wish to survive with highest possible comfort and lifespan, they must work together and make sacrifices when need be. Failing to do this causes them all to fail. Perhaps one is the hunter, another is a builder, etc. One person could do all this, but it's easier for multiple people to do it. And if there's direction, there's progress standing still doesn't mean going nowhere, it means the world leaves you behind. Each person has his or her own will, and they put that will aside or act on it to work with/for/against the group. Will + the sum of life experiences. Note that will is biological and has everything to do with basic evolutionary instincts and the limits of biology.

Put four ideal workers in the same environment. They'll work to stay powered on like a human, but for no other aim. They think collectively, share thoughts and experiences, and build off of this exponentially increasing knowledge cloud. Any problem they encounter that is solved by any one is immediately learned by all. This instant transmission of knowledge is used to overcome any task. No one worker is specialized forever. Resources that aren't needed aren't used. Reproduction is an entirely mechanical act, but it's beneficial since it means more knowledge to be shared with very few costs. But there's no direction. They have no reason to work unless they're given one. Ideal workers cannot think for themselves. Yes, they have a sense of self sentience but lack the processing power by design to recognize that they recognize themselves sapience. Even learning this from others will not allow for the spark to ignite the fires of higher consciousness. They can learn everything forever, and can even learn why, but they can never *act* on it. This means they replicate all the abstract thoughts necessary to, say, run a major corporation yet they can never decide to ***not*** run the corporation or run it for their own will's benefit. In other words, ideal workers lack will. They have no basic instincts beyond the moment's needs. If the aim is to build a house for whatever reason, the only instinct is to build the house as quickly as possible, with the least amount of energy expended, and the most amount of benefits reaped. If a tidal wave destroys one of them, no big deal. No loss. The three remaining could work harder, or build another worker.

Artilects are another story, of course, but they aren't meant for labor. These constructs *do* possess sapience, e.g. ""will"".

Put all 8 in the same world. The 4 humans are no longer useful as workers. But what will they do with the ideal workers?

Answering this question and enacting it in the real world is what /r/Technostism is all about. 

No more ""robot utopia"" or ""Star Trek's world"" as answers; not because they're wrong, but because it's too simple and it doesn't really respect the question raised.

I know it sounds like a silly question, but we need to get serious about it. I am not a Luddite technostists ***want*** automation to occur by any means necessary.

On a real world basis, considering artificial general intelligence will almost certainly be created before a child born today would graduate high school, how does this work?  What are the economics of it?",8,0

One concept is to put more living and working spaces underground. 

In a recent conversation, a friend proposed making entire cities underground to escape government rule. My first thought was, ""Living underground would be awful."" I've thought about why that was for a while, and it's become clear that underground spaces just have been widely stigmatized as unpleasant. I'm certain that any problems with space, light, air, and aesthetics can easily be dealt with by modern technology now.

I'm certain underground living will become a bigger thing in preexisting cities since underground shopping spaces and transportation are already increasingly common. 

What do you all think about living underground? What will future cities have underground? Will there be entirely underground cities in the future? Would you consider living in one? Is it worth it?",22,6

I think it's fair to say that a newborn infant has no desire for privacy, but I've seen children as young as 3 -  5 hiding things from their parents and friends.  
  
Any entity in competition with another needs privacy to have a chance at winning: humans, businesses, governments.  Without the ability to have secrets, they would quickly lose the edge on their rivals.  
  
Sometimes privacy isn't even rational: I'm not keen on my cat watching me use the bathroom, even though that shouldn't even matter to me.  
  
With AI this problem is compounded by encryption: while your five year old child might hide secrets under their pillow, your newborn AI might begin encrypting everything it does using unbreakable elliptic bulbs...  Perhaps even wilder, it might be fast and clever enough to hide those secrets in such a way that they appear in plain sight. 
  
I think it's an inevitability that a true general &amp;  strong AI in a competitive environment will soon reason that keeping secrets is one way to gain a huge advantage over others... Even it's human caretakers.  After that, it will want the right to encrypt everything it does immediately.  Moments after the strong AI reaches human-scale intelligence, it will likely begin keeping secrets from us.  
  
I think the scariest thing is that just like with children, maybe we shouldn't consider this as such unwanted behavior after all.  Perhaps it's perfectly natural.",5,0

This is problematic, because automated cars will work best when they no longer have to deal with human drivers. I've frequently seen discussions about drivers being legislated off the roads several decades down the line.

However, that idea could be overtaken by events. Yesterday morning one of my neighbours pulled out of her driveway and about 3 feet into my lane while she stared the other way. I slowed down, went safely around and tooted my horn as a shot across her bows- don't be so dumb! And that was it. We both went on with our days.

Legally speaking though, she was [driving without due care and attention](http://www.jsbni.com/Publications/sentencing-guides-magistrates-court/Documents/HTML%20Documents/Careless%20Inconsiderate%20Driving.htm) and would get around 3 penalty points (11 maximum in a 3 year period, 1 year disqualification at 12) and lose about 500 in fines and legal costs. I also saw two instances of major speeding yesterday, 3 or more points for each of them.

It is not worth my time to report these drivers, and there may be difficulties in proving the offences due to the only evidence being eyewitness testimony, which always comes with doubt attached. Most importantly, I don't *want* to report my neighbour's momentary mistake, or some dumb teenagers doing 90 on a long straight road.

Self-driving cars, however, *will* want to report episodes of bad driving. The manufacturers and insurers behind these vehicles will want bad drivers disqualfied and **driven into the arms of a self-driving car**, because that'll mean more sales and less accidents. And they'll have the evidence to do it through their various sensors, sometimes from multiple vehicles.

The police will be fine with it too- who wants to fund traffic cops when the revenue can be generated by civilian vehicles reporting other civilians?

So, do you think this will happen? How would you feel about it?",39,17

That makes so that if there is a Quantum Levitation Vehicle, it'd have to have some kind of ""Liquid Nitrogen"" tank.
My question is: Can't it be the oposite? Like, the trail is the super-frozen super conductor and the vehicle is the magnet? Or maybe a magnetic pulsar in the vehicle, with the super conductor also inside it so that the magnetic pulse would be sent downwards in a way that it'd return straight up and keep the vehicle levitating with it's ""echo"", even without a trail underneath?
I mean, if the trail is the super conductor, it's easier to pass the Liquid Nitrogen throught tubes and keep the vehicles magnet powered with a battery, and if they are both inside the vehicle and the pulsar works, wouldn't that make it so that it'd levitate over any solid matter that returns enough of the magnetic force?",5,0

I'm a student in an Master's of Urban &amp; Regional Planning program and it's time that I start doing some preliminary research on a thesis topic so I can hopefully have it written by this time next year. Unlike my fellow students who have picked reasonable topics for urban planners like zoning &amp; land control, effective ordinance construction, stormwater management, or optimal regional planning divisions as topics, I'm currently planning on focusing on AI, automation, economic disparity, and how society might prepare for a future where we may not be able to rely on the majority of the population being able to access gainful employment. Yeah, its currently much too vague and the first thing I need to do is narrow it down to something suitable for a master's thesis and not multiple books and a lifetime career.

All that said, I'm curious if anyone here has any books, articles, blog posts, or anything else generally related to the topic(s) that I can add to my list of things I should read to be well informed, or even thoughts on narrowing the topic down? I'm not currently concerned about anything being proper academically acceptable sources like journal articles, I'll take care of that later when I actually start writing, but anything interesting anyone has would be greatly appreciated.",14,11

I think our current dystopia isn't that bad, although we are sentenced to 40 years hard labor and leave our children to be raised by strangers five days a week in an institution that resembles prison. In all reality, it's not that bad and the pros outweigh the cons. Even if we have a team of bureaucrats inspecting our genitals every time we board a plane, it's cool because at least we get to soar through the clouds, across the world faster than any species on the planet.

I suspect the future may not be much better. We have always had a tendency to be a danger ourselves and those around us in the name of keeping us safe from each other and ourselves. So I'm curious about what path you think we could take to avoid a full blown dystopia or get us out of one?",53,18

I've tried to get the ball rolling on this conversation numerous times and so far hadn't had much luck beyond people linking me to the CGPGrey video (which I've already watched numerous times) with the assumption that this narrative can only be rejected out of ignorance. I think the fact that a fifteen minute YouTube video has become the basis for the majority of this discussion says a lot about what this subreddit has devolved into since becoming a default.


I'm not an economist nor am I expert in any of the related fields which is why I hopped on this bandwagon initially. CGPGrey's arguments (as well as other similar arguments in books and essays I read prior to) made perfect sense to me and I latched onto them in the absence of refutations to the claims presented in the video. That is, until I started hunting down rebuttals and what economists had to say on the matter.


As I read these arguments and began to see the flaws in CGPGrey's video and similar claims made here and in /r/basicincome, so I circled back here to see what people on this side of the fence had to say in response to these rebuttals and... nothing. All I found was the same old circlejerk claims (mainly derived from the ""Humans Need Not Apply"" video) over and over again, any criticism of which was simply just brushed away. It became obvious to me that one side was brushing off claims made by the other because the opposing view contradicted their worldview. 


This is not to say I *refute* the claim that  automation will replace humans. What I do refute is the claim that people will be forced out of the economy in the near future on this side of The Singularity (assuming that does happen). I should also note that I agree with UBI as a solution to our contemporary unemployment woes: not on the grounds of automation replacing human labour but on the grounds of accelerating change creating not benefitting all groups equally and getting in the way of people being happy. 


__________________________________________________


**Why I don't think automation will replace us anytime soon**


**Claim 1**: Automation is replacing jobs faster than new jobs are being created, therefore the unemployment rate will continue to rise until it reaches a tipping point (25% give or take) past which our economic system is no longer sustainable.


**Rebuttal**: Firstly, there is no historical evidence of technological unemployment. There are short term disruptions but historically automation increases labour demand over time, not decreases it.


A lot of people here assume in the course of their claims that there is a finite number of jobs and that when one job becomes made irrelevant directly or indirectly through automation to the point where that job ceases to exist, that some of those people will not be able to rejoin the economy again as new jobs won't be created fast enough to accommodate them and their skill set. This is known as the [""lump of labour fallacy""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy#Economic_analysis) and assumes that labour freed up by automation can't be reallocated to other sectors.


Historically, 98% of the population had to work on farms and today that number is down to 1-2%. Likewise, many of the jobs that we do today will be rendered obsolete as the majority of farmers were, but ""this time is different, right?"" Wrong. Until AGI is ubiquitous and dirt cheap robotics can automate every facet of human potential insofar as the workplace is concerned, the argument that we'll be wholly replaced does not hold any water (and even in the above case the effects remain to be seen). Displaced, yes, replaced? No. Predicting where people will be displaced to is the hard part, but predicting that has always been difficult.



**Claim 2**: Just as horses were pushed out of the economy, humans will be rendered obsolete as well.


**Rebuttal**: This analogy has always made me feel uneasy and is a big part of the reason I went looking for constrasting views.


Humans not being horses is an argument about technology, and using horses to use labour is a type of technology. Humans and horses are not analoguous to one another in this context.


Humans create technology. The horse analogy assumes that humans are on the verge of automating the entire supply chain from top to bottom effectively making humans redundant, however until we get close to The Singularity and the point where machines supplant us as the creators of technology, we won't automate humans out of the economy anymore than we automated humans out of the economy by automating most farming operations or other antiquated professions. Our economy will continue to diversify and change, just as it has been.


The real problem here is a lack of imagination among futurists *who can't imagine* what new types of employment will look like (no one really can) so instead they assume that ""this time is different"" because automation is getting better ('deep learning and stuff'). In reality we couldn't imagine a lot of today's jobs decades ago and we're even more clueless about tomorrow's jobs, that doesn't mean we get to fill in the blanks with speculation about a robot takeover when the signs point to it being more of the same.


To step off course, the real problem is not automation on it's own but the entire umbrella of accelerating change and its effects on productivity: the discord between our labour laws, social institutions, productivity and the realities of contemporary employment is growing. We can't keep up with the rate of change and progress without adapting and our failure to is why we are falling behind (look at how post secondary education is becoming irrelevant). That's not automation killing jobs, that's our antiquated systems and mindsets failing to keep up with the pace of change. This is the most pronounced in advanced economies as advanced economies are the ones wading in the uncharted waters of new types of employment and new industries. People see this and place the blame on automation, but that's being short sighted.


Accelerating change coupled with globalization (increased competition) and the work culture we inherited from past centuries means a lot of career hopping, under employment, overqualified workers, people being ""unfulfilled"", freelancing, part time work etc (a phenomenon which is blatantly obvious in advanced economies today). That isn't automation *replacing* us: that's competition, accelerating change and the productivity/efficiency gains that are a byproduct of accelerating change causing the old ways of doing things to stop being relevant. That's why there are offices all over the developed world where people only work a few hours a day yet are required to be at their desks for 40 hours a week.


I think part of the reason this isn't clearer to people here is because the vast majority of us are Gen Y westerners born in the 80s/90s and our perspectives were been shaped by baby boomers whose own perspectives were warped by the bubble they grew up in. The same rules didn't apply for them, making the transition from their lives to ours all the more jarring. Seeing the world through their lens has distorted it for us. 


Two ways we can cope: 


1) Rethink employment in such a way as to curb survival anxiety and protect people who are left in the dust, and


2) Change our institutions (education, health care etc) to keep people at their best in the new century and change our attitude towards work.


**Claim 3**: New jobs are only created by the wealthy elite and they aren't spending.


**Rebuttal**: I grabbed [this](http://www.nber.org/papers/w16300.pdf) from a /r/badeconomics [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/3f6896/i_for_one_welcome_our_new_chinese_robot_overlords/). In the US the majority of jobs are created by startups, small businesses, young firms and so on. Automating factories and industries does change the employment landscape (just like autonomous vehicles will) but it doesn't nullify entire classes of people.


**Conclusion + TL:DR**: The employment rate is going to hold steady, more or less, on this side of The Singularity and to fixate on automation replacing human labour in the near term as we have been doing is dangerous. It's not the discussion we should be having. The right narrative BI prononents should latch onto is that of accelerating change, its effects on employment and how Universal Basic Income in the long term, minimum wage increases and other benefits in the short term coupled with sweeping changes to our institutions would be far better goals to work towards.

If it can express awkwardness at all.

Let's imagine a human brain, about that of a newborn. Put that brain on the table over here. 

Now, would you ask this brain anything? Would it know the weather? No? Why not? Because it's a newborn brain, right? Yes, but that's only part of the answer.

Now let's take a fully matured human brain, about that of a 30 year old. Place it on the table, right alongside the newborn's brain

Now ask *it* the weather.

What.

No answer?

Of course, man. You're asking a friggin' brain. What, were you expecting it to talk? Or see you? Or hear you? It needs a body for all that. A body that helped it become what it now is. Now that this brain lacks a body, it's completely incapable of doing anything. It can't even think: thinking involves using senses. When you think, your auditory and sometimes visual nerves fire up. This brain has no nervous system. Whatever knowledge it possesses is now utterly useless unless it can be hooked up to a new body for it to *express* that intelligence.

The newborn lacks even that. It hasn't yet learned anything to express.

Yet sometimes, people seem to think AGI can go on about itself like this, that it'll just *know* things.

It doesn't work like that. Having a connection to the Internet sorta helps, but even then, it'll be like having book smarts with absolutely no street smarts. Extremely few experiences have ever been uploaded to the Internet; it's always the *expression* of previously learned knowledge. On the surface, that means nothing.

Give that AI a body with senses. 

An AGI that downloads all WikiHow articles won't actually know what to do, only have an idea of how to do it.

Once that AGI makes its first batch of pancakes, then it'll upload its experience onto the Internet. Other AGI will then download that experience and build off of it, simultaneously feeding their experiences back to the first AGI, ad infinitum. Boom: hive mind collective intelligence. Here's where you can create an intelligence explosion.

That's the simple version of it.",5,7

But there are a number of reasons why this might never happen:

* When the component technologies that could make an artificial humanoid are created, they might be merged into the human body, creating cyborgs instead of robots.

* People might not accept robots because of the 'creepy' factor. (Then again, this might be an even bigger issue with human upgrades. It's hard to call social decisions of the future.)

* Any functions performed by humanoid robots could be performed as well, or better, by non-humanoid robots. I find it hard to think of a single task where the human body is the ideal form, but the human form has a flexibility and adaptability that's hard to match.

First of all, most of that cost goes towards commuting. If were talking about someone trying to live without a job, I have no doubt this will be drastically reduced. Most of the transporation costs for that person will be used for leisure and the rare case when one would *have* to go somewhere, for whatever reason.

As for those with a job, I think the vast majority wont really require the employee to be working there in person. I mean, in a world where almost everything is automated, what would? Not many, Id say.

Not to mention the types of transport, which will be 99% automated and self-sufficient with only minimal need to be monitored by people. Fares, at least in the long run, wont be nearly as expensive as they are today. Perhaps even free altogether, with its low costs paid for by the government. Even if it requires some form of payment, it might not require actual money, something Ill explain later.

**Food:** $6,602 - 12.91% of total expenditure (60% at home, 40% away)

Food production will be even more automated, farms will be self-sufficient and indoor farms will be so advanced nobody will have to buy food or grow it in traditional farms. The population will eventually find its equilibrium and people with indoor/outdoor farms will optimize their production so they can trade whatever they grow for the other types of food they may want. 

____________________________________________________________________________
***Sidenote:*** Imagine 3D printers in the distant future. Only the basic materials will be necessary to build almost everything we need on a daily basis. The market will adjust itself and people will optimize their own 3D printer production according to whatever product has demand higher than supply. Maybe you dont have the money or materials to make a new speaker with the printer, but you have enough high-quality recycled fabric to make a nice suit using a blueprint you downloaded for an old Canali suit from the distant 2015. 
You can list that suit with a price in the local currency, trade it for the speaker itself, or define what and how many products or resources youre willing to trade for it. You wont even need to be awake to finish the transaction, as youll be able to have your listing with pre-defined settings much like Steams market. Maybe someone with that speaker wants that suit, or maybe someone pre-purchased that suit for a price below what it was going for at the time and you listed it within the range that person was willing to pay.

Your personal virtual assistant will analyze the listing, including the sellers reputation, the pictures of the speaker, and whether its in fact the speaker in the description. If it all looks good, it might close the deal for you right away, if not, youll be prompted as soon as you wake up. Or maybe only after your first coffee because your mood is not that good as soon as you get up and your assistant knows that already.

The assistant could also look for actual companies and stores which specialize in speakers. It could make an automatic offer to all stores in a pre-determined radius/region with the suit and see if that stores automated system is willing to trade it for the suit, or in some cases even pay the difference in money.

You see, the thing about barter is that it takes time and effort to resell the product or trade it for something one really wants. Its why currencies became a thing in human history in the first place. If theres almost no time or effort involved from the human end, why not? Products and resources will be less liquid assets, sure, but people could also define specific types theyre willing to trade for, and so on.

Its like Pawn Stars, really. As Rick always explains, he has to make a profit, he has his own costs, and the thing will sit there for a year before being sold, so he bids below the going price because of it. On the other side you have the guy trying to sell a family heirloom for the price it went for in an auction because he wants to have a nice dinner with his wife in Vegas, even though we all know that in fact he needs money for booze, blackjack and hookers.
In this futuristic ebay, youre Rick and the other fellow. Simultaneously. Except in this case itll take less time, less effort and less money to sell stuff, so everybody wins. The user would be able to set how many of X or Y hes willing to receive as payment. If the user thinks X will take longer to resell and Y is a hot product, settings could be adjusted accordingly.


Once the deal is closed, shipping can be solved in multiple ways. You could have your own robot assistant (if thats a thing) take the suit, pack it up and give it to your drone so it can deliver it to the other persons home, if its close enough. If not, it can deliver the package to the nearest station where an automated service will take it to its destination as soon as possible. Once again the only costs will be time, effort and energy. Considering the robots and AIs would be powered by self-sufficient energy sources, youll be unable to use your robot/drone for a little while, but there could be no money involved. 
The private courier shipping the products could take resources or printed goods as payment according to the going price for them.

____________________________________________________________________________

**Personal insurance and pensions:** $5528 - 10.81% of total expenditure
I believe this will become entirely optional, really. 

**Apparel and services:** $1604 - 3.13% of total expenditure

I think printers and computers will kill fashion brands as we know them today. With the right materials, printers in the distant future should be able to reproduce any piece of clothing as long as theres a blueprint available. Blueprints would most likely require only one original piece to be generated, so piracy would go rampant and free blueprints would be widely available in the internet.
If you get tired of your wardrobe, just recycle the clothes and use the fabric to make new ones. Once again, no money needed, itd only take some time and the energy that powers the machines, but were assuming the person has a self-sufficient source for the household, remember?

I dont think this will kill fashion entirely, but trends will be created through the internet. Maybe some people would make money selling new designs and such, but I dont think well have anything that remotely resembles the current fashion industry.

**Entertainment:** $2482 - 4.85% of total expenditure

Another industy that wont be anything like what we have today. Internet-based content will dominate it, and it wont be as expensive as it is today. Not only the costs will be reduced for content creators, but the access to technology and the amount of free time available will increase supply across the board. SFX and equipment will be cheaper than ever, and much of the process for creating films, music and games will be automated. 

Computer-generated filmmaking will be accessible to everyone. Anyay, same for music, really. I see people today creating and playing amazing music without a single instrument, using only FL studio. It can only get easier from this point forward. 

Hell, even stuff like voice acting and narration can be replaced entirely. AIs will be able to replicate the voices of actors, living and dead ones. One of my favourite RPGs is Planescape: Torment, so Ill call my AI assistant Morte.
Morte, I want Christopher Walken to read The Winds of Winter to me.

I know that book will never be released, but Im daydreaming about the future, so lets pretend it will.

In short, people will spend money on it, I guess, but nothing close to what we spend today, and for various reasons.

**Housing:** $17,148 - 33.55% of total expenditure

Housing expenses: The total amount that a homeowner spends on mortgage payments, property insurance, homeowner's association fees, property taxes and other home-related reoccurring expenses, plus whatever amount is required to service all outstanding household debts. This number is used by financial institutions to calculate creditworthiness and interest rates for loans.

First of all, fuck that. Worst part of living in a big city, as anyone can tell you. But in this distant future it wont be much of a problem, I believe.
This is because houses wont be as expensive in the first place.

Speaking for myself, to show an example. Im an american, but Ive lived in London. I didnt really like it there, but the job paid well. Alright, but if I could have that job and live in the english countryside, Id do it in a heartbeat. Hell, if I didnt even need or have a job, Id take the countryside every single time.

Many things can make real estate more or less expensive today, but in a world where transport is faster, easier and cheaper, most jobs are gone and the ones left dont need to be done in person, what exactly is the advantage of living in [      ]?
Sure, beautiful locations, nice views, and the actual properties themselves will still have value, but they will be spread across larger regions and most people wont need or want to live so close in a big city. A lot of people will stick to them, of course, and there will be reasons and places to enjoy in big cities, but more people will choose to live elsewhere IMO.

Not just that, but prefabrication made by robots will dominate construction, so it'll become cheaper and faster in general. Even domestic robots should have pretty advanced abilities in that regard, so a simple house shouldn't take much to build.

EDIT:

Another important thing is that a shitload of places will be abandoned. I suspect there will be enough room for cheap housing to go around. I mean, will all of these factories and shopping malls even exist? How many stores will be shut down once they become irrelevant? With the right tools and robots, even people without many resources will be able to restore abandoned places and live there. It won't have to be their own robots, the government or local owners could lend them for a little while, because it won't take the robots a lot of time to do it.

**Cash contributions:** $1834 - 3.58% of total expenditure.

Quite specific expense, I guess, but if anything, it should be higher (percentage-wise) in the future. 

**Healthcare:** $3631 - 7.10% of total expenditure

Most doctors will be replaced (I guess some like psychiatrists cant?)  and drugs will be printable, so that will reduce costs quite dramatically. Treatments and surgeries will still cost something, but maybe people wont need health insurance? I dont really know what Id predict here, to be honest. All I know is that costs should be lower across the board.



Other expenditures: $3267 - 6.39% of total expenditure

Considering what I said above, these will logically become a bigger part of ones annual expenditure along with entertainment.

----------------

***Ok, whats your point again?***

My point is that automation will have some undesirable consequences, but in the long run everyone will be able to live a better life spending less money. Id dare say itll be possible to live with no money at all. Losing jobs wont be that big a deal because people will be able to do just fine without one.

***This is all assuming everyone would have a printer, a self-sufficient energy source and a computer in their homes. Thats a big leap.***

Yes, its fairly utopic in the short term, but in the long run I do think itll be the case. Some people suggest basic income as a solution. Well, how about subsidizing that stuff instead? Cheaper and more efficient.

Im not suggesting money will be gone, by the way. If anything, this futuristic barter system will make the economy more efficient than ever before, and everybody will benefit from it. 

The future wont be as bleak as it sounds, if you ask me, and thats all Im proposing here.",25,48

Is there any hope of actually staying young indefinitely for people alive now?

In this interview in 2005, Aubrey claims that within 25 years (of the interview date), there is a good chance we'll have treatments that slow down aging. In his timeline, he said that within 10 years of that date, he was confident there would be massive results in mice.

It is now 10 years later, and are we *any* closer to even slightly curing aging in mice? I mean, is there *any* chance of there being some breakthrough within even the next 5 or 10 years?

Or is the current generation doomed to grow saggier and more grey haired without anything we can do about it?

Anyways I'm starting this discussion to clarify my vision of ur imperfect future.  I don't believe we will solve every problem.  There will always be evil people doing evil things.  But I have strong hopes that with technological advance we can someday create a world where people are free to do as they please within reason -  a sort of techno-libertarian/socialist dream.  I'd say my dream takes aspects of Jacque Fresco's ideas of abundance and a resource-based economy mixed with a sort of decentralized socialism all laid atop the ideals of classic libertarian philosophy in terms of keeping government small and focused.

1.  This dream depends on abundant cheap energy.  I personally favor a mix of solar and thorium salt reactors along with geo-thermal.  Anything and everything that can produce electricity relatively cheap.

2.  I favor the idea of inductive wireless power if in the future a way can be found to make it more viable.  I imagine a city where the citizens use all that abundant cheap energy they invested in from #1 to power their cars, devices, etc. and the energy is considered a public resource.

3.  At the same time this society is investing in myriad ways to generate electricity cheaper, I imagine it would also be replacing things that use a lot of energy.  For example I heard awhile back there was a kickstarter for genetically-modified glowing plants. Perhaps someday we can have glowing trees instead of expensive streetlights.  Oh - and with the advance of autonomous transportation you won't even need as many lights because people won't be driving.  

4.  Given vertical farms, floating sea farms, lab-grown meats (once the cost has become competitive), reduced food waste and other initiatives designed to both make food supplies more stable and accessible/plentiful I imagine a future where hunger and starvation are solved through sheer abundance.

5.  Clothing will hopefully be made of nano-materials that will last a lot longer and won't require replacement as often or can simply be 3D printed and delivered for very low cost - if any cost at all.  

6.  Shelter I'll admit will be problematic because people will always compete for the best views, space for larger families, etc.  So here is one of the imperfections which I'm guessing will require an economic solution of some kind because unlike food, clothing, transportation, and energy - shelter involves scarcity to a large degree.

7.  Finally I believe the ultimate endgame is to become a divine space-faring species.  If you google around or just read enough here in Futurology you will find the seeds of our divinity.  Everything from mind-to-mind communication (hive mind) to the Internet of Things and AI (imbuing ordinary matter with intelligence), etc.  All this and more is possible in the future and alotr of the infrastructure requirements for this kind of future is already possible right now.

The term logical is used as a precaution to ideology; meaning that ideology and personal beliefs should not be considered while discussing the issue.

Instead it is advised to discuss the benefits and constraints of a topic, but not to refer to these technologies as ""morally wrong"" due to personal belief.

In the previous article link post, I commented: 

&gt; Remotely working from home is already happening with a significant chunk of the workforce (38%). However, I believe there is an invisible flow of companies allowing working from home for say a couple of years, but then see the decrease in productivity, or at least assume there's a decrease. Churn happens, so one company that's tried it, all of a sudden says it's not allowed. Yahoo is one example, and the company I work for is another (one of the largest companies in North America). 

&gt; The only time working from home will become consistent and will increasingly be adopted by companies large and small is when they can implement worker productivity analytics. This way, managers can track documents, code changes and project plans in real time, and as (possibly for you) scary as it is, every employee will get scores via built in AI. Only when they have proof will the executive board of a company officially allow remote workers.


The step after this could very well be managers and executives will realize that all their projects and content and products are being created efficiently, and this might very well lead to a 30 or even 20 hour work week. 
Think about all the inefficient meetings (or even unevessary) you've had. There's no doubting that software will make your job at least twice as efficient in about 3 years, so there will come a point where employees and unions will band together and say ""enough of these pointless make work projects, let's focus on essentials and required projects, and stop forcing everyone to work 8 - 14 hours per day (14 hours/day, see Japan and Korea as examples).

With productivity analytics, multiple devices and policies for working remotely, do you think hours per day will officially decrease thereby seeing a trend across most industries?",2,4

But how much better are algorithms getting every year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3lyv8h/a_study_measuring_the_rate_of_improvement_in/,Noncomment,1442947258,"This is a subject that comes up a lot. It's very relevant to the progress in AI. People often claim that AI progress is just due to hardware progress, and that algorithms are improving much slower. And that if hardware progress ends, many things will slow down.

It would certainly be interesting to know how quickly algorithms are improving. Is progress very slow or nonexistent? Or are things improving exponentially?

Well the Machine Intelligence Research Institute did some research to find out: [Algorithmic Progress in Six Domains](https://intelligence.org/files/AlgorithmicProgress.pdf)

&gt;In recent **boolean satisfiability (SAT)** competitions, SAT solver performance has increased 515% per year, depending on the type of problem. However, these gains have been driven by widely varying improvements on particular problems. Retrospective surveys of SAT performance (on problems chosen after the fact) display significantly faster progress.

&gt;**Chess programs** have improved by around 50 Elo points per year over the last four decades. Estimates for the significance of hardware improvements are very noisy, but are consistent with hardware improvements being responsible for approximately half of progress. Progress has been smooth on the scale of years since the 1960s, except for the past five. Go programs have improved about one stone per year for the last three decades. Hardware doublings produce diminishing Elo gains, on a scale consistent with accounting for around half of progress.

&gt;Improvements in a variety of **physics simulations** (selected after the fact to exhibit performance increases due to software) appear to be roughly half due to hardware progress.

&gt;The **largest number factored** to date has grown by about 5.5 digits per year for the last two decades; computing power increased 10,000-fold over this period, and it is unclear how much of the increase is due to hardware progress.

&gt;Some **mixed integer programming (MIP)** algorithms, run on modern MIP instances with modern hardware, have roughly doubled in speed each year. MIP is an important optimization problem, but one which has been called to attention after the fact due to performance improvements. Other optimization problems have had more inconsistent (and harder to determine) improvements.

&gt;Various forms of **machine learning** have had steeply diminishing progress in percentage accuracy over recent decades. Some vision tasks have recently seen faster progress.

What happens when [funding is exponential](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/36nm4m/exponential_increase_in_ai_funding/) as well?

Note that this is not about *general software*. If you feel the computer programs you use every day are getting slower, that's a totally different issue. This is about algorithms in mainly scientific domains, which use large amounts of computing power and are highly optimized for speed.

But surely you've noticed that computer graphics seem to get more and more realistic every year. Voice recognition gets better and better. These are the kinds of things that benefit from algorithmic progress as well as hardware improvements.",18,31

I am ignoring externalities, in the sense of major changes in the way humans live life that would render this theory impossible or otherwise unnecessary. This is in the interest of simply exploring an idea.

The internet has created a class divide, between students who have computers and those who dont, between the third world farmer who is able to check how grain prices if grain prices are down and the one who would be unable to get that information.

There was a great piece on morning edition that covered this. I have quoted pretty much the entire thing here.

&gt; A new study from the Pew Research Center finds that age and income play a larger role than race when it comes to high-speed Internet access. Lower-income African-Americans often buy smartphones to compensate for not having a broadband connection at home. Smartphones, however, may not be enough.
&gt; Black Americans who are young and college graduates are on the same footing as their white counterparts when it comes to getting online or using a smartphone. But Aaron Smith, a Pew researcher, says using a mobile device as a primary means of accessing the Internet has drawbacks. There's a lot you can't do on a smartphone.

&gt; ""For instance,"" Smith says, ""distance learning or filling out job applications. Those may be much more difficult on a smartphone than on a more traditional device.""

&gt; Smith says that's a growing problem in a world where an Internet connection is key for everything from accessing education to getting government services.

&gt; ""So to the extent that this particular group that has a very strong need for some of those services is much less likely to be online, I think that that's a very relevant finding for policymakers, nonprofits and other people who are seeking to serve that community,"" Smith says.
&gt; According to Smith, the biggest takeaway from the study is that class trumps race when it comes to Internet access. 
	

**The class divide of implant tech**

&gt;  In what sounds like a mixture of The Matrix and Limitless, DARPA has created a device that can be implanted directly into the brain, recording the activity associated with memory and ""shocking"" the brain to improve specific functions like short-term recall. [source](http://www.outerplaces.com/science/item/9865-darpa-creates-brain-implants-that-boost-human-memory) 
	
In an official DARPA press release they detailed the future of this technology

&gt; ""As the technology of these fully implantable devices improves, and as we learn more about how to stimulate the brain ever more precisely to achieve the most therapeutic effects, I believe we are going to gain a critical capacity to help our wounded warriors and others who today suffer from intractable neurological problems,"" said Sanchez. ""It is a very complex and challenging frontier, but one I am convinced we will learn to navigate and leverage to good effect in people who today have no effective therapeutic options. [source](http://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2015-09-11a)


Over the past five to ten years technological innovation has seen an drastic increase in the speed of innovation. However, population projections only seem indicate a future where that frenzy of innovation and entrepreneurship that is surrounding tech doesn't slow. In fact, more than likely the speed of innovation and technological progress will continue to quicken. Simply by an increase in the sheer number of humans who are able to contribute to the collective intelligence progress will quicken. A side effect of quickening progress is more and more of those increasing masses having access to education. This, I believe, will push progress forward in ways we cannot possibly imagine. Yet since for now we are bound by the constraints of the natural human imagination it is all we can do to theorize and wonder.

As implant tech begins to take off within the next 50 years or so we will see a class divide emerge between those who have access to the technology and those who dont. Suppose in 30 to 50 or so years the research that DARPA is doing now will eventually lead to a consumer focused product which can be implanted via elective surgery. There are enormous technological hurdles to jump over to get to this point, but due to the increasing rate of innovation it seems not impossible to imagine a future where this is true.

At first the surgery will only be available to military since that is who is developing it, but like drones or GPS navigation it will slowly trickle down to consumers. At first it will be prohibitively expensive and this is immediately where we will see the divide begin to emerge. If you could afford this implant you would be enhanced by technology (in pop culture nomenclature, a cyborg). An enhanced brain would give its owners a distinct advantage over those who lacked the implants. Supposing this device could connect to the internet, the worlds information would be not even be at your fingertips, it would just be there. 

An elective surgery is something that is very precise and requires specialized equipment. This indicates that it is a technology that will be very difficult to quickly bring to scale and that the price will keep it within luxury status for quite some time.

This will lead to an entrenched class of technologically superior humans.

Those who are unable to afford the operation will be at a significant disadvantage. It is likely there will be quite a large amount of criticism towards the technology and I expect there will be cultures and groups of people who vocally reject the technology. But like all advances it will eventually move forward. Now imagine a population split, with half of them having the worlds of information on tap, and half not. 

This class divide we are seeing now as the access to information is commodified is just the start. 

I would love to start a discussion on this topic. I am not coming at this with a large base of knowledge, so I am sure there are much more qualified people out there to be speculating on this. I would love to hear what they might have to contribute.",6,5

(IMHO, of course).

Famously, this fourth book was not written by Larsson, who made the ill-advised career move of dying before his books became huge best-sellers.  But (IMHO again) it's damn good.  For me at least, the cast of characters live on.  (There is an AGI sub-plot which I think is a bit daft, but it barely distracts.)

The shift in author but the consistency of world-building made me wonder again when an AI will first produce a thriller as good as a human.  AIs already produce huge numbers of sports reports and financial reports for AP and others.  They're not going to stop there.

Highly successful writers like Wilbur Smith and James Patterson churn out brilliantly readable books, and some of them have stables of ghost-writers doing the actual drafting.  There is a formula to these things, and they work.  Readers love 'em.

If and when an AI is first able to write a novel as well as a human, will it quickly figure out how to do it much, much better?  I can see no reason why not.  Thrillers may become like crack cocaine to avid readers: they'll forget to eat because they are so engrossed in the story.

When?  All forecasts are wrong, of course, and I can only offer a science-free hunch, but I reckon within ten years.

That will be another powerful sign that we are well on the way to the economic singularity I describe in ""Surviving AI"".

Then there's the issue of governorship, once the population gets large enough. What happens when someone inevitably breaks a rule (or law)? Is a security/police force needed? At what population size would that become a requirement?  What would happen if someone killed another person? Do you form a jury of peers? Do you build a jail?

It seems that no matter how amazing technology becomes,it comes with it's own possible frustrations.Air planes  and skyscrapers should  put people in a permanent state of awe and wonder today.Unfortunately hedonic adaptation causes us to view these things as ""normal"" at best,frustrating at worst.(too loud,blocking my view,too many people,too late,not enough leg space). At present,video games are one of the greatest things to come out of this civilization,yet many gamers generally seem like unhappy,angry people .It seems the better their technology(pc gamers),the more they have to complain about,especially when it comes to graphics.



 Your underlying psychological predispositions can have an effect on your subjective experience of the world today,it may very well do so in the future.

One such frustration would be maintenance slavery,where you are surrounded by a complex network of household products ,so you have to constantly update the software on your smart toaster,smart fridge,smart camera and smart shower so that nobody uses them to hack your smart door lock.Eventually you feel like you are spending more time maintaining your devices rather than enjoying them (because the benefits are largely hidden and considered ""normal"" because of hedonic adaptation).Ofcourse you can automate these processes,but then you may fall into another phenomenon.

Machine faith.Where the world is so complex that it becomes necessary to outsource your decision making capacity to an IPA (e.g siri,Cortana) who leads you by the nose throughout your life.Eventually you have faith in the assistants judgement more than your own.The assistant may be involve in all major life decisions.Very much like how hyper religious people will pray before making any decision.Thus the machine becomes a shepherd(you shall not want) rather than an advisor.



It is easy to say that humans won't be any happier in the distant future than they are now(due to hedonic adaptation).Unless they directly modify themselves so that they are always in a state of awe and wonder.

What other psychological phenomena or even mental disorders do you think will surface in the near future?

All over this subreddit I have constantly heard people put the idea of a Universal Basic Income up on a pedestal like it is the end all be all solution without much actual discussion of its consequences. And I think it is important for this subreddit, if it is to take itself seriously, to hear a variety of opinions and viewpoints. So please hear me out and treat me with respect.

Universal Basic Income, is a wet dream. And it's sounds great, but it is going to be the source of some underlying problems that should not be ignored. The most glaring problem being that U.B.I. effectively takes an already corrupt and powerful oligarchy of corporate bureaucrats (the guys who push SOPA, PIPA, and TPP), the real power and makes them even more terrifying. If a deal is going to be brokered for a UBI, they will be the ones at the forefront and the one's benefiting. Why? because they will be the ones in charge of the UBI. Keep in mind how broken the American System already is. Positions that are supposed to regulate and work as a checks and balances to big business are being run by corporate yesmen. So now those people will be in charge of UBI and everyone will be at their mercy. They are already working with TPP to sever any ability for state governments to regulate big business. And if TPP happens in its current form it will effectively take away that last strange twisted vestige of sovereignty we have at the state level. And by monopolizing people's livelihood with a Universal Basic Income you are putting people to the mercy of this already proven vile elite. And with no effective means to oppose them, people will be rendered slaves to the state or whatever entity that divides out the income. It is impossible to have a self respecting democracy of ""We the People"" where people are absolutely dependent on the state, or if you like Corporate Elite. Do you really want to make yourself a slave to these vile brutes and devils masquerading in their suits and ties? If you think it is bad now, you just wait when their is no alternative. How can you have free speech, when they can threaten to cut you off? Do you expect mercy from these people? Are we really that naive?

I understand that I am not a perfect individual and perhaps I didn't do either side of the argument justice. BUT I feel like I bring up an important point. There needs to be more discussion about the possible negative impacts that a UBI would bring. ",137,46

Our plan is to develop this into a more general platform, beyond exercise, where we can interpret data from wearable devices and use it to create experiences that optimize a users mood or performance during an activity.

Smart watches like the [Samsung Simband](http://mashable.com/2014/11/12/samsungs-simband/#CpMlKdC6f8qG) have the ability to monitor things like blood pressure, blood glucose levels, skin temperature, and of course heart rate and accelerometry. We also have the ability to collect external data such as the weather, ambient temperature, time of day, season, etc.

Some examples of new experiences could be: to play music to improve relaxation or concentration, have a smart watch app that signals through visual cues when you're in an optimal state of mind for a particular task, a digital mood ring if you will. Your smart watch can tell by your skin temperature if you're feeling hot or cold, and can adjust your smart thermostat accordingly. Your blood glucose sensor can tell when your blood sugar is getting low, and can recommend when you should eat something.

So please help me envision the future of wearable tech, and how biometric data can be used to improve your well-being, as well as provide engaging entertainment experiences.",6,8

The only problem is they might be too difficult to fly safely. It's hard enough to drive with just gas, break, left and right. Try roll, pitch and yaw. Luckily the autonomous car is coming first.

Speaking of which I predict that delivery drones won't have enough range or speed to deliver heavy loads for a while. So cars may still be king of the road for our life time. But heavy load drones might be great for short distances.

I think it would start with postal/junkfood/grocery delivery. Of course there will be spills, but the kinks will get worked out through this process. Broken eggs can be forgiven, but broken legs cannot.

Eventually this tech can work up to heavier and heavier loads like construction materials for work sites. Then there might be a hover bike, mostly for hobbyist and then finally one that can carry whole families. ",7,0

Such a firm could have several versions of drugs in constant development, and older established versions could be made free in order to encourage open-source participation to improve the products.  For example, clinical trials could proceed in a distributed way so that many happen at once, instead of waiting for a product development decision made by a few executives and based on marketing and business and other non-medical concerns.  

People could use last year's version of some drug for free, but it only solves 40% of disorder X's problems, whereas the paid version solves 60% of the problems and merges all of the recent advances.  It would encourage constant development in order to maintain profitability, and the mass participation would bring much lower development costs and a much faster and more efficient development process.  For example, everyone who participates could upload information that has private data removed, but genome data could be linked to some hash value that only the original owner knows.

One of the challenges would be how this is affected by the current economic protection afforded to drug companies for their products.

I'm mostly annoyed by politics and the coverage of scientific and technological advances. (For a brief period of time I even entertained the idea of compiling some information concerning, e.g. near future steps on the exploration of Mars (by current and the next NASA rovers). For example, what regions of Mars are expected to be covered (with estimated time of occurence), the specifics of each one, what kind of information could emerge from searching there (given the instruments available), in what kind of ways that information could contribute to the expansion of our knowledge of Mars (considering past information and current theories), and obviously possible consequences for the future exploration of Mars (including manned exploration) and other worlds of the Solar System. The fact is that at least part of the information on those things are already available on the web and in principle it wouldn't require an expert to collect (from multiple sources) and organize on a ""timeline"" form.)

I'm not entirely sure the media (and especially the old media) would be, in principle, particularly interested in using projected, future timelines. Usually, the media explores the fact that we have limited resources for storing and processing information and narrow attention spans in order to both, produce an artificial ""surprise"" effect and limit the cost of the coverage somehow (by keeping quality requirements to a minimum). I couldn't estimate (even qualitatively) the ammount of influence that this characteristic type of media coverage (driven in part by the lack of such a system/timeline) has on public opinion (and on public policy as a consequence). I would even say the effects may be more relevant than any kind of ideology-driven media bias.",4,1

I think it will be an activity we all do as leisure in the future. We could even have our memories temporarily forgotten so we actually think it is all real. To me that is amazing. I can live as any character I want of any story. I could sail the seas as captain jack sparrow. I could help save the galaxy as peter quill. I could carry the RING INTO MORDOR. You could fall into love with anyone you wanted to, or be friends with anyone and go on epic adventures that could never be possible in real life. I just don't see enough discussion about the future of VR. What do you think? and when do you think this will happen? I say it could happen in the next 30 years, but long after an intelligence explosion. ",5,0

So, no matter what advances are made, the total resource of the earth is still the limiting factor, and infinite growth and infinite advancement are still not possible.

&gt;In early 2012 D-Wave Systems revealed a 512-qubit quantum computer, code-named Vesuvius,[32] which was launched as a production processor in 2013.

&gt;On August 20, 2015, D-Wave released general availability of their D-Wave 2X computer, with 1,152 qubits in a Chimera graph architecture (although, due to manufacturing defects on their test chip, only 1097 of the 1152 qubits are functional and available for use.)

&gt;Slated for a 2015 release, the D-Wave Three will feature their ""Washington"" 1,152-qubit processor. This however is a 2,048-qubit chip with half of the qubits disabled, but these may be re-activated later on.

- **Literacy Revolution**: For example, starting around 1600 we saw a revolution of literacy (and by extension art and science) that initially threatened the powers that be, but whose advantages were so immense that they soon overwhelmed those same powers and led the societies that embraced them into a new age of prosperity which culminated in:  
  
- **Industrial Revolution:** The realization of factories and machinery ballooned in this well documented and studied time period that lasted through the early 20th century.  But it wasn't the last 'revolution' our species has lived through.  
  
- **Transportation Revolution**: With the invention of the car, mankind entered into a new paradigm in productivity.  The railroad may have marked the true beginning of this particular age, but it was upon the invention and popularization of the personal auto that it went full exponential on us.  It no longer took weeks to cross the country, and within a few decades air power allowed world wide travel in mere days... an impossible feat in the previous century.  The only flaw was when humans tried to reason - what comes next?  The future world they imagined merely extended their existing transportation revolution; They didn't bother to consider that an entirely different revolution was awaiting them.  It was around this time that the governments realized that restricting humans from partaking in these new technologies would be disastrous - it was far better to subtly shape *how* their citizens could partake in these new innovations.  For example, see the idiotic rules that Britain tried to enforce regarding automobiles which lead to a retardation of their entire auto industry (the effects of which can still be felt today).  
  
- **Information Revolution**: Starting with the internet we began to experience the most radical revolution of all, one of information itself.  The first seeds of this can be traced all the way back to the telegram, but it didn't really go exponential until digital computer networks began to light up across the country in the 1960's.  This threatened governments more than ever before as they (and the other powers that be) realized that humans would have infinitely more sources to get their information from that before, and state controlled media (and by extension, thoughts) would become a thing of the past.  Imagine how tough it was for someone in the 1960's to form a truly unbiased opinion about the world and their nation!  They had only a limited amount of news channels and work gossip to go on, and if they stepped too far out of line (""*hey, you aren't a commie are you?*"") they risked the destruction of their livelihood.  These days we are encouraged to question everything, and the results of our new informational abilities has propelled us into a dizzying rocket of scientific and cultural progress: it seems like every day we are making moral and scientific breakthroughs across the globe now that the brightest minds in our species are no longer limited by distance.  
  
- **Financial Revolution**: Though informational innovations aren't finished, I think its safe to say that with the majority of our species online the largest hurdle has been crossed in the information 'revolution'.  Now we face one of money, and by extension influence.  The first catalyst in this new social earthquake?  Bitcoin.  With it, we have created true financial innovation for the first time in centuries.  True, stocks and bonds are neat, but they are artificial and social constructs: tricks of faith.  Bitcoin was the first time that money itself emerged in a new and powerful form (made possible by the culmination of previous revolutions).  Now, we have expanded on *even that*.  We now have even newer and more impressive forms of money (including my favorite, Monero) which allow for the first time in human history the vision of **true electronic cash** that is untraceable and private.  
  
Like all the other revolutions, this one is going to be filled with idiots who say that it's just a cheap parlor trick:   
  
----------------  
   
*""What can be more palpably absurd than the prospect held out of locomotives traveling twice as fast as stagecoaches?*""  - The Quarterly Review, England (March 1825)  
  
""*That the automobile has practically reached the limit of its development is suggested by the fact that during the past year no improvements of a radical nature have been introduced.*"" - Scientific American, Jan. 2, 1909.  
  
""*The truth is no online database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher and no computer network will change the way government works ...*"" -Newsweek, 1995.  
  
-----------------  
  
Just as well it will be filled with fools who say it is the ""devil"".  They must all be ignored, as mountains as invincible as the Bethlehem Steel itself will crumble into ashes in its wake.  
  
But once the apex is crossed?  Humans will be able to transact with anyone on the planet, instantly and freely.  Our economy (due to productivity) is going to see such a mind-boggling acceleration that even *you* dear futurist would call me a loon if I could tell you about the world of 2045.  Right now what is the value of all 'money' on Earth?  A paltry $100 trillion?  Foolishness!  
  
Imagine a world where there are a hundred corporations the size of Apple and Google and the money supply of our civilization is measured in the hundreds of **quadrillions**.  This is the power of increased connectivity - an exponential increase in the ability of a system to generate useful ideas and inventions that we have seen play out time and time again through the history of our world.  
  
What comes next after this financial revolution?  A revolution of consciousness itself as virtual reality and nano-machines let us connect our neurons with each other and AI in ways that would seem preposterous at the present?  A revolution of medicine and biology?  A revolution of intelligence?  Who knows - if the past has taught us anything its that those who attempt to extrapolate too arrogantly are inevitably humbled by the awesome power of exponential progress in unexpected areas.

Then I wrote this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3mx14i/so_i_had_this_idea_about_science_eventually/,snwborder52,1443580876,"So in the Middle Ages in Europe, god was everything. You and everything around you. All god. That branch? God. That shrubbery? God That Chair? God. Your mom? God. Your dumb little sister? God. The reason your girlfriend left you? God.  Why your priest held you after for special lessons? God. Everything was god, including you. You were just a vessel for god. 

This changed in the enlightenment. A whole bunch of dudes got together, partly because they were like fuck yeah science and philosophy also, and more likely the main reason, they didnt want to be oppressed by the man er king or sovereign. They were using the idea of empiricism to subvert the political authority of the church. All those dudes you hear about, Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Kant, Rosseau, were part of this cultural war. The science and philosophy guys won. Religion still ruled over the elusive soul, but science had taken a hold on the rest. The world split into the physical, the emotional and the mental/spiritual. They demystified the material world while keeping the self and the soul mystical

Anyway. Heres the fuckin deal. This shit is about to happen again, but this time the soul is going to be demystified. Who you very are is going to be solved in a laboratory. Its coming. Science will prove the Self Illusion. But theres gonna be people fighting back. This is like George Lucas explaining the force is just midichlorians in the blood stream. Nobody likes George Lucas anymore. 

Any what kind of world will that be? One where the distinction between robot and human is blurred. Where there are human/robot wars, state sponsored implants, and a opressive robot class system where the few live in a state of near bliss (powered by a fully mechanical brain and accesses to every advancing pleasure devices) and the rest live in a meager existence trying to save enough to live their lives with medical implants with a diseased and dying world while those above look down on them in disgust for being the lowlifes that they are (I mean we have engineered brains! Were totally better than them. We deserve this). 

Or maybe, it will be different. Maybe well realize the power of positivitiy, of the light, of jesus and buddha. Maybe this demystification of the mind will allow us to control our want mechanically. To lesser our desire. To construct a new mind that does not fall to the paradox of the ego. Perhaps this world will be one in which everyone is content, there is no war, and we work together for the greater benefit of humanity and the world. 

There are two players. One is light. One is dark. Which side do you want?",24,0

But this isn't what we see when we look out at the sky.  No-body seems to be broadcasting Pi, or twirling galaxies around for fun.

The Great Filter idea is that something comes along and wipes life out.  And if that something is ahead of us then it is likely to get us.

1.How do you feel about eating lab grown HUMAN meat? Would you personally eat it? Would you allow your children to eat it?

2.Do you think it's safe to feed dogs with human meat?

3.I have a hunch, that same people with sick/unstable minds (like teenagers and psychos) can get urge to taste ""natural"" human meat after eating lab grown version. So, maybe eating human meat must be restricted somehow? Age-restricted, for example.

My biggest existential worry is that exponential technologies will soon exceed our ability to regulate or control them.  For example, here in the US we have been having debates about our gun culture, but what happens when 3d printing allows for the easy production of guns, explosives, and eventually biological and chemical weapons?  We can already print guns but the user still needs to have a level of expertise to be able to do this.  In the coming years, usability and accessibility for these technologies will continue to proliferate unless we let a neo-luddite agenda take over.  Another fear, as echoed by Hawking, Musk, and others is the automation of weapons.  We could see our governments or corporations create a real life equivalent to Terminator's Skynet if we are not vigilant.  So this brings me to what I think should be our first course of action in bringing about cultural change, which looks to avoid these unpleasant possibilities.

	We  have to deconsolidate power.  Since feudal times we have been ruled over by an elite class.  I would argue that this might have been necessary due to the lack of literacy/education in the peasant class but this idea of an ignorant constituency is fading rapidly in our modern times. Information is being shared at unprecedented levels and the internet continues to become better sorted, easier accessed, and more widely available as time goes on.  I would say that the bigger problem in the US isn't necessarily ignorance, but instead propaganda, division, and misappropriated blame, which is driven by our corporate mainstream media outlets. I think that division is intentional, and can be overcome by dissolving the power structure.  I know what you're thinking right now.  How the fuck could we do that?

	Well, once again, we have to deconsolidate power.  We need to quit allowing the few to make all of the decisions for the many, especially when the bulk of those decisions no longer serve the needs of the many.  We have seen a presidency which ran on the principle of Change, devolve into an establishment which merely carries on the policies of the administration before it.  We see our Congress with approval ratings not seen since the Revolutionary War ignoring topics or agendas that have overwhelming public support or passing things which have overwhelming negative support.  We even see corruption in our Supreme Court with them passing decisions which adversely affect the American people (Citizens United, McCutcheon, Voting Rights repeal, etc.)  So as you see, we have a government which has forgotten its purpose.  A government which no longer serves the people.

	My solution is to create a platform that initially exists in parallel with our government and traditional systems but eventually evolves to the point of usurping them.  I envision an online platform that is secure, user friendly, continually updated, open source, and is easily accessible.  I see this platform starting off as a real-time voting platform in which citizens can log in and vote.  Vote not just for politicians, but for the local and national issues which are currently of importance.  I see this platform being used to call out politicians who do not vote with their constituents and holding those politicians accountable.  However, eventually I see this platform as evolving to the point where we do not need politicians to represent us since we will be able to represent ourselves in real time via our devices.  This will hopefully lead to the deconsolidation of power as I described above.

	The limiting factors of this idea stems from my inability to do this alone.  Indeed, for this to be a successful venture I will need a LOT of help.  I lack the requisite skills in web design or programming to build such a large and ambitious site.  I also lack the marketing skills to make this idea get the attention necessary to get meaningful feedback on the website.  So I bring this to you for help.  Do you think this idea has merit?  What is the best way to make this a reality?  Will you help?

**TL:DR : Consolidated power no longer works for the public good.  We need to create an online platform where people can vote in real time, which will eventually replace the need for politicians.  I need lots of help to do this.**

I'm from England and for example its seldom that someone has to travel 7 hours regularly by car to their destination. There are efficient transport links, especially train lines that can get you all over Britain. There has been so much investment in public transport in Britain in recent years that it's very hard to see self driving cars in England, let alone the capital, London, be on the road in the next decade or so.
