   Helium 3 is the perfect fuel source: extremely potent,  nonpolluting, with virtually no radioactive by-product. Proponents claim its the fuel of the 21st century. The trouble is, hardly any of it is found on Earth. But there is plenty of it on the moon.

Scientists estimate there are about 1 million tons of helium 3 on the moon, enough to power the world for thousands of years. Scientist estimate that this new cash crop of the moon,(deposited by solar winds) is worth upwards of 4 billion dollars. The equivalent of a single space shuttle load or roughly 25 tons could supply the entire United States' energy needs for a year, according to Apollo17 astronaut and FTI researcher Harrison Schmitt.

Here's a few I could think of:

Intelligent software like [Watson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_%28computer%29#Future_uses) will help with all kinds of data mining jobs. Like making medical diagnoses, sifting through legal documents, synthesizing information from published scientific papers, and all kinds of other functions.

Image processing AI will also help in medicine by analyzing X-rays and MRIs etc. DNA profiling will also be used to diagnose diseases when we figure out more about the genome and reading DNA becomes cheap enough. Pharmacies are [already being automated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy_automation) and also reduce mistakes in filling prescriptions. Computers and robots [will automate](http://www.livescience.com/5397-job-swap-robot-scientist.html) a lot of laboratory work. Testing thousand of molecules and genes to create new and better drugs.

Air traffic control and the flying of airplanes will be automated and safer for it. Also the baggage handling will be done by machines. When the security checks are done by AI and scanners too we'll almost have completely automated airports.

[Genetic algorithms](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/genalg/genalg.html#examples) will eventually do most of the work in all of the engineering fields. Humans will only supply the computers with the desired object or structure, its physical requirements, and guide it in making it aesthetically pleasing.

What other jobs can we think of?",4,8

One individual brought up the idea of Xenogardening. I was wondering if anybody else was fascinated by this idea and all of its implications. 

If we consider the future, we can make a few assumptions and inductive claims. 

The image above is a rough likelihood of how the human presence in space would grow exponentially, employing either synthetic lifeforms or just tracing the distribution of human colonies over time. 

Whatever will actually occur, this image is a good approximation. 

What I now ask you is what *does* Xenogardening imply and what does it mean?

There is little information on xenogardening and is a novel idea;

i) the practice of the rules-of-engagement for alien planets and the future potential life that could manifest

ii) The nurture and protection of alien planets, alien life, and potential life

ii) The human rules to spreading through the galaxy

Ultimately, I am a consistent wikipedian editor and am inspired to possibly create a wikipedia article for this idea and its broad future implications. To begin my research, I wanted to consult r/futurology's thoughts, comments, and knowledge first. What say you, Xenogardeners?
