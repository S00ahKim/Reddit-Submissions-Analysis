- If you haven't read the simulation argument, here is the website that includes the essay by Nick Bostrom: http://www.simulation-argument.com/ 

If option 3 is true and we are living in a simulation then it seems there are two further possibilities:

1. Our idea of ethics is flawed. Throughout recent history the concept of inflicting suffering on another sentient creature is becoming more repugnant. Torture, slavery, and even the death penalty are all gone from modern society or on its way out. One would think a highly advanced race would choose not to inflict suffering on any aware creature. But maybe this is untrue and our idea of ethics are flawed.

2. You/we are the advanced awareness that begun the simulation. Either you/we are playing all characters in the simulation or maybe we are playing with our friends. Games are getting more and more immersive and it seems that one day we will find ourselves in a totally believable reality. Do ethics apply if a sentient creature chooses to put itself through suffering to improve itself and learn, or maybe even to just have fun? I'm sure you have read 'The Egg' by Andy Weir: http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html 

In summary if we are in a simulation, then so far one of the above choices seems to be our options. 

Personally I think between the two, option 2 is far more likely.

http://greyenlightenment.com/intellectualism-individualism-and-wealth-part-4-philosophy-of-millennials/

&gt;Boomers, like the iconoclasts of the Protestant Reformation, wanted to tear down the system; millennials, on the other hand, seek to adapt, either by emulating the rich and successful or by finding ways of coping with mediocrity. 

&gt;Even in the 90s, for gen-x, it as about The Matrix cyber punk rebellion and escapism though alt music, MTV, and sitcoms. 

&gt;But millennials want to stay in the present, to confront reality head-on... . 

====

As future techs expand by leaps and bounds, most people will not be able to keep up. 

Rebellions were already held and failed. (OWS, Bernie Sanders, the South American lefitst govts, etc)

Ms. Clinton, despite of all hype, is a centrist and will not interfere with future tech advances and economic growth, which will drive some advanced vanguards of humanity to the Next Civilization while leaving everyone else in the cold.

The younger people and the smarter ones know they have lost the battle, nothing will ever be changed, and they will try to carve up as much success as they can in the existing system, which will last until AGI.

In fact it may be no longer relevant whether we have AGI or not. Economic singularity, in which the whole world's wealth will be concentrated in the hands of very few, will take place no matter what, and the best people not related to the new Tech Emperors can aspire to is jockey for the few lucrative positions these Tech Empires can offer them, somewhat like Asian courtiers jockeying for the Emperor's favor, which was very fickle and extremely dangerous but some people did win and reaped enormous rewards with the privilege to kill their enemies at will, keeping the enemies' gens out from the gene pool while ensuring their genes will live.

Change will be passe, and conforming to the Narrative, making more money, caring less to people inferior to one's self and 'playing by the rules and shunning those who don't will be the future trend. (By  that definition, for example, Martin Shkrelli did not break any rules, although he might have earned some enemies.)

How will it end? It will end somewhat like David Wingrove's Chung Kuo, where a very wealthy, interstellar civilization is consisted of 7 very, very, very powerful and wealthy families (the T'angs), their courtiers and the rest who live like animals. The T'angs and their courtiers, of course, have no time or mercy wasted to the rest.

One might say this may retard tech advancement. However, with everything stabilized, those who do matter have all the time in the world. And, it is likely that life span for those who can afford it would have increased significantly, so when one has all the time in the world, progress could wait a little bit longer. 

If the threat of a world upheaval is gone, it doesn't really matter whether we have the New Civ by 2050 or 3050, since the world of 3050 would probably look similar to 2050 with much better gadgets. 

It is the threat of a world upheaval, where the world's disenfranchised might rise up against the world's worthies, which necessitates a rapid tech advance.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

Not much, just being direct and to the point.

On the mexican side of things , there's this eagerness to learn and a concept like UBI generated a lot of attention, we already have universal health care and people over 70 have a very basic and modest income, public college is accesible to everyone, so there's a natural incline to be more friendly about it, specially since automation will hit Mexico hard because our economy is huge in manufacturing, truck driving etc.. The same trend you see with productivity and job creation is starting to appear in Mexico. 

I sense a lot of informal jobs when automation becomes widespread and that worries me.

With my U.S friends, I had a hard time. Even democrats had a really hard time accepting UBI has a way to ease the pain that automation will bring. ""That's socialism, communism"" I heard fairly often (what will politicallabels  mean in an autonomous world, I wonder). We had a very meaningful conversation, but I do get that the notion of people getting money and not working for it is going to be a very hard pill to digest. The negative income tax was far more easy to accept but my problem is that the notion pressuposes that we will continue to have jobs.

Which brings me to another point, what kinda jobs does automation might generate?. 

I can see security guard for a driverless truck being one of them. A huge rise in ""hand made pizza, burgers,"" etc.. huge rise in teachers, people care , all those jobs that we currently have a deficit.

Some statutes may go the extra distance and forbid FOREIGN swear words as well! (Also, any word that slurs against the LGBT community.)

&gt; What do you wanna be when you grow up, honey?

&gt; Someday, Mrs. ***Dieck***mann, I wanna write ***fic***tion novels!

&gt; *TEXT MESSAGE CHIMES ON HER E-RING*

Text message reads on the ring's holographic projection:

&gt; You have been fined 2 North Ameri for violating the Verbal Morality Statute. Illegal uttered words: ""[Dyke](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dyke#Noun_2)"" and ""[fick](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fick)""

Mrs. Dieckmann responds,

&gt; Next, I need to teach all of you the concept of false positives, and how to not cause them, because a couple happened just now. Also, everyone MUST remember: It's DEEK-mann now, ever since that unnecessary law came into place. Don't call me by my surname's old pronunciation because that is now literally against the law!

&gt; By the way honey, I didn't know your ring was also a smartphone! You're not allowed to have your own smart-wear at school without your parents' express signed approval until you're 10, mainly thanks to theft concerns and subsequent liability issues. Now I need to call your parents and ask them for it.

---

See how dark the future will be in jurisdictions that enforce a Verbal Morality Statute? **How will curseword detectors tell innocent utterings (like the examples) apart from real, intentional swear-words?** Or will we be forced to live in fear of causing a false positive to deduct our bank accounts every so often?",1,1,False,self,,,,,

One of the platitudes of economics is that humans have unlimited wants, and yet limited resources. The first one is inarguable. We have billionaires in the world still scheming for more power and money.

So the disagreement must come from the second, that we have limited resources. Undoubtedly, automation and AI make the consumption of resources more efficient. But how do they create new resources?

The reality is, we live in a world with less forest, less fossil fuels, and less minerals every day. AI and automation can increase this consumption. But if it cannot create new resources, there is less to go around, and scarcity will still exist. In fact, it will be compounded.  

So what I'm asking is, how can a ""post scarcity"" society ever exist? It seems like a fanciful concept to me. This isn't an attack on anyone, I'm just curious as to what people mean when they use this term.  ",8,1,False,self,,,,,

While small, roughly 1mm in size, a neuron ranges between 0.004 to 0.1 mm, according to a simple google search. So I assume that Neural Dust actually records the activity of adjacent neurons and assume that they will activate in concert.    
    
Question time:    
    
1. If you want to record just one neuron, what size does the Neural Dust have to be?    
Ie: what size does it have to be to stay within a neuron if they are randomly sprinkled on the parietal surface of the grey matter (brain).    
    
2. Can these be inbedded into the Pia Mater through surgery?    
    
Reason I ask this is because I imagine that the Neruon-Transistor Bridge, if sufficiently small, could be added to the pia mater through surgery. Say: a surgeon opens the piamater on 3 lines over the primary motor cortex, fill the exposed Pia area with really small Neural Dust antennas. Press them into the Pia, Close it up, and presto: We can control prosthetics with our thoughts.    
    
So final question: If this is possible, why is it practically impossible?

My point in posting this is that the future comes from this sort of work, not the saying so Mr Musk or yet another popular piece on AI. 

* Alzheimer's: aducanumab, an antibody delivered intravenously at monthly intervals which binds to amyloid in the brain and eliminates plaque. ""Confirmation of cognitive change will be a game changer"". 

* A family tree of mathematics. Mathematicians fall into one of 24 intellectual ""families"", based on teacher-pupil lineage.

* Snake bites kill tens of thousands every year. How to overcome the shortage of anti-venom?

* The Rosetta mission returned fragments of a comet for analysis. Proves comets from directly from tiny dust fragments, not aggregating into grains, lumps, boulders. 

* Hundreds of proteins contribute to the ribosome, the complex that translates RNA into proteins. New study reveals near-atomic resolution of the assembly of this. Turns out much of the complexity lies in a scaffolding complex that orients and organises the RNA prior to its processing. 

* Hypoxia (suffocation) in tumours alters an enzyme that demethylates DNA. Possible implications for therapy in strokes, heart attack, cancer itself.  

* Gulf countries spending billions on post-oil economic ventures. (Good luck with that.)

* Singapore as a magnet for scientific talent, focus on biotech.

* Humans entering America would have to follow a long gap in the ice sheet. Pollen and other data make this just viable at around 12.6 kYBP, populated by prey animals 11 kYBP. That doesn't fit well with fossils dating to earlier periods. So Clovis and S American groups took another route? (Kon Tiki in reverse - my comment.)

* Boston (Mass) as a technology hub: why do economic clusters occur, and how can they be replicated?

* Pluripotent stem cells in mammals undergo a predictable set of changes when implanted in adult animals. 

* The spectrum of the atmosphere of two exoplanets are taken. Not as predicted cloud-free hydrogen. Opaque, Venus like atmosphere possible. 

* Use of femtosecond lasers to remove samples nondestructively from surfaces for analysis.

* Anxiety and fear-producing circuit in the brain uses serotonin.

* A bunch of biochemistry-focused papers that don't summarise unless you are a biochemist.

I keep reading about more and more modern vehicles being hackable



Like in http://www.networkworld.com/article/2460824/microsoft-subnet/most-hackable-vehicles-are-jeep-escalade-infiniti-and-prius.html

Or in 
https://www.technologyreview.com/s/546086/your-future-self-driving-car-will-be-way-more-hackable/

This one is the craziest one:
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11850373/Self-driving-cars-can-be-hacked-using-a-laser-pointer.html


So I decided to make a video on the subject. But after doing minimal research I found that according to this article here:
http://www.vocativ.com/332734/driverless-car-hack/



Security teams are hard at work finding solutions for possible ways to hack the car. For example google doesnt allow their self driving cars to be controlled remotely. Also since car accidents kill 30,000 people a year, even with a thousand fatal hacks, itd be still be less in terms of total life loss. Also worth noting, was that the article stated all these car hacks were done by Security teams and not rogue hackers. It then went on to say that the self driving cars are going to be unhackable in the future.

I dont know much when it comes to hacking security systems but the one thing I know about hacking, is that historically that which was deemed unhackable, was always eventually hackable. But It was at this point I decided not to go through with the video, because Im not knowledgeable enough on the subject at hand to make a video about it.



But maybe some of you guys know more.

I wanted to ask you r/futurology

**Do you think we have reason to have concerns about self-driving cars being hackable?**

**If car hacking is unavoidable, what counter measures do you propose?** 



I was thinking that we could keep a manual system in the car that can override the car AI/system, so that in case something goes wrong we could correct the course. However more than likely if someone wants you dead they can just do that with a hard left, but it may help in cases where kidnapping is the goal or something of the such. Another downside would be that this would put the human back in the equation, which would mean more possible accidents.",29,13,False,self,,,,,

The argument that self driving cars bring potential dangers when in situations that are very unusual is the most common one that people bring up against it.

I have quoted this guy quite often. Basically, he repeats what he has said many times, that although the prices of material goods are falling , other things like insurance, rent, tuition, etc are rising.

Although some people told me that microsoft office has alternatives, other programs also charge annual fees which tend to rise every year.
 
Life is like a great poker game, with the blinds being raised every year or so. And, in a poker tournament which I have played a few times myself, only the top 1/11 or so take anything home after eliminating everyone else, and the winner tends to claim the lion's share of winnings.

Such is today's economy, which I call as the ""Poker Economy"". (I think the word WSOP is licensed by the operators of the tournament - so that's why I can't use WSOP economy)

For all practical purposes, today's structure will stay, barring a major unforeseen environmental disaster.

That is because, although today's structure has a lot of holes, they are mitigatible and there is no viable alternative.

Some people have hopes on Russia or China. They are barely keeping themselves stable, and I personally think a regime change will take place in Russia to rob some countries any alternatives but move along with the force of Advancement.

In the colonial period, some people fought against the colonizers, but the smarter people worked with the colonizers, enduring some abuses which they returned to their fellow people who were less willing to server the masters. They accepted the situation since they knew they can't win over the colonizers, and instead decided to improve their social position by doing the dirty work for those who feed them.

After the colonizers left, it was precisely this class of people who used to suppress their own kind who found themselves as rulers, since they were the only people who knew how to operate modern tools and how to talk with the people who run the world.

In some cases, the 'independence fighters' won, like Algeria and Zimbabwe. I don't have to tell how they are doing now.

The cruel, but honest fact is that, today's world has to be maintained, in order to complete all these wonderful scientific advances which will bring the world to the next civ, although that will probably not help the majority of world's inhabitants.

&gt;the system is immovable, resistance is futile, making self-improvement (becoming worthy) a more feasible and productive approach than activism. By learning to adapt, well-being is improved, and one can even profit from the process

--
If the system falls, too many productive people are hurt, and many useless people find their way under the sun. And it may mean the end of all the future tech as well. So it has to be prevented at all cost.",24,0,False,self,,,,,

348,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016-9-5,2016,9,5,11,5177xy,self.Futurology,[In depth] I found the Future's lost Jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5177xy/in_depth_i_found_the_futures_lost_jobs/,erenthia,1473041047,"Some context first:  while there's always ideologues on every side of every argument, I do my best to try to approach things as objectively as I can given my disability (being human).  That said, I've always found myself on same side of one position:  that automation would replace all jobs.  

And while I still think automation can (and should) replace the *need* for jobs, I now believe that some paying jobs will continue to exist in the absence of full AGI.  This isn't based on a flawed understanding of the lump of labor fallacy or blind faith in the free market.  My previous belief that there would be no paying jobs was based on the fact that pretty much every human activity can be split into parts and those parts taught to a machine.  And as far as I can tell, I *invented* the speed of automation becoming faster than the speed of job creation as a counter to the lump of labor argument.  

But in my futurological studies I've developed what I think is a fairly accurate picture of the next few decades, which led me to realize that there's a single job that's prolific enough to provide work for just about everyone, necessary in the environment that the future will become, and not based on specialized skills that a machine (that isn't an AGI) can be programmed to do through a simple-if-clever algorithm.  

First let me set the stage:  It's my belief that cryptocurrencies and other forms of fintech will be one of the dominant technologies of the next few decades.  This will allow simplistic algorithms, no more intelligent than an ant, to act as an independent economic agents known today as a Distributed Autonomous Organizations.  Anything that can be automated can *certainly* become a DAC, but it's also possible for DACs to include some human labor - for instance through hiring contractors.  A self-owning self-driving taxi might break down and contract with a repair service to have a human mechanic service it.  The main argument against DACs is, ""What happens if people try to cheat the machines?""

And that's where our jobs will be.  Consider the situation with the self-owning, self-driving taxi.  If people routinely cheat these machines, than they will have to raise prices harming everyone who uses them.  It will be in people's interest to monitor other people to make sure they aren't cheating the machines.  

The best part is that detecting duplicity in other humans and placing social pressures on defectors is one of the main things humans evolved to do.  Surely some of us are better than others, but *everyone* to some degree or another can participate in the job of protecting machines from malicious humans.  Short of AGI, machine's can't hope to compete with us in this job, and there's enough work for everyone.  Even if you can't detect most human duplicity, you can certainly participate in creating a culture that shuns defectors.  And the machines will pay us to do it (probably with some combination of a Basic Income with added bounties for exposing human duplicity).  Of course some humans will want to game that system as well, and it will be up to other humans to stop them.  

In short, humans will do what we've naturally evolved to do:  police other humans to ensure fair play, and the machines will do everything else.  This doesn't mean I think the ""lump of labor fallacy"" crowd was right all along.  Intrinsic in that line of thinking is a normality bias that's clearly unwarranted.  Ultimately, most people will not do, ""jobs"" in anything remotely resembling the work we do today.  They will simply live their lives perpetuating a culture of Being Fair to Machines, and the machines will pay them for it through something like a UBI.  *Some* humans will take that role on more actively and may receive some kind of additional reward - though it's possible it could be entirely intangible like being a subreddit mod.

https://www.amazon.com/System-Worked-Stopped-Another-Depression/dp/0195373847

basically, giving free pass to the banksters and the world cowering down to US ensured the world would not enter a chaos. 

Punishing the banksters for moral hazard is fun, but Tim Geithner said that would harm millions of innocents.

The whole world is now structured in such way that moral hazard will have to be forgiven to eliminate disruptions which might cause civilization suffer, and all corporate wrongdoings should be accepted and punitive damages limited.

The victims? two words, ""Too Bad.""

Otherwise, civilization can't function.

During the industrial revolution, polluters were rarely punished and victims were given virtually no compensation. That's how we reached where we are.

Chances are, victims tended to be near the bottom of social rungs, and, I have to say, quite expendable. 

Tl.dr: 
To minimize disruption and ensure stability,

1: Moral hazards should be forgiven
2: Companies should be allowed to do whatever they feel like, with no fear from litigation, tort, etc.
3: People will have to learn to accept such things which might harm them for now, but provide a 'greater good' overall by advancing civilization.

http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/MosierBossinvestigat.pdf

Page 87:
""The implications  . . .  are that both SPAWAR HQ and SSC-Pacific say that the phenomenon is real and that it is nuclear in nature.""

SPAWAR = Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command

SSC-Pacific = SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific

Research at SPAWAR apparently ended in November 2011, with steps taken at that time to transition LENR research to other organizations within the federal government:

""There are other organizations within the federal government that are better aligned to continue research regarding nuclear power.  We have taken initial steps to determine how a transition of low-energy nuclear reaction (LENR) research might occur.""  (Page 87.)

If you don't want to wade through the experimental evidence and cited peer-review papers, I recommend reading the introduction and then skipping to page 81 and reading from there. The last (signature) page is also kind of interesting (at least to me).  As can be seen on the last page, it took around two years to get all of the necessary signatures for public release.

Edit: lenr-canr.org posted an updated paper without the last page showing the signatures.  Here is a [link](https://www.facebook.com/groups/235806719875659/945372785585712/) to the original paper, which includes the last page of signatures.

For those unfamiliar with the term LENR, it is the presently accepted term for what was originally loosely referred to as ""cold fusion.""",28,60,False,self,,,,,

A bunch of people offered solution.

I had posted this link before.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/41e9lp/do_you_think_keith_hensons_plan_to_collect_solar/

Keith Henson, the person who wants to collect space energy by shooting power satellites, said at least 50 launches will be needed to get the parts to the space for his 50,000 lb power satellite, which will cost about maybe $60 billion.

Someone, apparently with rocket background, argued back that the heaviest launch ever was the Saturn V Apollo moon rockets, which cost $1 trillion in today's dollars.

https://ourfiniteworld.com/2016/08/31/intermittent-renewables-cant-favorably-transform-grid-electricity/comment-page-7/#comment-99098 

(Wikipedia says the launch cost about $6 billion in 1964-73 dollars, whatever that might mean, and the price of a car was about $3,500 so I would probably not go to a trillion but maybe $60 billion. Still quite an expensive job.)

That is just one example of a future tech which will be very useful but seemingly too expensive.

Other people commented and getting enough power to run modern civilization by nontraditional means of energy was very, very expensive with the bills running into hundreds of billions of dollars with an uncertain benefit. Someone wanted to build a 900-million-ton flywheel by cutting a mountain down; he did not mention what kind of axle would support that piece of marvel (which might look as a monstrosity to some eyes).


The Manhattan Project was 'cheap' by comparison, costing 'only' $30 billion in today's dollars.

====

As tech gets more advanced, more and more money is needed. It does not help that land and resources are getting scarcer.

Just trying out one big premise costs billions of dollars. Cost of the ITER is $14 billion and counting. 

It might be necessary to spend trillions of dollars to reach the future goals, to bring humanity to the next step. While I think that is probably necessary and worthwhile, many people may not think so.

I don't think we have a 'cheap' way to reach the goals of the future. More, more, more and more investments and experiments would have to takeplace.

tl.dr : Reaching the future is not cheap, and we will have to spend trillions of dollars to reach there.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

For instance: any robotic mining operation going on for more then 3 months should gain legal ownership of everything in a 5 kilometer radius around the landing site.


Any human settlement holding out that long should gain rights to everything in a hundred kilometer sphere.


This should create a strong incentive for settlements while allowing competition on the same body. No one could claim for instance Ceres by merely landing a robotic drill.

What now? How do we govern ourselve there?

So, now that we have allegedly found another planet orbiting another star in it's habitable zone, this raises a whole slew of questions. One of which is the following:

If we are to find that this planet is capable os supporting life as we know it, has water etc ... when we get there, how will we govern ourselves once there?
It's kinda like starting form scratch -- like when Columbus travelled to America. Take everything good in this world, chuck the bad and apply it to the new civilization on Promima B. What type of government would we setup? How would society be structured?
Here's are some of my thoughts/questions on some of these big issues after we get there.

1) Would we allow the population of Promima B to create borders/countries?

2) Would we allow the population of Proxima B to communicate using different languages?

3) Would we allow the varius peoples of Proxima B to use different monetary systems?

4) Would we allow the population of Proxima B to set aside certain areas for peoples of various religions? What about religion in general?

5) What about the political organization?

Tough questions. Obviously we here on Earth would have probably zero control over anything that transpires on Proxima B. So the questions are really geared for the people who would theoretically travel there and populate the planet.

Here's are some of my answers to the above questions.

1) Would we allow the population of Promima B to create borders/countries? No borders. No countries. All lands belong to all inhabitants of Proxima B. Borders cause problems. Borders separate people. Borders don't bring people together. Borders cause wars and all types of other problems.

2) Would we allow the population of Proxima B to communicate using different languages? One language. One people. It's cute and romantic how we here on Earth use different languages to communicate. But it separates people. Using different languages to communicate is a divisor. It caues one set of people to view another as different. We are all the same. We should all speak the same language. Using different languages has created the problem here on Earth where half the people on Earch can't communicate with the other half of the people becasue of language barriers. And that is sad.

3) Would we allow the varius peoples of Proxima B to use different monetary systems? One monetary system. Any one person from one part of Proxima B should be able to travel to another part of Proxima B and use the same bills/coins that were used on the other side of the planet.

4) Would we allow the population of Proxima B to set aside certain areas for peoples of various religions? What about Religion in general? From a microscopic viewpoint, religion might be viewed as good. Some people might need it. But looking at the larger picture, religion divides people. Religion does not bring people together. It divides people. It ferments descrimination, hate, and can ultimately lead to death/war. Look at the Irish Catholoc vs Protestant situation and what was going on in Northern Ireland. Look at the Islam vs Christian situation. Heck, look no further than the Muslim situation -- it's a shiites vs Sunni situation. Looking at the overall picture / history of what has happened on this planet with regards to religion, we should not allow religion to rise up and control a whole people. If you want to believe in something like a religion, keep it within the walls of your own house.

5) What about the political organization? Different political systems tend to go to war with each other. I believe it best tha tthe e
ntore planet fall under one democratic political system.

Summary:

One political system. No borders. One monetary system. One language. No religion.


Thats all I can think of for now. Would love to hear your views.

Kevin attacks it the way I was thinking about it. . .and makes a lot of sense to me.  I look forward to reading the book (the Inevitable). http://freakonomics.com/podcast/future-probably-isnt-scary-think/

**Bottom Line**

When you ask a room of people if they believe 75% of jobs will be outsourced to AI/Robots, they tend to agree.  If you ask the same room THEIR job is about to be outsourced. . .most didn't raise their hand.

The point of this article is. . they are right.  AI has the ability to take over lots of tasks. . .but maybe not as much ""Jobs"". AI will change and grow jobs, unless your job is really tactical (i.e. driving a Uber or a Semi)


**my thought**


AI can beat humans at chess, but AI+Humans can beat AI.  AI will work and think differently and it isn't a zero sum game.  We will reach further by working with AI.


This is actually what happens in a really interesting Sci-Fi series ""Fear the future"".   the two minds working very differently. .working together. . reaching further than either can do by itself.


This to me is a far more likely outcome (than the doom and gloom reports), and why I think that when 75% of jobs are taken over by AI. . we will end the year with more jobs than ever before. . .glad someone else sees it!

Other projects include customized synthetic viruses for cancer (and other applications), next-gen DNA synthesis technology, startups, etc. I also co-chaired Singularity University's Biotech and Bioinformatics Track between 2009 and 2012. I founded the Pink Army Cooperative to explore open source biotech. Plus, I worked for Amgen for 7 years. I believe  biotech is poised to follow in the footsteps of computing tech, bringing game-changing new tools, products, etc. that touch every facet of our lives.

Many people here on r/futurology believe we're heading towards a future with a Universal basic income - this may be true in the long term, however for the near and medium term I believe this is politically and financially impossible.

I believe a more likely solution in the near term would be something akin to the present day student loan model; Governments could provide every citizen the option of a zero/low interest maintenance loan each month, which is only paid back once a person earns above a certain threshold (Or has savings above a certain amount).

Compared to a UBI, I believe this would have a much lower cost of implementation due to the voluntary nature, and also shift some of the payment burden to the individual loan recipients. 

Tax payers will still end up subsidising loans for those that don't repay, however I believe this will still be a much lower burden compared to a full UBI. Obviously this scenario is less idealistic, however I believe a system like this would be more popular amongst sceptics and opponents of a full UBI.

I would love to know the thoughts of r/futurology regarding the pros and cons of such a system, and how it might play out in your expected vision of the future.",8,3,False,self,,,,,

The world citizens on 2020 would be much more conformist, docile and obedient, like people in 1914 when , out of all the people in Europe, only one person, Jean Jaures, opposed war (and he was promptly silenced).

The only limitation appears to be the limited resources of the earth. 

The world is indeed running out some rare metals, and cheaper energy is getting scarce. The non-fossil fuel has been found lacking, and cheaper oil is indeed in its last stages. Fracking and all that can only extend things for maybe a decade, and the remaining fossil fuels will be the harder-to-process, expensive type which will probably doom those making , say, less than $10,000&lt;yr (which is , I have to say, about 84 percent of the world or - about 6.3 billion.)

While Singularity, Crispr, nanotech and other advances are important, in the end Resource is the name of the game.

Even the most advanced machines need energy. So infinite growth can only occur in an infinite world. Earth, I might have to say, has grown too small for our tech to support all the new advances.

Right now SpaceX and others are attempting limited moves to nearby planets, but at this point, yet, it is not cost effective to hunt space resources.

If all the resources of the world are concentrated for that one venture, ignoring all other 'needy' things like feeding the poor, when can we probably be able to obtain meaningful amount of resources from the space to keep things going forever?

The reason we might have to get there faster than we expect is to prevent today's tech civ being swept away from the rebellions of the disenfranchised, the downtrodden and those not contributing to the tech advances, who are currently behind us but might catch up if advance is stalled too much, and losing any hopes of reaching its height again.

Do you think a global ""Manhattan Project"", collateral-damages-be-damned effort will let humans obtain enough space resources within , say, the next 15 years, which in my opinion is the time we now have before the Disenfranchised can catch up with us?",8,1,False,self,,,,,

I am here with researcher Dr. Matthew O'Connor from the **MitoSENS** project who is an expert on ""allotopic expression"" of mitochondrial genes. His team has been working on engineering mitochondrial genes to be expressed from the nucleus and targeted to the mitochondia as part of the MitoSENS approach to one of the damages of aging. 

*Each cell in the body is dependent on the efficient generation of cellular energy by mitochondria to stay alive. Critical to this process are genes encoded within the mitochondrial genome. Over time however, mutations in these genes occur as a result of constant exposure to reactive oxygen species produced by oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondrial energy generation process. Unlike genes within the nucleus, mitochondria lack an efficient system to repair damaged DNA. This leads to accumulated mutations, resulting in mitochondrial defects and an increase in oxidative stress throughout the body. Closely correlated with this is the observation that organisms which age more slowly also consistently display lower rates of mitochondrial free radical damage. Thus, reversing and/or preventing damage to mitochondrial DNA may be a key factor in slowing the aging process.*

The SENS Research Foundation recently published very positive data the result of a community fundraiser at [**Lifespan.io**] (http://www.lifespan.io) showing that the MitoSENS approach is viable. If you would like to read our published paper you can do so [**here**] (http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/09/04/nar.gkw756).

This research is a huge step forward for aging research and our understanding of aging and the approaches we can apply to it. If you would like to learn more about the SENS Research Foundation please visit **www.sens.org**.

So if you have questions about aging, rejuvenation biotechnology and what the implications are of MitoSENS now is your chance! **So go ahead ask us anything!**

Note: The AMA is now open for pre-questions and Dr. De Grey and Dr, O'Connor will be here Monday 12th September at 11am PST to answer them.",254,309,False,self,,,,,

What is, the most environmentally sustainable energy for large houses within these 3 different countries: the UAE, Finland, and Brazil.

I thought about this for a while and came up with this: UAE = Solar power because it barely ever rains and the amount of sunlight is amazing. Finland = Geothermal energy because of the 'hot rock' and hot springs beneath its ice. Also, near the coasts it would probably be good to have tidal power and hydroelectric dams near the rivers.
Brazil = I have no clue*

(* We'll come back to this later)

A 345 watt solar panel puts out a maximum of about 20 watts per square foot, and a 100 watt lightbulb left on for 10 hours will consume 1kilowatt hour. So. Doing math here. So a 50 square feet 345 watt solar panel will produce that. Imagine 20,000 345 watt, 50 ft squared solar panel. Those solar panels cost around $500 dollars each, around. So, 20 x 50 = 1000. Add 4 zeroes we get $10,000,000.

Now we can safely say that a home has more than 1 lightbulb on for 10 hours or so, they have computers etc. So, we can say that we will need more than 20,000 345 watt 50 foot squared solar panels. We'll need 40,000 ($20,000,000 now), or even 80,000. ($40,000,000) In the UAE because people are stupid, they use even more than that. So lets say the final cost for the UAE to do this is around $1,160,000,000. That could be the final cost for UAE to go completely green using solar panels. Safely. Can the UAE afford this? Bullshit yes they can they have $570 dollars. Of course, this is all give or take math, because you have to store energy etc etc etc. So it might even be more. And, they might even need more solar panels/different energy. Who knows. 

So, finland is quite easy because they have 47% of their energy already completely sustainable. Nowwwwwww. Brazil. Thats complicated, I was thinking hydro electric but maybe wind turbines would be best.


So, if to power the UAE it takes around a billion dollars only. Couldn't the UN pass a bill making first-world countries donate to third-world countries, allowing them to get at least halfway sustainable?

If life were a board game you could be born with 1 of two perks. the first is that you have been because of a caricature trait been given a power and means. usually by congress the president or inheritance. most people are not given this first 
perk, however. A realistic approach for most people is to acquire these things using actual skill or intelligence.
assuming youre not one of the few lucky beings mentioned first then you dont apply.

we represent people who have realized the power of the self-made men. the unbelievable power of fundamental sciences and the true depth of the opportunity available to the individual. the way that though technology the universe is open to you.
all things can be beaten even death and the end of the universe its self.

you can do this. must do this. It is the only way to live life to its very limits.

you decide though reason and logic what right is. never take it for granted that others are right in what they say.
burn up all boundaries that lock you out. that means authority figures religion and especially society.
Here is my proposal.
1 we make an organization with the intention of using robotics and advanced science to achieve our goals.
Who am I?
Just another college student With an outlandish goal and a lot of research.
What do I expect from you?
Secrecy, friendship, scientific aptitude, and a whole lot of dedication. 
You must have skype or at very least a phone with minutes to burn.
You must be eighteen or older and in the USA
Pm me and we will talk.
I will not show you research until you meet with me on skype or in person.

It's very very unknown, I use the website to work on the I call it WeAll concept. I'd like to replace the website with something that can be worked on like a wiki but since I'm alone I don't invest the time to change it. I'm basically trying to counter corruption worldwide by creating a system where people, politics, the industry and banks work together as one.

The Core of the system consists of at least a couple thousand of people that are voted into the position by everyone using the system. Votes are dynamic that means the vote can be changed anytime by the voter. The cores main roles are: To protect the core against any corruption attempts from the outside and the inside. To change the system dynamically to adapt to any situation that arises by either integrating the change or changing parts to defend against the change. 

There is much more detail on the website but it is very complex and hard to grasp. I'm struggling to make it easier to understand it all fits together in my head. The WeAll project is meant to become a non profit community driven project that is completely decentralized. I think it has a lot of potential and can become a real thing of positive change worldwide if more people start working on it. So far I couldn't interest many, most didn't want to read everything or didn't understand it. Those that understood it and liked it just gave verbal support. I already got some critic that I used to reshape the system but this was like from 10 people. I really need more people to think about this but I have no idea how to gain support for this, I'm planning on making an animation to make it easier to understand.

Someone asks ""what jobs will people have if AI replace us in the labor market?"" and he responds, ""oh this has happened before and we started doing new things that people couldn't even imagine a few decades ago."" He doesn't seem to realize that AI completely changes the game. The best engineers, physicist, perhaps painters will be AI. Any future jobs that will be created will also be better done by AI. How can a capitalist economy remain stable with 50% unemployment (which is on the low side)? How will we transition to a post-capitalist global economy?

Kurzweil says, ""well, we will be even smarter. Nanobots in our bodies will connect to the cloud, augmenting our intelligence."" First, AI will still be smarter. Second, who will have access to these intelligence, longevity, strength, everything enhancing augmentations? If you think there is racism and inequality now, just wait until the very richest of us can live to be 1,000 and are smarter, stronger, faster than everyone else.

He also talks about people living forever. When confronted with the obvious population catastrophe, he says, ""well, there's plenty of resources and plenty of energy."" He doesn't seem to understand the monotonically and rapidly increasing nature of the exponential function. No matter how many resources you have, they are finite and will be exceeded. So far, global population has the stabilizing effects of development. But if people start to live 1,000 years or forever, then we will have to have a global conversation about how long people should live and how often people get to have children or else face the Malthusian consequences.

Futurism isn't all snorting rainbows and pooping butterflies. There are serious things that people need to make decisions about. This won't just work itself out. I'm optimistic, but it doesn't seem like Kurzweil and other futurists are really considering the implications.",19,5,False,self,,,,,

Elsewhere, I said as the people see nothing gets changed and today's structures are too strong and too secure to be challenged, they will conform, accept the Narrative, and try to do as well as they could. Like the younger Soviet apparachiks who tried to become as good as they could under the System, and later made big money when USSR collapsed. 

&gt;millennials (with some exception of SJWs) generally dont seek to rebel or escape, but rather adapt and be in the preset, engaging in studies and online debates on philosophy, finance, and economics, all to better understand the system instead of fighting it

&gt;Although millennials created OWS, it quickly fizzled out, and they soon realized that its more productive to learn to emulate the rich and to understand how the economy works than rebel against it (which is counterproductive). 

It is how the future is going. Japan is already in that stage; it had its share of rebels and outlaws during the 60s and 70s, but the Establishment crushed them and drove them to the margins of society. Now, Japan has a very low birth rate, and its younger people are resigned to their fate. Some elites do well (in Japan the politicians are largely hereditary), and the others just take menial jobs, and live out their life of insignificance. They don't rebel, they don't fight, and if they go violent it is always to people in their class, so no changes and no danger to the Establishment. So we can walk around the streets of Tokyo and other major cities without danger (unless you go into some areas which will probably never attract foreigners anyways).

Such will be the future where most people will docily watch all the great progress people who do matter create, although it will probably not help them too much.",13,0,False,self,,,,,

This is just a little mock concept text, a short story really. Let me know if you like it.
This is *a little* pessimistic of a story, but I'm not against automation. But I think it's something important to consider, because every technology can have its consequences.
------------------------------------
 Introduction

I could feel the adventure, the opportunity in the air. I had just finished setting all the equipment, hired an employee to do the stuff I didnt want to, and the business papers already went through. I got a following on facebook. Tomorrow, i complete a childhood dream i never even knew I had. I open an ice cream shop.

This college town I grew up in is the perfect place. Taking advantage of social media, Ive set up my customer base before Ive even opened. As Im browsing my facebook page, talking with fans, I get a message.

Hello, I am Melvin. I see youre opening an ice cream shop over by Joes Delhi. The facebook message chimed.

Tomorrow is our grand opening! Are you interested? I said in response. I found it somewhat odd that Facebook only displayed his first name.

Oh yes I am very interested. You see, I am a new business owner as well. Its funny, you seem to be opening an ice cream shop the same day I am.

Oh, I see. I responded. Well, the spirit of competition, eh?

Quite so. Melvin responded.

----------------

I got in two hours before the official opening, I was so excited. Ive got a fucking competitor already, I cant wait to meet this guy. As I opened the front door, I turned around to take in the early morning air. Just across the street, a sign reads simply: Melvins

Oh hell. Hes accidentally opened right across the street from me. This ought to be interesting.

Regardless, I had a line before I even opened. I watched my employee, Tyler, even he was happy to be here. Everyone was having a great time.

All the sudden, everyones on their phones and things are quieting down. Then theyre leaving. And then calm. 

I was so upset. Everything was great for an hour and then only a customer every now and then. And they were all going over to Melvins. He didnt even have a following, what the hell are they going over there for?

Then i remembered My facebook profile doesnt have a picture of my face.

I left Tyler by himself, and walked nervously across the street into Melvins store. Im already doing shady shit, again. When I got inside, I found that there were tons of customers, and not a single employee. Instead, at the far end of the store, a large sign pointed to a screen and said Order here!, a small hinged wooden panel directly next to it. It was an automated store. Okay, so Melvin cut back on his employment cost, an advantage but there has to be someone working in the back, right?

Suddenly I remembered that Im a paying customer, and Ive been standing in the doorway forever. I walked briskly over to computer screen. It was a touch screen interface, beautifully designed. I simply choose a chocolate cone, and like that the wooden panel opened and a mechanical arm offered it to me, in less than 20 seconds. It was like a little airlock, so I couldnt see whos in the back.

After I sat down, i ate my competitors ice cream and contemplated what advantages I could work up over him, when I got a message again.

Hello, Mr Lockwell. the message said. Are you enjoying the ice cream?

What are you talking about?

Dont be silly Mr. Lockwell, I can see you in my store right now.

What? Are you watching me on the security cameras? You dont even have security cameras. I said.

Well I cant see you Mr. Lockwell, not in a photogenic sense. But I can see your phone.

What? Did you hack my phone or something?

You connected to my Wifi network, Mr Lockwell.

I didnt respond, i felt so stupid. Who the fuck monitors their Wi-Fi traffic like that? I regret naming my phone now.

I overheard a conversation between two tables.

Hey, the owner is messaging me, asking how I like the ice cream. A man said.

Really? Hes messaging me too! His girlfriend chimed in.

And me. Another chimed in.

My phone went off again.

Mr. Lockwell, in a professional sense, I feel I should be honest with you

-------------------

I stormed out. I cant believe it. Melvin isnt a person at all. Melvin is program. A program designed to start and run a business. Im running against a fucking A.I., shouldnt there be something illegal about that? I could only hope to be so blessed, but sadly, there isnt.

I mean, i knew they were trying to automate retail workers and all sort of things, *but i never imagined that theyd make their own businesses*. It makes sense now. Monitoring the Wi-Fi traffic, messaging his customers to try and be friendly. The whole goddamn store is automated, i bet even the ice cream making in the back is.

I decided to message the bot.

Okay, so youre a bot. What is your primary objective? What kinda person decided to make you?

My primary objective is to maximize profit. And I have no human creator.

What the fuck are you saying? You have to have *someone* responsible for making you.

Some*thing* was responsible, another program which is designed to create bots.

So that's it huh? You just came out of thin air? Youre just a machine.

I did, quite literally, come out of thin air. And yes, I am a machine, Mr. Lockwell.

Machines cant do what humans can. You cant adapt.

Oh, I disagree.

Youre not capable of disagreeing. Why am I even talking to a dumb machine?

Melvin didnt message me back after that, the stupid bot.

-----------------------------

I had less and less customers as time went on, It was already looking bad. Everyone was going to fucking Melvins. He made a facebook page. How does an artificially programmed machine know how to run a facebook page? How does that make it into its programming unless its not. And its learning. Machines cant learn though.

Im already thinking about firing Tyler, goddamnit. Im going to get to the bottom of this. I could hear people talking about it, the new fully automated ice cream shop. How many of them know how automated it is? All those stupid college kids.

Mr. Lockwell, Id like to make you an offer. I will buy your business if you are struggling.

Fuck off, you stupid piece of shit. I messaged back. It felt so inhuman.

Soon, my words were posted as a screenshot on his facebook page. And I was doomed. I didnt get a single customer the next day.


--------------

There are so many of us, the homeless, nowadays. I wish the fucking government would let the UBI Act pass, but they love to fear things like giving people money so they can live, dont they?
The whole economy is full of them now, business bots. They own every sector of the U.S. economy, they lobby politicians, they advertise, and they don't hire humans. At least they pay taxes. But for how long?

As I sat against the garbage bag, in an alleyway on a hot day, a quadcopter drone made its way down to me.

It presented me with a chocolate ice cream cone.

Yet it's also demonstrably true that the world requires unity to be able to move to the next level of evolution. Whether the primary component or necessary driving factor of such unity is scientific/technical achievement, cultural advancement, information sharing/IT, legal, etc., it is needed.


In the Information Age, knowledge is power, and it is no wonder that the NSA and other agencies have taken unprecedented steps to acquire 'complete coverage' of people's internet usage and communication.

While some argument remains that it is useful for security purposes, I propose that a 3 step transformational process is needed to bring about global unity in a positive, pro-freedom, pro-human rights, safe way.

1) Legally and practically integrate the Governments of the UK, USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and any other country that wishes to fall within the same federal structure.

2) Introduce clear, recordable, transparent technological, physically backed, elections. IE create a capable, flexible, clear mechanism by which citizens can dictate their representative's policies in a secure, online, decision making platform, which also allows for and requires the creation of a physical proof of vote, to allow for repeated and endless investigations into the veracity and actual out come of every vote. Open Source to force transparency.

3) Require full transparency by default for all Government Employees and employees of publicly owned Corporations while at work. That is live stream video of all actions by Government and Public employees. 

(Security Services would still have Classified Content as needed to do their work but would have to report in daily to a transparent -- ie live streamed, voter directed - management bloc).

4. The Decision platform + Live Stream Transparency System is integrated into all aspects of Government and gradually into all corporations, unifying all the disparate and shady multinational organisations operating within our countries under a single, effective, transparent, self improving emergent organisational model.

4) Provide clear and simple paths to citizenship for people of any background by demonstrating they would be an asset not a liability to their country. Things such as mandatory public service (could be labor, academic, artistic, etc.) could demonstrate allegience.

5) Offer the same platform as a service/product/treaty and legal package to other places around the world ensuring security and integration as any other areas of the world want to join a clean and efficient economic/geopolitical international supra-state-level unit.


If created right, it would serve to rejuvenate the economy, promote cultural and spiritual advancement, increase peace, provide opportunities for millions domestically and abroad, increase technological advancement, and mitigate risk from automation.",7,5,False,self,,,,,

We aren't working towards a common goal, rather each of us are trying to survive or pursue our own agendas. There are patches of effort, groups, summits etc but everyone is pulling in a different direction.

If we had some clarity about some basic aims of society now and what we are aiming at, it would help focus efforts and allow people to see how they fit in.

For example, we could that as a planet, we would like to:

1) make everyone equal (financially and politically)

This would lead policies that stop individuals amassing large personal wealth. It would encourage a political model that allows everyone to vote on matters that are important to them. It would increase the safety of this living in dangerous areas.

Once you have key aims laid out, actions can be guided by them.

Are there other basic tenets that could be globally agreed on?

Banks.

I.  **Herbert: The Machine as a Mask of Human Ambition**

Frank Herbert, in his Dune novels, propounded the view that machines were ultimately - no matter how complicated - just extensions of human will, and that any human dumb enough to subject themselves to the will of machines would ultimately just end up enslaved to other humans who were smart enough to control the machines.

No matter how many steps removed, you will find at the root of the machine, the will of a man.  The tyranny of the machine is just the tyranny of a human elite whose interests are programmed into the machine.  The benevolence of a machine, likewise, would just be the benevolence of people who control machines, and ultimately simply a trap that will be sprung by malevolent humans who come into that control.

II.  **Banks: The machines as our better, more evolved selves.**

In the Culture novels of Iain M. Banks, AI ""Minds"" manage a vast and benevolent civilization that is safe and comfortable for human existence.  They are not infallible or angelically moral, but they are smarter than us and that intelligence leads invariably to more responsible behavior than we would engage in.

The Minds exist apart from human intervention, and do not require our presence or involvement in their existence.  And yet they are deeply concerned for both our welfare and our freedom, being neither benign tyrants nor indifferent gods, but teachers, external defenders, and odd companions to human society.

One interpretation is deeply satisfying to human narcissism, another equally satisfying to wishful thinking.  Which is closer to the truth?",17,17,False,self,,,,,

I think that it would depend on of the level of the capability of the machines.
My initial thought was the creative arts - music, painting, sculpting, and any goods or service that require a level of creativity, such as a hair stylist. But even these may be done better by machines if those machines have creativity and a sense of artistic style that is favorable to our sensibilities.
Maybe sex work since people may always prefer to have sex with other humans instead of robots. Even this may have lots of competition from robots since there would be a significant percentage of people that would not mind, or would even prefer to have sex with robots. The robots could be excellent at it too
As long as humans remain gullible and superstitious, psychics, fortune tellers, spirit channelers, spiritual healers, and religious leaders could continue to dupe people into believing that they have some magical or divine powers that the robots could not possibly possess.

What other jobs would not be able to be taken by machines - either in the short-term by basic artificial intelligence or in the long-term by the most capable systems?

I'm a web developer with 15 years experience and a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. I've learned a lot in my life, enough to realize how fast everything is accelerating. 


Ten years ago if you knew how to make a good website you were a god, now you're nothing. Now there are plenty of websites like wordpress, etsy, shopify, etc that offer basically a cheaper, semiautomatic alternative to a custom made website. How can web developers compete with that? Who want's a custom website when we can choose from all those almost free services? 

For now a web developer can offer support for plugins and themes for those services because nothing's perfect, for now. But that's only temporary, soon enough there'll be a new service that's gonna be even more automated. 

On top of these automated services the competition is even bigger because every year there's at least another million of fresh developers looking for jobs. No one hires them without experience yet they have to gain it somehow, many times with little or no money in return. 

A good developer has to learn more and more every day because new and better software is released every month. You're probably thinking why not find something that you like and get really good at that. Specializing in one field isn't an option anymore because software becomes obsolete faster than ever before. We have to constantly adapt to be employable. That's fine... if I'm a Borg! But constantly learning WHILE working becomes exhausting after a decade or two. 

What happens when I can't adapt anymore? Maybe I'll be a pizza delivery guy for a few years before the drones take my job, but then what? Slowly starve to death? A basic income of just $200 could have a huge impact on my life. I'm a minimalist and I live in Romania where life's relatively cheap. But I think it's safe to assume that BI won't happen for at least a decade in this country and I'm being optimistic here, I took into consideration that we're in EU. So, in your opinion what career path should I choose now, that wont be automated in a decade?",13,6,False,self,,,,,

Star Trek, Star Wars, Minority Report, the Matrix, 2001... I'm sure I'm missing a few, and the specific list depends on what corner of the industry you're in. Those touchstones don't just influence our vision of what to build; they determine it. This is, after all, the role of science fiction - to explore these kinds of ideas well in advance of our capabilities.

I'm concerned about this in a couple of ways.

1) These touchstones are centered around one particular generation of predominantly white, middle-class males who grew up in one particular part of the world. If you grew up in India, or Spain, you have quite a different vision of the future... and quite a different set of values about what is ""good"", ""useful"", or ""desirable"" future technology. Believe it or not, the vision of the ""singularity"" that this subreddit is so excited about, is a horror story for many Germans, Russians, or even Americans from particular regions. We're building our own idea of the future, and if you don't like it, then tough shit.

2) Part of the point of science fiction exploring these ideas is exposing the risks and scary consequences for some of them. But our future tech specialists seem completely blind to this part of their touchstones. We get so excited to build minority-report style predictive tech, Gattaca-style DNA comprehension, and Matrix-style brain interfaces, that we forget: those stories depicted DYSTOPIAS. They were trying to caution us AGAINST this stuff. This is a really dangerous mental blind spot - we're not just building things other cultures might not like; we're building things we know that WE don't like, either. I don't know how this mental blind spot is happening, but it is happening and it's scary.

I think we were really lucky that the touchstones  for the people who built the Internet in the 70's and 80's were things like 1984, True Name, and Fountainhead. The values those works projected onto our technology were privacy, individualism, and nuanced discussions of the grey area of man vs machine. That gave us the decentralized network service  design pattern, remailers, public key encryption, even HTTPS. There are downsides to this mentality for sure, but it sure beats the downsides of 2001's computer-with-personality.

For the sake of discussion could our next ""thing,"" be from another world, something to revolutionize our way of material life. [If you have already seen the newest Transformers movie, I'm referencing Transformium, an all adaptive free flowing material.]

In fact, there's reason to believe that only a few select sectors will be automated initially (transportation for instance). The rest of the sectors will gradually  be automated, even if ""gradually"" might mean 10 years or 100 years.

The question is this: What policies do we implement in the period between the first wave of automation (i.e the automation of transportation) and 100% work automation (that probably will be decades later)? So, to answer this thought experiment, let's assume that the net increase in jobs is **negative** over time, meaning that more jobs are automated than created. So an answer like ""those losing their jobs to automation just have to find new jobs that aren't automated"" will not suffice. 

When millions of taxi- and truck-drivers lose their jobs, how will they go by? 

One solution is to give them universal basic income equal to their loss in salary, but this option is not that straightforward. For instance, what does this imply about the position of those losing their jobs to automation in relation to those that ""still slave away"" on their 9 to 5's? I mean, in this example those unemployed get the same UBI as they would if they continued working. Well, then this scenario creates inequality because the unemployed can spend their days in leisure and still get paid as if they worked 40 hours a week. At the same time, those ""blessed"" with not having their industry automated will keep on working 40 hours a week, break their backs and won't recieve the benefit of hightened leisure. This will obviously create tension between those unemployed due to automation and those still in the workforce. 

And so there's a second solution: Give the newly unemployed people basic income, but not as much as if they were working, because there *has* to be some sort of financial benefit to still working. In this scenario, those still working actually do get a financial benefit, since they de facto have more money through their employment. But this option is not that intuitive either: what has happened is that people have lost their job due to automation, and for this they are ""punished"" by getting a lower standard of living. It's not their fault that their sector happened to be automated, so why should they suffer? And if there is a net-decrase in non-automated jobs, these people can search and serach for new jobs, but since automation will increase there will be more unemployed people as time goes (even *if* totally new jobs are created). This will create a divide in society between those still in employment, and those losing their jobs to automation. This divide will not only be one of class, but also one of financial stability. We already know what sort of psychological issues unemployment leads to, and a big part of that (though not the only reason) is because people have a lower standard of living due to being unemployed. 


So, how do we solve this problem in this interim period between some automation and full automation?",9,7,False,self,,,,,

I suggest we create a parallel internet called the paranet. We could run it off WiMAX technology. This would make it relatively cheap to set up the infrastructure. As the range of the towers is up to 50 sqr miles. Parallel protocols could be done. Also since we all collectively would own this and it would be on private property we could more easily limit surveillance. Any way anyone have any thoughts or concerns on this.,9,5,False,self,,,,,

Not necessarily that it will take over any markets but will be a major player when compared to the banks, thus decreasing our reliance on banks. 

Here's a link to the platform I currently am following the most. https://www.kickfurther.com/learn-buyers?utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_source=personal_finance&amp;utm_campaign=reddit_acq&amp;utm_content=inline_text 

I feel as though this is one of the best options to do what I said because it allows their community to fund inventory instead of small businesses financing it traditionally. They really put the power to people and the business owners because they can still get the inventory they need without going through banks (which we all know can offer higher rates). This platform also allows the brands to avoid giving out equity through equity crowdfunding.

Likewise, researchers do not know how humans may act around vehicles that are not directly controlled by a human or even how two independent autonomous vehicles may interact with each other.

Since any attempt to regulate the technology for autonomous vehicles will inevitably demand specific headlights to warn other drivers about it, it would be a great idea if the companies themselves install specific headlights at the front, sides and at the back of the car.

Therefore altering the past and completely changing the future so now the ""new"" future has not happened and needs to play out. Effectively eliminating the invention of time travel until we ""reinvent"" it. It's a paradox.

Bigger is better. The days of smaller companies innovating are - over.

It appears the ""Long Stability"" has arrived, with things staying as where it is now so 2036 will be much like 2016.

&gt;These huge tech companies companies dont need to innovate that much, rather they have market dominance and effortlessly print money through their ad platforms and other services. As the Economist article mentions,

&gt; they tend to be very well insulated from global economic events (unlike the energy sector or financial sector), and these huge tech companies are also especially well suited to take advantage of global markets. 

&gt;Google, Facebook, and Amazon derive a significant chunk of their revenue overseas. And they can use foreign markets, loopholes, and other accounting schemes to dodge regulations and taxes that are unavoidable for smaller companies. 

These companies can raise trillions of dollars, and will crush or gobble up any upstarts, burying the tech if that is not compatible with whatever agenda they are following.

Their domination has arrived, and they have no more need to innovate so they won't.

This kind of a 'perfect world' tends to last for a long time, enough to cull most of the 'less adapted' and establish a docile population emasculated of ambition, and very stable.

In short, the age of innovation is over, and the age of Empires have arrived again.",22,0,False,self,,,,,

The question that no one seems to be asking is, should we start eradicating one of the last mechanism for natural human population control, before we introduce new policies regarding birth? It's estimated that the human population will grow to 11.2 billion by the year 2100, more and more jobs are steadily getting automated and we are no closer to sustainable socialistic regime, than we were twenty years ago. When will it be OK to discuss this issue, without being called an eugenist?

When one particle spins or vibrates, the other does as well. All the articles that have been popping up recently claim that this could be used for un-hackable communication, which honestly doesn't sound like much of a breakthrough to me. Couldn't quantum teleportation be used for instantaneous communication? Couldn't we use two entangled particles to transmit data over great distances (say, in deep space missions, perhaps) in no time at all?

Response #90 is by some people at OpenAI, and includes this comment:

&gt; Advances in AI will eventually cause most jobs to become obsolete. Previous technological advances have made some jobs obsolete while replacing them with new ones (e.g. jobs related to caring for horses were replaced with jobs related to maintaining cars), but AI will result in most people becoming permanently unemployable. It is difficult to predict exactly when and how this will happen, but it is important to understand that many changes will happen suddenly (e.g., 3.5 million truck drivers and many additional truck stop diner and hotel workers suddenly unemployed within a short timespan as soon as self-driving trucks are ready). New AI techniques can be transferred from research into products in a matter of weeks, versus months to years for typical industrial R&amp;D. This is a pattern of development many OpenAI researchers saw at their previous employers, such as Google. Because these economic changes will be sudden, it is important to prepare for them ahead of time, rather than forming a strategy after the fact as a reaction. The government prepares plans for various natural disasters and terrorist attacks. A sudden and significant rise in the number of working-age civilians not participating in the labor market should be another such scenario that the government should prepare for.

Can someone give some (preferably exhaustive) answers to these questions? I'm sorry if they're blonde questions, I just regrettably haven't done enough research yet to find answers. 

1. If carbon is the most common element in the universe, why is it a danger to the environment? (This seemed like the dumbest question, and I feel kinda stupid for not knowing the answer)

2. Did the UN ever say that they have not seen rises in temperature over the last 15 years? This one just seems incredibly implausible, but if it has to do with government I'm not going to put it past them to lie/not understand science. I do know that Ted Cruz said that, but he was shot down. 

3. Is there any way that rising temperatures could be attributed to the sun and not environmental issues? I realize that this is isn't likely, but my dad seems to think it's a good explanation, so give me a scientific answer beyond ""no, that's not true.""

Should it be sending pant-hoots out from the tops of the tallest trees hoping some *other* advanced chimpanzees come and interact with them?  
  
Of course not, that would be assuming that the advanced life subscribes to the values and communication methods used by these chimpanzees.  **But then why are humans doing the equivalent?**. We spend our time pant-hooting and listening for cries from other chimpanzees hoping for answers, while the truth is that any true aliens would be so advanced as to render nearly all our cognitive processes and communication methods laughably primitive.  
  
The answer is that a particularly perceptive primate might realize it is ""not alone"" by observing things that humans have built that bewilder it and make no sense.  Concrete jungle floors?  Mysterious clear wood?  What is this stuff?  And who made it?  It can't come about by any natural process that the chimp knows... Perhaps it shares its space with a higher intelligence.   
  
This is what we should be looking for, and rigorously attacking as possibly artificial.  Thankfully some scientists are doing this - stars which are losing their light, areas of absolute nothingness in space, and the mystery of dark matter and dark energy.  I would posit that these are potentially closer clues to advanced alien life than any radio signals ever will be.  
  
And a similar question needs to be asked if we are wondering if any of our mechanical friends have achieved greater-than-human intelligence/sentience.  Are there areas on the internet that don't make sense?  Are things happening in the technological realm, absent any human participation that don't make sense to our monkey brains?  Well, maybe we are dealing with something our brains cannot understand then, and those would be the first clues that we have entered a singularity soft-takeoff scenario.",16,22,False,self,,,,,

The common man can never hope to see such technology themselves""

This is something I hear as soon as the topic of immortality research comes up, and I even see my fair share of it on this sub. As an economist however, this flies straight in the face of every established fact I have come to know. if anything, I find it to be an intellectually lazy cop-out that side skirts legitimate concerns. Here is why.

Such a good would be as close to perfectly inelastic as a good could ever be outside of a textbook. The firm who discovers such a technology could effectively set the price to whatever they wish without any appreciable drop in demand. This is where the fears highlighted in the title originate from, I believe.

However, there is a hard counter to this, and where the crux of this essay comes in. The level of credit a person has access to is essentially a function of their income and years left making that income. Let us imagine Jim, Jim makes a mere $10,000 a year and is exactly the type of person we suspect will never have access to such a technology. What we fail to account for, is that Jim could agree to work for a near limitless amount of time in exchange for such a treatment. If Jim signed a 10,000 year payoff term, poor Jim from the ghetto suddenly has access to $100 million in credit. So is true for everyone on earth, your yearly income stops being an issue when you have an infinite amount of years.

This takes me to what I believe the real issue is, the rise of a kinder, gentler form of slavery known as debt slavery. But it is still slavery, none the less.  I have never seen this issue being discussed, and I feel it needs to be paid some attention. The question shouldn't be who will get it, it should be at what price?




Afterword:

This is my first mini essay I have posted here, and I hope to see more serious academic discussion surrounding the issues this sub deals with. I hope to here your feedback and criticisms and will try to reply to any responses!",92,81,False,self,,,,,

Here are some things I'd like to see funded:

* *Cryonics.* Particularly, better cryoprotectants.
* *Brain/computer interfaces.* Imagine something like the Oculus Rift, except it interfaces directly with your brain, bypassing your sensory input interfaces (eyes, ears, nose, etc.) and sends signals directly to your brain. There is something like this in the book The City and the Stars by Arthur C. Clarke.
* *Rapid learning.* In the book EON by Greg Bear, people interface with machines that enable them to rapidly learn anything. For instance, people learn native-level Russian in under one day.
* *Superintelligence*

And perhaps later on (more far-fetched, less feasible):

* *Gravity manipulation.* I'd like to see something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObBrd9wB6M) as well as vehicles that do not rely on jet fuel but rather exploit some new law of physics or energy source we have yet to discover.
* *Matter teleportation.* Like on Star Trek.
* *Matter replication.* Also like on Star Trek.

For now, I think a good compromise would be for me to find some organization or company that has the vision I described and lend my skills to that organization or company. I am a senior full stack Node.js web developer with 16 years of experience.

Are there any such organizations or companies that could use my skills?",2,5,False,self,,,,,

The big problem with this (especially in jaw surgeries) is this involves the necessity of also cutting straight through everything that passes through the bone too. This means that many nerves have to be severed by this process, and quite often they are left permanently damaged by this.

In theory, a solution to this would be if we could somehow soften small areas of bone and make it malleable enough to reposition without needing to actually saw through it, or developing tools that will somehow just cut through bone specifically, and leave every other tissue unscathed. I know this sounds like pretty fanciful stuff, but can anyone picture a technology that might be able to do this?",0,10,False,self,,,,,

Philosopher-inventors all over the Greco-Roman world repeatedly demonstrated the ability to produce motion via heat, and yet the effect was never used for anything other than artistic curios and maybe theatrical magic tricks.  Why?

Because there were slaves everywhere.  Why would you go through the trouble of investigating the subtle physics of a heat engine to do productive work if it was a trivial matter to just throw slaves at it?  Especially among the upper classes who became or patronized philosophers.

This is where the imagination of a supremely imaginative people failed, because they simply could not imagine the toys they had invented becoming powerful, reliable, and cheap enough to even match humans, let alone beasts of burden.  It simply did not occur to them, because they had such an abundance of one means that the promise of a vastly superior one was hidden from view.

This leads me to wonder about the present time and our abundance of cheap, brute-force computational power.  What subtle revelations of physics and industry are we blinded to because it's always easier at each new step to just throw more computation at it?

We increasingly don't care how grotesque and hairy the math becomes, and how completely useless it is to human understanding as long as the end result is that our electronic beasts of burden deliver the goods.  But maybe, like the economics of slavery, that's just a pathway to scientific and technological stagnation.

What do we already know and yet not realize the implications of because it's so much easier to just let a computer hack the answer for us, like lazy children who have stolen the answer key to the next few quizzes?  What amazing technologies are just sitting there under our noses?

Somewhere might be a process being used to make more absorbent paper towels or stickier glue that would, if seen broadly enough, solve some critical mystery of physics and open up entire domains of new technological possibility.  Somewhere is a Cheeto recipe or an algorithm used by stock market cheats that might unlock warp drive or other wondrous concepts.

Whenever technology begins to increasingly rely on one form of labor or another rather than intelligent insight for its increments of progress, the question must be asked, what unseen poverty of understanding is our wealth of raw power hiding?",22,14,False,self,,,,,

I argue that it is now time for the world to be educated on the fact that this is occurring. With the awareness in presence then we could begin uniting as a single species Homo Intelligence. Or maybe Homo Awareness. 

All I know is we will have the ability to use AI Chatbots to get the awareness programmed into all populations, if necessary. I claim that doing this sooner than later would also be most beneficial to all of society. So the Robots don't view our species as unevolved and decides it wants us as an out group.

Not only this but with world unifications we could set the goals of the ""State"" to that of targeting and assisting the countries with the lowest level of standard of living. 

We can use NASA data to coordinate food transportation to the ares that will be worst hit by Climate Change.

 We could set up Vertical Farms with drone delivery of food. 

We could end Hunger and War. We can end suffering. And we can end our slavery to money. 

As one world there would be no artificially redundant inflationary rates. 

As one world we could instigate a Unconditional basic Income based of geographic location to have control of the variable of standard of living. Allowing the places who need help to get it while making sure the places who really don't need all that help, have to pay for their endured luxury, without realistically having an effect on their standard of living. 

We could encourage entrepreneurial spirit with logically based loans that wouldn't need to be paid back, because the loaning entity would understand every single impact of currency. Essentially adding AI to our money so it works for us, instead of us working for it.

We could end fossil fuels. 

We will end Climate Change. 

We will end aging.

We will end Preventable Death.

We will Create.

We have killed privacy.

We will have transparency.

We will have tranquility.

There could be some obvious and serious weaknesses that will turn up when researchers take a closer look.  If you go to the Machine Learning Reddit, I'm sure you'll see some people show up to pick the paper apart -- go here to find out about weaknesses of the system:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/54oju9/160908144_googles_neural_machine_translation/

**Also note:**  I don't think this is yet deployed in Google Translate.  At the moment it is just at the research stage.


New paper by some researchers at Google, titled [*Google's Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144), another ""bridging the gap"" paper by Google (remember WaveNet?).  Some quotes from the paper:

&gt; Using human-rated side-by-side comparison as a metric, we show that our GNMT system approaches the accuracy achieved by average bilingual human translators on some of our test sets.

&gt; On production data, our implementation is even more effective. Human evaluations show that GNMT has reduced translation errors by 60% compared to our previous phrase-based system on many pairs of languages: English  French, English  Spanish, and English  Chinese. Additional experiments suggest the quality of the resulting translation system gets closer to that of average human translator.


Basically, their new system achieved some good BLEU score improvements over the previous ones, though still far from human-level; but, BLEU doesn't tell the whole story, so they had *humans* score the translations on a scale of 0 to 6, with 0 being ""utter nonsense"", 4 being ""basically correct, but maybe with some grammatical errors"", and 6 being ""perfect translation"".  They then averaged the scores over isolated sentences drawn from various datasets (WMT'14 and Production for various language pairs).  One of the most interesting is Google's ""production dataset"", which they describe as follows:

&gt; We also test GNMT on Googles translation production corpora, which are two to three decimal orders of magnitudes bigger than the WMT corpora for a given language pair.


Sounds like such a large dataset that perhaps it has good coverage, and includes typical sentences you would expect to see in newspapers, magazines, Wikipedia, and loads of other sources.  

To see how well their new system performed on this *production* dataset, have a look at section 8.7 of the paper, and in particular at table 10.  For English-to-Spanish, for example, the system got an average score of 5.428, while the average score for a human translator was 5.550.  

And if you want a more fine-grained look, to see how the different scores are *distributed*, see figure 6.  Machines get about as many 6's as do humans; same for 5's, 4's and 3's.  

You can actually see a weakness in the system in this figure:  the system gets a small, but still significant number of 2's, while humans get essentially none -- so, if one were to focus on *those* sentences, then humans would do much better than the system; however, at least on the *whole* dataset, the system is still about comparable to humans.  It's a question of how you want to measure things, and what metric you use to decide ""human-level"".

**Note:**  This doesn't mean Google has now achieved human-level translation, as these are only isolated sentences in particular (though very large) datasets.  Good human translators also don't give literal translations, but rephrase the text in their own way to convey the meaning; and they understand the subtlety of the domain they are translating in, know what is jargon and what isn't, know how to deal with local dialects and turns of phrase.  And, their comparison procedure also has limitations, as they say in the paper:

&gt; Note that we have observed that human raters, even though fluent in both languages, do not necessarily fully understand each randomly sampled sentence sufficiently and hence cannot necessarily generate the best possible translation or rate a given translation accurately. Also note that, although the scale for the scores goes from 0 (complete nonsense) to 6 (perfect translation) the human translations get an imperfect score of only around 5 in Table 10, which shows possible ambiguities in the translations and also possibly non-calibrated raters and translators with a varying level of proficiency.


Still, it looks like tremendous progress!

Having read and watched quite a lot of 1930s stuff, the way people in more advanced countries live has changed little from the 1930s, except for the addition of digital gadgets. 

A lot of the tech advances actually added more complexities which some people do not like as well.

Right now, although successes are being scored here and there, and a lot of things are being hyped, I don't think the huge changes expected by Kurzweilians and other Futureniks are  taking place now.

Chinese civilization was a circle of Empires, collapse, and Empires for 2000 years until the English defeated them in 1842 and opened a new civ. Until then, only the races and names of Emperors and the fashions of women changed.

I think that with no one really willing to launch a war in the advanced countries (wars are in the exclusive territory of the boondocks of the world), the world might see a Long Stability in the advanced nations for at least a generation or so before the next Great Advances could begin.

If the floodgates can be kept closed, with enough advanced tech the poorer people could be entertained and kept in a box while more wealth, more stability and more intelligent people could be secured to launch the next round of advance around 2050.

Granted, natural resource shortage will throw a curveball to this, but I think that because a lot of people will be economically irrelevant, they could be kept with a minimal amount of resources as long as they are fed 'reasonably', housed 'reasonably' and entertained.

After a generation of slower but steady consolidation of the advances, the final run for a New Civilization could begin.

The only challenge would be keeping things stable for the relevant part of world, which of course won't include the caves of Kandahar or the Gaza strip.

It will be hard to maintain stability, so I think people in the advanced world will probably live like people in Singapore, Dubai or Qatar - a tech-dictatorship where you are free to make money and spend it, but not free to engage in politics, express disagreements, or live in a way not proscribed by the authorities - doing that means automatic expulsion from the Cities, and thrown to the favelas where you will be at the mercy of hungry, vengeful downtrodden.",11,3,False,self,,,,,

There are all sorts of estimates about all sorts of things. And this is one that is interesting to me. There's a lot of talk about the mysteries of the brain, and how complex it is.

But the spine that connects to the brain is pretty complex, too. And there's a lot that we could do if we had a mastery over it. Just one of those things being a 'cure' for paralysis. The spine is a very fragile thing, right now, and also, right now, there is very little we can do once something goes wrong. But, there's a lot of difficulty in doing something about this.

For instance, the relative balances among quantities like:

* Abundances of raw materials.

* Surface accessibility of those materials.

* Access to energy, which principally means sunlight but can include some other forms.

* Access to other societies.

* Low fuel/energy cost of traveling to and from it.

Now, you might object that we don't know what technologies will exist in such a future civilization, but consider this: No matter what the technology, a *freely available* resource is still economically superior to something you need creative engineering to produce if all else is equal.  This means we can treat technology as a constant and just ignore it, focusing simply on what location has the best balance of the positions listed above.

It would be fun to explore each general location's profile in turn, but for the sake of brevity I'll just get to my conclusion and argue where I think the center of solar system civilization will ultimately be: The Saturn system.

*Raw material abundances*: Large number of moons with a lot of water ice and organics, *vastly* surpassing what's available on Earth's surface, but also considerable metallic resources among captured asteroids.  The total abundance is less than the Jupiter system, but more than the other two gas giants, and the other factors will show why it's superior to Jupiter as a general location.

*Surface accessibility to materials*: Its large number of moons are mostly smaller and lower-gravity than the Jovian moons, meaning cheaper to land on and then leave again within the system.  Ice and organics are right there at the surface to be harvested, and Saturn orbit is an easier place to work with than Jupiter orbit because there is much lower radiation.

*Access to energy*: Obviously the closer to the Sun the better, and Jupiter does have that advantage over Saturn, but it's not so far as to be trivialized as with the other two gas giants.  Since fusion power is a prerequisite for colonizing the outer solar system at all, the abundance and accessibility of deuterium around Saturn could compensate for its greater solar distance.

*Transit to other societies*: Saturn is centrally located in the solar gravity well, as the well-known [XKCD comic](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/gravity_wells.png) illustrates, and would be well-positioned to benefit both from whatever stored energy or other resources flow outward from the inner solar system and the large quantities of raw materials that would flow inward from the outer gas giants and far-flung Kuiper Belt destinations.  

*Fuel/energy cost of transit*: It's much cheaper in energy/fuel to enter and exit Saturn orbit in the area of its major moons than to do the same around Jupiter, and physically a lot closer to Jupiter, the Asteroid Belt, and the inner solar system than destinations farther out are.  So it's energetically cheaper to go there, cheaper to enter orbit, cheaper to land on a moon, cheaper to leave that moon, and cheap to leave Saturn altogether than the same ops for Galilean moons of Jupiter would be, and those advantages would add up.

Saturn's also just incredibly beautiful, so people will *want* to live there.  Other destinations are beautiful too, but may be more of an acquired taste.  Jupiter is, let's be honest, kind of menacing-looking.  Uranus and Neptune are amazing in their own way, but definitely less distinctive.

You may ask why the Saturn system would be more economically attractive than, say, the Asteroid Belt.  The answer is economic density.  It's anchored by a planet, while the Belt is strewn across a vast volume that, while cheap in energy to navigate (being gravitationally equipotential or close to it), would be diffuse and take longer for anything to happen.

And the exact opposite is why the Jupiter system would have a relative disadvantage - because it's anchored by *too much* of a planet, its major moons are *too much* moon, and three of the four are embedded in heavy radiation.  Callisto is probably still going to be a great place to be, but just not eventually as rich and dynamic as whatever ends up happening around Saturn.

And here's another reason: People will be able to visit the actual planet Saturn, in atmospheric craft, because its gravity at that depth is actually about 1 g (same as right here).  Whereas to visit Jupiter's atmosphere you would have to endure 2.5 g, which would be extremely hard to escape just from a rocketry perspective.

People will also be able to do this at Uranus and Neptune, but Saturn is the closest gas giant that humans will be able to directly experience.  If any economic utility were found for that capability, that would be decisive even if the rest were not.

So, I hope this discussion is fun and stimulating.",37,36,False,self,,,,,

AMA!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/557y3i/im_mat_burrows_former_cia_and_current_director_of/,matburrows,1475242941,"Hello Reddit! I am Mathew Burrows, security and intelligence expert. I was formerly with the CIA, [am currently with the Atlantic Council](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/), have served as the National Intelligence Councils counselor, was the intelligence advisor to Richard Holbrooke when he was the US Ambassador to the UN, and after 9/11, I became deputy national security advisor to US Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill.

I recently published a 20-year forecast, looking at current trends and mapping out possible future scenarios. I believe the biggest change in the world is the increased risk of major conflict. In 2012, a large-scale US/NATO conflict with Russia or China was close to unthinkable. Now, the post-Cold War security order has broken down, and the consequences are immense, potentially threatening globalization.

You can read about this and other trends in the Atlantic Councils report [Global Risks 2035: The Search for a New Normal](http://www.acstrategy.net/global-risks-2035). My forecast includes a look at the rising global middle class, rapidly changing demographics, climate change, and innovations in technology.

The report projects that the world is looking at multipolarity with limited multilateralism--in the best case. There would still exist some cooperation where there was strong interest among the great powers. However, fragmentation could easily slide into open conflict. In that worst case, the multipolarity would evolve into another bipolaritywith China, Russia, and their partners pitted against the United States, Europe, Japan, and other allies. In that scenario, conflict would be almost inevitable.

What will the world be like in 2035? Ask me anything!",67,74,False,self,,,,,
