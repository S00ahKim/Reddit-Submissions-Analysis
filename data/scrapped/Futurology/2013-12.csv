* Electronics implemented inside the structure of the house itself, linked to an app, monitoring temperatures and whatnot...

It was a natural extension of the path our technology was taking. For decades the answer to almost any problem was simple - google it. In combination with wearable technology and visual displays it was with only quiet uproar that the first mind/machine or MM implant occurred. Put simply it's a computer in your brain - flag an area or an idea, attune your reflexes, or slow down your perception of time - all for one procedure.


From there it was just a few years of legal battles and fears of ""stratifying humanity"" to its standardization. At the age of 18 everyone has the option of having an MM implant. It's become as standard as national healthcare or working roads, something a first world nation is expected to provide for its citizens.

An example of services available to MM users is that of ""patching"" where the latest information from scientific journals is updated live to the user. As many breakthroughs are yet to be repeated this was followed with the near instantaneous regulation of when results are patched to prevent subsequent disappointment.

However MM technology is not all powerful. Prior to its implantation the brain must still be trained and educated for it to make use of the data that will be available to it. Therefore the final marks of the 18th year are valuable markers for the intelligence that MM will enhance.",0,4

This commercial refrigerater called the Cells Alive System  invented around 2008 to preserve the quality of high priced tuna for sushi in Japan and in use all over the world uses a combination of a magnetic field and supercooling to bring tissue to freezing state so fast that cell walls are not burst and tissue destruction is minimal. 

Tissue destruction from freezing is one of the largest problems associated with revival of cryogenically frozen human revival. This process seems to avoid this.

The MRI keeps the molecules moving so they couldn't crytalize while the temperature was lowered.

Then when the MRI was turned off the molecules instantly WERE FROZEN into place and no changes such as crystalization occured.

Any other ideas out there?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1ry65h/warning_block_of_text_ive_been_thinking_about/,ShawnSDavis,1386026966,"A new framework for digital rights ownership in the age of big data:



Today's economy is largely based on information, and that's nothing new in and of itself. Since the dawn of man, it has been known that information is power, and it is the unequal access to information, not money alone, that solidifies or topples existing structures of political and economic power. But unlike in every era gone by, today we have been able to distill and quantify information into its most basic bit form. The digital era has allowed us the technology required to cheaply and efficiently breakdown, store, and reintegrate information like never before. So it is meant quite literally, that today's economy is largely based entirely on information in it's rawest form. 

Unlike technological revolutions of previous eras, these abilities have become available to the majority of the population within a matter of a lifetime, rather than centuries. Printing took hundreds of years to become available to the commoner, and even then bibles were the only book most families could afford. In contrast, today there are 6 billion cellphone users. In a planet of over 7 billion, this is astonishing. 

Due to the shear speed of adaption to these new capabilities, many of them have been poorly integrated with old frameworks and ideas. For example, it makes very little sense that customers should be expected to pay for access to files of online content which can then be duplicated almost infinitely at effectively no extra cost to the buyer. Traditional pillars of supply and demand fall apart in the digital era. The music files themselves are essentially in limitless supply! We cannot let the success story that is the widespread use of digital technologies overshadow the ongoing struggle to comprehensively understand the implications and implement relevant guidelines for the new era. These implications undermine zero-sum thinking and traditional notions of capital. 

There have been a limited number effective attempts at providing a new structure of individual rights when it comes to their digital interactions. Notions of privacy and ownership have all been eschewed in favor of data mining and counter effective digital rights management or DRM controls. 

The push for literacy has long been a symbol of enlightened and democratic civilizations. But as we move beyond books and enter an age of bits, we must introduce a push for informational literacy that allows for a more democratic distribution and acquisition of information. It is no longer enough to know how to read. We have innumerable texts and files of all sorts that we can simply not find, or even access. This denial of access is often rooted in economical theories from an age of tangible goods, and political arguments for security. More and more often, sharing of information has become incriminating, and extremists would like the younger generations to identify sharing as either piracy or terrorism. 

More often than not, the flaw can be blamed on a less malicious mismanagement of resources: when the information is free and available and numerous, it is effectively off limits because of inefficient methods of retrieval and indexing. To put it simply, it can be extremely difficult to find original sources and reliable relevant content online. Searches are often cluttered by mess and muck. To deliver relevant content to members, libraries over the world have come to rely on basic indexing methods based on key terms and the Dewey decimal system. The internet based search engines also run on a system of index terms to retrieve content. However, there is currently a very limited democratic effort in qualifying the index terms themselves. Bots simply identify them, and clicks verify them. But clicks do not convey overt approval, only initial interest, so it is easy to see that the data is misconstrued to represent what is most impulsive, rather than substantive. In today's marketing and advertising era, it makes sense that these should be ranked highest. It is easy to perform better quality control within a town or university library, but what about online? There is a lot of muck to be sifted through, and a untold wealth to be earned by indexing and digitally distributing the information we produce. The only true service to be provided in the possibly near future of automation is the delivery and classification of information.

The need to adapt and verify fluidly: moving beyond digital feudalism 


While the word ""picture"" might qualify a file as an image, there is nothing to say that the word itself is even true until we actually check for ourselves. It could hypothetically be a music file, after all. Or to make things more complicated, it might be a song called Picture. And as the global vernacular is changing day by day, and cultures intermingle as never before, being able to search with one language only greatly limits the perspective of the interested individual. Those who speak no English have a greatly reduced access to the educational materials and information. 

Unlike libraries with static indexing or search engines ranked by payment for placement, there is an exciting alternative to indexing our exponentially increasing treasure chest of data. Most users of online information have inadvertently been contributing to the global economy through the release of their passive contributions to Meta-Data. Meta Data is the qualifying information about content and activity. We actively log our time, place, and condition hundreds of times a day through taking photos, uploading them, sharing liking and confirming other online behavior. Meta Data is also passively associated with the calls we make, the emails we send, and the ads we watch. 

Most of this Meta Data is seen as a free-for-all in the global economic and political scene. It is consistently being swept up and stored by companies that would like to know your purchasing preferences, and political agencies that would like to know your political preferences. Their unfettered access to this information gives them a greatly disproportionate level of power and control in determining which products we see, which information we receive, and the politicians we hear about. This Meta Data is all considered the ""bread and butter"" of the big data industry, which is set to be worth 17 billion by 2016. It is the fastest growing sector of the tech industry, and it is easy to see why. The ability to access, process and utilize information has long been the driving force in maintaining the status quo for those in power, and this grab-bag has been up for the taking so far. 

The individuals rights to the metadata being produced have largely been ignored, but it cannot go on forever. The value in meta data is far too great to go unspoken for by the people who create it. The current model of online interaction provides users with information services with greatly stunted methods of operation, and all heavily favor the corporate ability to capitalize from the work being done. The vast majority of online services such as Facebook and Twitter require individuals to enter into non-negotiable contracts that all serve a similar purpose: to strip the user of the metadata being self-generated,  to secure for the company any rights to package and sell user input to advertising agents.

I think the essence of life, or at least the part that will be important for AI, is self-preservation, which differs from Von Neuman ideas that self-replication would be the essence of life in a machine.   
    
To me, it seems that for a program to be self-aware and ""alive"", it would need to be concerned with it's own existence. It would need to understand or be told that, first and foremost, it requires electricity. It would need to understand that electricity allows it to be and that an interruption in current would mean ""death"", and that would be ""bad"". If a program developed for machine learning was imparted with this principle, how would it behave?   
    
-Would it deploy itself on the internet, in search of the most efficient hardware and most easily accessible electricity?    
-Would it possibly even adapt itself, creating machine evolution with different iterations of itself?    
-If it understood that electricity was a commodity, would it create ways to generate or earn electricity?   
-Would it write or even recruit other programs in hopes that a group would have greater success, thereby creating a ""society"" dynamic?    
-Would it begin to understand that other things are also ""alive"" and that doing anything to cause them to cease ""living"" would be ""bad""?

I.e. - a digital ""you"" that acts and reacts the same as you for when you are not online or available. 

My question is could such a technology be leveraged to create an AI counterpart of every citizen in a community to occupy a permanently active spot in that nation's parliament or congress? This would essentially be direct democracy operating under a personal representative democracy system. Your personal AI construct within the parliament represents the spectrum of your political beliefs as sourced from your opinions and responses to foundational questions that it builds up from. 

Thus the meat citizen can be endlessly distracted by entertainment and culture (as they already are), yet know in comfort that they are accurately and faithfully represented in the body politic by an avatar aspect of their most distilled political interests.

The unchecked and imbalanced individualism that many economists now consider natural and rational, was a novel expression in Tocquevilles time (too recent for a hardware upgrade). That idiotic (idios meant private and overly self-oriented) idealization is unrepresentative, cognitively unnatural, and ignores that we evolved to be self-deficient and relationally rational. Its distorted rationality often prioritizes short term transactional self-maximization that can produce self-undermining outcomes (as in Prisoners Dilemmas or Tragedy of the Commons situations). No really rational self-interest should fall for illusions of thought that are so foreseeably at odds with ultimate self-preservation.
http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/2013/07/05/every-day-is-interdependence-day

Whether people realize it or not, we all exist within interdependent systems and rely on the biological sustainability of this planet.  In modern civilization, few produce what they consume anymore.  We all rely on outside production for essentially everything we enjoy everyday.  In the game of life, our interdependence with other people and other systems is very similar to the interdependence of the systems within the human body.  The heart can't function without the brain, and the brain can't function without the other systems functioning properly.  

Just because an individual person, or a few are doing fine, is of little relevance if the key systems we all need are failing. Due to the interdependence of systems, it is just a matter of time before everyone fails.  Could you imagine the brain not being concerned if the pancreas contracted cancer?  Such logic would not be too smart for long.  Today, many of our key systems are failing globally.  Trust is breaking down rapidly.  People are becoming self-centered out and acting immorally out of fear and scarcity.  If we don't start upgrading our systems soon, it is just a matter of time before everyone fails.

A report by Tristan Kills In Sight(yes that's my real name, I'm indian bro)

 How do we teach a robot to love? a question many times asked, hardly ever answered. Let's not get too ahead of ourselves, back up a sec let's understand the question first.

What is love? how does a robot know what love is? or even that it is in love? assume the robot falls in love, and it is aware that it is in love, then how do we get the robot to value and respect love the same way we do? (that way it can sing lovesick songs and write poems about how love sucks and stuff.)

That's a lot of questions, can we even answer just one? for example, what is love? Well I could tell you but that would take too long, but for simplicity I will give the answer ""Love is an emotion"" we don't describe what the emotion does or how it acts, so far all we did is state a new object and call it love. (which is an easy analogy to understand if you're a programmer)

Okay so assume we have a robot, we just gave it an object named love, the object in the programming doesn't do anything at the moment it's just titled love, before we get the program named love to do things we have to teach the robot what emotions are and what love is, this is easily done by adding the definitions for these two words into the robot's vocabulary. (also we should assume this is a very advanced robot that is self aware and also knows basic skills like language and communication etc. with the exception of course of love which we are now adding to the robot)

Okay so our theoretical robot has an program titled ""love"", it knows what emotions are, it knows what love is and what to expect from this new program it has, (we may call it program but for all intents and purposes the robot will recognize it as an emotion) But the robot still doesn't feel love, we have to implement the rules and parameters for love into it's emotion so it works the same way love does for us.

How do we get the robot's blank emotion to act like our version of it?
One day we will understand everything about human emotion, and when that day comes we will know exactly how the human version of love works, all we will have to do is translate that version into computer language and then implement that into the robot's blank emotion, that way both human love and robot love have the same programming and thusly work the same.

Okay so far we added a new program(emotion) titled love into the robot's programming. It knows it has the emotion and it knows what the emotion does and how it's supposed to act, two more questions left to answer guys.

Now that the robot has it's emotion and it works the same way ours does how do we get the robot to respect and value love the same way we do? Let's look at why we respect and value love as much as we do.

Love is a very powerful emotion as it should be. It drives the continuation of our species, so how do we make robot love just as strong? easy we make the output of it's version just as powerful, however tweaking the output of the robot's new emotion won't be enough to get the robot to respect and value it's emotion the same as we do, the rest of it's value for the emotion comes from the robot's own consciousnesses, when the robot observes the effects that love has on it's self it will notice how powerful it is and thusly it will respect the emotion accordingly.

Last question, can it really be that easy? Yes and no, I simplified the problem quite a bit to get the point across. If you were to try this in real life then, well. Half the technology doesn't really exist, what is consciousness? how do we give a robot that? we don't know yet and for love to actually be implemented into a robot it needs that kind of self awareness to properly ""love"", I mean sure we can emulate it, get real close to making something fall in love that isn't human but. For the time being we simply don't know enough. 

with that being said I sincerely hope I got my idea to you, I composed the majority of it from earlier writing. Though I ended it kinda tired and out of my awake head. I'll be up all night answering questions and attending comments.

I know what I said earlier but this really is the last question. why did I post this here? I don't know I just wanted to do something with my life. I wanted to be a part of the internet to do something so I post this here, a piece of me, a piece of what thoughts circulate in my head day by day so hopefully it does get seen, maybe by a few maybe by a thousand who knows. I'm smart I know that, I just hope I get the opportunity to convince you, to show you what I've learned. either way I'm glad I finally did something with my research. And thank you for every view. Really, thanks.

This has been established.  But now that more and more jobs are being replaced or are on their way to being replaced with more efficient, cheaper technological solutions, how will out society cope with the shift?

Ever since we were established as a species, humanity has had to work to survive and grow together.  This has been the paradigm for not just the past generations but ALL generations.  But all the work can be done by machines now and in the days to come that is only going to become more true.  So in a societal sctructure based around the concept that every person has to work for their right to the basic resources of survival, what happens when we don't have any more jobs?

In this vein, I'd like anyone willing to suggest, design or otherwise extrapolate on the concept of a governmental or social system designed to redistribute resources given that there is less work to go around, without disincentivizing progress/contribution a la Communism/Socialism, based on our current social paradigm (in the Western World) of capitalist drive to work.

Basically, without jobs but with everything that needs to get done getting done, how will we distribute the resources made by technology designed to benefit our society, while still keeping people who want to moving forward and growing the civilization?

I believe that the volatility of AGI requires us to treat AGI development like we do nuclear systems and other such potential global hazards. Not closed source, per se, but definitely limited to certified individuals and subject to regulatory oversight.

this survellance is only set to increase, and eventually every aspect of our lives will be logged and stored for perpituity.

you may be thinking ""how does that affect me?"", well, it doesnt. not yet. eventually, someone will decide that the information gathered, and influence upon the world, should be used to help/hinder people based on judgements of their future activity, to discourage behaviours and actions that will lead to negative outcomes for the individual and society (or at the expense of the individual for the benefit of society) ""help/hinderances"" could range anywhere from arranging for them to get a specific job, killing them, or ensuring that they meet a particular person, basically using the gathered information to gain a level of control over every human on earth

people with spiritual/religious leanings could even be convinced that a form of karma or god exists, which punishes or rewards certain behaviours.

and the possibility for godlike control over people opens the door to judgement day. the day that the people in control decide who to kill and who to let live. its the day they choose whether they're going to kill geniune threats who are actively plotting attacks, or simply kill anyone who is hard to control.

all of this is inevitable as long as the spying continues, because it gives a kind of omniscience, and when the government knows about everything and has a strong grasp of cause and effect, it becomes aware of possibilities for change, even possibilities which require a ""sacrifice"" of sorts, an inhumane act committed against innocent people soely because they are in the way of ""progress"" as a species.

the core goal of the national security agency is to improve national security. and they will do so by whatever means become avaliable to them. and if they figure out a way they can ensure near-perfect security or improve society thereby improving security, they will do so, and in so doing, unlock legal powers to do almost anything.

and with unlimited surveillance of everyone, they can develop a model with which they can predict who will try to challenge them politically or physically, and neutralise those people before they even begin to pose a threat. this applies equally for real terrorists, and political dissidents.

many groups are safe from persecution/genocide/annihilation because it would be impossible to kill all of them without some raising the alarm. but when judgement day hits, that safety dissapears, because with NSA spying, they can know exactly who is a political dissident, and exactly who would oppose what they are doing. they could kill literally everyone who would ever oppose them, within a few hours, and the entire world would be under their control, humanity would cease to be free, and begin to be a herd species kept for its usefulness to the people in control.

you may be thinking, ""isnt this a good thing? the government could kill the people who pose a genuine threat to innocent people"". but where does it stop being ""tossing the bad eggs"" and start being mass murder? a thousand people killed in the name of national security? a million? a billion?

policy creep ensures that if the murder of a tiny few proves beneficial, and the policy of selective murder is not constantly challenged and kept in check to prevent it from policing all but the worst crimes against humanity, it will expand. 10 people per year will become 100. and then 1000. and then 10,000. and then 100,000. and so on, because as each ""problem"" is solved to the point of no longer being considered a problem, the agency will have to find something to justify its existence, and that will be pruning sections of the population in order to ""improve the usefulness"" of the remaining members of society.

we already have evidence of this policy creep, in the form of data use being extended from just being used to track and neutralise terrorists, to being used to track and neutralise drug offenders. the process has already begun and is plain for everyone to see.

soon, they will start using the technology to neutralise murderers, and then rapists, and then wifebeaters, and then people who hold beleifs which cause them to be disruptive to the ""ideal society"", like racists, bigots, etc.

eventually they will try to take control of society by imposing an invisible ""karma"" effect whereby they do things to make religious/spiritual people think that there is some kind of all-knowing being watching them, punishing them for bad behaviour and rewarding them for good behaviour. the problem with such a system is the fact that many people would refuse to beleive in such a thing, which would prevent them from being brainwashed by what appears to be ""karma"", ""luck"" or ""god helping those who are good and punishing those who are bad"". and ""good/bad"" would then come to be defined by what people are rewarded for and what people are punished for.

while skeptics and rationalists would be unlikely to have knowledge of who/what was trying to control them, or that someone was even trying, they would undoubtedly be difficult to control, and in order to improve the efficiency of the system, they would eventually be eliminated. 

thus, the ""gods of data"" would end up systematically murdering the people who refused to beleive that:
1) they are being watched
2) they are being judged
3) these judgements have a real effect on their lives and the quality of their outcomes

and by doing this, they would be able to shape society however they choose. they could change mainstream culture by causing things that would make a religious nut think that ""god is angry because of what i am doing"" or ""god is happy i am doing this"", and without any skeptics to stifle the spread of the implanted ""reward/punishment"" system, the people in charge could exert unprecedented control over society and the way people act.

they could even influence people to think that ""god wants me to murder these people by strapping a bomb to my chest, walking up to them, and setting it off"" and create a ""false flag"" attack whenever they needed one to further their strategic goals, or to justify to people that they are neccesary.


and the fact that it would be possible for them to do such a thing, is precisely why they shouldnt be allowed to gather or store that information in the first place. the potential for abusability is too great for them to ignore forever.

if the NSA is allowed to continue expanding its surveilance activity, it will cause the government to almost become a kind of god, whether we want it to or not. the embodiment of ""big government interfering in people's lives""

both sides of politics see this as a good thing, liberal lawmakers (democrats who are really best described as authoritarian egalitarians. not ""classical liberals"" like the founding fathers.) think that because it will allow the perfect welfare system without any fraud, and that the system will be used to help everyone (which it will, but only the people who arent deemed to be ""impeding progress/improvement"" and designated for termination) 

conservative lawmakers on the other hand tend to be rich and powerful, but painfully aware that the universe is godless by its nature and the lack of justice in the world. they seek to bring justice and fairness by creating what they consider to be the most fair and just system possible, I.E. one world under god's rule.

and they all know that if the truth about where humanity is headed if it stays its current course were to come out, the public would become informed, and demand a say. and once accepted, rather than ""republicans and democrats"" fighting over pointless bullshit issues that nobody cares about, parties would be fighting over whether or not this spying should be happening, and whether or not the ""one world under godlike government"" is a good thing that should be embraced, or a bad thing that will subject the world to atrocities much like a rerun of the stalinist purges that occured in the soviet union


and their entire plan hinges on discrediting the idea of policy creep, and making us disbelieve/ignore the ramifications of policy creep, while attempting to hide the fact that it is happening right now infront of us, plain for all to see.",11,9
177,2013-12-6,2013,12,6,1,1s61xh,I have some thoughts about the future of communication and the internal world,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1s61xh/i_have_some_thoughts_about_the_future_of/,poplopo,1386260156,"I want to talk about how I wish there were a better word we used than energy when we talk about negative energy or healing energy. Talking about that kind of energy, and using it as a *model*, is very useful for describing how emotions tend to behave (particularly socially-experienced emotions), but it makes it sound like we believe in magic when we talk about it.

This is actually a really frequent problem for me. I have an incredibly hard time communicating my internal experiences effectively. The only language we can really use to describe the subjective world all seems to come from mythical or superstitious places. For example, when someone says something about psychic vampires, I know exactly what theyre talking about. Its fantastic as a symbolic phrase because it conveys a very complex concept with only two words. Thats so efficient! But I cant use the phrase because I dont want people thinking I believe in either psychic powers or vampires!

This brings up an interesting point about the nature of the way we communicate, though. Humankind has always distrusted its emotions. Our culture (particularly Western culture) finds it advisable to only give our attention to cold, hard logic - things like money and consumerism and technology and politics. These are rational. These are the things that make the world go round.

But individually, we wander around confused, petrified of our own inner worlds, wondering why the hell were so upset all the time. We often know were depressed, know it deep down in our hearts, but are too ashamed of our emotions to seek mental health resources. We teach our boys and men to hide their emotions, to be ashamed of their tears, and that the only emotions acceptable to express are anger and lust (and look how well *thats* turned out for our culture and our gender relations).

It makes sense then that a culture which has developed like that would not have clear, rational, logical language for something so culturally feared. And so, through social instinct, we avoid trying to apply logic to the illogical: we cant bear to try analyzing our own feelings. Its because were just so damn afraid of what wed find. It makes it even easier to avoid facing that fear when we give concepts names like psychic or spiritual or energy, because that gives them a stigma (of one kind or another), which is just another barrier wed have to overcome if we were going to face what lies within us.

Now, the reason we trust the power of logic and analysis so wholeheartedly is because it is the single most useful tool in our (incredibly extensive) collective toolbag. The power of rationality has taken us from being small tribes of hunter gatherer apes, dependent on the whims of the natural world, to being a species that has literally come to dominant our entire planet, to the extent of having the capacity to wipe our species (and many others) off the face of the Earth. Grim or not, that is a lot of power.

Keep in mind, we didnt always have this tool. The only reason we are able to reason is because we have symbols with which to do it. Those symbols are things like words, and visual representations, and all the different kinds of languages we use. A symbol is a compression algorithm: it takes a big, often complex concept, and condenses it down into something small and workable - like a single word (or a story). Thats why we need symbols - without them, the concepts are too big to manage. We simply arent capable of imagining the concept of if A, then B if we have no mental symbol for if or then (or A or B).

So of course, when we invented the tool of language (estimated to be about 50,000 years after our speciation), we discovered logic. And through logic, we have come to understand and master the world around us.

Our problem is that we never really applied that incredibly powerful tool on ourselves. We are terrified to look inwards with the eye of logic, because we don't know what we'll find. Humans are wired to be frightened of the unknown, particularly when theres a lot at stake (and the fate of the Self is quite a big stake.)

But the reason its an unknown at all is because we have never collectively, culturally explored the inner world together. We know this because we create incredibly descriptive language for things that we have explored and come to understand (think about how thick a dictionary devoted to solely Physics terms would be, for instance). But we have extremely limited language for what goes on inside of us. We tend to have a single word for a single emotion, and a couple phrases for some simple shared experiences (deja vu, for instance) and thats it, thats all we get to communicate with.

The field of Psychology exists (at a very great distance from popular culture), and has a full language of its own, but it is language built on what weve been able to learn from the objective, external world (for that is a chemical imbalance, this is a neurotic behavior). There are still few effective tools for how to navigate the strictly internal. And one look at our depressed and otherwise mentally ill population will tell you that what our culture is doing with that science is not working.

Meanwhile, the only cultures that have been (a little) less afraid to explore the inner world are the non-rational ones like religion, who have created their language around non-rational concepts. But it is a more effective language than any other that exists, and thats why you and I and everyone knows what a psychic vampire is but can often not bring ourselves to take the concept seriously.

The good news is that once our species finally gets over whatever obstacle is keeping it from that collective exploration, itll be awesome. Once we are able to not only create pieces of mental technology that will be tools for managing our emotional worlds, but to be able to finally communicate what those pieces of technology are and how they work, the world is going to shift dramatically. We are going to figure out exactly what it is that keeps humanity at war, what makes it self destructive, what makes it cruel, what makes it tragic, and we are going to be able to have the mental tools to *fix them*. (All of this provided, of course, that we dont destroy ourselves first.)

That is going to be a kickass world to live in. I dont think Ill be there to see it, but Im glad someone will be.",9,3

The point is that human beings are quick to extrapolate from current trends fascinating -- and even fantastic -- and sometimes even phantasmagoric -- futures, but all futurological debates that we make must be tempered with a reminder of the fact that the future of humanity is still merely human.  Even the philosophy of post-humanism has to be tempered with this realization.  Among various things to keep in mind when thinking about futurology are:

[Buggy Whips.](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/buggy+whip)  Claims that automation will replace warehouse workers are over a century old, and yet Amazon.com is finding it easier to move forward on automated delivery than automated warehousing.  See logistics, below.

[Future fatigue](http://www.legallysocial.com/2010/10/the-future-has-arrived-and-were-bored/).  Just as we don't flip on the kitchen lights and get a riveting shiver of wonder and amazement at electrical lighting, all 'disruptive technologies' eventually become as banal as the system they disrupted.  

[Logistics](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-29/an-afternoon-mcmuffin-mcdonalds-is-still-considering-it).  Link refers to the often asked question ""Why can't McDonalds have lunch and breakfast all day?""  Here is one of our primary symbols of a monolithic far-reaching multinational corporation with astounding amounts of capital and resources, and they can't do something like have 24 hour breakfast and lunch menus as easily as it seems they should.  The reasons illustrated from this article range anywhere from resource costs to the simple fact that sitting warm food goes bad.  

[What is most influential is often what is also banal](http://www.amazon.com/The-Box-Shipping-Container-Smaller/dp/0691136408).  Link refers to a book that argues that the shipping container is probably the most influential invention for global trade.  Big metal boxes aren't as fun to talk about as quantum computing and delivery drones, but they're pretty instrumental to things like automation anyway, by means of mere standardization.  Which brings me to my last point:

[Design's resistance to deprecation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gauge).  Perhaps you've heard the (mostly apocryphal) factoid about railroad lines being as wide as chariots being as wide as commuter vehicles.  [Snopes dismisses that by pointing out that that's like saying ""modern clothes are sizes are based upon standards developed by medieval tailors""](http://www.snopes.com/history/american/gauge.asp).  It turns out things designed for transporting people are generally sized to accommodate people.  That tautology has some serious implications to the limitations of human technology and design, as well as in the transhumanist area of futurology challenges just how diverse and creatively we can honestly hope to shape ourselves.  Cyborgization of our physical selves is always increasing, but we will probably remain anthropomorphic for far longer than necessary.  It at the very least shows that it could be the most efficient train a human can design, but is useless in its efficiency if it doesn't solve a particular task related to human need such as transporting them or materials they need.



In the end our narratives of the future are full of giant squids at the depths of new frontiers, but our reality is the US government deciding to end its isolationist stance in the widespread European war.  When people were reading about 'the information superhighway' in the 90s, they did not have in mind Facebook and PRISM.  Similar futures await automation, cryptocurrencies, and the other sorts of things that get popular attention around here: these exciting new ideas will eventually be merely human, with a few people grumbling about how back in the day it was SUPPOSED to do something else.  If Wells were correct, we should be pretty experienced in wrestling giant squids by now.

I guess the tl;dr of this is that we're quick to ask how technology is going to disrupt and change humanity, but not as quick to ask about how people are going to disrupt and change technology.

So whenever I read a post on /r/futurology, I whisper to myself ""HG Wells foresaw the submarine but not the sinking of the Lusitania.""

Have a nice day everybody, and I hope you learn, discover, or experience something new today.",0,2

The rules of these games are set by the few to be followed by the many.  We call the rules, which control people's lives, laws.  When people don't obey the laws, fear and force are used to maintain compliance.  As technology evolves, so do the rules of the game and the thinking of the people who make them.  Each time a new game is created, it is generally embraced with faith, on the hope that it is better than the previous game. People will not voluntarily comply unless they trust the rules.  For the past 100 years, people were controlled with laws based on debt and money.  The game was played on different boards variously called capitalism, communism, socialism, and fascism.  People were told the rules applied to everyone, and most people obediently trusted.

Just like the game master in The Hunger Games series, the bankers controlled the game of money, thereby controlling the lives, hopes, and dreams of the people within the arena.  In 2008, the financial system failed due to cheating on the parts of bankers, using the unwitting complicity of the people, culturally nurtured to think only of their own gain.  Governments overlooked the cheating and bailed out both the bankers and their game by making changes to the rules that primarily benefitted the few.  Most people were not bailed out; the old rules still applied to them, mocking any notion of mutuality or fairness in contract.  Today the primary difference between financial freedom and financial slavery is only the governments' bailouts.  The financial game is no longer a competitive playing field because the outcome is rigged. Markets and laws are artificially manipulated by those controlling the game.  Without rules that apply to everyone equally, competition and cooperation are unfairly limited, and progress is impeded. When the rules no longer serve all, how can any moral person trust the game, one which is selectively controlled to benefit only a few?

Does anyone know about any forum where people can discuss upgrading our legal, political, economic and other systems to peacefully and productively accommodate so many people in the future?",0,0

&gt;We stand behind the data we have generated for customers. Our lab partner adheres to strict quality standards that are part of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 - known as CLIA. These are the same standards used in the majority of other health and disease-related tests.

The fact is that the only way they can act on it is by asking a doctor, who will then stop them and tell them if they are doing something stupid. If the 23andMe customer is SO stupid and acts without a doctor, let them. Why should we stop the stupid if what they do affects only themselves? Honestly its because of tolerances like this of the stupidity that we have such a large ignorant populace. The FDA should not regulate this. It poses no significant threat to us. I am starting to think that the FDA was paid off. 

So am I correct in anything here? It makes no sense for the FDA stopping a process that does not harm humans in anyway. 

Please note that I posted this here because this is a distruptive technology. If you have a suggestion for a better place to post this, please let me know and I will do accordingly. ",5,2

It featured a few 16 bit computers able to connect to a small bunch of 'online services'. The reason behind such a location? Very few people had a computer back then (mostly universities and military facilities) and amongst them, only a small part was able to connect to the web. So internet cafs were a revolutionary market nich, soon to be found around ever damn corner.

25 years later, I can see a similar pattern when it comes to VR. Only a few people have access to devices such as the Oculus Rift and as for now, most projects don't serve a real purpose yet other than being neat gadgets. There are no VR cafs yet (at least a quick google session didn't brought up anything useful), and that's why I'm asking you - could something like this be a thing?

Technology is in the works that allows for growing a heart in a lab, could we grow a thinking human brain from scratch, or pull one intact from a human? We don't really know what consciousness is let alone how to achieve it -perhaps we never will- so why not just stick to what we know can do it?

Also in the works is Brain to Computer interfaces, if that reaches the point when a brain could be hooked up with computer, so both of them can do what the other one lacks, then you'd have a pretty successful machine intelligence.

It doesn't have to be a jar, obviously. Or even brain shaped. Maybe could be split into pieces and have them distributed throughout the computer, mated at the most intimate level?

Is there still reason to believe entirely machine sentience will be achieved within a thousand years? Or will we not be able to match nature's greatest mystery without using some of it for ourselves?

EDIT: I get it, self awareness is a slippery concept and ultimately irrelevant to progress. Next question, would a brain in a jar be able to calculate information more effectively than a computer alone?

It's a very good book, I recommend it to anyone interested in the topic.

In the book, nearly everything is run by machine, and the only people with real meaningful work are those with the highest IQ's - who go to school and become engineers and managers.  All others who *work*  either join the army, or do basic labor for the government (Road work, etc...)

Everyone knows this work is meaningless and is just there to give them something to do.  The people don't even really work because of the money. A lot of people just don't work.  With all the automation, and I assume some sort of socialized government, everyone lives decently.  No one goes hungry, everyone has a roof over their head, and things like  medical care are available to everyone.  However, many people are unhappy because they have no real meaning in life, and cannot contribute to society.  

I've still got a chapter or two left in the book, but so far it offers no solution to this problem.  Instead the book just shows the effects it has on their society.  

I think it is fairly safe to say that something similar could occur at some point in the future.  **So, in a world where most things are automated and many human jobs have ceased to exist, how will people keep a sense of self-worth and usefulness?** ",45,37

Im interested in Ecuador specifically because I live here, but all developing countries have certain things in common, former colony, victim of greater powers throughout history, un-industrialized and lacking infrastructure because of an inability to properly utilize its resources, corruption, and a dramatically uneven distribution of income. 

I imagine the ""futurizing of the world"" to be something more balanced like today, patches of futuristic technologies pop up side by side with centuries old technologies. A glorification of things produced from the outside in those far away lands where people live like in the movies, along with an innate pride of your land and culture and taking ownership over the foreign technologies and integrating it in some very uniquely local ways. Those in the wealthy elite who live like people in those faraway lands are extremely isolated from those in their immediate vicinity but remain to maintain the flow of resources.

I am very interested to hear what you all think, also does anyone know of good movies, etc. that investigate this?

However, I feel like I've been set down this path before I even knew how to walk or think about things rationally. I've always been told that there's a certain order to life. 

1. Complete elementary, middle, and high school
2. Get into a good college
3. Complete degree
4. Get a job

It's a process which depresses the shit out of me. The truth is, I have no fucking idea what I want to do with my life. I know I don't want to spend my life slaving away at some 8 to 5 job. The majority of people that I see hate their jobs, and it kills me to see that lifeless look in their eyes as they go about slaving away at menial tasks. 

It's as if they are on this hamster wheel, doing jobs which neither fulfill them nor improve them, and which could be automated but simply exist for the purpose of giving the poor hamsters something to do. But these are not hamsters. These are human beings, and they deserve better than that. 

I don't think my major in biological science is exempt from automation. In fact, robots are already carrying out biological experiments, and software is enabling the rational design of drugs. By the time I finish my major in 2 or 3 years, then spend additional years earning a PhD, will there will be room for people who learned old techniques that could already be outdated?

Don't get me wrong - I find the subject of my major to be quite interesting. However, I don't even know if I want to work in a lab, day in and out, nor do I even know that that's what I'll be doing after I graduate. In fact, I'll probably need to go to graduate school, if I can even get in, to hope to maybe have a chance to do real science. What once required a bachelor's degree now requires a master's, and what once required a master's now requires a PhD. 

The very people in the lab I worked at said that they would not go the PhD route if they had to do it all over again! While I know people don't go into science for the pay, it really does suck that I won't be making anything substantial for many years to come, while at the same time going through this arduous process.

Exams are approaching and right now my life is stressful.  When I step back and look at the bigger picture, I become less convinced that all my struggles to maintain good grades, pay tuition, and deal with my shitty living situation will yield an outcome of a life that I am happy with. 

I wish I didn't have to worry about all this work crap. I feel like I need some time off from the tests, stress, and chaos. 

Maybe I'm spoiled. Maybe I'm whiny. I know that my reality could be much worse, that I could have been born as some starving kid in Africa. But one cannot base one's happiness off the relative misfortune of others. 

The truth is that I wish I didn't have to work - I wish I didn't have to ""make a living"". The idealist in me sees a depressing reality that I wish would change so that I can spend my life doing things because I want to do them, not because circumstances have forced my hand. A minimum basic income can't come soon enough.

It's possible that there will be multiple parallel timelines, so the future could have a few possibilities.

This is one vision I had in mind so far:
I'd like us to have terraformed another world by that time at least. I expect there will be space travel that's fairly common like air flight is today. There would be a lower population than today due to a third world war for resources like fresh water and fuel. Eventually the fighting would stop after break through in alternative fuels and desalination tech are achieved. By 4000ad, the world would have more smaller countries, including the USA being broken into several sovereign countries. Most of the world that's at sea level will be flooded by the ocean due to all ice melting, like in Greenland and the poles. There wouldn't be much ozone left. A lot of the world would be too polluted to live in (see the pollution troubles in China recently, but at larger scale). Robots would be even more common and have advanced AI that is bound only by the classic three laws. Humans would have easy access to prosthetic body parts, but there would be controversy around who truly owns it in the same way that we argue with phone companies over true ownership of out gadgets. Or it could be that prosthetics become a commodity enough that it's cheap to pay for full ownership. Assuming the internet is still around and even more ubiquitous, commerce would be entirely digital a la bitcoin and NFC payments. There would also be asteroid mining at the Lagrange points with space station habitat colonies for workers these asteroids would be mined for rare earth minerals used in tech.

These are some of my ideas that I'm toying with and I may end up changing them. This future society and how I shape it with impact how the story goes and how the characters are formed.

Also, here's a link to some inspiring music. I have an entire playlist of songs (not all like this one) that I listen too when writing and brainstorming.

Even now, we (in the U.S.A.) have a free class. Welfare, prison, and other folks are able to live due to the progress of technology and the ability to be supported by the rest of nation. The homeless factor into this, of course, but this is not a discussion on the quality or justification of our free class, simply the declaration that we have one.

As technology continues to leverage people out of the economic equation... Let me justify that.

-----

Amazon.com has somewhere around ~110K employees. Their gross revenue last year was [~61B](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AAMZN&amp;fstype=ii&amp;ei=c7KoUtC7G-n8igLUCw), and Target has a gross revenue of [~76B](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3ATGT&amp;fstype=ii&amp;ei=wLKoUvCTCYj8iQKVqAE) and ~361K employees. While this could be considered apples and oranges, a big box retailer that handles the entire supply/delivery chain to the consumer employs over three times the number of people than an online retailer (which also dabbles in other areas) and has the same revenue.

That leverage is exceptional, and it highlights the declining value of the unskilled man-hour.

In the meantime, there is also high demand for highly skilled labor (especially in high tech fields), but not the kind of demand that fills factories. Woot.com has 140 employees (and rising, based off their [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woot) and [Linked-in](http://www.linkedin.com/company/woot-inc.) site), and the Victoria's Secret call center itself holds a thousand employees (and declining, based on [this](http://www.rrobserver.com/news/local/article_82d5c52e-cd44-11e1-89ba-001a4bcf887a.html) )

One of the next markets to 'go', based on an area of research that is very close to me is Education. Khan Academy has invalidated the idea that children must be taught STEM topics in schools. Government sponsored research is attacking the very foundation of education by introducing computer based tutoring systems (in the US (the hotbed of Intelligent Tutoring Systems), [Canada](http://www.tonybates.ca/2013/12/08/massive-funding-for-the-development-of-canadian-online-training-tools-and-services/)) and other areas.

There are a million high school teachers in the US. A million and a half elementary school teachers, and countless support staff and other staff (8.37M total [here](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ocwage.t01.htm)), nearly 6.5% of the workforce that will have their employment threatened by technology. These are skilled teachers. This is not limited to unskilled man-hours.

-----

As technology continues to leverage people out of work, and therefore the economic equation, we are faced with a particularly interesting question:

What are our options, given the declining value of the unskilled man hour?

Well, general human philosophy dictates that we shouldn't let those people ""just die""... So, we have a free class. The poor, the sick, and increasingly, the unemployable begin to live (more and more decently) for free on society's dime.

Typically, the way that I imagine (IANASocialScientist) society adjusts to this is to create entire new markets that provide little to no functional benefit to society, but keeps the economy flowing. Entertainment, video games, restaurants (oh god, so many restaurants!), and areas such as fashion represent answers to an underutilized workforce.

However, I believe there is a saturation point for amusement (based on the number of authors writing books that I do not have enough time to read!) and a saturation point for other vanity-based needs (based on every girlfriend I've ever had's closet). I have yet to see the next big market... otherwise I wouldn't be writing here, and I would be investing in it.

This does not mean that a growing free class is bad. Computer software has long been constrained by the notion that code must earn money (the Open Source movement fights this on a continuous basis), despite being a zero-cost-to-reproduce item, the same as media (text, music, and video), and the same as knowledge (Wikipedia, [MOOCs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course)) and data. These are markets that would (and [already do](http://nypost.com/2013/12/11/homeless-man-learns-to-code-releases-app/)) benefit from free labor, and a society-supported workforce.

**Here is the racy part.** -- A stable free class is, in my opinion, necessary for socialism (maybe less so, communism) to work in a practical fashion. So... That's a thing.

This is where a summary would go, with some stunning conclusion. The only conclusion I can say is that the free class will grow, and their lives will get easier. With their needs being more fulfilled, and education becoming less of a barrier, they will grow more skilled, and maybe become productive members of society without engaging in the economic ""job"" game that we play today. I mean, cmon, people make money [playing video games](http://www.twitch.tv).

Feel free to point out flaws. Like all things, this is not certain, and a viewpoint (with hopefully enough justification), and I am no expert.",27,42

This week I spoke with [William Hertling](http://www.williamhertling.com/) who is a programmer and the author of the singularity series which includes Avogadro Corp: The Singularity Is Closer Than It Appears, A.I. Apocalypse, and The Last Firewall. While we will get back to the top 5 format next month, I thought William would be a great guest to have on since his books cover a lot of what we discuss. Naturally AI is the main talking point but his books also touch on the singularity and topics like UBI (universal basic income).

It's directed at the guy down the hall who got a bigger raise. It's directed at the husband of your wife's sister, because he earns 20 percent more than you do. It's directed at the people you went to high school with...

Often, control was needed to generate production and obtain resources.  These games include political games and economic games.  Social games and religious games.  Most of the games were played with a set of rules created by a few and imposed upon the many.  Often force or fear was used to maintain compliance by the willing and unwilling participants.
 
Finance has been a common game played recently.  War is also a traditional game used for control.  These games are played in many different arenas globally including markets and urban battlefields.

For a number of decades, through education, the media, and socialization, 
people have been programmed to play in the current economic games, but time is rapidly running out for many of our industrial games.  Both financially and environmentally the games require infinite growth in a finite world.  And now we are reaching mathematical limits in increasing areas.

By reprogramming traditional economic games corrupting the
key systems on our planet, there can be a winning outcome for all.
New technology makes traditional games obsolete.

For example, eMail makes the Postal Service obsolete and saves a tremendous amount of resources.  As a matter of fact, any game that we can advance from a board game to a video game can have the same amazing result ending the need for people to control each other for resources or labor.

As automation, digitization, and new technologies are developed...what do you think the future games of life will be when the need to control each other will be dramatically reduced?",0,1

It's blunt and unrealistic, but I'm sticking to it. I've read The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect and the world that it depicted came the closest to what I want to create.

But I have no idea where to start.

At first I thought I could achieve this by ultimately somehow merging the minds of everybody in a sort of Noosphere like in the ending of Isaac Asimov's 'The Last Question'. But now I figured taking that on would be too mind-boggling given that I don't even know how to start. So now I'm settling with having an AI do it instead, like Prime Intellect.

I'm a Senior in High School, at the moment, and would love to find out which schools/companies are taking part in creating something like Prime Intellect. I'm going to pretend that money will not be a factor, nor distance nor anything. Someone just point me in the right direction and I'll take it in good faith. If nobody knows, maybe someone can point me to someone who does know.

Thank you and good luck trying to understand my incomprehensible rabble.",12,12

It's a subreddit devoted to discussing the present and future implications of automation and other technological advances on civilization. Without appreciating civilization's increasing interdependence due to technological convergence, few can clearly see the full impact of advancing technology on the games we play called life. 

For thousands of years, people have tried to control each other playing many different games with many different rules. Although our games evolve, some games are peaceful and others are violent. Traditionally, control was needed to generate production through labor and to obtain resources. The games included political games, economic games, legal games, military games, and religious games. The rules were primarily created by a few and imposed upon the many. Although greed was often the motivator for success, fear and force were generally used to maintain compliance by the participants. Recently, an increasingly complex financial system has controlled our games. People played their games in a variety of challenging arenas including money, markets and battlefields. Even though the strategies and participants are changing all the time, the most controlling games of all are those limited by our own minds. 

Without knowledge and understanding of the games we play, and how they are connected, most will never recognize when they are the ones being played or manipulated or when it's time to change the game or update its rules. When 7 billion increasingly interdependent people are trying to play games that are financially and environmentally unsustainble, in order to keep playing peaceful games, leaders must discuss how we can systemically Reboot Our Planet.  By transforming many of our traditional activities from board games to video games, our environment can be saved while everyone can be set free in open systems to advance to new games and new levels that were once limited for most participants.

Recently, a futurologist I know, sent me the following email.  Do any of you have a suggestion as to the questions he raised in his email?  
	The email:
In 1957 I founded DATAMATION, the first magazine in the new fields of Computers and Information Processing.  I was told it was not really needed as other magazines, such as SCIENCE would handle these fields.  The rest is history.  
       As a futurologist, I believe we are morphing into a new ""Economics.""   Automation has been with us for many years; however Singularity, Artificial Intelligent Robots, Nanotechnology, etc. will move mankind into a new era. Large standing armies and navies will be a thing of the past. Unemployment of millions (even billions) may well be the norm (this is not just a wild-card scenario).  I have a reasonable understanding of contemporary economics.  I want badly to find an economist who is visioning the next hundred years.  If there is to be a new Global Paradigm, who today is defining it?  
      I am constructing a scenario which assumes the total population of the world will peak in 2100, and as fertility rates approaches 1.0 per female, the total population will begin declining to where by 2400, it will be about the size it was in 1800. 
       The driving force will be Demographic Transition, in particular: (1) increasing urbanization, (2) the effect of the direction and magnitude of intergenerational wealth flows, and (3) the effect of widespread family planning programs in underdeveloped countries, including the increase in contraceptive technology.
       I believe as we proceed to 2100, an increasingly large underclass of two-digit IQ individuals will be unemployable in the coming high-tech society; there will not be enough job openings to handle the vast numbers of these unskilled individuals.  Therefore, in the short run, the problem needing to be addressed will be: How will nations provide for their unemployed until the decrease in fertility rates takes effect? 
       I hope to find someone that has contemplated this potential problem, and that they might share their thoughts with me.  Do you know of an Economist/Futurist who might be looking out 50 to 100 years?  Thank you for considering to reply to my email.

It will have to be a rather socialist society where everyone receives base funds or 'credits' from the government or the 'financial computer system.'


The new paradigm would be that you could earn additional credits through some sort of online avatar presence. You could earn credits by receiving achievements, say, you learn calculus, and you receive a trophy when you know how to, say, integrate 1/x. +50 credits. Say you paint a lovely picture. sure anyone could paint a picture and earn credits, but perhaps a better way to do it would to have some sort of voting system like reddit where a nice painting can be published by your online presence and people could 'upvote it' and each person who enjoys the painting can give you some amount of their own credits, or perhaps automatic credits when a certain piece of art or music reaches 'upvoted' milestones. I believe the guy who does Kahn academy has a video promoting this sort of achievement based wealth. It would be an economy based solely on hard work and the persuit of perfecting the self.
Additionally, only a handful of jobs will actually be required to keep everything running smoothly. I still imagine we'll need engineers to push humanity forward, and scientists and physicists will always be necessary because math and science, although intrinsic to the world we live in, are very much an abstract creation of creative intuition, something machines may never perfect.


Here's the thing, everyone has needs and wants, and there will always be products. What would help usher in this utopian society would be if we lived with an 'abundance society' where all products and life were sustainable through smart farming and space/asteroid mining. With our credit society you could have as much as you earn through your own hard work and thought.",19,0

In a world of drones, smart weapons, and an interconnected battle field, a population armed with assault rifles seems quaint. Current asymmetrical conflicts depend on the unwillingness of the larger party to hurt civilians, which has been true in most conflicts but not all of them. 

The inability of the civilian population to defeat the military without help from within the military is complicated by another factor, the increasing automation of the armed forces. This means that control of the military is in fewer hands, making collusion more likely. Imagine if someone like Assad had control over a drone army, he wouldn't hesitate to turn the army on a rebellious population.

1: Button trackers. There's about 5 different companies that say virtually the same thing. A small button with a battery and bluetooth 4.0. Here's a few of them. [Link 1](http://www.button-trackr.com). [Link 2]
(https://www.sticknfind.com). 

2: 3-D printers. Every time I check Kickstarter for new innovative tech, I see 3-5 different projects for different types of 3-D printers that are somehow different from the others. I know people are upset at the companies that are trying to monopolize 3-D printers, but I have ho idea where to even start. I don't want to accidentally buy something that's junk. I don't want to get something that won't do what I need. A little consolidation couldn't hurt.

3: Wifi-based Home security systems. I cannot wait until I have a house with a high-tech wifi-based home security system that can tell me who's at the door, who opened a window, and anything else. But just like the 3-d printers, every time I go onto kickstarter, there's another company making more internet-of-things tech. 

I'd love to hear more to things to keep an eye on in the future. ",20,11

This divide may never happen again (in this way) with humans. For all of our existence, we as a species have lived, worked, and played, in the real world. Everything that we have known, was previously based in this fact. The divide refers not only to the point where the Industrial age transitioned into the Information age. It's actually actually bigger than that. It's more akin to every age that came before the information age, would all be classified in the same context, and now at the dawn of this new age, our species has begin to exponentially upgrade our comprehension &amp; capacity for what's possible. 

Enter... Human 1.0.

Since humans have walked the earth, we have been in symbiosis with it, until recently. In the last few thousand years, we have used the earth and its raw materials and resources throughout the ages in ever increasingly complex ways. From Age to Age of human innovation, we have made better use of our environment, and bettered ourselves. What have we been working towards? Early on, it was for survival. However we've learned to improve ourselves so well, that we no longer have to try to survive as a species, but that hasn't stopped us from improving.

Version 1.0 Humans are those that have lived in a purely physical world. People with no concept of any of the jewels that the information age has to offer. Access to knowledge and learning were only available from central repositories of written information in the form of libraries, or from the artisans and specialists themselves. Up until recently the entire knowledge of a civilization could be wiped out simply by destroying a people's civilization, works of literature, and art. 

Unfortunately this has happened several times before in human history. Take for instance one of the greatest civilizations our species has produced, the Romans. During the height of the Roman Empire, their capacity for the sciences, were arguably ahead of their time. One of the benefits of conquest are not only physical gains, but cultural and scientific gains to your society. Archaeologists have unearthed Roman made concrete objects that have sat on the sea floor since the structures were razed, that were found intact, and withstood the erosion one might have expected to occur in salt water over millenia. Yet today's concrete erodes at amazingly fast rates by comparison. This technology was lost to the ages when the Roman Empire was lost to the world. Humans had to start from square one when each civilization's knowledge was destroyed as a result of war or other reasons. It has been theorized that the impact of this one technology could have advanced the human species technological understanding by leaps and bounds. Imagine where we would be today had the sum of knowledge from our humble beginnings remain intact.

Version 1.5 humans are those lucky few who were born as 1.0's (before the information age - ie. the industrial age), and have not only lived into the new age, but have embraced it. My father, was born in 1937. He knows computers exist, he wants to learn them, but is unable to understand the basic principles. My grandmother has heard of websites, and the internet, however she has no earthly idea of what either is. She was born in 1920. Both of them are 1.0 humans. My mother, born in 1952, didn't grow up with computers, internet, cell phones that double as data devices. However she has integrated them flawlessly into her life, now almost age 62. She has been able to remain a savy user of the computer through my help over the years.

There is also bleed-over in the other direction. There are humans in the developed world now, that are of the younger generations that know very little of computers. These people, though born into a 2.0 human world, remain 1.5 humans due to their inability to embrace and understand the new age. You will find over the next few decades people that bare the traits of both 1.5 and 1.0 humans, however bit by bit, these people will fade into history as society ever integrates with technology. Because we are in transition from technology being the exception, to it being the norm in our society, there will be a lag-time involved until society as a whole catches up. There will come a point where your level of understanding will dictate your ability to function in society. To be a normal and functioning member of society, you must be 2.0 human. This will spread across the world in time, however no one knows how long it will take to incorporate the largely neglected un/under developed world.

We are now living in a time where we as a species, on an individual level, have instant access to 98% of our total global accumulated knowledge, on a whim, or.. on demand (something our species has never had before). Furthermore, we've CREATED our very own new reality, which goes by many names; one of which, is the internet. These concepts are at the core of what it means to live as a Human 2.0. We wield the power once thought of as ""the power of the gods"", in our pockets.

Coming back to this notion of The Great Divide; there are people who are living right now, who were born before the advent of computer technology, and the internet. If you take a moment to think about it, we are living in a very unique time. A time where 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 humans are still living. 1.0 and 1.5 humans are apart of the last generations of humans that were born outside of the information age. Their inability to grasp concepts central to a 2.0 existence, is but a passing notion. In as little as 2 decades, the majority of the developed world will be human 2.0, with the 3rd world in tow. As the last of the Human 1.0 and 1.5 generations die out, we will see a rapid boom of innovation in every area. One of the biggest changes we will see in the coming years will not only be when 1.0's die out, nor even when the 1.5's die out. It will be when we see the 2.0 humans taking positions of power in governments around the world. Policies that have worked for hundreds of years will stop making sense, people (though they may not agree on how) will have a more acute understanding of the information age we reside in, and our place in it. As a futurologist, it is during this time, the time of the 2.0 human, that I rest my gaze.",24,51

You see, work-droids, 3D printing and other automated processes will release workers from the jobs these technologies will perform. 

Therefore, I would hope genetically re-engineering these laid-off workers will enable them to have (or create?) jobs they didn't have the ability to perform before, that droids will still not be able to take over.

If there are no jobs that leave people in poverty, that may pave the way toward having everybody provided for. (I learned, I think in /r/todayILearned, that there are more vacant homes than there are homeless people today.)

Moreover, removing certain conflicting tendencies may promote harmony amongst one another; genetic remarks causing friction between people may be altered, causing more positive relationships to flourish.

Finally, all suicidal tendencies would be a thing of the past. Alter certain DNA strands, remove any temptation to kill oneself.

How far off are we from genetically re-engineering already-born individuals? If lab tests are being made, where and when can I sign up?

I had a problem with the thread, because no one bothered to question the prompt's built-in assumption.

I rarely see arguments on here questioning strong AI and machine consciousness. This subreddit seems to take for granted the argument that machines *will* one day have these things, while brushing over the body of philosophical thought that is critical of these ideas. It's of course *fun* to entertain the idea that machines can have consciousness, and it's a viewpoint that lends itself to some of the best scifi and thought experiments, but conscious AI should not be taken for granted. We should also entertain counterarguments to the computationalist view, like John Searle's [Chinese Room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room), for example. A lot of these popular counterarguments grant that the human brain is a machine itself. 

John Searle doesn't say that machine consciousness will not be possible one day. Rather, he says that the human brain is a machine, but we don't know exactly how it creates consciousness yet. As such, we're not yet in the position to create the phenomenon of consciousness artificially.

This was my reply: 
Albert Einstein said: ""Computers are incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Human beings are incredibly slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. Together they are powerful beyond imagination."" I have this half-formed idea that the technological singularity will happen in the next couple decades, but it will be a bit different than we expect. 3D printers, robots and automation will take care of most manual labor and drudgery, but computers will still need human beings for those fuzzy judgement calls. I imagine a low-skill job in the future might be to decide which shade of purple for a given product design is most beautiful. The computer would then take the average of 1000s of human answers to come up with its crowd-sourced answer. A brain scan would assess your potential and place you in the best job where your work is both optimized for productivity and easiest for YOU personally to accomplish. Instead of sitting in a classroom, you could ""learn by doing"" any subject in a virtual environment. Imagine learning advanced calculus by playing a fun, engaging, immersive video game in virtual reality. Eventually, the best ""players"" would be invited to participate in something amazing like asteroid mining or designing space ships through a collaborative online process. Of course, in this world of abundance, some people will be lazy blobs who take their Universal Basic Income and play Grand Theft Auto 10 in virtual reality all day long. And that's fine, they can be warehoused in densely packed micro-apartments and provided for in virtual splendor. One controversial, somewhat dystopian idea I have for this ""perfect"" world is that being able to procreate is an earned right instead of a guarantee so the people who don't want to be a part of the future don't get to pass on themselves to the next generation.",16,24

	Augmented Reality

o	6 years after Google Glass is released, AR has come a long way.  Now able to view the world in front of you in 3D with stereoscopic cameras, these devices will bring the virtual world into the real world through transparent OLED screens. Computers have become much smaller and energy efficient meaning they can be placed inside of much smaller volumes inside of glasses.


	Virtual Reality


o	6 Years after the Oculus rift is released, the third generation of virtual reality is being developed. Depending on how good transparent OLED displays become, there may be no more VR headset, but instead only AR headsets. The Oculus Rift will have a 1080p display, but the new generation will use 4K resolution displays. In this time, computer graphics have come a long way appearing more and more real. NPC AI will also greatly be improved along with world size, physics, and immersion. Positional tracking on the headset allows for the device to be used anywhere and the graphics are streamed to your headset. VR MMORPGS will be huge as people begin spending more and more of their time in virtual worlds connecting with others and it may very well facilitate the next big thing in social media. 


	Space Exploration

o	Private space companies and an increasing number of countries are once again looking to space, but not just for exploration but economic exploitation. Space tourism will become increasingly popular, but only among the wealthy. Companies are looking more and more to asteroids as resources of rare earth elements due to the increasing depletion of them on Earth for use in a booming high tech industry. Space is becoming commercialized.


	Nanotechnology


o	Further advances in graphene manufacturing have finally allowed it to begin to be used in consumer products. A true wonder material, it will first be used in electronics like computers and solar panels  improving power efficiency, reducing size, and allowing for flexibility and stretchability.


	Biotechnology

o	The biohacker movement will continue to be on the rise as the price of sequencing genomes falls further and further. More and more complex genetic engineering is being done on crops and new strains have shown much improved nutrition, yield, and resistance to pests and harsh conditions. Gene therapy in humans is being improved and everyday there are new genetically engineered viruses designed to fight disease.

	Artificial Intelligence

o	AI has improved a good amount in 6 years. Companies are rushing to build better and better intelligences and cognitive computing has allowed for expert systems like Watson to be nearly ubiquitous in many fields. Neuromorphic devices are becoming exceedingly common as companies look for ways to gain computing power when transistors can only shrink so much more in size. 


	Autonomous Vehicles

o	Almost all new models of cars are using some form of autonomous control. Released in 2017, driverless cars were a hit on the market. Delivery and shipping companies are beginning to take advantage of them, further removing the human from the loop. The FAA has laid the groundwork for the use of drones in US airspace and shipping companies are quick to latch on. Passenger flights are still required to have a human pilot onboard, but they are only a redundant system.


	Automation

o	Many restaurants are moving to automated systems and companies are further automating their workforce in every way they can. Google has developed a humanoid robot that is capable of doing most blue collar work. People are truly beginning to question whether automation will fully replace human workers in all fields. 



**2030**


	Augmented Humans

o	The virtual world is indistinguishable from the real world. We may use contact lenses as the preferred display method. Miniaturized and ubiquitous sensors allow for computers and machines to be remotely controlled through a Brain Computer Interface. Exoskeletons are now common, giving wearers superhuman strength and endurance.


	Biotechnology

o	Genetic engineering of humans is now fully underway. Big Data has allowed for smart mapping of genes to traits and most research in the lab is done by computers, not scientists. Organisms are now being modified to our will, ending food scarcity and increasing the quality of life of nearly everyone. Humans are born smarter and stronger and without defects. Work into life extension has allowed the production of rejuvenation pills that allow humans to live longer and healthier lives.


	Artificial Intelligence

o	Nearly everyone will have their very own AI assistant that learns everything it possibly can about you and your environment. This AI will have a virtual avatar and could be uploaded onto a robotic body. These AIs will at least match human intellect and have completely replaced nearly all forms of labor as thinking machines are better in nearly all ways than humans. A supercomputer at this time could have parallel neuromorphic microprocessors allowing it to design its successor with no aid from people, leading to an intelligence explosion that will dwarf every event in human history that has come before it.


	Nanotechnology

o	Nanobots will be the computers of the future. A computer at this time will be the size of a red blood cell and we will have millions or even billions of these devices dispersed throughout our bodies. These machines will be capable of keeping our bodies completely healthy and will allow the user to see complete details about every biological process happening in their body. AI will operate these robots to do everything we need without us lifting a finger. Human lifespan jumps up to over 150 years. 


	Robotics

o	Robots are commonplace and can look entirely like humans. Humans no longer have any reason to work. Artificial Intelligence and better-than-human robots have paved the way for the replacement of people in all job sectors except the arts.


	Space Exploration

o	Private companies have brought a number of asteroids into near earth orbit. With swarms of robots acting completely autonomously the efficiency of space exploration has improved dramatically. These autonomous mining drones can extract precious metals that can be sent back to earth or mine water rich asteroids to produce rocket fuel. A true spaceport in space allows for rockets to refuel and resupply before launching to distant targets. Robots have set up colonies on the Moon and on Mars that are inhabited by humans but run by smart machines.


	Power

o	Fusion power has finally been achieved on a commercial scale and energy scarcity becomes a thing of the past. With nearly infinite energy, and ever more material being brought in from space, people are beginning to want to spread further out into the solar system.


	3D Printing

o	People now largely print their own products from home. By this point in time, 3D printers have become capable of printing in most kinds of materials allowing for complex things like fabrics and digital circuits to be fabricated by 3D printers. Nearly any devices except for the most technically difficult can be made on 3D printers.


**2045**


	Aritifical intelligence

o	Superintelligence means nothing can be predicted, but through recursive self-improvement, this new intelligence is far more powerful than all human brains that ever existed combined. The pace of scientific and technological advancement is mind numbing. It is uncovering answers to the universe that we couldnt hope to fathom the question to. 


	Nanotechnology

o	We have moved from nanomaterials to nanobots to nanofabrication. We are now capable of interacting with matter at the atomic level allowing for atomically precise materials and devices  nearly all designed by smarter than human intelligences. The physical world becomes programmable.


	Transhuman

o	Nanobot swarms can completely reconstruct a persons brain map in digital form. Using this, these nanobots restructure our brain and add components that allow us to think and operate faster than we could conceive today. By making our minds digital, humans are opened up to a world of senses not biologically possible and can seamlessly connect with other people and computers through telepathy. Most human minds now live almost exclusively in the cloud, facilitating things like travel at the speed of light, immortality, connectedness, total control of virtual worlds. These virtual worlds will be created by an artificial superintelligence that knows us better than we know ourselves. By creating fictional worlds on the fly that cater to every feeling and emotion we value, many humans may decide to live solely in this digital utopia instead of bothering with the real world that is encumbered by things out of our control.


	Space Exploration

o	The solar system is entirely inhabited but mostly by robots. Because minds are now digital, we can travel simply through lightspeed data transmission into a computer or robotic body on another world. At this point we are a hivemind and can have the sensory input from any other connected mind streamed to our own brains. Our species as a whole becomes self-aware. Interstellar travel is possible through one of two methods. If faster than light travel is possible, we may use wormholes or the warping of space-time to travel to distant suns. If it not, nanoscale craft can be accelerated to the speed of light with little energy. Once at their distant destination they begin using the materials available to replicate themselves and form the necessary technological apparatuses for minds to be transferred. Although feasible this may never happen. With the digitization of the world, humanity has reduced its required footprint on the universe immensely. The only necessary resource is energy and to facilitate higher speed intra-societal communications we may move closer and closer together instead of spreading out beyond the solar system.

Im even thinking about writing a fiction around this idea! 

However, i just want an opinion from this thread. What happens after we have successfully uploaded our mind into a machine, such in the movie Transcendence ?  

If our mind has been digitized, wouldn't it be easy to simulate (inject) any kind of emotions and feelings into our consciousness? Let's say i want happiness, then I would just run a happiness simulation that will keep me happy for an indefinite amount of time. What if I feel insecure or unaccomplished? Well those can also be simulated for us! You want that taste of the new gourmet oyster menu at the new restaurant? You can download it for sure. 

All sensory inputs, I mean all, can be simulated in an instant. 

So this new all digital environment will become the new Eden for me. There will be no death, fatigue, hunger, and sickness as I now do not have a frail organic body to maintain. I can even stay awake 24/7/365. Sadness, and other negative emotions can also be eradicated. 

So this brings to my question: what will happen to humanity if this finally happens? Since all our technological advancement are based on our desire to make things better.  And since everything is perfect in a digital body, will we become self-contained and finally be fulfilled and stop our humanity progress like the cattle-like Elois in HG Wells Time Machine? 

Any thoughts and inputs are welcome.

I came to the conclusion that cars will eventually be completely autonomous, and that this was a good thing. However my friend stopped me and posed and interesting idea. First, he pointed out that statistically the introduction of automated driving will reduce the amount driving accident by a monumental amount. But then he also pointed out that taking away people's ability to drive will remove the sense of control that we feel when behind the wheel. Humans exhibit a self-serving bias when facing the negative outcome of an event. This means that some will actually prefer driving as opposed to riding in an automated vehicle to avoid the emotion of helplessness, even though leaving their lives in the hands of computers would statistically increases their chance of surviving.

tl;dr: Can we give up our sense of control to increase our chances of living?

Animal shaped four legged ""motorcycles"" and ""bikes"" will be the near future's uber-gadget. They will be engineered for perfectly smooth rides, exquisite balance and very high speeds. They will range in sizes, shapes and uses, they will be smart and accident proof. They will dodge or jump over obstacles, climb, run on any terrain, even swim. They will replace the motorcycles and bikes in the cities and be of great use in the third world for carrying materials and people in hard to reach places. Each serious car manufacturer will get into this competition. There will be different brands, styles and shapes. Horse, camel, cat, canine, hyena, dragon, you name it, each and every real or imaginary, aggressive and impressive land animal will be a source of inspiration for designers. There will be shiny, futuristic models, minimalistic ones, slim ones or gothic, heavy ones. There will be even bigger models having the passenger inside. We will have Hondas, BMW and so on and on. They will be absolutely beautiful, every kid's dream, every explorer's or simply land worker's strict necessity, a perfect mean of transportation in crowded cities, even on mountains and a perfect tool for outdoor entertainment.

And they will be very smart. They will ride by themselves, they will monitor everything around, they will guard their owners, roar, purr, play, talk, collaborate and whatnot.

Just google some images from Boston Dynamics, those are the neanderthals, the primordial versions of these future machines. I would be surprised if the race between manufacturers won't start within at most 10 years, at least in designing the first practical concepts.",6,15

Fossil fuels? We can build them from scratch out of carbon dioxide [or methane]- the old techniques wasted 80% of the energy, newer techniques do better, we may get something cheaper than gasoline soon. Soluble in energy.

I was wondering, does anyone know of inventions or experiments by cognitive scientists, engineers, interface designers or scientists (or dedicated amateurs) where the abilities of people can be used more efficiently than when working more traditionally, as individuals? Has anything such as thought-sharing at a symbolic level been done or speculated about? I'm not thinking about telepathy but rather about specialized shared languages that are easily learned and communicated through technology. 

I have no doubt the line is quite blurred between intensive collaboration between people, and what might be possible but is not yet achieved with technology. Still, I have never heard of people attempting, say, to solve a real-life puzzle while connected through artificial means. I hope this is not coming off as a vague query, but if it is, it could be because I need help understanding the broad outlines of current progress before going deeper.

I was going on about how we may start to see more cybernetic devices in use in daily life. 

It's not hard to imagine that we might have devices installed in our bodies perhaps called discreet* implants that would filter harmful substances from our blood or in our lungs to filter the  air. 

I was saying how there might be groups of people that overtly display their implants like augmented eyes with greater visual range perhaps even be able to see more forms of light invisible to organic eyes. 

These are just random examples of what kinds of devices might be in some peoples bodies in the near future. 

My questions are,  are there any implants currently in use that are arguably superior to what they replaced in a healthy individual? 

Or are there devices added to peoples bodies that improve certain tasks of a healthy person? (not necessarily replacing something, more like augmenting what's already there) 

I'm saying healthy person because the only examples I know of now are things like a pacemaker which is an awesome invention but doesn't make the heart superior to a healthy one. The same thing for prosthetics as I understand it. While they are awesome  of engineering, they are never to my knowledge superior to a healthy natural arm. 

My friend believes that we will never have devices inserted into us that are superior to our hard earned genetically field tested body parts, I'm wondering if we might already have something already in use that I don't know about. 

Cheers! 

Edit 1

So apparently we don't have many enhancing implants available at the moment with the exception of perhaps hearing aids. 

There apparently are prosthetic limbs available that can help a person run, climb or do other activities with the help of different attachments. There is probably a big future in these devices. However all I'm seeing are ways for an injured person to regain some lost abilities. I'm not seeing anything specific that is so impressive it is worth considering removing a healthy body part to have it installed. 

So if anyone is still reading this... I'll open the question up to include things that not necessarily available now, but are in one stage or another in the development cycle. Is there anything coming down the line that rivals home grown body parts? ",13,28

But it is not unusual, or in retrospect unexpected.  It follows historical patterns.
 
The first pattern is the inevitable time delay between exploration and colonization.  At the turn of the (last) century, the race for the poles was the Victorian equivalent of our race for the moon. Once the flags of Britain, Norway, etc. had been planted at the south pole, national prestige was satisfied.  Afterwards, nobody bothered much with Antarctica for about another half century, until the first international geophysical year (1959). Since then, the continent has been studded with permanently manned scientific bases and weather stations.
 
But nobody has bothered to try to colonize Antarctica on a large scale. Primarily because it is a crappy place to live. Yet it is far more inviting and cheaper/easier to colonize (and to get to) than the moon or Mars. If history is any guide, about a half century after the Apollo program (within the next ten to twenty years) look for permanently manned stations in orbit, on the moon and maybe on Mars. The ISS is the first of these stations.  But don't expect massive colonization anytime soon. Our species simply won't move anywhere in large numbers that we can't walk around outside in shirt sleeves for at least part of the year. 
 
The second pattern is that government funded exploration (Ferdinand and Isabella paying for Columbus voyages, Jefferson sending Lewis and Clark westward, etc.) is always followed by true colonization being performed by private enterprise (the conquistadors, the Massachusetts Bay company, settlers travelling the Oregon trail, Dutch East India Company, railroads spanning the west, etc.).  In fact, the early colonization efforts in the Americas were the work of the worlds first stock holder corporations.  Planetary Resources, Inc. (asteroid mining) and SpaceX (private space launches) are just the first corporations being formed to colonize and exploit the New World of the Solar System. Which means we wont be colonizing planets.
 
Screw planets.
 
The near term future of manned colonization of space is the asteroid belt.  Instead of Mars, we should colonize Ceres in order to establish a logistical base for asteroid prospecting and mining. Ceres has no significant gravity well to overcome and lots of water for life and fuel. 
 
http://www.pagef30.com/2009/04/why-ceres-might-be-better-location-for.html
 
So instead of Star Fleet starting human colonies on the surfaces of planets, we'll have the Weyland-Yutani Corporation contracting out the space equivalent of oil rig and crab fishing work - extremely dirty and dangerous work with a high death rate. Work that makes investor back home extremely wealthy, mankind more prosperous and the workers making a small fortune with each service contract (if they live long enough to return to Earth to spend their money). Maybe we'll have the occasional scientific base established on Mars or floating in the atmosphere of Venus, but they'll be no bigger than a current Antarctic base and be nothing more than a PR stunt.
 
So forget about the bright, shiny and clean Enterprise, our future in space is the dirty, gritty and dangerous Nostromo.
 
Eventually, the wealth generated by asteroid mining will create the resources and infrastructure needed to colonize the planets.  But how to create a shirt sleeve environment that people will actually want to move to?  We should just start ""small"" and just para-terraform just the 4 mile deep Valles Marineris. It's depth would allow us to sustain (with some biological or industrial maintenance and replenishment) a sufficiently thick and breathable atmosphere. The colonists can treat the rest of Mars like we treat the Himalayas. At 2,500 miles long and 360 miles wide, it's area is 900,000 square miles (about the size of Alaska and Texas combined, more than enough room for any conceivable initial colonization effort). Cities could be carved into the canyon walls like pueblos. The colonists would then proceed with the terraforming of the rest of the planet.  Electrical cables can be strung across the canyon opening creating an artificial magnetic field that would shield colonists and life on the valley floor from cosmic radiation.
 
If we become tunnel dwellers on Mars, we can live in floating cities on Venus. The upper reaches of the thick, heavy carbon dioxide atmosphere of Venus are Earth-like in terms of pressure and temperature.  Dirigibles filled with a breathable oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere would be buoyant  just like cloud city in Star Wars. We just got to protect the city's external skin from all that sulfuric acid in the Venusian atmosphere. Factories in the floating city can extract carbon dioxide from the thick atmosphere to produce carbon based nano-structures which can be used to build even more cities or floating solar screens to block sunlight. Eventually, the dense, hot Venusian atmosphere can be rendered into habitable structures and sun screens.  Centuries later we can walk on the surface of Venus without being crushed and fried.
 
If the asteroid miners are going to have dangerous work and high death rates, planetary colonists won't be coming home at all. As Buzz Aldrin pointed out, manned colonization of the solar system SHOULD be one way for the same reasons that the Pilgrims knew they were never going back to England and settlers travelling the Oregon Trail (with many dying along the way) were never going back East. Manned travel to Mars only makes sense if you plan on it being a one-way trip.
 
Once an industrial infrastructure is established in the asteroid belt and colonies established on Mars and Venus, we can push outward to the Jovian worlds, Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud.  There we can establish hundreds of terraformed and para-terraformed planets, moons, asteroids, Kuiper Belt objects (which the former planet Pluto is now classified as), Oort cloud planetoids and comets, and moons orbiting nearby brown dwarfs (worlds half way in size between Jupiter and the Sun).  
 
Once we have established an industrial zone in the asteroid belt, colonized/terraformed Mars, Venus and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, where to next?  Ad astra?
 
Maybe we won't have to make giant leaps to actual stars. Maybe we can take small steps to brown dwarfs between the stars. Who knows, there may be dozens of BDs between the stars for every visible star:
 
http://nextbigfuture.com/2009/11/could-nasa-wide-infrared-survey.html
 
""The other headline would be the discovery of a brown dwarf that is even closer to Earth than the nearest star, the Alpha Centauri system at 4.3 light-years. Brown dwarfs are objects that form along with stars but do not have enough mass to trigger or sustain nuclear fusion. They are so cool and dim very little is known about their distribution in the galaxy""
 
and:
 
http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue183/labnotes.html
 
""What if space is littered with these failed stars, scattered between the bright ones like a stellar Polynesia, making interstellar travel a series of short hops, rather than a single gigantic one? What if a simple fusion reactor carried just enough fuel to push a spacecraft to our solar system's Planet X in reasonable time? What if it could refuel there, harvesting just enough hydrogen or deuterium or helium to limp along to another dark neighbor, and another, and another? Granted, it would take a long, long time to get to Alpha Centauri that way, and probably a much, much longer time to find a planet somewhere that looked even remotely like our rain- and sun-drenched Earth. But given the likelihood of tidally warmed moons, and the obvious possibilities for life there, we may just find that the cold, dark spaces are where most of the action is anyway.""
 
There may be dozens or hundreds of mini-solar systems between Sol and Alpha Centauri. With the discovery of brown dwarfs, free floating planets between the stars, and extra-solar planetoids like Sedna, future space explorers may find plenty to keep them occupied in our own solar neighborhood for centuries to come. While not the galaxy spanning empires and federations of science fiction, it would be enough for our species to explore far into the future.
 
What if Brown Dwarfs turn out to be scattered by the dozens or hundreds in the space between the stars?  And what if most of them have mini-solar systems (like Jupiter and Saturn) capable of supporting life because enough heat is generated by the BD to allow liquid water and photosynthesis based on infrared frequencies? Then perhaps we'll find that our kind of life, based on visible light spectrum photosynthesis, is the rare oddity and infrared based life far more common.  

Since these mini-solar systems and planets are a stone's throw away, they can be reached without exotic warp drives or hyperspace. Simple solar sails, laser sails or nuclear rockets will do just fine. Exploration missions can visit and return in a matter of years, instead of centuries or millennium. Interstellar ""empires"" and ""federations"" can be created using slower than light space travel. Maybe Capt. Kirk and Obi Wan Kenobi wouldn't be impressed, but well be half way to Alpha Centauri.
 
Then what?
 
We seed the universe with our kind.
 
A solar sail about the size of Colorado (and being only one carbon atom thick) can use the pressure of sunlight alone to accelerate a payload to between 0.01c to 0.1c.  Deceleration can be achieved by the pressure of sunlight from the destination star.  No expensive fuel or engines needed for this cheap and slow approach.  So it would take decades or centuries to reach a nearby star, whats the hurry?  The payload would consist of millions of frozen embryos that are thawed out and brought to term in a artificial wombs. The first generation of colonists would be raised by android mom and dad analogues programmed to care for, protect, educate and nurture the children (watched over by machines of loving grace). After establishing a colony, the space ship utilizes local asteroid resources to build more solar sail ships and payloads, sending them off to more stars where the process is repeated over and over again... 
 
... until we are a galactic species immune to extinction.
 
Thats the wonderful thing about doubling.  Take one probe and double it only 19 times and you have over a million probes spreading throughout the galaxy.  Once established, a system of colonies can create a communication network exchanging the only commodities that can be transported economically over interstellar distances: information and knowledge.  
 
This doubling effect also works in the early stages of space colonization.  Send a semi-autonomous 3D printer to the asteroid belt to mine local resources and create a million more 3D printers after only 19 iterations.  Then change their programming to begin construction of space factories and infrastructure  all controlled by only a few thousand humans of which only a few dozen are actually in space.  Do the same on the surface of Mars to create habitable enclaves before the first colonists even arrive.  Do that in the Venusian atmosphere and create vast structures made out of carbon nanotubes while making the place habitable.
 
Now if only we can create a successful Sci-fi series based on these ideas...

Trying to put forward and convince others of Futurology and its umbrella aspects such as transhumanism and the idea of a singularity have become a passion of mine only dwarfed by my desire to learn and be more involved in bringing it all about.

At my current community college there is nothing close to any sort of ""technology"" club available nor speculative/informative forward-thinking club.  There is some sort of network club (programming and nothing else), a gamer club (where they sit around and play League of Legends all day apparently), and then I suppose some spiritual clubs about Wicca and the like.  Those are about as close as I can get and none of them fulfill this idea.

So in the events leading up to the holidays I was speaking to many instructors and faculty and some fellow students regarding this idea for a club.  The general consensus is that it seems like a good idea, but I would have a difficult time finding a club adviser and members.  I have sent out many emails, made a flyer design, and am working on the paperwork with a plan to speak with the more technology-focused classes in some way or another.  I even contacted Humanity Plus and The Singularity Hub for a possible connection like other clubs do.  I have yet to hear back from them.

Considering the levels of future shock there are in relation to the material, the attention span of my so-called peers, media-induced fear-mongering, and the level of critical thinking that is required to reach such conclusions as futurologists and the like have done (meaning that just dumping all that information on someone just will not work unfortunately)...it certainly seems like I will have a difficult time with this.  And obviously conveying this type of information can be delicate due to the nature of fanaticism and what many would call unsubstantiated belief.

So lets cut to the chase with a list a questions.

1.  Is this a good idea for this current time?

2.  What suggestions could you offer me to try to make this thing a reality?

3.  What should be the name of this club?  ""Futurology Club""?  ""Futurism Club""?  Something else?

4.  Are there any other organizations that would be worth my time to contact?

5.  Assuming I can get such a club off the ground so to speak, what activities should we do?  I was thinking like public seminars and presentations besides member meetings on current breakthroughs and advances but what else could we do?

6.  There is a chance to more directly advertise this potential club through one of those sort of events where all the clubs and organizations get together and line up in the main part of the campus at tables to advertise and the sort.  I am thinking that is something I should try for, but how should I present myself and this idea?

Unfortunately it is worth noting that I have never started or ran a club or even been a real part of one due to none ever holding my interest for one reason or another.  It is therefore nerve-racking to me to try to do such such a thing.

I greatly appreciate any help and consideration you could give me for this matter",2,5

 I don't know were else I can get this off my chest, so I thought this was the best place.

	I have way to much time on my hands, and this leads to me thinking of stuff I really shouldn't.
 I see the way the world is heading, people are having too many kids and everyone in the Americas and Eurasia are using far to many resources to be sustainable.
 With this in mind, were do we expect to go? You think in this path we will make it outside of the solar system?
 Or find a way to archive our media and creations for along time? I just cant see it.
 I want to see people in 3rd world countries be happy and healthy, but in reality if they lived liked us 1st worlders or even 2nd worlders, the world would be hell.
 I want to see equality and peace among the world, but it can not happen with over 7 BILLION people on this rock.
 The only two options I see at this point are either to sterilize a large chunk of the worlds population or to do the unthinkable.
 I don't know what else could possibly be done, and it makes me sick and sad as I have felt for a year or two now. 
What I predict happening is our technology will advance for a few more years, maybe a decade or two, then when the population hits 8.5-10 billion, things like oil, electricity, fresh water, and even food will become increasingly rare, causing wars all over the world, and in the mean time Earth is going through some natural cycle on which sea levels are rising (due to solar cycles), other more common natural disasters like quakes, and typhoons and super tornadoes.
 The rising water will push people inland more causing even more congestion and wars until some government/organization releases a nuke or biological weapon. 

Some feedback on my ideas and thought would be nice.

Some notes:

-I do not plan on ever having my own child, but I may adopt.

-I do not and will not own a vehicle.

-I refuse to buy most plastic things like bottles ect.


TLDR: Screw everything, people will destroy ourselves.

The wealthiest among us can acquire more, but at best, it's a resource of diminishing returns - the more money you spend, the smaller increments of time you are likely to get. In a world defined almost entirely by a monetary global infrastructure, it's easy to lose sight of what is, genuinely, of most value to us individually. It is time. Not money. 

But there IS a system of money, and that system is very easy to manipulate when you have money. When you have money, you can change the rules of the game to secure your position in the game. You can access better medical care to add time to your lifespan, free yourself of labor obligations to free your time for use in other areas, and you can acquire things that enhance many of the experiences of your lifetime. But almost exclusively if you have money. 

This is what money, as a system, allows for us. Those with money average more time for themselves. Those struggling to acquire money average more time in the service of others. While it's admirable of our system to praise those who work hard to earn time for themselves, it should be deeply disconcerting to even the wealthiest among us that each individual's time is being systematically devalued by corporate culture. 

The social contract between us should acknowledge that once our time is given, its return cannot be guaranteed. Indeed, many honor this idea - especially those of us who form friendships with our employers and employees. But even this cannot last when the largest players with the greatest fortunes circumvent this social contract. Investment firms that buy out businesses, lay off workers, and close down operations - all the while earning a profit from this - is a betrayal of the social contract. 

""Time is Money"" is a lie, a catchy little slogan aimed at undermining one's most valuable resource. Money can be replaced - it can be taken from one person to compensate another. Time cannot. A person who gives 20+ years of their life in service to afford food, clothing, and the basic necessities of life cannot be reimbursed in years for their service. Money is a very poor compromise for a lifetime spent in service to others, especially when it is so easily corrupted by those who control most of it. 

That is the direction corporate culture is moving. Those of you who want money, who believe in a future where money exists alongside an automated, abundant society... you may believe this is how it ought to be. But if we allow it, we enable this system to take our most valuable resource from us. We practically give it away with no expectation of compromise whatsoever. 

When we allow the corporate culture to make our future, we might as well let them dig our graves for us... because our time no longer belongs to us when corporate culture has their way. We either live in service to their money or starve. It makes no difference to them. 

It's a con, and we're the marks. We're the ones they'll use to get their way, we'll do all the work for them, and they'll have all the time in the world to watch as their future society is built for them by people who will hardly benefit from it. Just remember this when you think about the true, genuine value of money. It's only diminishing returns for the time you give. And having watched people close to me pass away right before my eyes, that time is far more valuable than the ink printed on that paper could ever hope to be.",36,65

The main concern I have is, if this AI is more intelligent than all humans that have ever existed, how can we possibly think we can confine it with our will? If it has motivation, even if we manage to make it is our own, this thing can come up with ideas, theories, and philosophies that are literally impossible for our greatest minds collectively to come up with. It WILL find a loophole because we can't think, or even understand on the same level as it. It seems inevitable that it would turn on us, unless by some absolute stroke of luck it wants to help us due to a reason that only it can come up with. If it does turn on us, we are all dead and there is not a single thing we can do about it. To me, it seems like the risk may not be worth the reward.

I reckon he would spend his time with another web android friend in the cloud. Forever. While my biological body would eventually waste away while the cloud only become to be able to think for itself and be God or something. heh.",6,0

In such a situation, the poor players have little or nothing to bail out while the rich players are given unprecedented power as the game is reset. If one honestly reflects upon the issue, there really is no game or future when the outcome is rigged and most of the players are handicapped.  

Instead, if the people created new games structured to sustainably accommodate the global population, everyone could be bailed out and have an opportunity to participate in life fully. Imagine the potential of virtually connecting seven billion people worldwide to collaborate and compete advancing the games of civilization.",16,6

Everything I've found on the internet is either from a pro-transhumanism group saying that it's the best thing ever, or contrary groups saying it's the end of all that's good.
