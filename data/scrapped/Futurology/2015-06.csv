It doesn't actually understand the questions or understand the answers, nor does it understand why people are engaging in goal oriented behavior (why people want cancer treatments, why people want palatable food, etc). 

So how far away are we from an AI that can read a library worth of material and actually comprehend what it all means, and that can use that information to engage in goal oriented behavior? Like if your goal was to create a new treatment for sciatica an AI could read thousands of books and millions of papers and articles about biology, medicine, chemistry, biomechanics, etc. and understand that info, then understand how to use it to create a new treatment for sciatica? And it would be an AI that understands why we would want a treatment for sciatica (because nerve pain is subjectively unpleasant)? Basically something that understands and comprehends what it reads, can decide what it needs to read to find the answer it is looking for, and that understands why what you are asking is a goal in the first place (google doesn't understand why someone would google a treatment for sciatica for example).

There have been several iterations of Moore's Law since Gordon Moore first articulated it, even by Moore himself. So I don't want to get too hung up on precise definitions.

Basically, we are talking about the **doubling of transistors or components every couple of years.** The implicit correlation of this in past decades was that computing power mirrored this increase fairly neatly. This inherent and predictable symmetry in price/performance was enabled by [Dennard Scaling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling). The demise of Dennard Scaling happened sometime around 2004 and people often refer to this as hitting the *'power wall'* because clock cycles could no longer be used to increase performance gains. Because of this, greater emphasis on parallel processing became the best method for price/performance gains. This has continued through today, most visibly in the form of multiple cores.

Since hitting the *power wall*, the implicit gains in processing power have been eroding despite a multiplicity of techniques to squeeze more out of less. The visceral aspect of Moore's Law that we felt and expected for decades has quietly petered out. You may have noticed this over the past decade, in that there has been a greater emphasis on size, weight, battery and cloud services rather than the raw computing power of your machine.

The debate on Moore's Law often gets sidetracked by virtue of the fact that we are still substantially increasing the number of transistors on leading edge chips. However, the production [cost per transistor](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/123529-nvidia-deeply-unhappy-with-tsmc-claims-22nm-essentially-worthless) has flatlined and has even increased for most of the semiconductor industry at [22 nm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_nanometer).

The significance of this can not be understated. This happened about 3 years ago and **the cost per transistor is still flat**. Intel still claims improvement in cost per transistor, but the gains are minuscule, and nothing compared to before. So at best we have a brownout in Moore's Law, which is a suspension that we've never had since the inception of Moore's Law. At this moment, there is nothing in the semiconductor press to suggest this will be resolved any time soon. The costs of all the follow-on technologies are expected to be much more expensive than what we have now. It's not that performance can't be doubled, but the price of doubling.

I think the consequences of this are profound, and it's only now that people are beginning to notice them because this takes time filter through the economy. Just to illustrate this further. Here is a generic example:

**Moore's Law in-tact - (These numbers to demonstrate the principle only)**

* 1990 -&gt; 1,000,000 transistors = $400
* 1992 -&gt; 2,000,000 transistors = $400
* 1994 -&gt; 4,000,000 transistors = $400
* 1996 -&gt; 8,000,000 transistors = $400
* 1998 -&gt; 16,000,000 transistors = $400
* 2000 -&gt; 32,000,000 transistors = $400
* 2002 -&gt; 64,000,000 transistors = $400
* 2004 -&gt; 128,000,000 transistors = $400
* 2006 -&gt; 256,000,000 transistors = $400
* 2008 -&gt; 512,000,000 transistors = $400
* 2010 -&gt; 1,024,000,000 transistors = $400

**Price per transistor begins to flatline**

* 2012 -&gt; 2,048,000,000 transistors = $400
* 2014 -&gt; 4,096,000,000 transistors = $800
* 2016 -&gt; 8,192,000,000 transistors = $1,600
* 2018 -&gt; 16,384,000,000 transistors = $2,400
* 2020 -&gt; 32,768,000,000 transistors = $4,800
* 2022 -&gt; 65,536,000,000 transistors = $9,600
* 2024 -&gt; 131,072,000,000 transistors = $19,200
* 2026 -&gt; 262,144,000,000 transistors = $38,400
* 2028 -&gt; 524,288,000,000 transistors = $76,800
* 2030 -&gt; 1,048,576,000,000 transistors = $153,600
* 2032 -&gt; 2,097,152,000,000 transistors = $307,200


Obviously, this won't happen because these cost increases are absurd, but that is the Hobson's choice for performance increases. And that is the end of Moore's Law, illustrated.

I should note that these transistor counts are a rosy scenario, because the transistor count increases have been diminishing for some time now. And the reason they have been diminishing is due to both cost and performance.

Now, one further disclaimer. This is the leading edge of mass scale microprocessor technology. There are plenty of other semiconductor devices that have not yet reached this point and are still years away. Memory is pretty much already there, but there is still storage and all kinds of sensors and a myriad of other micro-devices that can still reap years of benefits from Moore's Law. So none of this will make an immediate difference to the ongoing robot revolution or self driving cars. But raw computing horsepower for more advanced tasks will begin to get expensive, to the point that further increases become unaffordable. And as time goes by, more and more classes of devices will expire their Moore's Law improvements. This is what I mean by *rolling terminations*. 

So having said all that, what are the consequences? What are the future consequences for a society, culture and economy that has been hooked on the free lunch of Moore's Law for generations? What are the hopes and dreams that may be permanently out of reach?

24,2015-6-1,2015,6,1,16,381zzj,I own a small manufacturing and product development company and I want to talk about designed obsolescence.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/381zzj/i_own_a_small_manufacturing_and_product/,garett206_wellfxxx,1433143805,"Hello my friends and fellow humans. I want to bring up a discussion that has been on my mind since 2008 when I started a small and fun computer accessory company.... designed obsolescence.

For those that do not know the term, designed obsolescence is a practise in which the designer of the product purposely designed fail points in the product. It is an old practise but has really taken strength in recent years. The idea is that if you build something to break, people will come back and buy it again. 

Ever hear, ""they just don't make 'em like they used to?"" It's true. I have a traditional toaster over that has been in my family for over 30 years and serves me well to this day. I also have a 1 and a half year old toaster over that just bit the dust. Unlike most consumers I called the company and attempted to get a replacement part. The replacement part was available and was roughly the same price of the toaster. BBQ's are specifically terrible with this type of part costs. They don't want you to buy the part, they want you to throw the old one in the trash and buy a new one. If you decide that you want to keep the old one, they will get roughly the same profit on the part that they would have netted on the brand spanking new BBQ. 

Here's the debate that I have had before on the subject:
This...
One could argue that in order to keep the economy running smoothly, you must have a constant influx of consumers to drive demand. Here is a link from the IMF http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2014/09/basics.htm . One could also argue that in order to make products attainable to the masses, you simply have to make them cheap. 

Or this...
The flip side to that is that we are filling land fills at massive levels with many items that are not necessarily trash. By offering service parts at a reasonable rate, we could slow that down a little and help keep valuable resources in the market and out of the landfill. We can also offer incredibly high quality items for a reasonable cost that may be higher, yet more affordable when considering the amount of time the product will be used for. 

We are living in an age that makes it possible to design items and have them made literally the same day. We also live in a time that production runs no longer need to be in the 10s of thousands. I make production runs in as few as 540 pieces at a time with ""just in time"" manufacturing principals. 

We offer lifetime warranties on most of our flagship items. With over 50,000 units sold over the last 5 years, I have not had one returned that we simply refunded the customer. We service our products and want to keep them out in the market place with our customers happy. And boy are they ever. 

Engineers and companies that practice designed obsolescence should be publicly flogged and stripped of the right to do business. Maybe I am wrong and should be corrected on my opinion. Maybe those that practise this type of business are already being flogged via consumer reviews? 

What are your thoughts on how we can evolve from this mentality and use technology to continue to grow a healthy economy while providing excellent quality goods to everyone?

The Fermi paradox is something that I think has several simple answers. The first one that comes to mind is using us as an example. We have been mostly isolated to Earth for our entire existence. And man has only gone as fare as the moon. Even with the constant advancement of science and technology regarding space travel, we are far from moving interstellarly. And there is a good chance (as theorized my many respected figures) that we may be extinct before we reach the stars, whether that be a horrible war disaster, the worsening conditions on Earth causing us to die off, or many other scenarios.

So what if any other sapient race has had the same problem, and they die off being isolated to their own world.

But mainly, we don't know how common sapient races are, because we only know one of them: ourselves. So what if every race near us just hasn't evolved enough to rise to the same power as ourselves. And perhaps there are other races trying to communicate, we just can't receive any of the signals or we are just too far away.

I could be wrong, but I find this a convincing answer to the Fermi Paradox.",78,5

This is really just a discussion/speculation, I hope you can share better insights. 

3D printing is for now a very complex process from the design of the parts to the actual print, so I tried to answer: where is it useful?

(I) Show off in front of your boss: Because, well 3D printing is cool. 

Dont take it wrong here, it is a good thing. Thats how I raise grant money for my research. Besides, we have a cool technology and we dont know how to use it for now. So the hype around it allows to explore the possible applications in the society and to overcome the activation energy of changing habits.

(II) Rapid prototyping: improving manufacturing processes. (More than 50% of the market)

You can read everywhere that 3D printing will kill manufacturing. Well, for now it is improving its position through the rapid prototyping allowing to fine tune before mass production for improving both the process of production and the development of the product. I have strong doubts 3D printers will ever be competitive against mass production in factories, outside a subset of products.

(III) Personalized/customized products: the subset of product (More than 10% of the market)

The two main fields are dentistry and jewelry. The new stereo-lithography delivers in terms of finish and uniqueness for the aesthetics and touch of the finery we wear. In the future you will certainly add other biomedical devices in this list like hearing aid (the shell), hips, what else?

(IV) Production: Elements that can only be produced by additive manufacturing. (Maybe 10% of the market)

Rather than replacing old manufacturing maybe 3D printing is an additional layer of complexity. For example for NASA (but maybe here its a version of point (i) to impress the public) and aeronautics, very advance parts, that were not feasible with existing tools, are accessible, like weird helix structures made by laser sintering.

(V)Visualization &amp; communication: 3D rendering. (Maybe few % of the market).

Nikola Tesla was known to be able to see the parts he was designing as floating objects in front of him at like 30 cm and he could manipulate them and transform them, a kind of advance gedanken experiment. Not everybody can easily visualize in 3D, as an alternative to holography we have cold hard models. For surgeon it can be a great tool to prepare for surgery to have a model; 3D imaging is sometime hard to read. For communication purpose pedagogic materials are known to be the key of a talk. 

(VI) Toy machines for playing at home represents few percent of the market.
Well you know.

(VII) Cool stuffs: thats my part. (Maybe 5% of the market).

From printing tissues (Organovo) to cool stuffs in the labs, 3D printing opens new avenues to explore. As usual when the big industry push a field it have secondary unexpected effects. Like [NASAs giant leaps in technology](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/80660main_ApolloFS.pdf) during the Apollo program or the silicium industry that was derived in microfluidics, a revolution in modern biology. Maybe we were thinking of 3D printing as you print your own car and end up with therapies. Here the idea is that it brings something unexpected, an emergent property, serendipity.

Sources: okay here I am a bit short so I would say [this article in Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/03/31/2015-roundup-of-3d-printing-market-forecasts-and-estimates/), Reddit ;) and internet is of course a great source FabLab in MIT and 3D platforms, fairs, etc. To note: with all the commercial and patent warfare going on, it is difficult to get info on the technologies in use.

This is for sure not exhaustive and thumb estimations so if you have proper sources or insight do not hesitate. I really tried to explain and keep it simple, I hope it works.",4,4

Maybe one solution would be limiting how much houses each people could have.
IMO a sensible approach would limit a house to each people.
Big cities (more than 1kk pop.) maybe would let people own 2 or 3 houses, so owners of detached houses would profit ""giving up"" to vertical buildings if they catch 2 apartments.

Most of the capital in capitalism is debt and the currency created out of debt.  In order to keep people laboring for capital, new debt must be created all the time so sufficient capital can keep flowing to fund a capitalist system.

Since technology is becoming so efficient, it is getting harder for the capitalists to find outlets to lend to beyond lending to students getting obsolete educations, governments borrowing money that future generations can never pay back, and corporations borrowing money to buy back stock to enhance their capital owners without doing much for productivity.

There is a primal instinct in humans to control each other, and capitalism exploits this instinct in people.  By forcing people to serve or labor for capital from the people with capital, the capitalists get to control the lives of their fellow humans and their families.

If everything was automated, then no one would have to control anyone to obtain goods and services.  This would be contrary to the capitalists goals of control just like freeing the slaves was contrary to the goals of slave owners or eliminating serfdom was contrary to the interests of the king.

For futurologists, better systems can be created beyond capitalism.  Einstein said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  Any system that is developed in the future should promote and reward, not discourage, productivity and efficiency.  Capitalism is now burdening the world with unsustainable debt and unnecessary suffering because of obsolete thinking.

With creativity and collaboration, an amazing, abundant, and sustainable future is possible.  But in order to get there, the narrative must move beyond the limitations of traditional capitalism.

In the future, I will be posting some concrete ideas.

It can't remain the same. Surely there will be some kind of technology bridge into this area. I think my recent thoughts have been influenced by the movies I've seen that take place in insane asylums of the past. It seemed back then they were adamant that behaviors could be changed and that psychosis could be cured. Sure they used bad science and were terribly wrong in most cases, but they still tried. Today I don't see anything of the sort in prisons and criminal justice. It's more like a meat locker for storing humans at all levels of security. Will technology try and change this? I envision a mix of possibilities. For low level offenders see education and awe inspiring and changing behavior. Think education in science and nature along with VR behavioral learning. For more agressive violent criminals maybe a form of gene therapy to silence the genes for agression and poor impulse control. It would all have to be on a volunteer basis. I couldnt see just forcing it upon people. Though they are criminals they should still have a sense of personal choice. Does my idea of a future prison have merit, or is it just a pipe dream. Will be have a more civilized criminal justice in the future, or will it just get worse and go down the path of Judge Dredd?",11,1

If you would like a review copy in PDF or mobi format, email me at cccalum at gmail.com.

It starts with a brief history of the science and a description of its current state.  It goes on to look at the benefits and risks that AI presents in the short and medium term, with a short story highlighting the improvements to everyday life that are in the pipeline, and discussions of technological unemployment and killer robots.

Then it gets into artificial general intelligence  machines with human-level cognition: whether we can create one, and if so when; whether we will like it if we do, and what we should do about it.

This has happened before. At the beginning of cinema , there was a movie about a train coming towards you that made people frightened and run out of the cinema. But we got uses to cinema, and now it's rarely scary or  real.

The rent in San Diego is out of control high.  Its so high, that you can pay a software engineer in some other part of the USA and pay them 2/3-1/3 of what you'd pay a San Diego dev and they'd have just as much take home pay.   I've successfully made a few projects with two different teams of people I never even met in person.   The indie video game scene is alive with telecommuting development.  I wonder how long until the big players catch on.   Even if you don't want to look at lowering pay rates, telecommuting opens up your door to a whole new range of talent who would rather not pick up and move just for you.

The primary function of a licensed lawyer is to prospectively and retrospectively look at facts and apply them to established rules/case law to create a conclusion. Sure there are other functions, but this is primary reason clients pay lawyers.

It you look at the capability of AI today, it can presently do this function quicker and faster than humans.  Going forward, the divide between technological productivity and people will only get wider, especially in law.

The above is not a criticism of lawyers, simply a statement of fact.  It will be emotionally difficult for most lawyers to accept that what took years of study and tens of thousands of dollars of fees can more efficiently be performed by AI in a matter of seconds.

As far as the above logic being limited to lawyers, it is only the beginning as technology will transform everyone's narratives in the future.  Do lawyers have a future?  Absolutely, but just not in their present roles.",133,87

Plus, NASA stated that they explore because ""humans are driven to explore the unknown"" and it would be a lot cheaper to explore unknown water rather than space exploration because it would cost $3,776,300,000 less (in terms of how much is funded).

First, a social site that pays out to a user account balance that can then be redeemed for gift cards or some amount in crypto-currency or some other form of value such as physically local services and products near to the user's location that are working with that site.  The pay could be based on upvotes, or it could be totally off-site and simply aggregate a series of user accounts from various other sites and assign some worth to a user's participation on that site.  Companies might find this attractive if the participation resulted in more traffic through a site which could be associated with attention to ads.  For instance, the site could pay users who get articles to the top of some subreddit, and since the pay is allocated directly to the user base it's possible that each user does not necessarily have to be influenced by any 1 particular company's demands for attention.  This might be kind of like a cross between paying YouTube content creators in portions of ad revenues, and a groupon that rewards users for contributing content.   

Second, something like a Duolingo but on-demand and the crowd-sourced translation work could be held at a bounty which would then be distributed to those who worked on that particular assignment.  There could be divisions of pay by higher ranking tiers of translators who can get more of the revenue due to their added value, and also maybe for each word of translation that actually makes it to the final translation (so that a poor translation would not result in much payment since not much of it would make it to the final product).  Actual language translation is getting increasingly automated so this might be profitable for only a few years, and for on-demand services such as a company trying to get a stream of Tweets translated as quickly as possible.

Third, something like a Duolingo, but for other skills particularly coding.  So for example, a user signs up and learns some aspect of web coding, then uses something like 'immersion' that allows them to actually work on pending projects.  Their pay can be allocated based on how much of their code actually makes it to the final product based on crowd-sourced coding like on a Github project.  Also users can be paid similarly to the second idea in that they are allocated additional rewards or payment based on factors such as on-demand projects needed by companies.  This would differ from current Mechanical Turk or other crowd-work sites because everyone passes certain levels of training milestones as they progress through learning about some area (coding).  It's almost like on-the-job training except that it's on your time and your own rate of progression and you are rewarded for actually learning the material and actually being productive in real-time, and you are like a contractor who gets an assortment of whatever payments or rewards (perhaps a local business has offered an hour-long massage or an oil change or $50 in groceries, etc) are associated with the project perhaps in addition to some consistent monetary reward based on the completion of tasks.

At first, I thought to myself that all of this would be pointless because people would be doing bits and pieces of work and wouldn't care enough to actually contribute to these sites.  Then I realized that basically everyone is contributing to sites and taking classes for free right now, and in some cases there is actually even a cost to the user.  Maybe having the site create opportunities for users in an system to reward certain efforts in order to make contributions more focused could create enough value to attract companies to these models.

Today a poor person is simply someone without a good job or access to money.  Poor people usually have very little security and often struggle to get by everyday.  There is relatively little opportunity for many poor people beyond day to day survival.

People are valued in the current narrative with money usually obtained from laboring in a job or ownership of a business where other humans labor.  As technology rapidly becomes more productive than humans, and the need for people to labor in traditional jobs evaporates, how will people be valued in the future?

Will anyone have security if too many don't?

I don't think we're going to do it all that soon.  At any level of launch mass, automated systems do better.  Sure, a human can do a lot more in a day than Spirit did.  But much more could be done by a fleet of rovers and orbiters with the same launch mass as the total of a human plus the redundant safety systems, plus the consumables, plus the radiation shielding (plus the fuel and equipment for the return trip, unless the human goes for the one-way-trip option).

Before a human goes to Mars, I think we'll have food production in a box.  (Well, not necessarily all one piece of equipment, and not necessarily box-shaped.  But no plants involved, just chemistry, heat, and so on, in mostly-automated machinery.)  Taking along months' worth of food is a whole lot of mass.  Recycling CO2 and sewage into food, in a set of equipment of reasonable size, will substantially cut the mass we have to accelerate.

Before a human goes to Mars, I think we'll have some way of accelerating a spacecraft other than throwing stuff out the back (i.e. other than rockets and ion drives).  We might throw *and catch* stuff between multiple spacecraft, so that the same reaction mass can be used over and over.  We might have dual lunar space elevators, so that a spacecraft can go with rockets to just below Earth-moon L1, climb the cables to a bit beyond Earth-moon L2, and get launched into interplanetary space by the motion of the moon.  We might have rotating tethers in medium Earth orbit for momentum transfer between inbound and outbound stuff.  We might have an electromagnetic launch system on the moon, that can fling stuff into a transfer orbit to Mars.  We might have a tidal-locked tether from sun-Earth L2 out to where you can step off the end and be in a transfer orbit to another tidal-locked tether at sun-Mars L1.  Light sails or electromagnetic solar-wind sails might turn out to be more practical than I think.  We might even have something that sounds impossible now, like tractor beams.  But I don't think we'll send a human to Mars until we have *something* other than rockets and ion drives.

Before we send a human to Mars, I think we'll be using resources from space in a serious way.  It might be asteroids.  It might be the moon.  But I don't think we'll send a human to mars until the massive components -- fuel, radiation shielding -- don't all have to be launched from Earth.

However --

I do think we'll send a human to Mars before we're post-human.  I do think we'll send a human to Mars before we can upload a human mind into a computer, send it there as data, and reconstitute it in a new brain synthesized on the spot.  And I do think we'll send a human to Mars within the lifetime of most of the people who are children now.",13,0

However, the current rules and narratives are locked into traditional closed narratives often confined to brick and mortar structures.  Collectively, the growth of this system globally in the past few decades is beginning to reach its sustainable limits.

Even though specialized labor based industrialization dramatically increased productivity from the agricultaral systems that preceeded it, new technology is creating unprecedented opportunty that blows beyond current limits.

In a system where people no longer need to labor in traditional jobs, the existing rules of money and property is closing off access and opportunity to many.  If people can be motivated to collaborate and share resources, unprecedented prosperity can be had by all.  But if we are stuck in our closed systems and obsolete rules, the adverse consequences and inevitable violence that follows tragedy of the commons will be our future.

Now the key question is whether humans nurtured to be self centered and greedy can peacefully advance into a better more productive future?",20,7

Barriers that currently block the progress of innovation will be obliterated and there will be unlimited opportunities for essentially everyone who wants to advance the narratives of life.

Capital, geographical location, employment, and socioeconomic status will no longer be limitations on progress or success on a connected planet.

Ideally they'd be contactless as well and use NFC or some other technology. 

The way they should work is that it would be a generic card that you can load all your credit cards onto from an app. Plus all your other payment systems like Paypal and Apple Pay.  Not only that, but also your ATM, bus pass or train pass and lots of other things that would be easy to load onto it like your hotel room door key or flight boarding pass. Eventually you could use it for your house key or car key. Pretty much anything that could potentially read a card. This type of system is already in use in [Malaysia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyKad). It doesn't have all these functions yet, but its got a lot of them.

You could even make valet cards for people who are taking care of something for you and need access to something with certain restrictions.

If you ever lose the card, you could just log onto your app and disable that card so no one can ever use it again. Then just get another one and load it up with everything ready to go in your app. Otherwise you might already have a spare one that you've got at home.

I think a generic multi-use smart card is easier and faster to use than your phone. Phone based payments aren't taking off for a lot of reasons. Cards also give you a backup if something happens to you phone.",0,1

I am passionate about human computer interface, and interested in a variety of topics like next-gen EEG/BCI/nerve controlled prosthetics, using EEG/MEG to interface with computers/machines, virtual/augmented reality. 

One thing I have decided is I would like to work more on extending the capabilities of existing technologies rather than working on the next step.Things like optogenetics are neat and promising, but I would like to work as much with humans-machines as possible, more than mouse-machines. 

I wanted to ask for names that I can look into, who are doing interesting or cutting edge projects. Bonus if it seems like they are unapologetic transhumanists that basically want to make John Silvers from Treasure Planet. 

I am currently thinking neuroscience or biomedical engineering program, but I think finding the right person to work with is more important than the program of study.

What I'm wondering is, if this desire for immortality by the elites will push the advancement of dangerous tech (such as AI) too fast in pursuit of immortality.

Well its been a long time coming but it finally looks like the old hair dryers days are numbered and Dyson will  use some of there amazing designs to silence the noisey hair dryer.

Dyson hair dryer patent
Lets not forget how Dyson took on the hoover industry and totally changed the market and the design of the hoover for the better, if his Hair Dryer designs are nearly as effective as his Cyclone Hoovers then the other Industry giants will know they are in big trouble.

Dyson has become annoyed at the time  and especially noise  involved in drying his full head of hair.

Diagrams that have surfaced at the UKs patents office show that his company has filed patents for a hand-held blower with an insulating chamber  in other words, a hairdryer, which is already being dubbed the Hairblade, playing on the name of its Airblade hand dryer.

Crucially, he seems to be aiming to make it much quieter than current models  rather as the Dyson bladeless fan is almost silent.

Standard hairdryers are extremely loud, reaching up to 75 decibels  as loud as a vacuum cleaner, but held beside your head.

The patents, which became public earlier this week, are surprisingly detailed, and show what looks like a hairdryer with an air chamber linked by two smaller cylinders to a smaller base unit. The air would flow through the two cylinders and into the base.

Alexandre F. Godefroy is credited with inventing the first hot air-blast hair dryer, probably in 1890. All over the Internet we find this man, usually with his name misspelled, having been inspired by the powered vacuum cleaners warm exhaust and attaching the hose to the exhaust instead of the suction area. Since the first patents for gasoline-powered, motor-driven cleaners with a vacuum were taken out in 1899 and 1901, this claim for inspiration is questionable. Before this, vacuum cleaners were hand-cranked or were manual carpet sweepers. Some sources, including an article at pbs.org, say the bonnet of Godefroys air-blast dryer was attached to the chimney pipe of a gas stove.

The present invention provides a hairdryer, the patent application begins baldly.

The design works by combining air pulled in through the motor element and from the sides of the machine, which would mean the motor could be smaller and lighter  and, perhaps crucially, less noisy. This can result in a smaller and or more compact hairdryer which uses less power, the application says.

 The idea of a hairdryer has intrigued retailers, as they are a low-cost item with little to distinguish them. Dyson products tend to be more expensive  but also offer better profits. Dyson is a popular brand at John Lewis, said a spokesperson for the retailer. Our customers love the unique designs and innovative technology.
The patent publication is a rare slip-up by Dyson, which goes to extraordinary lengths to keep its new products secret. It shrouded the launch of its most recent product  a combined tap-and-hand-dryer  in secrecy, demanding journalists sign non-disclosure agreements.

Key among the phrases used in the 56-page application are that it would have sound absorbing and vibration absorbing properties tuned to the resonant frequencies of the appliance.

Dyson has also focused on the safety aspect of hairdryers, where anything that gets sucked into the air intake can come into contact with the electrically heated wires that warm the incoming air and cause a short circuit. It moves the warming element away from the air intake: if something is inserted into the appliance, it cannot contact the heater directly, it says.

Dyson is one of the UKs biggest engineering firms, reporting profits in September of 364m on revenues of 1.2bn in 2012, and announcing that it wants to hire another 250 engineers in the UK.

Dyson himself is not listed as an inventor on any of the related patent applications, which have been filed from the companys headquarters in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.

A spokesman would only say: Were constantly working on new inventions. I dont really know what our engineers are working on.

But the spokesman agreed that Dysons biggest inventions had, indeed, been born out of his annoyance with previous products. A lot of innovations are inspired by frustration, he said.

With the threads on the other subreddits of police actions in the USA, and the discussions they provoke, I began to think. I would like to make a disclaimer up front. THIS IS NOT A THREAD ABOUT THE POLICE ACTIONS IN THE NEWS.

Instead, I want to talk about non-lethal weapons in development/that have been developed and not funded for use.

The Taser has major drawbacks. It has a short range, long reload time, limited use and a high chance to miss with one or both prongs. The baton is close quarters only. Tear Gas and Flash-bangs require extra equipment to use effectively.

I heard a while back about some pepper guns that fired paintballs full of the active compound in chillies. It could also be mixed with dies to identify individuals after an incident. But other than passing mentions, they seem to have dropped out of circulation. Sonic weapons are the same, had a brief blaze of glory, then nothing. 

What non-lethal (preferably ranged) weapons are in development or have recently been developed? How effective are they at reliably dropping a target? Are they portable? Are they being funded for use with the police? If not, why not?

You seem like the right guys to ask. ",5,0

Everyone from [Bill Gates](http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-bots-are-taking-away-jobs-2014-3) to [technology bioethicists](http://www.businessinsider.com/technology-is-destroying-jobs-and-it-could-spur-a-global-crisis-2015-6) to [extremely popular youtubers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) are weighing in on the debate.

While articles keep appearing warning of a coming potential dystopian picture where labor is replaced by machines and we are rendered as serfs work in academic circles has been somewhat more split between fields. [Recent](http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/08/Future-of-AI-Robotics-and-Jobs.pdf) surveys of academics and experts within fields have revealed a clear split in consensus between technologists and economists; technologists favoring technological unemployment and economists suggesting other outcomes. Why does this split exist?

**How does technology act on labor?**

We have a fairly good understanding of the relationship between labor, technology and growth developed over the course of many decades. Technology increases the productivity of workers, it increases the goods &amp; services outputs of workers. Wages track productivity, increases in productivity will increase wages.

A fairly common myth is that wages have decoupled from productivity in recent years, [in reality](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.360.9511&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) we are seeing a statistical bias in the common methods we use to examine wages &amp; productivity created by other effects. Similarly the idea that wages have been stagnant for decades is [largely wrong](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/where-has-all-the-income-gone), again we are dealing with statistical biases in our metrics.

Of these other effects the prevailing model is that of [Skill-Biased Technical Change](http://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/violante/Books/sbtc_january16.pdf) which has been most heavily contributed to by [David Autor](http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/dautor) out of MIT in recent years. While other competing models exist they all share a similar set of outcomes but act in different ways, all of them explain labor changes resulting from technology from the dawn of industrialization until today. SBTC is very simply the effect that productivity increases tend to favor those workers who make use of new technology, IE have skills.

Even with both of these effects together the effect of technology on labor is one of [increasing labor demand](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_eKbRnXZWx3jSRBb) (higher productivity and lower prices for goods production) but with increasing wage inequality, the gains of technology are not experienced as much at the bottom as they are at the top.

**How does technology act on prices?**

Like labor demand this is also a productivity effect. Rising productivity will axiomatically reduce prices ceteris paribus, long-term even in non-competitive markets.

These falls are often offset by changes in consumption preferences or are otherwise so small that people don't perceive them. As a simple thought experiment here do you think housing today is more expensive then in 1955? What if I told you the real price per ft^2 has risen by ~14% (declining relative to incomes) and the increase in what people pay for housing is almost entirely driven by the increase in the size of the homes we consume? People have kept housing as a constant approximate one third of their household expenses and simply seek out larger homes, since 1955 the average size of a home has nearly tripled while we have one less person per household.

These changes can been seen throughout the prices we pay. I'm sure other then the recent price drop people are lamenting the cost of gas as always, while the price of gas has certainly risen the price of car transport per mile has fallen fairly dramatically; newer vehicles are cheaper, more fuel-efficient and more reliable then those we have had in the past. Even while household miles driven has increased and number of cars per household has increased household spending on transport has fallen, 22% between 1986 and 2011.

The way we measure inflation is simply [inaccurate for most of the population](http://www.wikiberal.org/images/c/c5/Inequality_and_Prices-_Does_China_Benefit_the_Poor_in_America.pdf) (excludes all rural &amp; suburban consumers, doesn't consider different price levels for different income groups and CPS fails to collect accurate consumption data), its understandable why people percieve things are getting more expensive when they are not. [Household level](http://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-1/pdf/a-comparison-of-25-years-of-consumer-expenditures-by-homeowners-and-renters.pdf) analysis reveals that the basic cost of living for a household has been falling fairly continously for the last 30 years.

This is technology &amp; trade specialization at work, as we become more productive due to technology the price we pay for goods falls.

**How do these interact?**

The worst case scenario we can see is real stagnation for the bottom decile and accelerating real gains as income increases. In effect whats been occurring for the last 35 years will continue to occur for the foreseeable future.

**Are humans going to follow horses, destined to be replaced by machines?**

I'm sure everyone has seen the paper that estimated computerization exposure for labor at 47%, I strongly encourage you to read it particularly the note regarding productivity gains and new areas of employment being outside of scope. Autor [has a very good paper](http://economics.mit.edu/files/9835) which builds on this looking at labor projections in a world where 47% of current roles are now computerized. As expected he finds an extended SBTC effect at work, accelerating nominal wages for the skilled while stagnating nominal wages for the unskilled.

While there are certainly [alternative views](http://www.kotlikoff.net/sites/default/files/Robots%20Are%20Us%20NBER%20WP%2020941_0.pdf) these also find inequality concerns not unemployment concerns.

Both of these hold until the singularity, perhaps beyond the singularity due to utility &amp; social-preference.

**So what problems will we have?**

A future without technological unemployment is not a future without problems, there are many we can see today and I am sure many that will emerge in the future.

The first major issue is that of labor matching. This is simply the process by which skills you have are matched with the demand for labor, you have skills x and an employer wants skills y, if you don't have desired skills you fail to match. Matching failures can increase structural unemployment short-run but long-run these issues do clear. The way they clear is by people finding employment that is a poor match for their skills but still provides an income, this is the effect of those with degrees working in retail. We have actually had matching issues unrelated to technology for some time as education signaling is often ineffective (there is no price information when choosing a degree which allows you to distinguish a degree with strong career options from those without), increasing rates of technological change will exacerbate this issue significantly. We need significant changes to the way we provide tertiary education, as well as improvements to the K-12 which feeds it.

Next the exponential curve of technology development produces shocks. Shocks are simply changes that push a system out of equilibrium, they can be both positive and negative and a single change can cause both positive and negative shocks in different areas of the economy. For instance McDonald's fully automating their restaurants would cause a shock by significantly reducing the price you pay for their food but would also result in millions of people becoming temporarily unemployed. Equilibrium would be restored when price levels have settled down, the market has absorbed the price change and labor demand elsewhere rises in response to the price change (either proximately or due to consumption substitution demand elsewhere). For the duration of these shocks its important we have income support (as well as educational support) for those workers who have been disrupted. This could take the form of an improved version of unemployment insurance or it could be something better like [this](http://www.irp.wisc.edu/research/nit/NIT_index.htm).

The inequality issues the SBTC effect creates are best addressed using mobility. That is provide the tools for individuals to re-skill via education as well as income support while they do this.

**A thesis on post-scarcity**

While technologists discuss the singularity as a trend or region of interchange from an economics perspective we consider it as a singular point at which a machine intelligence achieves equality with humans in creative &amp; cognitive tasks. While this point doesn't imply the immediate displacement of human labor it does imply a decline in the value of human labor (and thus wages) which is worthy of discussion. The idea of a point doesn't suggest there can't be a bleed effect before or after, its simply a way of considering a specific point in time beyond which concerns exist. One consideration here is that a machine replacing a human has interesting implications from a scarcity &amp; production standpoint.

An easy way to consider scarcity is that its the simple quality that your consumption imposes an opportunity cost on others, your consumption of goods changes the amount of goods for others to consume. This is what cost represents, its an equilibrium between the supply &amp; demand of goods.

As well as scarce goods we also have two other forms;

* Free goods - These are goods which, by their nature, have an infinite supply and thus no opportunity cost exists with consumption. Some of these we impose artificial scarcity on (think IP) as its necessary for the emergence of new free goods in a world built on scarcity.
* Non-scarce goods - These are goods which have an effective infinite supply. Examples include air &amp; sea water, while both are finite there is no reasonable level of demand which would result in an opportunity cost on others for their consumption.

Post-singularity goods look very much like free &amp; non-scarce goods. There is no natural capital &amp; labor expenditure for production allowing for an effective infinite supply of these goods to exist. This does not mean that some necessarily scarce goods will remain (think land and some creative goods) but by what mechanism will we distribute these goods? Will we continue to use money in a world where we have almost no need for money?

Without money why do we have employment concerns?",8,36

Much like plugging a battery into an RC car, I imagine redesigning shipping container to have solar cells on their top and sides and batteries to hold excess power. You would simply sit your shipping container where ever, it would charge up, and they you'd place it on a specially designed train which then drew power from it. 

Every day I drive past freight trains that literally sit on the tracks for weeks with the sun beating down on them, this seems like a gross waste of energy.

Not only could you ship freight, but also passengers for literally next to nothing, especially if you're upgrading the existing junk that are on the tracks now (for the most part).

Looking to discuss this :)

It really got me thinking.  The technology field is really taking over the medical field and for the better.  We're are on the midst of several technical revolutions that will enhance our lives like never before.  

Sure, Technology and medicine go hand and hand and have done so for thousands of years but we're coming to a point where technology will actually take over the medical industry.  What with robotic surgeons, Dr bots, BIG DATA, 3D printing, Genetically modifying food/humans, and all other sorts of technology coming out of the research stage, and introducing themselves to the medical field, medicine will forever be changed.  And I think its coming a lot sooner than people realize.  

With these advances in biotech we have the opportunity to enhance our lives and our bodies.  I literally mean create ""super beings"".  Who knows, maybe we'll be able to see in the dark/thermal vision, have super strength, or even modify how we protect ourselves with our skin.  What if we could make it so space didn't actually harm us, or the suns radiation didn't kill us.  I guess my question to this community is do you think that humanity will at some point in the next hundred years create a ""superman"" or ""super being"", and allow everyone to have it?  Or will it be for a select few?

I want you guys to create a timeline of when you think this would be possible and why, and explain where genetically modifying humans is going and its benefits.

Ive been a long time *Futurology* subscriber and Ive always been inspired by the content I see here daily. Now we wish to contribute and spread it to the world in new ways, so me along with other NYC students are set out to create a *Futurology Youtube Channel* that does just that in a fun manner thats still informative and heavily *community-oriented*.

Well be starting off with a 6-episode season as an experiment released over the course of 3 months, with each chapter exploring a particular subject. /r/Futurology is full of brilliant minds, and we would like to use this to our advantage, *crowdsourcing* the content so the videos can be as rich as possible content-wise. 

How it'll work is the following: for every episode well create a thread here to discuss the subject extensively, and out of the discussion well grab the best points of view and use them to build the script for the 10 minute video with the help of volunteers. The discussion is one of the things that make this subreddit great and we would like for the Youtube Channel to be an extension of that.

If you would like to help in any way, feel free to PM me. Any help is appreciated and this project can truly only be done right with team effort. We're hoping to get help not only from community members, but also from Youtubers and Futurologists in NYC and beyond to create something unique that has purpose.

The discussion for the first episode will open in the upcoming weeks. Be mindful that *this is not an official subreddit Youtube Channel* (though we sure hope it can be the case someday), but we have mod authorization to carry on this project unofficially.

547,2015-6-7,2015,6,7,4,38tv5s,Running errands with Self-Driving Cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/38tv5s/running_errands_with_selfdriving_cars/,Dan_Keane,1433620106,"I was out doing the weekend errands and was thinking how it would work with SDCs.  This is a bit stream of consciousness, fair warning, but just some thoughts I wanted to share.

If people just own their SDC, then I would assume that errands would work pretty much like normal. A SDC would take you to Store A, drop you off at the door, go park, and pick you up/tell you where it parked when you were ready via your phone.  Then you would be off to Store B, rinse and repeat until it was time to go home, where SDC would park in the garage and you would unload your stuff.

However, I don't think most people will own a SDC and instead it will be a ZipCar/Uber/CityOwned system and people will just rent a SDC as they need it.  This is where I'm curious how it will shake out as the technology becomes ubiquitous.

For example, I go to the Farmers Market first thing Saturday morning and buy some eggs.  But now I want to window shop for a few hours, but I don't want to carry around my eggs.  I could put them in my SDC, but that would force the SDC to keep the meter running.  Not really worth it for eggs. Does the SDC drop my eggs off somewhere and goes about picking out other customers?  Is there some sort of centralized locker system?  Am I forced to carry eggs around all day like a crazy person?  Should I have just waited to get the eggs?

I suppose just renting a SDC for a few hours on the weekends and during the morning commute would still be cheaper than owning a car, but still people would want to minimize running the meter.

Or what about making a trip to Lowe's and buying a bunch of dirt that has to be dropped off in your back yard?  Would you have to order a special SDC?  Would Lowe's have one?  How would you direct the SDC to back up into your yard (""just a bit more, two feet to your left, don't run over the rose bush"")?

There would obviously be a premium for SDC during peak time (Saturday mornings, rush hours, etc), so would that factor into when people are doing errands?

Would people even have to do errands if a SDC could unload itself?    I knew just want I wanted at Lowe's, I could have just ordered it online and I would imagine that the delivery fee would be pretty small since you don't have to pay a driver.

I imagine that standardize lock boxes would become common so that UPS/USPS SDC would be able to drop off packages without having a driver.  Maybe that is what will happen with all the garages; they become giant mail boxes.

Stores wouldn't really need parking lots anymore, but instead need massive drop-off areas for people getting in and out of SDCs as close to the store as possible.

Massive infrastructure changes will have to happen, obviously.

This of course all assumes that the economy won't collapse under the stress of all the robots/SDCs putting people out of work.

Crazy to think about.  I wonder if people just as amazed when horseless carriages started to be a thing.",9,4

Maybe not majority, at least at first, but there'd still be some human allies if the AI even asked.

Another thing is, what other, better scenarios do we have planned for the future? With governments becoming closer to 1984 and public to BNW we might soon become prisoners of our own countries, that is if we already are not, for all we know we could be living within countries akin to china, it's especially terrifying and plausible considering such projects as NSA or 5 eyes, the corruption within power-based positions where the bad guys prevail and good guys fall on their face (politics, police), the narrowing of competition as seen based on how little jobs vs. workers there are and the fact that 1% controls 50% of wealth etc., we the citizens are losing control over the system, I don't think the people high up there have any control either and it's just one cleaning another's hands just to not be stabbed in the back. If anyone is going to prove the post-apocalyptic vision, it's the powers of the world, and if these people could be stripped off their power by objective, unbiased and more powerful being, then that, as far as I can see, is one of the more optimistic scenarios.

However, to me, at least in my opinion, the AI will be more like Multivac where it will have some objective and strive for it, probably self-preservation, in case of malicious government we could even see an AI in style of ""Pupeteer"", or even start as a simple AI like HAL 9000 (imo the AI in movie was pretty simple-minded compared to a human, or heavily restricted in development) and develop into something like Samantha (or practically any AI in that movie) from ""Her"". My point is, I don't see how an AI like SKYNET, HAL 9000 or VIKI from I, Robot could come true, especially when we're talking about beings that would have access to all the information, including all the dirt on every government, and have some control/knowledge of anything that connects through long-distance, which I assume in far future will be pretty much everything except for George R. R. Martin's newest WIP book. 

The only way I can see an 'AI' go rogue is if it was not in fact a true AI and it had some flawed programming preventing it from learning, programming itself, ignore functions etc. but any AI capable of unbiased, objective reasoning and logic should have no query, imo, with beings that do not directly threaten it.

The basic fact of rocket-based spaceflight is the [rocket equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation).  Basically, it says that a rocket has to be almost all fuel, if it's going to get anywhere off Earth.  For any amount of payload and rocket, the amount of fuel required increases *exponentially* with the amount of speeding up/maneuvering needed to get to the destination.  This [page](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html) lists some numbers: just to get to low Earth orbit, a solid rocket would have to be 96% fuel and 4% rocket-plus-payload; the best number on the list is hydrogen/oxygen, which has to be 83% fuel and 17% rocket-plus-payload.  That's if you're just going to low orbit.  If you want to go to Mars or wherever, it gets worse.  Exponentially.  

(By the way, this may be a partial answer to the Fermi paradox: maybe most civilization-supporting planets are slightly larger than Earth, at which point escape by rocket becomes basically impossible.  So civilizations on those planets don't make it into space.)

There are two possible responses: use materials in space, instead of launching the rocket fuel from Earth; or use technologies other than rockets.  

Using space resources is fundamental to having a future at all.  But before we can do so, we (or rather, our automated machinery) have to be able to get to them, and then get the resources to where we want to use them.  If we use rockets, that means making huge amounts of rocket fuel in space, or lifting even huger amounts from Earth.

There are various options for [non-rocket space launch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rocket_spacelaunch).  Then there are ways of accelerating in space.  I'll just mention a couple of the latter, and post: see if I can start any discussion.

I like the idea of building dual lunar space elevators.  I've mentioned it in other posts here.  One elevator goes from the moon toward Earth, with its center of mass just past [L1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point), and the other extends away from Earth with its center of mass just beyond L2.  By extending a long tether beyond L2, we can fling payloads out into interplanetary space.  For destinations in the plane of the moon's orbit, we could simply release the payload from the end of the tether at the right moment.  For other destinations, we would need to launch from the end of the tether with a mass driver.

The other approach I want to mention is to have a mass driver orbiting faster than the normal speed for the orbit it's in, with a stream of payloads being launched away from the planet it's orbiting (or away from the sun, if it's in interplanetary space).  You can't gain any orbital angular momentum that way, but you can gain orbital energy.  If you can rendezvous with an asteroid, launching a tether to meet it at low relative velocity and attach, then the asteroid itself can provide the needed angular momentum.  Alternatively, a mass driver at a Lagrange point (Mars-sun, for example) can use the angular momentum of the planet.",8,19

What is the current state of the art in applied and theoretical materials that can handle the amount of wind resistance and heat generated by reentry? 

Without any kind of background in materials engineering I don't even know what kind of questions to be asking when I try to look this stuff up. I am wondering if it would be possible to convert a percentage this heat into some other form of energy, or if the heat could be channeled to ablative segments of a craft's hull and away from the structural members. 

The discovery channel used to love to do shows about this crazy Canadian inventor who invented a suit of armor that bears could not break and he also invented something called ""fire paste"" which seems to be really good at insulating against extreme heat, but I can't find too much on that which doesn't look good for it actually being real. 

What are the general ideas on improving our ability to absorb, reflect, or direct the intense heat generated by reentry for safer reentry for our increasing array of orbital transport craft? ",1,4

---

There are so many who have died that we would like restored when the science of human cloning has fully matured (how's it progressing nowadays?)

Now if someone's memories, et al., well, essentially their whole minds, haven't been fully uploaded to a backup database, then there's another obstacle to cross.

Until ""quantum archaeology"" arrives, we'd have to piece together who they were from: 

* (truthful) testimonials of loved ones, friends, teachers, supervisors and so forth
* their journals / diaries
* their academic papers, if found
* their photographs of how they lived their lives (might be indicative of personality types and so on)
* videos of them - those are golden
* newspaper and other media artifacts about them
* their possessions (may show some qualities about who they are)
* and anything to do with them.

Family members and others endeared to them would try rather hard to reassemble ""their person"" with these life-artifacts, but this ""reconstruction effort"" for their personhoods won't exactly reach 100%.

Sure, to ""extrapolate for missing data,"" while uploading and programming the clone's mind, we can add in the most wonderful personal qualities and (fictitious) life experiences (ex.: going on a Norwegian backpacking trip when they never really did, and meeting awesome people they never really met) to make their ""(deceased name) 1.1"" a more awesome &amp; hospitable person to be around than before.

However, futurists with other viewpoints will say, ""But that extrapolation takes elements of other people - the person they never were - and combines them with who they were, so you're essentially melding two personalities together into their clone!""

I think ""quantum archaeology"" would solve that dilemma, for those who prefer not to take the ""extrapolation"" route to ""complete the clone's reconstructed personality.""

But I have a super-vague idea, that may or may not be correct. Please define ""quantum archaeology"" in a way that laypeople can understand, and how this would work in restoring the dead's minds back to life in a clone.",4,1

It is not bound to the traditional constraints of people.  Humans are often controlled and limited by primal traits including selfishness, greed, and capacity.

Going forward, one wonders whether the limits of people will block the progress of technology.  Will we program it to be like us or will we make it better than us?

If we simply look at the way people treat each other, the outlook is not the best.  We are limiting each others progress all the time through violence, rules, and other means.  Although, AI can eliminate some of the causes of human limitations and make some of our current negative traits obsolete, people are naturally resistant to progress, even positive changes.

However, occasionally an enlightened and intelligent person comes along to push narratives forward despite the resistance of reluctant herds.  AI has the potential to take civilization far beyond anything people have seen so far.  Will someone come along again to show us a better path?

The question now is whether the limitations of humans will ever let AI reach its potential and what role will people have in this journey.",13,0

I'm interested in both your list and the reasons why. Submitting your list before reading others' contributions would be preferred.

A [5 Whys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) approach is encouraged, though I'd like to modify that slightly:

* Why is your stated issue a problem (e.g., its consequences).
* Why are _those_ consequences problems, and what are their causes? (Iterated, this is the initial ""5 whys"" methodology.)
* Why, ultimately, do those problems exist (e.g, is there an identifiable root cause or set of root causes)?
* If your initial problem is solved, _what then?_ In the spirit of [the Sorceror's Apprentice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorcerer%27s_Apprentice), what are the consequences (or remaining issues) of solving the initial issue?

Optionally: who is (or isn't) successfully addressing them. Individuals, organizations, companies, governments, other. How and/or why not?

I'm asking this question in a number of venues (including several subreddits). I'd appreciate /r/Futurology's views.

I'll summarize results in future at /r/dredmorbius.

 Google recent projects relating to putting electronics into clothes made me realize that it would make it pretty sweet if these guys actually introduced their own clothing lines, regardless if they have tech built into them or not.

 It could serve as a cool way to market their products, and get people to have a more culturally integrated view of the big tech companies like Google and Microsoft and could be a good way to integrate technological modernism into society.

 With augmented and virtual reality, hats could be a great way to incorporate this tech. Futuristic headwear. The eventual internet of things will also make these clothes becoming more and more sophisticated. Whether it's for casual, fitness, or business purposes.

Both are respected by millions and have spoken out against the development of super-intelligent computer programs.  Not just them, but many people from all walks of life fear the invention of a super AI will bring about the end of mankind in one way or another.

For centuries, people were afraid Jesus would return and bring about the Apocalypse.  Then, from the 50s through the 80s, they feared the Russians would start a nuclear apocalypse;  the 90s cloning experiments had them thinking genetic engineering would create a super-virus apocalypse.  By around 1999, the Y2K apocalypse had some running to buy underground shelters.  9/11 began the Terror apocalypse, and then the Mayan apocalypse of 2012.  Finally, after decades of dystopian movies predicted AI would doom us all, the time has come to raise that banner now as well.

It's pretty obvious each and every time something radically different and new is conceived, a great bulk of the population is afraid of it and make many claims as to why it should be stopped.  And each time it is proven that their fears, while understandable, are greatly exaggerated.  According to my calculations there have been exactly zero apocalypses in modern history.  The Four Horsemen haven't ridden forth from the depths of Hades, there was no atomic war, civilization did not end because of a trivial computer dating problem (nowadays this could be fixed in minutes and updated via cell or internet instantly), the flip of the Mayan calendar revealed nothing more than the first month of the next year and Miss [Pop's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haab%27) centerfold.

Here we are just a few short years after 2012 mania was spontaneously deflated, much as Y2K was more than a decade-and-a-half ago, trying to calm everyone down, quite uselessly, once again.

Obviously, different people fear things for different reasons.  Take Bill Gates for example.  With all indications pointing towards a future of equality and the reduced need for humans to do work, some positions will become obsolete.  As of right now, people have been - and are being - laid off as their jobs are replaced by automation.  As AI and automation take more of the job market away, there simply aren't enough jobs to give one to everybody.  Eventually computers will write programs and update the code, there will be no need of software developers.  Likewise, a shift towards wealth equality and more efficient resource management will make the likes of Bill Gates become an extreme waste of resources.  How can we provide those in need when there are those who hoard enough for millions of individuals?  AI will likely recommend wealth be distributed more evenly, and that means billionaires and millionaires will see their assets shrink.

What about Stephen Hawking?  He isn't super rich, but he is super smart.  A super smart guy like him is afraid of AI because it will be the end of his ilk.  With computers many times smarter than humans, why should we develop our genius?  To most of the population, this may not seem like a big deal, but when you are amongst the elite thinkers, becoming obsolete is just as frightening as to a chef or a truck driver.

What other reasons could cause people to fear the end of the world, and what drives them to exaggerate the threat so much?  Why do they fear that which can bring us such good?",62,17

But with every scientific discovery there are layers that separate the actual discovery from the general population. 

An example is IBM's Watson. The people who have direct access to Watson are a small team at IBM. APIs are available now to the general public, but APIs aren't the same as having direct access to Watson, and provide only a fraction of the services Watson is capable of providing.

In the same way, when AI suddenly occurs, who do you think will have access to it? It certainly won't be plugged directly into the internet. It will be compartmentalised, and different levels of access will be granted. I imagine a large corporation, for example will be able to pay for the use of a number of services/solutions the AI can offer - but for the end user, AI will be bundled into services and products. The average person will be able to ask complicated questions, and receive amazing answers based on a whole lot of data, but the end user will *never have access to the data sets themselves*, and will never be able to direct the AI to consult outside datasets that it doesn't have access to.

The average person will be saddled with Siri 9.0, while someone higher up will have free-reign on the applications they want to use the AI for.

There will never be a point where the end user and the (full) AI will be able to communicate directly, because access will be limited by social and economic status.

We will be sold dumbed down solutions, much in the way a multivitamin company will sell us Omega 3 tablets - ""it's good for you, scientists approve!"".

If AI were god, and society the Catholic church, to talk with God, we would need to rely on a priest to pass on our messages. This is what I think will happen once AI occurs. There will be an increase in overall growth, but without direct access, the human race won't ever reach some sort of technological singularity. Instead, there will be the people with knowledge, and those without. AI will be a glorified brain in a jar.

I chat with a friend of mine on a fairly regular basis about the future, technology, health, diet, etc etc. We share articles with one another etc.

Anyway I was talking to him about diet and health. I used to be quite fanatical about eating really healthy. I tried a lot of different diets to see if I liked them and how I felt while eating that way etc. I came to the conclusion that for my own well being (mostly of mind and satisfaction with life kind of way) it was best for me to kind of just eat ""whatever"" but try to eat as healthy as possible. Following a strict diet created stress, weird social situations, embarrassment going some place for dinner or whatever.

Doing as much research as I have about nutrition and diet, I know what is good for me and what isn't, so I generally stick to the good.

Anyway, I was chatting with him about health and all that and just kind of thought that we are of the age that I don't think it really matters what I eat right right now because in 30 years when any serious sort of diet related illnesses like heart disease, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes (which I am prone to get as both my grand dad and my dad both got type 2), etc start to crop up I feel like there will be solutions to these.

Not necessarily a cure, but like for example oh shit your heart isn't working so great anymore, you should transplant that with a mechanical one (which is already actually proven to work right now), or even a real possibility that I might not even have a biological body at all. 

What do you guys think about this? I still think it's important for me to eat as healthy as possible, because I've learned over the years that when I eat shitty food all the time it does actually have a very negative effect on how I actually feel day to day and my emotional state of mind etc. From an actual serious bodily health point of view I kind of feel like it's irrelevant.

That is, if any of these scientists are to be believed.",0,3

A good bet might be the future impact of AI on labor; or perhaps the impact of AI on scientific discovery; or maybe even the impact on military applications, like killer robots.

My guess is that they will mostly discuss how severe the impact of AI will be on labor and the economy over the next decade or two (for the AI part of the discussion).

Education apps keep getting better and better.   Once education apps become to the degree to spoon feed you K-12-college, then you'd just need to give a phone to a dedicated mind and they can become a genius over time.

Poor people do want hand outs and to survive, but normally they want something to do with their life.  If you could give them an education platform by which they can build an education on, they could have a lot to contribute to society in a number of ways.   There is dignity in an education.

I think the future of education might be in smart phone apps.  I think they're there now if you have money to pay for the good ones for your kids.   But as competition heats up, the cost of these apps will go down for a race to the bottom.  Normally racing to the bottom of price is bad for an industry.

The human mind cannot distinguish well enough between reality and VR. I have for a while now come to the opinion that eventually the upsides of future humans uploading themselves into the cloud would prove far too great a draw to resist.  Certainly not for the masses.

Maybe it's a horror show or maybe it's the next step in evolution .....I think what you think about that says more about you then it says about the technology. The technology simply IS and we conform to it just like we conformed to living by a beach and learning to fish or conformed to living inland and learned to hunt.

One  thing though is for sure .....starting tomorrow and with the sale of the first VR devices later this year we will begin the process of adapting human minds to the possibilities that will be fully realized only when people start uploading themselves.  

If you look forward to the next video card or the newest console today you will be looking forward starting in 2016 for the next incremental improvement in VR every year moving forward.  And it IS going to improve ....year in and year out. Relentlessly. 

FIRST it's oculus and VIVE and every year moving forward the tech will be refined. The resolution will improve ro photo realism. The latency will drop to zero. The controllers will grow ever more sophisticated every year.  Eventually the ski goggles shrink and they are reduced to glasses that project into the eyes. Touch, taste and smell will be imitated slowly as peripherals continue to iterate upwards to ever increasing levels of sophistication. 

Then eventually once people have been doing this for a decade or two we start jacking in straight to the brain because after all we will know people that were born paraplegic and blind by then.  We will know peopel by then who walk and see perfectly well and even dance and drive cars because medicine created the artificial limbs and eyes for them and then wired them in to their bodies by grafting them on. It's a miracle we will  take for granted and not a freak geek jacking in after hacking his body like we hear about in popular science fiction. It will come to us cloaked in that most irresistable of qualities....it will be common.

 Once we do that for a few years and people routinely spend time in a virtual world that is infinitely more entertaining than the real world can ever hope to be (for most people at least) we have nothing left but to upload ourselves into the Web and continue to do what by then society will not be addicted to but instead what society has evolved to and adapted too.  A fully realized virtual world with full stimulation/ imitation would be completely unrecognizable from real life and infinitely more interesting and stimulating then the real world. 

Eventually the world we can create will be far and away preferred to the world we exist in. It won't matter if the world's oceans are toxic or that global climate change has run amok.  The population will slowly dwindle until more people exist in a fully realized virtual reality then exist in the outside world.  You won't even have to choose one over the other as you will be able to move from one to the other. Leaving the real world will simply be a choice like owning a car or not. 

Eventually even giving birth in this newly world to new minds that never even know a physical body will be common if we bother with such things by then.  

It is the beginning of the end of our physical selves and that end starts for real tomorrow with the formal coming out of the Oculus Rift.  The gateway to that upload tomorrow goes through E3 next week.

How many people alive today will see that product announcement tomorrow for what it really is and recognize it for the fact it is as critical an inflection point in  human history as the discovery of agriculture or maybe even fire. It's a point of no return.  The event horizon of the future racing head long towards us.  It is the rabbit hole and like Alice in Wonderland, we have chosen as a society, knowingly or not, to see just how deep the rabbit runs.

Just a thought.",88,53

Anyways I have a theory that the technologies his companies are creating are all about living on Mars. So I'm predicting his next big idea will be one of the following. These don't sound like much, but I guess neither does a battery factory.  

- Indoor farming
- Low cost sustainable luxury housing

I would love to hear what you think about the future of AR and VR.

Virtual reality and augmented reality are two amazing technologies that will change the way the world runs. Do you think they will help society grow and flourish, or will they slowly turn us all into cyborgs who live alone.

I see virtual reality in two ways; It is great for gaming that will feel real to people, offering an amazingly immersive experience. And it will evolve in the near future, introducing our other senses to VR. Secondly, it will create a new culture of people happy to live their lives plugged into the matrix, sitting on their buts all day. 

Alternately.
I see augmented reality as assisting everyone to learn on the job, and have information on-tap. This change should help assist in the world having an **abundance of everything** we need (as a society to survive) because work processes will vastly improve. Secondly, it will create a new culture of people happy to live their lives plugged into the matrix, running around the world with holographic tags.",33,18

There should be a camera (A special camera that can film a place in 3 dimensions, like the ones in google walk) in his place so that in your VR you can see him, and the same camera in your place so that he can see you in hes VR.
This would be very similar to teletransporting... I'm just sayng... Is this possible?

But i think basic income has 2 parts. One part is taxing that money and diving it fairly and a political process to get there.extremely hard. 

But the other part - reducing the cost of living(but not the quality) to such an extent , that basic income becomes an easy process , because everything is so cheap. 

So i had an idea - maybe there should be some DARPA(which brought us the internet, GPS, self driving car among other things)  like organization , that has this second goal as it's target specifically , and invests in crazy risky research to get us there? 

Sure it won't solve all the problems, and getting to BI would be still hard - but still , it might help a lot , and it's not that expensive (DARPA's budget is ~$3 billion - peanuts).

It seems that hacks like these are happening increasingly often. Other recent examples that come to mind are Target and Blue Cross. This got me wondering if, in 20 years, we'll have given up on keeping our personal information private. 


My information is on a vast number of databases: government, foreign, health, academic and commercial. It's inevitable that some time in my life, one or several of those systems will be compromised and my SSN (as an example) will end up in the hands of an identity thief. The consequences for the victim can be devastating, but this could change in the future.


I can imagine a future society so accustomed to personal information theft that SSNs essentially become public knowledge. Hopefully by then, a thief wouldn't be able to get up to as much mischief with somebody else's personal information as he can now. A commercial sector overwhelmed by fraud would eventually adapt, perhaps going as far to require DNA samples to prove identities.

I think this system is feasible, maybe even desirable, but I think other alternatives should be considered. 

One problem UBI has is legislation. Legal systems vary all over the world and standards would be highly arbitrary when considering what the ""base"" income is. In addition to that, there is the problem of financial ignorance. Most people are not educated to budget, or they succumb to in-the-moment splurging. If they buy perishables or services, it is unlikely that they can simply get a refund. Money can also be stolen, hidden, counterfeited or otherwise manipulated at the expense of others. I'm not saying UBI wouldn't work, but it's far from perfect. 

I want to offer a slight alternative. The scenario I envision would provide people with a lifetime supply of everything they need to... well... be alive. There would be no possible way for a citizen to forfeit these necessities, even in long-term prisons. Things like internet, transportation, food and water, clothing, sanitary items and medical screenings would be free. 

Rather than monetary income, people's ""excess"" credits could be measured in energy. Whether that's BTU's, kWh's or anything else is of little consequence. Energy cannot be hidden (as easily) or manipulated through numbers. The measure of energy is universal and the value of energy is more stable than fiat (or resource-backed) currencies. Another measure of personal wealth could be computational power and storage. Whether you own your own server farm or occupy CPU's nowhere near you, your power in the cloud would reflect your social value and achievement and would offer you superior opportunities to influence the world. You would have more say in what our global society researches and develops. You would have the energy to bring those efforts into the real world.

I don't want to turn this into pages of text, so I'll stop here. I don't want to go into exhaustive detail, partly because I haven't thought this out to a tee, but also because I want discussion. What's wrong with this idea? Could I improve on it somehow? Is it just fundamentally worse than the UBI system?",7,3

1154,2015-6-13,2015,6,13,17,39oq0c,[Showerthought] if Artificial Intelligences should be shackled for protection. Should human intelligences be as well?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/39oq0c/showerthought_if_artificial_intelligences_should/,Junoncross,1434183140,"Ie. I half agree with hawking. Unshaved AI given unscrupulous instructions could wildly destroy the environment. Imagine an AI given instruction by a ceo to make money regardless of cost. Without something decent like Asimov's laws to constrain it, it may well start tapping the mantle or something and stop the dynamo of the earth. Or some other terrible early 2000s movie plot.  
  
My question is purely philosophical. Humans are capable of at least as much damage to the environment, and more so, to each other in the form of fraud and murder. Should Asimov's laws apply to humans as well?   
  
I realize this is very vague and abstract. Feel free to contribute whatever context you feel is necessary. Also, we can take as a given the wrongness inherent in applying essentially mind control on humans. Meta ethically, it is arguably more unethical to not prevent  a murder for some esoteric idea of individuality.  
  
Edit for clarity: I'm not advocating Asimov's laws so much as I am asking after ideas like them.  Further I'm not asking about the validity of laws as a societal concept. Murder is illegal, but people do it all the time. Doing horrendous things to the ecosystem by grand AI constructs would probably be illegal, but a more effective way to take care of it is to prevent those AI constructs from doing those things in the first place, rather than punishing them after they've already acted.
  
In the flavor of the example I just gave, is there any utility from shackling a human being who wishes to murder through technology to be compelled not to murder.  Not monitoring and prosecuting. Literally if you are intending to stab someone, your body is compelled to put down the knife or some other intervention. ",16,12

It was like that with GPS for me, suddenly one day I bought a phone and there I had maps and constant connection with satellite that knew where I am in the world, like in spy movies from recent past.

Then it was youtube, ability to watch and upload videos, to instantly find whichever music video you wanted... without it we wouldn't have independent artists gaining mainstream recognition overnight (whether deservedly or not), such as Macklemore or Harlem Shake... or reaction video to trailers or ''oh my god they killed Ned''

Sometimes a new service just comes along to completely surprise you. Yes, GPS existed before smartphones, touchscreens before iPhones and online video before youtube, in the same way photo and video storage in the cloud existed before Google Photos and I used it, but...

... unlimited storage of high resolution (even if not super-high res) pictures and HD videos for your personal use (and Google's, but anyway). Maybe this is not a service for photo professionals , but this is where your phone videos and pictures can go and live, and train google's image recognition software. And the image recognition itself is wonderful, and the ''gifts'' that the ''AI'' puts together are wonderful (for the most part)

Of course google will now have massive amounts of picture data, but I am not afraid of that, I think if my pics (occasionally blurry) can help the algorithms to improve image recognition capability and one day help driverless cars to navigate around, it's a small price to pay for giving my phone pictures to them.

I can imagine that in future tons of dash cam HD video could be thrown in there, when 5G is ubiquitous and cheap and driverless cars would have real time knowledge of everything that happens on any road in the world, and augmented reality glasses would have real time knowledge of sales/offers/fun events etc. happening around that we could take advantage of.

Motorbikes are the number one form of transportation in many Asian countries with about 60% of all motorbikes in the world due to their affordability and its one thing for people to switch over from driving a car to a self driving car but its another thing all together for millions of people to switch from motorbikes to self driving cars, does this mean Asian countries will be slower to adopt the new technology or is it possible to also have autonomous motorbikes?",18,12

For most, there was relatively little need for money compared to living in modern culture.  Human labor was necessary to produce goods and services so owning people was considered wealth in the days of slavery.  Money was primarily used by the wealthy people to exchange the goods slaves and servants produced.  

Those that owned slaves and servants provided them with food, clothing, and shelter.  Once machines made human plow agriculture obsolete, it became clearer to many that slavery was an immoral way for one human to control the life of another.

Today, relatively few people produce what they consume.  Money is required to obtain the necessities in life.  The traditional way of obtaining money in the modern culture is with a job or by borrowing based on future labor.  

As industries become automated, the need for people to labor is becoming obsolete and  jobs are going away.  If people don't have jobs, or access to jobs, it's difficult for them to access money in the present narrative.  Without money people can't survive or live with dignity and arguably their life is worse than that of the slaves 150 years ago.  

Unless universal basic income, or some equivalent, is introduced into a culture that is rapidly automating, the future for much of humanity could be something far worse than slavery was 150 years ago.

As industries automate, it will become much clearer to society that the output of automation is liberty and freedom which rightfully belongs to all of the people.

UBI is one way to achieve the above, there are others.  But to block people from getting the necessities in life by cutting off access to money is equivalent to enslaving people to a life of misery without liberty or the opportunity to pursue happiness in an economy that is automating.",59,35

However, as dependency on technology rises, so does the ability to control beliefs by controlling content people are exposed to.  And if beliefs are controlled, so are the realities of people's perceptions and realities.

Since the financial bailout in 2008, I have been shocked that judges allowed bankers to not mark their assets to market yet still rule that the loans made by those same banks were valid and enforceable.

It is clear that judges and politicians are conflicted in dealing with issues that may disrupt the status quo because many are millionaires and all make substantially above average incomes.  As such, it is now impossible for the average person to get fair representation or justice in the current environment.  This is especially egregious as most are struggling just to get by without the time, knowledge or training to voice a satisfactory alternative.

Could you imagine what it was like for an African American slave in the South when essentially all of the politicians and judges were slave owners, or close friends and beneficiaries of slave owners?

Today, representation and justice is logically not too different for those who don't have much in the way of financial assets or incomes.

If we are to evolve to an efficient, productive, and automated economy that benefits all of society, we can't do it if the rules and rules makers are self interested in perpetuating a money system that impedes progress for the benefit of a few.

Now the question is how can people have a voice when those who are supposed to represent them and protect them are too conflicted to objectively do their jobs?  Could AI be a potential objective solution to optimize progress to a future automated economy?",19,33

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that you mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is AI possible? It happened once before. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of June 15th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a AA battery. 
If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.",36,10

How would Universal Basic Income work then? For people who decide to not work and decide to not pay taxes they would be less money being generated in the economy and the people who do work would have to pay higher taxes to provide Basic Income for others and make up for tax money lost by those who don't work.

By moving beyond traditional systems relying on obsolete assumptions, civilization can evolve into something better than ever seen before.

At this point the only thing stopping progress is selfish and ignorant human beliefs.  If humans can accept that machines are smarter than they are, maybe people can collaborate with each other to rely on machines/AI to optimize new economic, financial, political, and legal systems for everyone on this planet.

This was obviously due largely to horses becoming less useful and more of a luxury over time.  This made me wonder about the future ""human capital.""

Historically, nations, governments, tribes, and popular opinion tend to promote child rearing for the obvious benefit of human capital.  However, when machines and AI replace workers and soldiers, there's no longer a need for acquiring the largest population possible.  There's no incentive for a nation to prop up a large population of humans when they provide no work or military power.  There's no economic benefit.  In fact, they require a huge amount of resources for intangible benefits that provide little benefit to governments or people in power.

Let's assume basic income becomes a reality instead of much harsher alternatives.  The larger the population, the greater the economic toll.  You can argue that machines and AI will provide the labor so who cares but you would be ignoring the resource cost and the inherent problems associated with overcrowding and limited land.

I'm not suggesting that people will want to be alone.  However, I do think we'll see the narrative change to something similar to China's one child policy.  It can sound a bit crazy but ultimately it boils down to: what incentive do societies and, perhaps more importantly, governments and the powerful have for large populations when human capital is replaced?

There is a reason behind the fact that all ""traditional"" car brands dont have such exaggerating amounts of technology in their cars - a steady and reliable supply chain. I once talked to a guy who plans curcuit boards for a german car company. He told me there is a ""7 year rule"" for a supply chain in the industry. You need a reliable source for the SAME piece of technology for 7 years (while production) and another 7 years for maintenance in case something breaks down. For example, if the CD-Player in your 2008 Honda Accord breaks, the Dealer can exchange the single, broken part and you are good to go. If the Touchscreen in your 2012 Tesla decides to break in 2018 - Well fuck. The supply chain for the Screen itself doesn't exist anymore, you'll need a whole new unit. At around 10 times the price of the screen itself. And its the same thing with bits and pieces all over the car. Especially electronic parts advance fast and there is a high chance that the one small switch you need for the window opener just wont exist anymore. 
So please, bear this in mind, when thinking about buying a Tesla. After a couple of years, maintaining and servicing the car is very likely going to cost a fortune.

P.S: I do  work for a major german car brand, but I'd trade my own car for a Tesla anyday. I just think its unfair to call the traditional manufaturers ""old fashioned/stubborn/blabla"" when there is a good reason behind their behavior.",25,0

Now to map the brain of say a dog, which has the same mental capacity of a two year old (or so), and put its conciousness inside of a robotic body, couldn't that be more close than we think? if exponential growth is correct, even though we mapped the brain of a worm a year ago, it should take even less time to map the brain of a domesticated animal. Not only that, but we're close to perfecting the motor skills of robots, such as with Boston Dynamics Cheetah or dog robot. I watched alot of jimmy neutron when I was a kid, and I always thought it would be pretty cool to have a robotic dog. You could emulate all of it's features, such as companionship or barking, you wouldn't have to walk it or clean up after it.

Here's the description on their page:

&gt;Today's robots are nothing short of astonishing. Those coming in the not-too-distant future are simply revolutionaryand they are becoming eerily like us.

&gt;What does it take to make a humanoid robota robot that can do anything we can do without the benefit of a human brain? How close are scientists to replicating some of the particularly challenging human characteristics? (Think fingers and toes.)

&gt;Why are we even attempting to create humanoids in the first place? ROBOTS 3D answers these questions and more as it showcases the latest developmentsthe successes and failuresof robotics around the world. ROBOTS 3D is a fascinating and fun look at what makes us human, how far machines can really go to look and act like us, and how humanoids are already changing our world.

&gt;ROBOTS 3D is a sneak peek into the future at what might be possible as scientists use innovative engineering and design to make cyber characters less ""humanoid"" and more just plain human. Robot ""actor"" RoboThespian will introduce you to CHIMP, ATLAS, PR-2, Herb the Butler, ICUB, and others as he takes you on an amazing tour of what's going on in robotics labs around the world.

We've talked about the impact of self-driving cars on insurance companies and insurance rates, but here's one item that occurs to me: has anybody run studies of the impact of self-driving cars on revenue for city and state governments?

I don't know if there are nationwide figures, but I just did a casual look for Los Angeles and California, and holy cats.  In a recent fiscal year, Los Angeles brought in [http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/los-angeles-parking-ticket-revenue-meters-247002501.html]($45 million in parking tickets alone).   Not sure what speeding ticket revenue is, but in the last eight years the state of California has run up around [http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-traffic-ticket-assessments-20150501-story.html](ten billion dollars) just in tickets that *haven't been paid.*  Presumably most people pay their tickets, meaning that California takes in more (probably well more) than a billion dollars a year on traffic tickets alone.  California's 2014-2015 budget was for $254 billion dollars, about $98 billion of which was from federal funds. 

I'm really curious if the states have plans looking at economic impact of self-driving cars.  They should.  Self-driving cars are going to impact government revenue in a substantial way, and if the states don't start getting ready now their budgets are going to do some interesting things they're not expecting.

(And I just realized: we're going to need way fewer body shops.)",3,4

Especially I like to spread all this ideas that we are getting replaced by technology or that world does not need money and it is just a certain time that it will take to get rid of it (perhaps not during our life but who knows).

So as you see, those topics are quite futuristic and I like to talk about ultimate solutions not a single problem ones. It seems, more people think how to reduce bulb energy comsumption rather than how to decrease energy price in the very first place.  

I have this feeling everytime I say something about new invention/idea  that is not going to happen within very next month/year but would totally revolutionize todays world, everyone looks at me like I am just a jerk/idiot talking about some bullshit that is not going to happen at all or is simply not worth thinking of or is just probably mine version of 'imagined world'. That things make me a little bit sad as I don't want to be perceived this way, especially at work. 

 As much as I want to be a part of modern thinking - that everything is possible it but we haven't find a way to do it yet, I find people tend to not like such people and prefer those that speaks about today's problems or politics. Also they like to hear about science inventions that are already here and just needs to be tested for few years or going to be commercialized soon..  What's the difference between then ? People do not want to use imagination but are interested in facts? Why is that? because facts are things that they could easily forward to their colleagues (just like gossips are created) ? 

What do you think, is it socially correct to spread news and futuristic ideas over the real world friends or colleagues at work? Or we should avoid expressing ourselves this way as it is negative and people tend to not like to listen to such people ?

Gimme some advise or your opinion what is this all about. 

PS. When will we finally get rid of having a need of society acceptance ? Is this something that makes us better people or something that makes us more depressed?  People tends to spam facebook with some shit in order to satisfy this need and I am only expressing myself... #firstworldproblems.

On most worlds, available energy depends on solar output and planetary conversion into the low-hanging fruit we enjoy on Earth today as fossil fuels.

Materials scientists, engineers, life scientists and dreamers across humanity are rapidly dismissing these inefficient sources and going directly to photovoltaics, atomic, and planetary conversion through winds, tides and geothermal. Even biological engineering is opening up entirely new pathways that may one day transform our planetary chlorophyll production into a limitless, on-demand power plant. 

Regardless who wins the engineering race to ubiquitous and (practically) free energy, the end result will be the same... World energy independence for all people of all socio-economic classes and demographics.  

When you take that inevitability and attach it to any number of simultaneous advances in information, environmental, health and manufacturing technologies - you get rapid explosions of significant quality-of-life improvements for all of humanity.  Freedom from existential discomfort, significant reductions in resource-based conflict, plummeting mortality rates for the poorest of the poor.  All taken for granted by the average ""developed"" nation, but a dream for most of people.  

With energy so readily available- meeting basic human needs such as food, shelter, education, communication, transportation and safety becomes the default norm.  Previous human energy output in pursuit of these basic needs becomes redirected to solve other puzzles.  Mental/spiritual health, physical wellness, personal life satisfaction, entertainment, the pursuit of higher knowledge, artistic endeavor, environmental stewardship, positive societal change... 

All of these human endeavors not tied to meeting basic survival needs lead to increased personal productivity and contentment- the type of productivity which logically carries over to those less fortunate.  The sick, the feeble, the helpless, the hopeless, the old, the young and even the temporarily ignorant or incompetent.  

Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness can finally become the de-facto reality for all of humanity.  

I have very real concerns for our world economy when we no longer pay The Man"" for energy.  Portable, automated, efficient and decentralized resource management, manufacturing methods, telepresence, labor pool, time management tools, health/nutrition monitoring, personalized medicine, replacement organs, intra/intercellular repair...  All from the comfort of your own home ANYWHERE on the planet without regard to what will power it all...  

The bottom line?  Free energy demonetizes, decentralizes and democratizes all fundamental quality-of-life standards for everyone.  

Where is the fanfare?  Where is the collective human effort into supporting/encouraging this imminent inevitability?  What good is money when you can create life's necessities on a whim? Who is preparing the world's puppeteers to release their hold on our livelihoods? What rash decisions will be made in an attempt to monetize the Sun? 

No worries - I'll continue blowing the trumpet until I'm perpetually blue in the face.

It's only air, after all...",12,13

If you have not, the open-source project is detailed here: hyperloop.com.

I have a vision to create a community/forum web tool to enable engineering teams across the country to collaborate on projects and discuss ideas specifically for the hyperloop competition.

I believe this belongs in futurology because the future of technological innovation will become open/crowd sourced, and this is the first time in history that the crowd will develop a project of this scale. Also, I am sure that it will not be the last, and tools like this are necessary if crowd scale innovation is to be managed effectively again in the future.  If you believe in this vision and you are capable of helping me make this project a reality, please reach out to me.  I am looking for one passionate web developer.

Here is a home page that I quickly put together: http://odhmoyer.wix.com/hyperloopx
It will require a rebuild because I made it on Wix though.

The finished website will include a twitter newsfeed, a multiperson/team registration form, a tree forum, and a github repository interface.

This past year has been really unnerving.

Specifically, I think we're witnessing the explosion of biotech advances as a result of CRISPR (CAS9) enabled genomic editing, in addition to big data and deep learning algorithms. It seems blatantly obvious that we stand at the edge of the cliff, and the cliff has already started giving way. Very soon we'll be free falling into major discoveries and advances. The discoveries have already started, what with immunotherapy curing a formerly incurable form of brain cancer.

I base this thought on the rapid acceleration of scientists ability to sequence the human genome, and the plunging costs. It took how many years to sequence the first human genome? And now, because of parallel processing / increased computational power, they can sequence a human genome in days, with predictions that they'll be able to sequence in minutes soon. And they're amassing a HUGE database of hundreds of thousands of genomes, with a goal of millions in the next year or 2.

Here's an article just released about the ""tsunami"" of investment happening in venture capital for genomic editing startups. https://medium.com/backchannel/editing-the-software-of-life-for-fame-and-fortune-adda86dcc2

It'll be here much sooner than we think. In fact, I think I see the leading edge of the tsunami off in the distance now. Wondering if my current real estate investments will be worth anything after it hits us...",16,31

My mind does this already when I listen to music. And I love making mashups and music videos, so naturally VR is the next step.

(Hard AI that is)

So, you, a mere human (*1), can think approximately only one conscious thought at once. A powerful AI's mind strength metric then could be essentially measured by it being able to think of as equal to a certain number of people at once. 

And thereby, you could measure its capabilities that way too. You would think of 1000 people as easily capable of out-smarting an AI of '100P', and losing a competition against an AI of 10,000P.

And so then, as the AI's start to fight one another, this too would be their metric of capability, so the AI that ends up dominating the planet will be the one that exceeds at least 7.125 billion P.

Although a few nuclear bombs would reduce our capabilities quite significantly, but we could postulate that such weaponry might be equally effective against the AI super structure. I suppose time will allow us to calibrate the clock more accurately. 

We will be able to track progress towards our species death quite specifically by this simple metric. A pretty good way to calibrate a doomsday clock right?

Perhaps a good website might be a clock comparing the currently most powerful AI, against the theoretical intelligence of all humans alive. And we could all watch it count down.

Although it is just a TV drama it got me thinking. For those of you that haven't seen it, 8 people from around the planet find themselves connected on another level. They can feel each others emotions, experience each others experiences, and learn from each others skills. As far fetched as this show sounds I think it may be an interesting depiction of the future. The thing that i believe sets humans apart from other animals is not necessarily or intelligence (there are many other fairly intelligent animals such as octopi or dolphins) but our innate ability to share our intelligence with one another to turn our individual intelligence into a sort of communal intelligence. The evolution of the internet has allowed us to be human at a much more accelerated level. As the internet continue to mature I believe people will start to neglect it's existence and take it on as a part of our own being. People will begin to connect to each other in new ways to share absolutely everything. Not just ideas and content , but emotions and experiences will be shared with others instantly on the other side of the world. My hope is that if this does come about, it will be a positive development. What do you guys think of this idea?",17,19

I've seen lots of discussion on how VR and AR are going to influence gaming and game dev, but not the automation of content creation and design. 
 ""No Man's Sky"" is a sci-fi game that's been in dev for over a year and we were given an update at E3 gaming conference this year.  Traditionally, video game worlds are created by human designers, limiting the scope and scale of possible games.  No Man's Sky is an incredible leap forward in that it algorithmically generates worlds, aliens, etc. and promises support for 18 quintillion worlds (with consistency for multiple people visiting same world).  And its creator, Hello Games apparently only has 12 employees.

Procedurally-generated games have been around for a while, but I'm interested in how improvements in AI will take this to the next level.  Could we see fully AI-generated plots soon? Imagine a game like Mass Effect, with not only AI-generated worlds but interesting plotlines, missions, and good vs evil desicion trees generated for each world.  AFAIK, No Man's Sky isn't on this level, but it's still impressive.  The synergy of AI content creation and VR could be a ""singularity"" in the world of gaming, with each player able to create entire immersive universes.

I hope to hear your thoughts and ideas of where this tech will (or won't) go.",14,21

Many futurists still see the future in terms of capitalism, but this is an incorrect approach. The incredible technology that is coming in the future will cause the monetary system to become obsolete, and poverty, hunger, and pollution will cease to exist. Space exploration and colonization will rapidly occur, super intelligent machines and AI will guide humanity into maintaining the Earth. Planets will be quickly terraformed for human habitats. Faster than light travel will become a reality. There will be no such thing as childhood anymore, children's neurons will be organized so that each child knows all there is to know about physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, geology, etc. Pain and sadness will fade as those nerve signals are blocked by implants in the skin. Humanity will soar into immortality as the human body becomes fully understood. Science will be the language that everyone speaks in, so as nothing is left to interpretation. We will move around the galaxy instantaneously, studying other planets and life forms. Time will become meaningless. Everywhere in the universe can be reached instantly. Earth will be kept as a museum for what humanity used to be. Any and every kind of technology will exist. All resources will be virtually unlimited. Trillions of humans will exist throughout the galaxy and other galaxies. Such ideas as work, money, commerce, economics, politics, and war will only exist in long past history. Knowledge of the universe will be complete. At this point, if we don't kill ourselves by 2100, our far-future sons and daughters will have become god.

It is already clear the AI will soon be more intelligent and capable than the world's elite.  There is little doubt the elite are well aware of this fact as they have access to the most informed advisors. 

Going forward, we should expect very convulsive debates around the world on who should control AI because soon it will be more powerful than most currently believe.  Understanding the issues in this debate will be key to recognizing where we are headed into tbe future.


Hint:  If everyone owns AI, everyone will be entitled to a dividend from its output.

It will take almost the whole day cruising at 120 on the highway most of the way, but it's alright. The mid-sized auto you rented has plenty of space and a nice table in the middle so you can play poker. Old fashioned paper cards still feel good in your hands, and that old deck with the colors nearly rubbing off is still holding up strong, even getting better with age.

Good idea to upgrade for the one with the mini fridge to keep the drinks cold for the whole ride. Cracking open a beer, you sit back and wonder how people used to travel in inconvenient train, or even worse, drive themselves slowly through traffic! Constantly having to focus on the road for such a long time seems like a nightmare.

Since you don't want to kill the pace of the trip, and make it down for mardi gras, dinner is going to be pizza on the road. Using the auto's console in the table you place your order, and it looks like about half hour for delivery. Not too bad.

You wish you could 3D-print some doritos or something but hey, they'll probably come out with a portable version soon enough. For now you just gotta deal with choosing your snacks ahead of time.

After a while you get a ping that the pizza has arrived. Rolling down the window, you can see right into the mobile pizza parlour driving alongside you, through the airtight seal it's created over your window. This one uses all fresh ingredients which is why it took a bit longer than usual, and you can see them being prepared in the back, layers of the pizza falling quickly into place, like a little robotic show. It's part of the charm. But it's all over in a few seconds when our pizza slides out of the oven, into a box, and into your open hands and you're instructed to close the window.

Hot &amp; fresh, so nice to get a Brooklyn style pizza, made ""the old way"" just moments out of the oven. And it's dinnertime on the road as you make the final stretch through Louisiana.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869

It's by two researchers at Google, who have trained various neural networks to generate conversational responses.  The results aren't perfect, but they show a lot of promise.  Here is one example:

&gt; Human: who is skywalker ?

&gt; Machine: he is a hero .

&gt; Human: who is bill clinton ?

&gt; Machine: he s a billionaire .

&gt; Human: is sky blue or black ?

&gt; Machine: blue .

&gt; Human: does a cat have a tail ?

&gt; Machine: yes .

&gt; Human: does a cat have a wing ?

&gt; Machine: no

&gt; Human: can a cat fly ?

&gt; Machine: no .

&gt; Human: how many legs does a cat have ?

&gt; Machine: four , i think .

&gt; Human: how many legs does a spider have ?

&gt; Machine: three , i think .

&gt; Human: how many legs does a centipede have ?

&gt; Machine: eight .

&gt; Human: what is the color of the sky ?

&gt; Machine: blue .

&gt; Human: what is the color of water ?

&gt; Machine: water .

&gt; Human: what is the color of blood ?

&gt; Machine: it is the same as a black eye .

&gt; Human: what is the usual color of a leaf ?

&gt; Machine: it is a green one .

&gt; Human: what is the color of a yellow car ?

&gt; Machine: yellow .

&gt; Human: how much is two plus two ?

&gt; Machine: four .

&gt; Human: how much is ten minus two ?

&gt; Machine: seventy - two .

Perhaps examples like this are the source of some of Geoff Hinton's recent optimism about neural nets described in this article:

http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/21/google-a-step-closer-to-developing-machines-with-human-like-intelligence

From the above arxives paper:

&gt; We find it encouraging that the model can remember facts, understand contexts, perform common sense reasoning without the complexity in traditional pipelines. What surprises us is that the model does so without any explicit knowledge representation component except for the parameters in the word vectors.


&gt; Perhaps most practically significant is the fact that the model can generalize to new questions. In other words, it does not simply look up for an answer by matching the question with the existing database. In fact, most of the questions presented above, except for the first conversation, do not appear in the training set.


Now just imagine where this will be in a couple years when such systems are trained with a lot more data (and using better training methodologies), using a lot larger and more complex models.  And imagine giving them access to computer vision, speech recognition and synthesis modules, as well as agent capabilities (to get things done for you, not just talk to you)...  ",7,49

You guys are a bunch of smart people, so I'm interested in your responses. Here's the premise:

&gt; You have 2 hours to prepare before you are relocated in time two years ago. You don't know why or how it happens, or how you knew it was coming, but you did. Here are the rules:

* You stay inside your own body -- it's as if time reversed back two years and then started again.
* You begin where you were two years ago, with everything and everyone that should be.
* You retain all knowledge of the future two years, and we're assuming everything happens like it always was meant to.
* You cannot bring anything back with you. It's as if you've suddenly attained two years worth of experience that never actually happened.
* Your possible actions must be plausible and logical. No gunning it out with the FIB.

You know what will happen, relatively, and who will do what. I'm trying to think big here with the scope of this. What would you do?

Remember, you had two hours to look up or do something, though you can't take any physical objects back with you. What could you accomplish in two years if you had fore knowledge?

----

I'll go first:

1. In the 2 hour time frame I'd look up lottery results and dates for the first few weeks after going back. Research startups that hit it really well off in the last couple years, and technologies that burst open.
2. 'Win' some lotteries.
3. Take that money (as I can, I know it's not all instant) and invest it in those businesses, technologies, and whatever I fancied at the time.


But, see, I know there are smarter people with better ideas that might make more than just themselves improved. What would you do?",40,34

One aspect that never seems to come up in these discussions is how it would impact our current trends of urbanization.

to preface my current impression of where things are heading in present system:

Personal anecdote (impression I got from my circle of acquaintances with whom I happened to discuss what they want out of life and what they are getting, from my life in Canada, GTA):

Young adults (teens to 30s) - they want to go where they believe they can achieve their ambitions in personal and professional lives. That usually means they are focusing on universities and city centers as where they want to move to because those are the places with large concentrations of opportunities, social entertainment and other young people.

Once people get married this seems to generally change - highly competitive people want to stick to cities, but majority seem to be dreaming of a less stressful life. I am in my early 30s myself, so this may be confirmation bias talking, but I constantly hear other married people saying stuff like ""we drove through this amazing little town... would be great place to live in... if we didn't have to worry about finding a job"".

The gist I am getting is that everyone is aiming their lives at being close to urban centers but for family pairs it's mostly out of necessity - because that's where the jobs are. A lot of middle-income people 'settling' for life in the suburbs as the best they can afford while still being reasonably sure of being able to afford anything at all in the future.

Summary of various media/news stories that I formed: 

in many developed countries small towns are dying or at least not growing, while the large cities are getting hidiously expensive and competitive as far as housing, with people paying more and more for locations with ever increasing commutes to work. Companies are motivated to locate themselves where they have access to bigger choice of workforce (even if they are the type that don't need 'local' customers), and people generally want to stick where they think the jobs are.

Overall:

Looking at population concentrations of many developed countries, there are large swatches of land that is basically not being utilized under the catch 22 situation - there is nothing there because no one lives there, no one lives there because there is nothing there. However, from what I hear people saying, key point is that for many ""nothing and nobody there"" is bad ONLY because that means economical suicide to try living there. Privacy and plenty of personal space is generally considered very positive, and internet now largely takes care of the remaining socializing needs of individuals who already formed a family.

Personally, I would expect that if a big social safety net like UBI was to be implemented in countries like USA, Canada, Japan, there would be many people looking to start moving to the more 'scenic' locales, greatly decentralizing population.

Not being an economist, I am not sure if it would be net positive or negative - certainly less efficient as far as use of resources, but seems like decentralization would also greatly increase number of potential jobs.

There's the [Paperclip](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html) thought experiment, which I don't find particularly threatening because a team smart enough to develop AGI would hopefully be smart enough to consider these dangers and prevent them. But it does illustrate the extent to which ASI is going to progress in terms of intelligence and ability, and the question remains what purpose can we program a computer to fulfill that won't turn out horribly wrong for us once it's been extrapolated to near-infinite intelligence?

As I've seen others argue, we could program ASI to 'maximize human happiness,' but the result of this scenario could be a never ending dopamine drip straight to the brain, which might be pleasing but sort of removes our humanity. We could program it to 'maximize human safety' or to 'make humans immortal' but again this could mean we end up in Matrix-esque pods strapped to tubes keeping us alive forever, and that doesn't sound very appealing either.

So the real question, to me the most important question, is what the fuck do we program this thing to do? We're essentially creating a genie in a bottle, and typically this doesn't go over so well because wishes always come at some price. 

I pose this question to you all. Is there a fool-proof purpose we could give ASI?

Currently, my thinking is that the best thing we could program a super intelligent being to do is to tell a good story. It's the only thing I've thought of that, when extrapolated, doesn't really look so bad. A paperclip maximizer will overrun the universe with paperclips, a human happiness generator will just create a never ending orgasm, but a super intelligent being designed to tell/create satisfying stories would only create better, more satisfying stories. Assume now that we've created a machine that has the entire catalogue of human narratives, has the ability to modify the physical universe, has the ability to analyze our personalities, and then with this information creates essentially a Pandora of experiences, designed to activate within the experiencer what has been identified as their particular 'satisfied feeling', and then maybe incorporates other people with similar tastes into the same experience. This isn't terribly original or far-fetched thinking, it's basically what we're already doing with Netflix or online video games. But it's the only thing I've thought of so far that I could ask of a super intelligent computer and feel fairly confident about.",6,0

I'm 21, married, and starting college for the first time in my life. You guys don't need the personal backstory, so here's some hard numbers. 

I'm married, so I get decent financial aid. I only have to pay ~500 bucks a quarter at the local community college.

I work 4-5 days a week at a restaurant, last year I made ~$22000 dollars and my wife, who works at starbucks, made ~$11,000.

We have 2 payed off P.O.S. cars which badly need some work done, but we are trying to put off. Insurance is 140/month.

Cell phones 110/month, internet/netflix/random bills are total around another 100/month.

Health insurance is 85/paycheck for my wife through her work.

We have about 1000 dollars set aside, and we net about 1-200 a month extra for saving.

Our rent is only 600/month which in our area is great, unheard of actually.

We only have about 500$ in outstanding debt, for a couch we got cause our old one was disgusting garage sale nastiness lol.

SO here is a summary, roughly 1100 a month in bills, give or take. The problem is, I'm going to be a computer science major, so I need a half decent laptop. I also need the extra money for transportation to and from college (roughly half hour 1 way) and I might have to start working a bit less due to my course load. It would be a HUGE weight off of my shoulders to grab like 2,000 in subsidized student loans which get no interest and pay them off with my tax return. I could pay for tuition, while being able to afford a laptop and take a day off work here or there without worrying about starving. Is this ridiculous to assume it'll take stress away? 2 years from now I'll be going to a non-community college university with higher cost of living and tuition. I'll NEED student loans there. But here, I don't NEED them, but they'd be nice to have. Convince me it's not worth it, or tell me it's perfectly fine. I'd just like some input.

**TL;Dr**-- I have ~$1,000 dollars in bills each month, my wife and I make 2750 a month pre-tax, I need ~$500 per quarter in tuition and i need a laptop for school.

Listen to the Melomics video posted in Futurology.  Music created by AI.  AI is also capable of writing news articles and business briefs.  The images created by figure recognition AI are themselves works of art.

Biological machines that took billions of years to arise and that these human machines are giving rise to the next generation of machines.  More sophisticated and efficient.  Humans are becoming obsolete.

Accepting the above premise only leads us to the inevitable conclusion; free will is an illusion.

Curiosity got me. Started looking for information put in a recent article about Peter Thiel's comment about Stanford and anti age gene therapy.  The reddit link and the article didn't give any specifics so I started looking. Couldn't find it.

But Maria-Grazia Roncarolo's name kept popping up.  Turns out, she's already developed several gene therapies, a couple of them in trial, and one awaiting approval from the European Medical Agency (Europe's equivalent of the FDA). If approved, this will be the world's first authorized and recognized gene therapy for a particular childhood immunodeficiency called SCID (bubble boy disease). 

Reading through several articles currently available online, it looks like Stanford is on the cusp of announcing some major and revolutionary successful gene therapy treatments. The collection of articles have a strange subdued exuberance to them.

https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2015/04/maria-grazia-roncarolo-on-advances-in-gene-therapy.html

I'm convinced we're going to be profoundly surprised by what we're capable of achieving via gene therapy in the next year or 2.

No more of this ""5-10 years away"".

I have a question for my fellow futurologists. I am a firm believer that open access to matter compilation technology will form the basis for a cultural upheaval for the human race. I come from an archaeology background and to date all social behaviours have centred around the procurement and storage of resources. Once we can print a shirt, or an item of food, or a medication - that entire system changes.

So my question is - do you believe matter compilation technology is a likely outcome for the 2015 we find ourselves in? And if so, when do you foresee the uptake of the technology occurring?

Plain color flairs are available to all /r/Futurology community members.

Other, slightly fancier flairs can be given out by the mods:

* From now on, users whose identities have been verified with the moderators (generally for AMA purposes) will now have a flair [that looks like this](http://puu.sh/iBDbF.png).
* [Best of 2014](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2qpnaf/best_of_2014_winners/) winners have been given a unique ""prize"" flair. This flair will also be up for grabs in any future contests.

Most existing user flairs have been updated to one of the new flairs already.

Ofcourse we would have to reshape quite a few more things on the human body if one was to survive on mars, we could call it guided evolution. It makes sense from a darwinistic point of view that once we have the tools we would steer our evolution and done responsibly our kin could thrive in the whole universe one day.

Not that closely resembles a human, but is 100% human. I believe this would take billions of years and no one would be able to do it, but I know it is possible.

People are very complex. Imagine how in a video/movie how every element from coloring to editing to sound design are all very intricate, and large processes of their own, and if done perfectly, and I mean perfectly, could take years or a year to do for even a 2 minute video. Now take that and imagine it times 1 trillion, 1 quadrillion. That's what evolution has been doing to humans from the time we were single celled organisms until now, slowly making us very complex.

In the far future, what if we were able to make, instead of robots, simple organisms to do things like pass the butter (see this Rick and Morty clip: https://youtube.com/watch?v=3ht-ZyJOV2k). So for instance we would have a squirrel that's sole purpose was to pass the butter.

The debate would inevitably arise of if this was ethical, and people would of course agree no, but what if we could also decide per organism what would make it happy, and ""program"" (for lack of a better term) it to enjoy what we want it to do, so for instance the squirrel would enjoy passing the butter. Then it would literally find life fulfillment in passing the butter.

And not only that, but we would inevitably create new organisms instead of design ancient ones (in reference to the squirrel, because seeing as this is the far future, by then a squirrel would be ancient), so instead of a squirrel passing the butter it would be a little creature with one hand that was only physically designed for that task.

And kids would be creating crazy beings and inevitably their own toys and playmates. They would be able to create a creature that's sole purpose was to play with them, and give it a natural lifespan of 3 years so that when they outgrew it, the creature would die naturally and happy because it would have fulfilled it's life goals until the end.

This means that the debate over ethics is no longer applicable, because if every organism is happy to do what we ask them to, and beyond that it not only makes them happy, but also fulfilled, then they would be at peace, as would much of the world.

And if we could figure out ways to harness this control of purpose to solve things like depression in humans, it would be revolutionary. However, if we did it to humans it could get dangerous and used as a weapon, also making it unethical due to the fact we'd be enslaving/bending other humans to our wills.

But then what's the difference between us and the creatures we create?

But if it's true happiness at the same level as evolution would do it, then is it truly unethical, and is the only difference between these creatures and humans as a (by then) more advanced species time and complexity?

So many questions. What do y'all think? Please respond or elaborate!",1,0

Also, this is probably not a popular position on this sub, but I am hoping for a discussion on the issue. On the inside, I'm hoping there's something that can convince me space exploration is something we should be doing, other then for just the sake of exploring because we're exploring.
I realize Mars is an ideal stepping stone to bigger stuff, but what is a solid argument for being an interplanetary species. My understanding is that Mars itself doesn't have much to offer in resources, nor does anything close by. Maybe deuterium? Traveling to other semi-habitable places doesn't seem close to practical in the near future. It seems to me that space is too big to get much outside the solar system, and there isn't a lot of reward to reap within it.
I guess the one solid reason I can think of is that it would be nice to have a backup civilization in case something devastated Earth.

It is something I have never seen before and I think it's awesome but also terrifying. How extensive are drone policy's going to get at large outdoor events? Will I have to sign away my rights to be filmed by drones at every gathering I go to? Wavers in case of sociopaths with bomb drones? Are there going to be places you go where drones monitor all of the crowd with facial recognition *all of the time.* And is that good or bad?

Maybe they will be well managed and benevolent? Hopefully only a few ""drone policies"" will ever be written before we all accept them as helpful little robotic servants without fear. I think most likely some bad accidents or incidents will tarnish their reputation for a while. Hopefully not too bad or too long.

You know how despondent lifesigns will have distinctive heartrates and other vitals that only come off of suicidal people, right? They may breathe in a different pattern and rate, and etc.
If rooftop sensors detect that, it could notify the building's authorities and other relevant authorities outside the building. Then authorities get to watch that suicidal maniac through surveillance video feeds. There may even be intercoms to help talk the maniac down from killing him/herself.

Moreover, if the maniac decides to jump, then somewhere along the building's walls, net deployment guns would shoot nets to ensnare the jumper and arrest the fall. The jumper would get winched back up to the roof, or a window, where a security guard would take away the jumper to see some psychiatrists.

---

^(DYK that often after a fall, the jumper realizes that everything they thought was unfixable, can get fixed after all? The testimonies of the jump survivors from the Golden Gate Bridge indicate that they change their minds about jumping the moment after they jump. I have every confidence that this would be no different for someone who jumps off of a tall building.)

---

Giving me credit is optional if you decide to put this idea into fruition. (I would build it myself, but I don't have the resources to do so. I only have the resources to put the conception online.) Compensation is optional, too. I'm into making this concept to see more lives saved, not for the money.

^(By the way, what other subreddits should I submit this concept to? It would help for them to have a good amount of subscribers.)",17,0

Ive been involved in fighting aging at the Science for Life Extension Foundation since 2008 and our efforts have been focused on raising funding for longevity and regenerative medicine research from both government and private sources.

I am the co-author of the [Roadmap to Immortality](https://mariakonovalenko.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/roadmap-to-immortality-longevity-genetic-engineering/), [Roadmap of Regenerative Medicine](https://mariakonovalenko.wordpress.com/2010/06/03/regenerative-medicine-roadmap-11/) and Longevity Cookbook.

Ask me anything about transhumanism, biology of aging and political activity in favor of life extension.

I will start with the End Game and move toward the present. 
So the End Game is that every person will finally have freedom from time. What I mean by ""freedom from time"" will be explained.

  Let start by thinking about the possibilites of living and earning  income without actually working. Currently the average person whether they are salary or hourly, earn income by trading time for money. Literally, this means that a person must trade time of their limited lifetime for money. And in order to live comfortably we need money. In essence I am saying we are servants to such a system. In the future, we may evolve from this system due to robots. ""Really, robots"", you say. Well, the future of smarter and smarter machines tend to reason that eventually AI will be as good , and then better than we are at completing tasks. So, it would mean good business to rather own your own robot and have it earn you income in the same way you did. I am pretty sure humans would fight to say that we should make income from our working properties and we would unionize in a sence of saying it is , the same as if we were working, in order to earn the same / hour income.

What seems to be the underlying difference between a rich person and not one? Freedom of time. I would define a rich person as the following:

* a person who could retire at any moment and live comfortably for the rest of their lives
* thats it

So in the future I forsee a balance of humans owning ""robots"" and earning income from them. 
An ongoing income, where we are not doing any of the work, would mean we could have our time back.
Another forsight I have is that this would lead to an era of task oriented income, meaning we would have machines that become faster than us and /hour payment is eventually unfair. R ""robots"" would become $/task oriented. So the more robots you have = the more income you have regardless.


Thats the End Game of the future!

In summary our future will find a balance in keeping humans able to profit from technology through: human ownership rights of robot work.
We will have freedom of time, and ease to earn more income.

I would like to hear some feedback on this theory positive and negative.",8,1

It's inevitable.  Whether that's in the next 50 years, or the next 100's off years is debatable, and not what this thread is about.

Picture mankind 1000 years from now, or even better, picture mankind 10,000 years from now.  Technology will be like nothing we could comprehend.  Culture, society, age, immortality, ethics, everything we currently know will be different.  Lets assume we have what is equivalent to corporations in the future.  These ""corporation's"" goal is to create worlds, with people, animals, dinosaurs, etc. LIFE in general.

Now, the humans of the year 12,015 will be different (Obviously).  But the big business of that day and age is to create/populate other ""Earth"" like worlds.  What does this even look like??  What kind of business would mankind need to run at a universe level?  Ethically, this wouldn't be allowed in today's day and age.  But, what would happen if we found out today that we're not the only humans, in fact, our ancestors traveled the universe 10,000 years ago, and our amazing planet was just ""farmed"" and someone actually owns every living thing on this planet.

How does that affect us now?  What would we do about it?  

Do you think this is a path Mankind is on?

The video barely got any upvotes, so i thought it might be a good idea to repost it in case people are interested but missed it. I made a self post as i imagine the title of the video was the reason people glossed over it.

Some of the things discussed are:

* Self driving cars vs. driver assistance systems.
* How the car ""sees"" and how it handles odd/rare situations.
* An estimation(of sorts) on when the technology will be available(around 5 years).

Unfortunately, nothing yet on how it handles bad weather conditions. But it seems like it's starting to master optimal condition driving.",5,17

No, I don't think so. I don't think that answer should surprise anyone. A more reasonable question to ask is *if* Chicago sees a majority of its roadways filled with automated vehicles in 2025, when do we see the same in Caracas? And that begs a much grander question: As the collective world advances, just how far behind are some of the individual places in the world, and will they catch up?

Much of my optimism for the future is fed by the turnaround of a city like Medelln, Colombia. 15, 18 years ago, Medelln was commonly viewed as the most dangerous city in the world, and for good reason. Today, however, Medelln is one of the most exciting up-and-coming cities in Latin America. I traveled in Colombia recently (I'm from Colorado) and was consistently blown away by the progress that has so convincingly been made in 15 years. Medelln in particular feels, honestly, more safe, bustling, and optimistic than Denver. That's a shocking change, and one that makes me think.

At the same time, cities like Accra exist, and rural Ghana at that. Will people in LA be worrying about immortality before Ghanaians have a chance to celebrate their septic systems?

The cars would always have power and it could be done ""green"".

The general idea combines short range wireless power transmission and the solar highway concept. The energy generated by the solar highway system would be routed to transmission stations built in the median of each road. Surplus power would be stored however so this works at night. 

This would allow us to have ""green"" cars that run for no fuel costs anywhere on the power grid system. Cars can have on-board power systems for ""off road"" travel.

This system requires that the solar road idea work out and that the wireless power transmission technology actually be as good as some people are advertising it to be. It would also require a great deal of retrofitting road systems.

That's not what VR is, that's just how you access VR at the moment. VR is not a technology, it's nothing less than the extension of the Internet to the mind and DARPA claims they'll have brain computer interfaces (BCIs) within 5 years.

BCIs wont just allow you to control machines with your thoughts though, they'll allow the blind to see, the deaf to hear and the mute to speak. They'll allow a whole new level of immersion in VR. This technology will be miniaturised and eventually implanted. With advances in molecular assembly and disassembly revolutionising the concepts of raw materials and recycling, and nanoswarms revolutionising the manipulation of physical reality, people will be able to communicate with that technology just by thinking and by extension shape reality by thinking too. With a BCI implant, a person will eventually gain what is essentially real world ""telekinetic"" and ""telepathic"" abilities, along with the ability to ""think things into existence"". Those abilities will be able to be used from within VR and with live camera feeds to render the physical environment, you have augmented reality (AR) too.

Now, [it's a well know fact that the porn industry are major drivers of technology](http://www.supercompressor.com/vice/how-porn-influenced-technology-8-ways-porn-influenced-tech-supercompressor-com) and VR is the perfect opportunity for them. With a BCI implant, you'd be able to have perfectly realistic sex in VR or the most fantastical sex imaginable.

With continued progress in automation and AI removing the need for people to work and providing them with UBI instead, people will spend more time in VR - learning, socialising and enjoying themselves. When you combine all these elements, people are going to find they don't want to leave VR but they'll have to in order to take care of their bodies in the least. This will lead to the development of life-support tanks so that people can remain in VR and with life extension technologies providing immortality, having kids will become a thing of the past. There will be ""warehouses"" full of these life-support tanks as it will be more efficient than everyone having one in their house. 

At some point in the future, we will develop the ability to transfer our mind into computational matter and the most logical place for that matter to be located is in orbit around the Sun. By the time it comes to make that transition, we'll be used to living in VR and using technology to interact in physical reality. We will be used to networking with other minds and shaping realities with our thoughts. VR will have prepared and trained us, and shown us how our body limits the capabilities of our mind. It will have virtualised society and life. When the time comes, we'll be ready and waiting.",56,31
