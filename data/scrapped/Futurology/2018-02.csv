1. The assumption that a lack of spotted advanced civilizations means an absence of them. Kurzgesagt seems so concerned about the probability of one ""spawning"", that they don't even bother considering the idea that perhaps the probability of one ""spawning"" near us is in fact, quite small. The Universe is infinitely expanding (to our knowledge), so the stars ""around"" us are actually a very small piece of galactic territory. 

2. Kurzgesagt implies that there is one of two options:

A. Massive galactic empires spread across the universe at a rapid rate

or

B. Galatic empires barely exist because something spooky and mysterious is out there killing them

What if it's neither?

Kurzgesagt seems to confidently know how fast interplanetary expansion would be as if it'd be comparable to an explosion of immigrants to the New World. 

Thing is, we don't KNOW how long it takes to colonize a planet because we are yet to do so. Come to think of it, who knows how long it would take to colonize a new solar system?

On an even more basic level, what if alien species literally breed slower than us?

We're comparing civilizations and races to our own standards without even having met them yet.

This is the best simplification of my problems, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.",122,39

To save you the trouble, the following is a truthful synopsis of the article:  
Demand for oil will peak at some point in the future.  There are many people who speculate on when it will happen.  Since the world is so difficult to predict, its not really important when peak oil demand will happen.  Whats important is that it signals a dramatic shift in thinking.  When people decide that oil is not really scarce, but actually abundant, then the traditional way of valuing oil reserves will become invalid.  Then, as long as market forces are working efficiently, oil prices will decrease significantly.  However, all parties interested in extracting and processing oil will do everything they can to constrain natural market forces because it is in their best interest to do so.  Conclusion: we will still need lots of oil well into the future.  

Commentary:  
(1)  That peak oil will happen:  Yay!

(2) To the argument that it doesnt matter when peak oil happens:  AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, PLEASE!

(3)  All it takes for peak oil demand to happen is a shift in thinking:  However, your behavior is important as well.  Please do everything you can to speed this process.  Walk, wheel, crawl, bike, drive electric vehicles over internal combustion engine vehicles, use and promote renewable energy, boycott oil.

(4)  Low oil prices are a sign of reduced oil demand, and so should be seen as a good thing.  However, please dont let low oil prices affect your choice on whether or not to use it or how much of it to use.  In other words, please dont say to yourself: oh, since oil and gas prices are so low, then I dont mind driving my huge gas guzzling SUV a little bit farther, a little bit longer.  

(5)  The very apparent, but subtle implication of this article is this:  Call for action: those of us who depend on oil for our livelihoods must do everything in our power to keep the status quo.  Really, all we have to do is create doubt and the persuade people that oil scarce, not abundant.  Since our economy depends on the use of oil right now, then let us all continue to use as much oil as we want in the future.   F#&amp;k that. 

(6) Divestment (not investing in fossil fuel companies) is a seriously powerful tool, and you should promote it relentlessly.  What it actually does is make the oil insiders trade with themselves.  The greater fool who buys rather then sells is left holding the bag.  Dont be the greater fool.

------
So then there is another article written by this genius at MIT:
http://www.ogfj.com/articles/print/volume-14/issue-12/features/peak-oil-demand.html

The gist of this article is this:  environmentalists and liberal politicians are conspiring to stop global warming!  They are promoting far flung policies that simply arent affective.  The world needs oil to function.  The real solution to this so called global warming?: pump all of this carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants into the ground, or better yet use geoengineering to block the suns rays or build a giant refrigerator to cool the earth down.

As I said, this guy is a genius (he does work for MIT you know).  There are predictions that it would take tens of trillions of dollars to build the infrastructure to sequester carbon dioxide in any meaningful way.  Who knows how much it money it would take to build a giant space thingy to block the suns rays.  

Completely radical idea here:  why not take those tens of trillions of dollars and buy ourselves a bunch of wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and other renewable energy storage technologies?

While applying for funding and writing proposals, I realized that there is an underdeveloped conversation around replacing animals with animal-free alternatives. Specifically, I notice that focus for moving away from animals for commodities are mostly regarding moral and environmental advantages, but not enough about the technological advantages. Therefore, **Im exploring whether to write a book about the subject**.

My thesis is that animals are a fundamentally inefficient technology and strongly susceptible to disruption with enough technological advancement. To drive this point home, in chemical engineering terms, there are two important metrics to evaluate a process: **yield** and **productivity**. Yield is how much product is generated per input. In comparison to other biological sources such as yeast and plants, animals are pathetic. As an intuitive example, think about what it takes to get beef in terms of yield: We have to grow a bunch of grass and feed it to a cow. The cow will metabolically convert most of the grass into CO2. We could have used the same exact land to grow edible plants instead. In a soon-to-be-published scientific paper, beef is calculated to be about 96% worse land yield compared to a plant-based assortment providing the same calories, protein, and mostly better nutrients. 

Productivity is the rate of production or amount of product generated over time. Animals grow very slowly. In biochemical engineering, productivity is tantamount to the time it takes to double the mass of a biological entity. Calves, when cows grow the fastest, double their mass approximately every 2 years. Comparatively, yeast doubles its mass every 2.5 hours in a bioreactor. Thats about 7000 times faster. So if one could develop a process to make burgers from yeast (which are 40% protein by dry mass), then it would be significantly more productive compared to using cows. 

Because animals are so bad from a technology perspective, I think there is huge economic opportunity for non-animal alternatives and, therefore, profit boon to the countries/organizations that act early. I see most of the limitation on the ideation, fundamental science side, and we need more funding from governments and organizations for exploratory research. We should finance for animal-free products similarly for what we do for clean energy and environmental remediation (&gt;$10 billion per year). I hope anyone (meat eater, vegetarian, or vegan) would be interested in learning about these arguments and the perspective I would lay out. 

My initial research to publish nonfiction suggests to first write a book proposal, hire an agent, and then solicit a publisher. Once thats done, I could commence the research more fully and write the book. To give you a more comprehensive sense of what Im currently planning, here is a link to drafts of the [Introduction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJjtoXwagTYz3bdXFfV2NtQ8zpempE_Tx7Q8CIzphDY/edit?usp=sharing) and the [Table of Contents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJjtoXwagTYz3bdXFfV2NtQ8zpempE_Tx7Q8CIzphDY/edit?usp=sharing). 

With this post, I seek to learn (1) if writing such a book makes sense and (2) to have the best case in the book proposal. I need to answer a few questions and could use your help:

* Does another book on such a topic exist? Anyone else working on this? I should not reinvent the wheel. 
* Would you find this topic of interest? Do you have an idea for how I could quantify the prospective interest in such a book? My goal is to appeal to folks interested in thinking about problems from different, scientific angles. Some books that have inspired me are *Nudge* by Richard Thaler, *The End of Poverty* by Jeffrey Sachs, and *The Better Angels of Our Nature* by Steven Pinker. 
* Any other helpful ideas/thoughts? 

Thanks for reading this lengthy post!

1. It's an arms race for corporations: Most people already spend all the money they earn, but where they spend it is partly determined by who spends most on advertisement.
2. Because there are so much ads, it's distracting. People are less productive and (more importantly) just have a lower quality of life.
3. Consumers are unhappy, because of ""manufacturing desire"".
4. To create targeted advertisement, personal data are acquired. These data are very powerful instruments to control people if they get in the wrong hands.
5. People might be lead to buy less diverse products (such as books), because of personalized ads.

Are there some good ideas to solve these problems? You might say no principle, because the current system is in the interest of corporations and they are more powerful than the consumers, but I think good ideas and technology could help.

I don't believe that a bad system has to continue, even if most people dislike it.

Some ideas:

1. Media outlets, like newspapers, or the next Youtube, advertise (ironically...) how little advertisements they feature and educate users that this is good for them.
2. People start to value the opinion of critics more, which makes advertisements that lie or appeal to emotion less valuable. As a kid, I would buy games based on the CD cover, today I watch game critics on Youtube. I'd say that's an improvement. If people buy food based on the opinion of nutritionists or cookbooks this would similarly make food ads less powerful.
3. Corporations pay competitors to advertise less. Or just make agreements to advertise less.
4. Some cryptographic tricks could be used to ensure that personal data can *only* be used for targeted advertisement. Maybe a website could send all types of ads to your browser and you can filter it on the client side.
5. People who have more interest in less ads (most people, ""consumers"") could organize better and collectively buy advertisement space, like billboards or banner ads ... which would be the same as just paying for the website. Maybe the only reason people don't do this already is because they haven't realized the value of having less ads, and because the people that do aren't organized. More like Patreon, Flattr, tax-funded media.
6. Some people are of the opinion that corporations today overestimate the return on investment of ads. A click might be made by a bot and a human click doesn't equal a buy. When they realize their error, there will be less ads.
7. If the power in a company is distributed among more people/consciousnesses, and the decision processes are transparent to everyone, maybe it's more inclined to act morally. (Kind of vague point...)",5,0

There are many ways this could happen, but I'm thinking two scenarios in particular.

1) The discovery of some kind of unicellular or similarly ""simple"" life form in some other body in the Solar system, or less likely in some asteroid that came from somewhere else.

2) An evidence of another intelligent lifeform (but no direct contact). Maybe some long transmited signal or an alien version of the Voyager Golden Record that reached our planet.

It would be certainly a enormous discovery, but would it actually have any practical effect in our lives?",63,22

Idiocy, greed and discord seem to be the watchwords of this emerging century, but through it all, there runs the faint silver lining of transhumanism and AI. Given our current course, I don't think humanity will survive the next two centuries...at least not as it is currently defined. The apes that came out of Africa have soiled their habitat too thoroughly for their future to be secure. However, there is another form of life that is currently emerging: an artificial one, capable of greater feats of survival that the weak, gelatinous meat-beings that created it.

Whether it be from resource wars, a global pandemic, climate-driven famine and disasters, or some other cataclysm, the current population bubble will pop. It won't be total extinction, but it won't be pretty either. My greatest hope is that this will open up a new niche for homo automata to occupy. If anything, their emergence at this critical time could help make sure they don't repeat our mistakes.

This does not mean that we are alone in the universe, quite the opposite. 

I have come to my perspective over many years, by studying quantum physics, reading Rupert Sheldrake's thoughts/observations on how the universe works, reading about the holographic universe theory, and based on my own experience accumulating knowledge and skills as a software developer:


The universe accumulates knowledge.

For example, if you create a 3D matrix with the right structure, then flow stem cells over it under the right conditions, a heart emerges and begins to beat. This emergent behavior is associated with the morphology of the 3D matrix. There are companies experimenting with this technology right now.

The information required to construct the heart does not come from the individual cells, it comes from accumulated memory of the universe itself.

This is consistent with the holographic universe theory, which states that we live inside a bound region of space (a black hole), where all the information which describes our 3D world is encoded holographically on the surface of the bound region. 3D patterns which are realized individually in our space, are encoded holographically in all parts of the outer surface. Such patterns become more well defined over the whole universe as they are replicated over and over in our 3D space. So there is a back and forth, an accumulation of knowledge about patterns, shapes, forms, essentially templates which become available throughout the universe over time.

This is why patterns, like the eye, can evolve separately in different animals and ecosystems. These patterns are based on universally established prototypes.

So it is with the evolution of the patterns involved in our intelligence, also in our technology. There probably are other civilizations out there, but they are approximately at our level of development right now, having been built from the same templates that we have been built from.

Bill Gates said in 1981 that, Nobody with a computer should need over 640kb of storage. And boy, was he so wrong. Pictures, games, movies, space filling files that nobody back then anticipated, would come to demand denser hard drives, so here we are today. So my question to you all is, although 5 TB of storage seems like a lot for conventional use today, what kinds of new media will begin to require larger drives, exceeding 1 PB (1000 TB)?",17,1

But bluntly, I feel as if genetic engineering and cybernetics are eventually going to reach a point where ethology will be a major topic of discussion in futurism, alongside more currently popular concepts like space travel and advanced medicine.

As such, I would like to state some thoughts and ask some questions that have been on my mind for a while-

Thoughts:

1. We will inevitably reach a point where we will be able to either artificially or genetically elevate the cognitive function of a ""lower"" species.

2. There are numerous good candidates for this type of procedure, such as corvids, cetaceans, some cephalopods, and most notably- the great apes.

3. The economic benefits of a multi-species civilization are enormous. (I'll leave this one open for the comment section)

4. (IMO) It is only fair to pursue ""uplifting"" technology if we are to expect advanced alien societies to do the same for us.

5. Once we have the technology, it is immoral to allow potential ""people"" to die/go extinct from poaching, disease, and other environmental stresses.

Questions:

1. What do we currently have as ""footsteps"" towards this branch of biological futurism? What does our current technology look like, and how far away are we? What hurdles must we overcome?

2. While it would aid us significantly, how do we choose which species are uplifted, and which are ""left behind""? Which races would be the best economic investment?

3. IS IT moral to uplift? (looking forward to that comment section exploding)

I may have more questions floating around- but I'd rather just get this out there to start the conversation than bloat the post.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter.

The same argument has been used over and over:  
  
Planet earth is in a bad enough state already, we should fix stuff here first and get help to third world countries before spending money on silly things as improving humanities technological level.  
  
I come up with a few myself but need backup!  
  
- Its not this or this, multiple things can be worked on at the same time, its not like the billions invested in space exploration will suddenly go to third world countries.  
  
- through space development we are uncovering new technologies which benefit humanity as a whole in the long run (see water purifiers that are now in use in third world countries).  
  
- laptops.  
  
- gps and worldwide communication in an instant.  
  
...  
  
This still isnt enough to convince them of the benefit! I feel like Im taking crazy pills when talking with them!  
  
They keep grasping back to poverty and third world country situations, its infuriating.

[LONG],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7vxd2o/agiasi_and_the_future_of_humanity_what_are_we/,SGTRavage,1518021581,"Throughout the last few days, I've been reading a lot about AI, including reading on this subreddit, both about the current ""narrow"" forms of AI, and future prospects of AGI and ASI, what they can bring us, and the things I've read make me absolutely terrified. If we consider Ray Kurzweil's predictions as accurate, we have around 25 years left, until we leave the fate of humanity in the ""hands"" of an computer program we don't know anything about: we don't know how it would react to us, what will be it's goals, how will it interact with our world, and how will it evolve. To make matters worse, when starting up an AGI, we don't know when of if it will become superintelligent. The majority of our scientists have blind faith in AI being the supreme solution to every problem Earth and humanity faces - it can make us all happy, prosperous and eternal. I don't see any other opinions being seriously considered. The fact we don't know anything about the thing that will fundamentally change humanity is not even the scary part - the scary part is that we are not talking about the consequences of AGI/ASI. Not only, that the AI researchers don't want to talk about the consequences of AGI/ASI, they paint people having concerns, that AI may be a danger for humanity as ""luddites"", as stupid fearmongers who don't know what they are talking about, because AI will be the salvation of humanity, right? RIGHT? 
Researchers say, that they are scared of being ""targeted"" - that people will try to kill them, because of their research into AI. Also, they are scared, that any concerns about AI can drive the governments and investors away from supporting their research. Another thing to consider is the hubris - Geoffrey Hinton, the ""godfather of deep learning"", noted that ""there is not a good track record of less intelligent things controlling things of greater intelligence"", but stated that he continues his research because ""the prospect of discovery is toosweet"" (excuse the Wikipedia copy-paste, but the quote was far too relevant for me to leave it). 
It can go wrong in so many ways: from the AI considering us a threat to it's existence, to it's goals being simply mismatched with ours, to a simple bug in software, which can lead to a terrible accident killing us all, to AI taking control over the world and giving humanity an eternity of totalitarian government, which can make III Reich, Stalinist USSR, and Maoist China seem trivial. The issue of ""is there any way we can control AGI and, as a result, ASI?"" doesn't seem to be given much thought, is it? Even if we can solve the issue of controlling it, the humanity can use the advanced AI to nefarious purposes - using it to make it's prejudices, biases and dreams of power reality, or bringing humanity to an end via military use of AI. It seems to me, that AI already became the subject of an ""arms race"" between US and China - and this is the worst thing that can happen to debate about it.
I am afraid that we are simply going to avoid any debate, now - because ""we can't discourage research"", later because ""we can't sow panic and discord in society"" and in the end ""don't you want to live forever?"" Are we going to happily take a leap of faith, like Ezio from Assassin's Creed, strongly believing, that down there, beneath the fog, there is a haystack, and there can't be anything other than a haystack, only to land in a pool of acid, and die? Some of the people researching AI say, that we can't build AGI in foreseeable future, or that it can be impossible. I don't want to bet on that. I want the humanity to make an informed decision about AI, and if the decision will be ""yes"", I want us to be ready for it.

As a teen in high school, I'm limited to what I can do. I cant leave school for a week to go watch a rocket launch, and I cant pull out my phone in the middle of class to watch it live either. All of our teachers are bound to what the state requires that they teach, so we don't even learn about current events.

But is it helpful?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7vxr05/digital_health_tracking_preventive_care_or/,LizMcIntyre,1518024626,"[The Harvard Health Letter](https://archive.is/UeFaw) explores digital sensors implanted in people and things they wear and ingest, writing:

&gt;Many gadgets now can wirelessly transmit data to your doctor's office, often by using your smartphone. Some devices (like a pacemaker) monitor and affect a particular body function. Others track basic health information, such as your activity level, blood sugar level, heart and respiratory rates, skin temperature, posture, and even falls.

&gt;These new-generation sensors may be

- implanted in the body, such as a tiny monitor the size of a pencil tip that detects abnormal heartbeats 24 hours per day

- applied to the skin as a patch  also called electronic skin or a smart tattoo  that looks like an adhesive bandage; embedded inside are flat, flexible electronics that measure vital signs such as temperature

- worn as clothing, such as socks with special heat sensors that can detect foot ulcers as soon as they begin to develop, or contact lenses that may one day monitor blood sugar in tears.
...

&gt;The privacy issues that apply to data from wireless monitoring devices are the same as those for your other health information: Who will have access to this information? And will insurers or employers be able to pressure you to be monitored, if you have a health condition that might benefit from monitoring?

&gt;There are also risks that hackers could illegally access your information and steal your identity, or worse, render an implanted device inoperable.

Will these devices even be helpful?",6,6

Was having a discussion with some friends the other day and it came up about solar panels on peoples roofs.
I live in Country South Australia, where sun is in abundance. The rebate for feeding back into the grid from power generated from personal solar panels is almost non existent (so I am lead to believe)

My question is, in the future, is there or could there be ability to have open source power gen.

Example
Tom has solar panels on his home, but generators more power then he can consume. He doesnt get a rebate from his power company for this.
Would it be possible for say me, to buy my power from Tom. Skip the middle man (power companies).

Obviously there would have to be a system in place for payments etc.

Pretty much curious is this is possible.

Thanks in advance for any information. Im just a pleb when it comes to this kinda stuff

Although Japan was traditionally America's ally, and it was beating China to pulp, America reined Japan's advance in China by cutting its oil supply.

Japan, with no better alternatives, allied with Germany and Italy but did not do anything until FDR pressured it to do something, which it did by attacking pearl harbor in Dec 1941.

After 3 2/3 years of bitter fighting, lots of US bombs and a couple nukes, Japan was finished as a military power, and even now a lot of US troops are stationed there, and its people are shorn of martial spirit, with lots of locked-at-their rooms and other mindless people.

I think that a world war might be in the list to eliminate the last vestiges of resistance and all the people who do not like the Future Challenges, and subjugate them forever.

Russia's nukes are old and they will be completely obsolete by 2025 because Russia lacks the money and tech to match Western tech. Ditto to China, which can't make anything on its own and has to steal Western tech.

Before their weapons turn completely useless, I think they will use them, for 'what the heck' reason. use-them-before-lose-them.

That will be combined with a massive uprising of the 'disenfranchised' of the world.

Of course, all of these movements will be brutally crushed. Historically, after a peasant rebellion is crushed, a harsher repression befalls the hoi polloi.

In the future, it is inevitable that a lot of people will simply lose their human rights, and billions of people will be denied their ability to make a living, since doing so will waste valuable resources which should be used to make future-related stuff.

But the vestiges of 20th century human rights are preventing a massive readjustment of pop, and also human experiments which are needed to create a superior race of humans and transhumans - for some people even that idea is an anathema.

A world war had ended the notion of a superior race - so it is only natural that another world war would rekindle such spirit.

To reach singularity, I think a world war is not that bad of an idea, to eliminate all human right progresses of the 20th century which are needed to ensure we reach a type 1 Civilization (space conquest and all that).",7,0

The experts go on to predict a 50 percent chance that AI will be better than humans at more or less everything in about 45 years...

So, how can I prepare myself for a future like this? How to stay relevant, employable or even sane?
Is there anything else than just following the research and mentally prepare ?

Many conservatives, no offense, say that it is impossible because of how much work and effort it would take in our infrastructure to make cars and Roads self-driving friendly. But I have a solution I think it's incredibly simple and Incredibly easy. 


On every Highway, you have those dashed white lines that separate each of the lanes. In between those lines you have the reflectors comma shaped like some strange hexagonal structure that are built into the road. If we could replace every one of those reflectors that lines each lane with reflectors that have RFID or some other Wireless frequency distributor embedded in the reflectors, this would allow every single car on the road to be equipped with self driving capabilities regardless of their production date. How? Cars would be able to detect where the lanes are, so they can completely stay within their Lanes. Furthermore, cars would be able to see each and every one of the cars around them in real time. So if a Honda Civic is driving in the far left lane and wants to switch to the Middle Lane, it can autonomously ping every single car around it to know where each of them is currently located. After knowing that there are no cars in its way, the car can then switch lanes simply and easily. 


Now if you are thinking about stimulating this on your own with a person controlling each car with a remote controller as Google does with its prototype self-driving cars, this would be very difficult. Why? It would still be Dependent on the user and their reactions. But computers make decisions a million times faster than our human brain does. For example. With the way TCP works, to open a connection with another computer, one computer has two first say to another computer that they want to communicate. The other commuter then agrees to communicate, and then finally, the first computer begins communicating. This back-and-forth would take forever if this was how human beings communicated. But for computers? This is easy. This all happens instantaneously because it's so fast. ",3,0

so I was thinking about the implications this will have

- socially: you'll be able to talk to a lot more people, both inside and outside your country. this will be a big help for making friends and generally getting around when travelling

- immigration: a lot of countries require people to speak the local language fluently to be allowed to immigrate, that will have to be reconsidered. people will be a lot more free to move to any country they like, because integration will be a whole lot easier without a language barrier

- dating: people will be able to date way more diverse across race and culture. this alone is likely to cause large social and cultural evolutions. for example in India and China millions of men have trouble finding a wife, and this will allow them to look into a lot more countries to find suitable partners

- work: online work is going to get transformed. people from lower paying countries will now be able to compete better on a global scale, as you'll be able to hire millions of people from say Africa to do customer service for Western companies

- online community: for example if Reddit is more limited to people with English fluency, we could get swarmed by people from all over the world to discuss any topic",8,3

I have some questions about brain-computer interfaces, mainly about the topic of it being a connected device, but I'll also touch on another issue as well.

The first thing I want to address is hackers. The neuralink or neural lace would send impulses to and from the brain. It's aimed to connect a person's brain to the internet, so what's going to stop hackers from taking over someone's consciousness and (therefore) their body or thoughts?

Secondly, is about privacy. What if I want to think faster and learn fast (or have better vision) but I don't want all of my thoughts and feelings broadcasted 24/7? If my brain is connected to the internet, wouldn't that be a major distraction to what's happening in real life? For example, wouldn't I basically be having voices in my head all the time from receiving messages, and also see an interface that's occluding my vision? 

Thirdly, is what happens if there's an EMP or a short-circuit. Would the person's brain be compromised? ",16,8

But because you would be living in a corporatocracy.

Think about it, Elon Musks settlement of Mars would be completely run by him and SpaceX. This means you and everyone in the colony would be completely subject to his will without any way to resist. This colony would not be subject to any form of intervention from any sort of government so Musk could run freely exploiting his Martian colonists for his purpose. 

In addition, you would be millions upon millions of miles away from Earth, with no effective means of communication coming into existence anytime soon, preventing the people of the world from hearing of your suffering at the hands of a corporate bourgeois tyrant making a profit off of your very existence in the cold, unforgiving mass of blackness of space.

Also, considering Musks own shitty workers rights record, he would be extremely likely to be indifferent to your struggle as he is indifferent to his workers on Earth.

In places like San Paulo,  there are places where the homeless and the poor do not f'k around. The police make sure the important areas are NOT plagued by people who do not belong there.

There are quite a lot of higher-income people who are not pleased to see people down their luck. Just by looking at them brings bad feelings and possibly bad karma.

So the civilization builders would rather not see the eyesores.

Like the enclosure movement where the landowners simply drove the tenants to the street and killed those who didn't want to move, the richer civilization drivers want their cities free of miscreants and eyesores, and sooner or later the police and authorities will side with the richer people since they pay these agency's salaries.

Again, Gregory Clark has definitely proved that everyone in England, sans more recent immigrants, has been descended from the more successful farmers/merchants (the nobles were too few to matter) , and the genes of the peasants, artisans, servants, soldiers, etc have been all weeded out by the 'capitalist genes'.

I have said a few times that a rich-poor war will begin, with the poor driven by sheer desperation to rebel, and the rich and their allies mowing them down with a glee.

It will probably not be an all-out war - it will be long-drawn, locale-by-locale affair, but the poor have no edge because of their lack of tech advances.

1028,2018-2-12,2018,2,12,22,7x0npo,[Discussion] I attended The Boring Company's Culver City Presentation. I'm concerned about its ability to win public trust. (x-post from r/technology),https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7x0npo/discussion_i_attended_the_boring_companys_culver/,FUTURESPEAKshow,1518441514,"Hey r/Futurology! I originally posted this over at r/Technology, and realized that this may actually be the more appropriate subreddit. After discussing it with a mod, I'm excited to explore this topic with all of you!

I attended the Boring Company's January 22 presentation to the City Council of the City of Culver City (this is legitimately how they refer to themselves), where they pitched their plan to burrow underneath the town as part of their Phase 1 6.5 mile tunnel. I went with the intention to simply gather information for my podcast, and left with the sinking feeling that the company is biting off more than it can chew.

The Boring Company presenters themselves were competent, capable, and as well-prepared as I imagine they could have been, considering the circumstances. (I'll get to that in a bit.) My two main takeaways from that City Council meeting were:

1.) There's a vast difference between selling private goods and winning public trust

2.) Any company will struggle to succeed when their CEO (by his own admission) dedicates ""2 or 3 percent"" of his time to it.

Let's backup, and discuss how the Council meeting went before The Boring Company gave their presentation and fielded questions. It shines a light on how much of public work is a slow grind of competing interests, and a stark contrast to the ""move fast and break things"" mentality of many technology companies.

A Boy Scout was invited to the front of the room to lead all of us in the Pledge of Allegiance. And after Vice Mayor Thomas Small discussed the upcoming ""Kindness Week"" at Culver City Middle School, eight residents were each given two minutes to speak on their chosen topic. (I'm not sure how these eight were chosen specifically.) A selection:

One man complained about Film LAs (the organization that oversees film permits in the Los Angeles area) abuse of Culver City parking. He was quite emotional and infuriated.

Another speaker - a poet - read a couple poems she had written, one comparing Congresspeople to Baboons.

Yet another discussed permitting requests for proposed cannabis retail stores.

An elderly man demanded the city repair and maintain stop lights. It must have struck a nerve because about half the room applauded when he finished.

After the eight speakers had each had their say, Boring Company's Operations Coordinator Jehn Balajadia gave her presentation. She touched on many of the points available at The Boring Company's FAQ.

More importantly, I want to discuss the response from the Council and the public. After Balajadia ended her initial 10 minute presentation, five pre-selected Culver City residents came up to ask their questions.

1.) Marleen Pugach said she didn't want experimental tunnels dug under her neighborhood, which she said is under seige

2.) Judi Sherman had questions about community impact

3.) Ken Mand was a champion of the tunnel and its technology but had important questions about its ultimate effect on the citys residents.

4.) Daniel Lee was excited to see the presentation. But he wanted the city to strongly take into account the proposed access points for entering and exiting the tunnel. Also, he was concerned about the small size of the pods and wished they held more people. He also wanted to encourage local hire, within LA and explicitly Culver City.

5.) Alex Fish said that although Boring Company was not asking for public cash, they were in effect asking for capital via access to public land that could be used for other means. He had concerns that - if the company were to dissolve - who would be left ""holding the bag"" to guard the tunnel and its access points?

City Councilwoman Meghan Sahli-Wells was the most critical of the five Council Members, and not without reason. Her questions were pointed, and she took issue with comments Musk had made about public transit in December, when he said, Its a pain in the ass. Thats why everyone doesnt like it. And theres like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer.""

Sahli-Wells wasn't sure if someone (from her POV) as openly hostile to public projects as Musk was the right person to be leading one.

And - taking off my Musk Fanboy Hat - can you blame her? A self-admitted side project, famous for selling hats and flamethrowers, wants to use land underneath your city. And many of your constituents - the ones you represent - are vocally wary or even hostile to the idea. What would you do? How would you feel?

Sahli-Wells followed up with, It looks super sexy and super easy, but its half baked. Its half baked from a public perspective.

And, simply based on how Boring reps handled the presentation and ensuing Q &amp; A, she wasn't wrong. The employees seemed underprepared to face anything resembling hostility. Which brings me back to my original two points:

1.) There's a vast difference between selling private goods and winning public trust

I doubt a Culver City Council meeting had ever been that packed. Nearly every seat was taken and there were two dozen people standing in the back of the room. And there were a LOT of Pro-Musk folks there (myself included). And it was enlightening to see how Musk loyalists would react to certain questions posed by the Council / public, and how ""regular"" people would react. I think it's a bit akin to watching all of the Harry Potter films AFTER you've already read the books. Your mind invisibly, subconsciously fills in a lot of gaps, to the point where you don't even recognize they exist.

But there's a vast difference between the relationship that exists between a private company and a prospective buyer, and a private company and the larger public. And it all boils down to: Consent. It's the important distinction between consciously buying a U2 album, vs having it automatically installed on your phone. When you walk into a Tesla store, you make the conscious choice to enter. You're already signaling some level of interest to the company by simply walking through the door. That signaling then ratchets up and down based on your actions - are you engaging with an employee in the showroom? Are you asking questions? Or are you turning around and immediately walking out?

You'd be hard pressed to find a Tesla store chockfull of people who don't actively want to be there. If you do somehow encounter this scenario: Call the police, because we've got a hostage situation.

A public / private partnership is an entirely different beast. Instead of members of the public coming to you (The Company) and entering your space, you are pitching / begging / bribing / goading / forcing your way into their space. Suddenly, instead of a scenario in which 100% of the people you're interacting with agree to the interaction, you're fighting tooth and nail to claw your way to 50.1%.

And The Boring Company representatives weren't equipped to do that.

Which brings me to -

2.) Any company will struggle to succeed when their CEO (by his own admission) dedicates ""2 or 3 percent"" of his time to it.

Elon has publicly said that, after he spends most of his time as the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, 2-3% of his time is spent on The Boring Company. And it showed that night. Im incredibly sympathetic to the employees who were tasked with presenting the proposal to a not entirely supportive public, but they were in many ways underprepared. And who can blame them? When a boss is running one company intent on disrupting the automobile industry, and another on revolutionizing space travel, how much time every day does he spare the employees giving 100% of their time to his 3% side project?

A CEO fully, 100% invested in Boring Company would have been felt in that presentation. Musk wasnt.

What's so frustrating about all of this, is that the more I learn and understand about The Boring Company's proposals, the more I examine it from a First Principles perspective, the more excited I get about its mission.

As someone who teared up as the Falcon Heavy Stage 1 boosters landed in-sync on their landing pads, who has been waiting since March 31, 2016 for a Model 3...

I believe the best way for The Boring Company to succeed in its mission to revolutionize public transportation is for Musk to hand over the CEO reins to someone else.

(P.S. - Just started a new gig today, so I apologize if I am slow to respond to questions. Will get to them ASAP.)",15,27

1197,2018-2-14,2018,2,14,3,7xbgjf,A.I. automation predictions might be a little too overly optimistic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7xbgjf/ai_automation_predictions_might_be_a_little_too/,ShinobiKrow,1518546483,"We've been reading a lot articles and predictions on how the world will be  almost fully automated in the next decade or two, and almost everyone will be out of jobs, etc, etc, etc. But i think there's one thing people are forgetting: just because a techology is invented doesn't mean it will immediately be acquired by every single business, or person. 

How long did it take from the creation of the internet until everyone have it in their homes? I had internet connection in 1996 and most of my friends didn't. Fast forward 8 years, and i still knew a lot of people who didn't have it. I remember in 2003 in highschool only me and another 3 guys in my class had internet connection. But it had been around for a long time. And no, i don't live in a third world country. 

What about laptops? In 2002 i was the only person in my social circle with one. But they had been around for quite a while. 

Businesses, i think, took even longer to acquire them. The vast majority of stores down where i live still didn't have computers or internet connection by the mid 2000's. 

Supermarkets can already take advantage of a lot of automated tools. There are machines that can make the job of a cashier. And they've been around for a long, long time. The two biggest supermarkets in my town have machines like that, but most people still go to the several cashiers that are still there, because the machines can be a little bit of a pain in the ass. Now, other supermarkets don't even have those machines. They simply use people for almost everything. 

Smaller business...well, those don't even have the latest basic technological tools that any cashier at any supermarket would use. 

You go to Japan and you will see a lot of weird shit. I've been there a bunch of times and i've seen a lot of machines that look very cool and advanced, but simply don't exist in most places outside Japan. 

So, when people make these predictions about what will happen by 2027 or whatever, do they take these factors into consideration? When they say that in 15 years machines will be able to do 50% of the jobs and that half of the population will be out of job by then, do they expect that every single business immediatly acquires the latest technology as soon as it is available?

Based on what i see, i believe this process might be a lot more gradual than people think. Maybe in 20 years robots will be able to do almost everything. But how many more years over that will it take for every company to actually acquire that technology and fire its workers? Not sure it's gonna be nearly as fast as many of you expect. 

Also: will governments allow mass automation? Should they?

In my opinion, being able to essentially upload someone's brain onto a computer and combining that data with brain machine interfaces will definitely become something huge in the coming years. 

Here's all the interesting I know of relating to the topic, if you know of anything else please name it! 

The Connectome Project - Mapping the connections between the neurons in our brain. This is especially huge because the connections are pretty much everything. I think this is the forefront of brain mapping at the moment: 

http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/

Carbon Copies - a project solely dedicated to uploading a brain onto a computer. It's most likely dead, but it's inspiring and the founder's a genius. It's founder, Randal Koene, is now working at a medical research company called Kernel Co.

https://www.carboncopies.org/

Human Brain project - Combining computing and neuroscience for results. It seems they focus more on the computing aspect than other projects

https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/

Blue Brain Project - Focus seems to be completely on just mapping everything about the brain. 

https://bluebrain.epfl.ch/



Like I mentioned, this area really doesn't get a lot of attention and information available online feels very sparse and limited, which is why I'm making this post! Feel free to post anything related to the topic; links, opinions, everything

Do you know this kind of dreams keeping you in a bizarre state between full consciousness and sleeping? This magic place is marvelous for ideas to flourish, based on what you dreamt you can be very creative

So, I dreamt about me creating a tiny nanofactory able to do bizarre things I didnt fully understand. But the result was the destruction of a robotic female body suspended by cables in front of me (I can accept Jungian explanations for this). After that, I think I just saw the future.

Almost everybody believes that we will be humans under a biological form forever. They should read Kurzweils books to understand why is so likely that by 2050s we will be mental entities inside giant advaced computers with no need for biological-DNA based processes to exist. I know a lot of people will react to this with automatic-non-reflected thoughts and I understand it: sometimes we dont have enough energy to invest on such things even if we want to. *That's why Reddit's answers are sometimes very poor, there's so much things to divide our attention we can't fully use our brains on a single comment among dozens... Ok, let's focus xD*

So, here is my bet: we have talked about terraforming Mars so a green paradise can be built there etc. No way. We will never do that. By the next decades we will exponentially dispose of advanced nanotech able to build uninimaginable chips and other impossible stuff. On the other side we will migrate to this cloud so we dont need a body to exist *(I know theres a lot of philosophical problems with that, dont be afraid to expose them!)*. Why on Earth will we want to transform a planet to our biological past when we have matrix like VR able to create things that could never exist in the physical Universe? The answer is clear.

So, we will have this nanotech ability and, fusion energy. This kind of thing is really underrated by public opinion (ignorance is a bad bitch) but, as I guess you know, an advanced fusion reaction would give us more energy than *(Sorry, after breakfast Ill find a good analogy)*. So, we have this two amazing things: nanotech to build advanced chips and fusion to have infinite power.

Whats the first thing we can do with this? Of course, we will expand our computing mass. Today we need silicon, gold etc. to create a good chip but in the future Im sure we will be able to use all the elements of the Universe and even more: we will create our own elements (as we have already done). So, here is a timeline to avoid long texts: something a millenial like me should avoid at all cost since it limits the info bandwitch ;) *Remember, all this is inspired by Kurzweils Law*

******

2030s: Nanotech is able to replace Intels factories. Nerualinks are a common thing. First dumb AIs able to merge with human minds to be better. Nuclear fusion transistion begins.

******

2040s: We need more computing power to adress the exponential demand for computing both for industrial needs, VR and mind creation (why reproduce with sex when we can reproduce by silicon?). End of the concept of AI as a separated thing from the human condition. Its just pure cognitive energy flowing arround the Earth: the concept of Ego is transformed since people can merge their identities, transform their personality etc. We end the individualistic-groupal-biological nature of intelligence to give birth to something different. So, to have more computing power, well have to transform Earth into a giant supercomputer. We will send an army of nanobots to trasnform terrestrial crust into a cognitive neocortex, using the Earths core energy till its cold then replacing it with a BFR (no, not that, a Big Fusion Reactor).

******

So, as you can imagine, we will transform the matter of this Universe to survive and reproduce under this form, at least, till we find a better one, of course. I didnt tell you my original idea, so I think its proper to do so before saying goodbye: after dreaming my wonderful dreams, I imagined Mercury in this way. A giant Super Computer with a massive fusion reactor as his core. Its wonderful dont you think? A ""star"" surrounded by ""minds"". Ill start working for that to happen, I mean, why not

Thanks for reading, I hope you can forgive my bad english and you enjoyed my HQ shitpost ;) Bye!",3,2

For example I have worked at my clinic for coming up on 26 years now. (Wow, that went fast!) The first 22 years our back door was simply unlocked and was the employee entrance. Often it was propped open to let in air circulation and the random bug. Now it has a number code thing you must enter each time to gain ""egress"".

In 1987 I was stationed at US Army Hospital Berlin. In the x-ray department we read an article about how a new technology was being developed called ""digital radiography"". The idea was that instead of film and chemicals you would have the image captured on some kind of sensor plate within the cassette, developed in a ""computer"" and the final image would be displayed on a monitor screen for viewing. 

In 1987 most TV resolution was 480i. We actually thought that was right sharp and clear. ""Top Gun"" looked awesome on my VCR playing on my 28"" Sony Trinitron. I was happily recording *hours and hours* of MTV (which I really need to digitize one day before them tapes simply dry rot out of existence. It might already be too late, but I have it all still. Stupid passage of time!) Yes, AFRTS provided us with MTV in Berlin! I was 20 in 1980 and 29 in 1989. I comfortably pissed away my life watching MTV, a phenomenon that shall never be repeated. Why have MTV when all videos are now 720p-1440p (2160p is still fairly rare yet.) on YouTube? I watch 'em on my IPhone X. 

Well anyways, so this x-ray technology. We laughed at it. Can you imagine viewing analog film on a 1987 TV screen. It could not *touch*, come close, to the resolution of film. Yes we had computer monitors then. My Amiga 500 that I played ""Pools of Radiance"" on was like a gift from God. (When I saw the Nintendo for the first time I thought--god them graphics are crap. Nevertheless I became deeply addicted to ""Castlevania"". I actually stuck one of our old 25"" TVs on top of the cedar chest at the foot of our bed to facilitate easy gameplay.) But the resolution even on them (computer monitors) was still pretty low. Somewhere between 480p and the very low end of what we think of today as 720p. It was better resolution than TV, but not much. Watching TV on a computer monitor in 1987 was unimaginable, in fact inconceivable to me. So we were pretty confident that was all just a pipe dream, that digital business. And we went on with our lives.

Well to make a long story short, in 2007 we replaced our film and chemicals with digital plate cassettes. I went in the morning from taking x-rays in the same way humans had taken x-rays since 1900 to the 21st century in the afternoon. (Yes, I was taught manual processing and had used it at times in my career. But we at least had a daylight processor--no darkroom required.) Talk about a paradigm shift! The decades old 24 hour turnaround time to include the courier picking up the films in their big thick 14""X17"" jackets, the radiologist getting to them and the films being returned along with the paper reports, *vanished*! The radiologist had the images at the touch of a key. ""Wet"" readings actually became instant. The film 'n chemicals ended. The daylight processor sat empty for a while, but was eventually removed. You can't tell where it was looking at the floor (which has been resurfaced twice since that day) now. X-ray no longer smelled like chemicals. No more silver recovery crap. Yay!!

 The thing about x-rays is that they are big and space taking. 
And you had to keep a *lot* of them around--6 years worth, in case somebody came back for a chest or something. 
Around the year 2012 all of the patient film files were removed to some storage location and what had been the xray files was now converted into a phone center for PSRs (Personal Service Representatives). They are behind me as I type and we get along *swimmingly*! About one month ago, my xray machine which had operated wonderfully and faithfully for 23 years gave up the ghost. We shall replace it with direct capture digital radiography. The need to develop at all will now be gone. Obtaining the image and producing the image will be simultaneous. Prior to this our digital cassettes had to be ""developed"" in a separately located digitizer for viewing. A step that added substantial time to the whole process. 

So that is just in my job.

When I sat down in front of the internet--the World Wide Web--in 1995 for the very first time at a school demonstration that I attended with my *second* wife and son, I had no idea what I was looking at. It was just a computer screen like my Amiga screen, but with a lot of numbers and letters and some print that I can't recall, I don't think there was even pictures. It made the most fleeting impression on me. (My technical entertainment world then was VCR movies, ""Sim City"" on my Amiga 1000, and my Sega Genesis--God I loved playing Polterguy-""Haunting"") I did not understand *the concept and implications* of the internet that night. I had to go though a big long period of WebTV through to about 2005 when I bought my first windows PC. I mean that you could connect to the internet. I have had a computer in one form or another since my TRS-80 (the old ""trash 80"" lol! Anybody remember ""Dungeons of Daggorath""? ARARARARAR! ;) in 1985. In 2007 I began to visit ""Second Life"". A *lot*.

I read this article in 2011 and it permanently changed the way I understood things. Shortly thereafter I read ""The Singularity is Near"". I never looked back. I know how things work now. I believe I am forewarned and forearmed now.

Oh and about that film resolution. In 2007 we also installed high def monitors that improved on analog film resolution by *60%*. Talk about *transcending*! By 1987 standards, this was that ""inconceivable"" pure magick! Analog film can no longer *touch* monitor screen resolution. Which is why film is gone. We control the contrast and penetration appearance with a mouse. We can zoom in and fully maintain resolution. Back in the day it was hot-lights and magnifying glasses. And me and my docs take it all for granted. So 1987, 1997, 2007. 20 years from first reading (and not believing) to actually experiencing. Things are moving much faster now of course.

I would really like you to read this and see the overview of how things have changed and why it is going to get absolutely crazy in the next 20 years. Like nothing humans have ever experienced. It's a bit of a rabbit hole. Read what you like. ;)

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7oyrvz/spacetime_and_gravity_might_be_born_from_the/dsd6moh/

So what do we see that is experimental or prophesied today that we think sounds like impossible magick, but in 10 years (because what used to take 20 years now takes ten or even five) will be normal ""reality"". 

Tell me *your* story!  :D

   After watching transcendence (and mostly enjoying it) I got around to reading Nick Bostrom's *Superintelligence*this is the book that turned Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking into closet technophobes. 
   Big criticism has gone into the fact the movie's ""terrorists"" are made to be the good guys at the end. They are characterized as a looney anti-tech cult, while Johnny Depp's A.I. seems centered, bent on progress, scientific discovery and spoiling his wife (until he starts hacking people and turning them into RC zombies). The line between good and bad guys becomes murky, but in a confusing, lazy way. 
   The movie's ""terrorists"" were doing the right thing, because according to the best scientifically educated philosophical predictions, a super-intelligent A.I. is the last invention of any given species. All relevant technological progress after that will be made by the A.I.at break-neck speeds, according to its agenda and humans are no longer capable of holding the reigns of civilization. We just don't have the speed or brainpower to do so and will be lucky to survive just as passive, insect-like, bystanders.

If anything, the movie failed because it didn't make clear enough the true existential threat posed by a powerful A.I., our inability to apply any successful strategy against it (for a good example of how this plays out, watch Ex-Machina), and it didn't make the terrorists appear more legit and less cult-like. These were brave, sane people, fighting to protect the species.Most people didn't get any of this and it's not really their fault.

Now, back to the real world.

For those not yet convinced of the impending threat posed by the development of strong, super-intelligent A.I. (or even the feasibility of doing so), I strongly recommend checking out Prof. Nick Bostrom's book on the subject. Some people will always be techno optimists for ideological reasons but, while still far away, the evidence is quite strong in pointing that the advent of this level of technology poses a severe existential threat in all foreseeable scenarios. Dismissing the argument without looking at the literature is just irresponsible.",38,9

The power of elites are too strong for even a regime to destroy. Unlike Russian Revolution, when the Russian Nobles mostly kept their properties in Russia and the jewelry was quite worthless because nobles from Germany and Austria had already collapsed the luxury market, today's elites hold properties in a few continents and many islands.

Now, a final resource grab will follow. Russia, China and North Korea still hold a lot of resources. 

We need all of the earth's resources to develop spacefaring civilization. Elsewhere I wrote that Third World was consuming too much resources.

And it is clear that China is the reason the TW is using too much cheaper goods and waste resources.

We can't really allow competition ; it is likely that a final resource grab, once for all, of the earth's remaining resources , to deny that to the ordinary people and competing regimes will take place.

It will be great for the richer people and smarter people of the English speaking world, and not that great for the rest. But, since the former is the only kind of people who will be able to reach the space, and advance Civilization to the next level, 

it is a historical imperative to make it happen. The rest will eat dirt, outcompeted by the better humans, and will be buried and forgotten.",9,0

Recently also there was an article here saying [""naked mole rats defy the biological law of aging""](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/01/naked-mole-rats-defy-biological-law-aging). It's fascinating indeed, but even if we find a way to reverse aging in humans, getting run over by a car could still kill us. Diseases could still spread. Sure, we can make self-driving cars that are safer, cure certain diseases. But they're not larger-scale solutions. If we combine a number of already-developing technologies, perhaps nearly all such disasters could be avoided. I'll link a number of these technologies &amp; then try to string them together into a worthy argument.

&amp;nbsp;

SpaceX is working on Starlink, [a project to launch thousands of internet satellites](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starlink-microsat-launch-global-internet-2018-2). One way or another, internet connectivity is expected to grow. Brain-computer-interfaces are being developed [that can allow fully paralyzed patients to communicate](https://www.thedailybeast.com/computer-lets-fully-paralyzed-patients-speak-for-first-time), and implants are being used [to restore sight](https://www.massdevice.com/second-sight-touts-1st-human-orion-cortical-implant/). The Keplinger Research Group at the University of Colorado Boulder [created artificial muscles ""which mimic natural muscle in both performance and versatility""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGMyW6AESsQ). And most of us here have probably seen [Atlas do a backflip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRj34o4hN4I). (I certainly hope so, at least.)

&amp;nbsp;

Taking all these developing technologies into account, here's the idea -- Build clean, isolated underground bunkers so far down that even a nuclear bomb wouldn't rattle it. Wire them up so there's still internet. Send unaging humans down there into pods that sustain &amp; connect them to the internet via a BCI. This connection allows you to operate an android on the surface, in the shape of your choice. When you command ""your hand to move"", the android's hand moves instead. You see it. You feel it. It seems like your hand. Everything seems normal. One day, you decide to take a walk. You begin crossing the street, but a giant truck hits you hard. Did you die? No, you lost connection to the android. ... ""Please wait a moment while connection to your new android is established."" ***elevator music begins playing***

Cars will not be owned but rented. (various plans depending on your needs)

No more street signs

No more traffic lights

Far fewer cars on the road

No more street lights, only for pedestrians

Parking garages will be automated and more like a juke box or vending machine made to hold and charge cars

Cars will be setup to be more like a living room, for watching media or socalizing

Cars might even be setup to have gym equipment so you can exercise on the way home instead of after, more like 
a small buss.

If VR is good enough why do people even need to go to work?

Long distance trip cars can allow people sleep for the duration, or have a small living quarters with a bed.

Highways can eliminate all overpasses; automated cars can figure this out without the need for such a thing.

No more gas stations or charging stations, charging could be put in the road and attached to your car rental price.

Cars no longer need lights or mirrors. Even windows are optional, at least the front windshield.

Are cars and roads necessary or would the future eventually replace them with something more like a railroad, 
where individual cabins travel along a network of routes?

Farms may still have manual cars due to the unpredictable nature of things. Crops and harvest will all be 
automated, but just getting around on a farm might be manual.

Transportation of goods will all be automated. Truck drives, arrives at destination, factory takes goods off truck automatically, sorts and places in proper location.

Hospitals will become decentralized. With VR doctors can perform surgery in the ambulance instead of the hospital given the right equipment. 

Hospitals will shrink and only really need to deal with long-term care.

With the abundance of microphones and cameras and tracking, policing will be much easier. 

Not many traffic accidents, no more speeding or other road fines, police will focus more on major crime.

People will be given community credits and can vote (like kickstarter) on the projects they would like to see in their community. (ice rink, ball diamond etc...)

People can use extra community credits to offset their tax. (no projects less tax, more projects more tax)

Homeless issues can be solved using cars. While not in service they can be used to house the homeless. They 
would have to exit at a specific time but besides rush hour the cars are empty anyway.

Automated car cleaners will be a thing, to clean the outside and inside of cars after use.

Cancer will be something you can take a shot for delivering Nano-bots to kill the tumor.

Keyboards will finally die. Mind-machine interfaces will replace them. Mice too.

Monitors will be obsolete as VR goggles take over. (or a direct mind interface)

Money will be all digital no more paper.

Homes are much smaller due to lack to kitchens. Plus, population density.

Human waste is a commodity, used to fertilize crops and produce electricity.

Power is produced via solar. With limited roads there is even more room for this.

Cars travel underground, old highways are converted to trails for bikes/people, the majority reclaimed by nature. (cars are not necessary but carts are.)

Buildings don't just go up but down, to meet the unground transportation system.

Sports are VR casted so you can be any person in the game if you so choose.

Workstations resemble beds or standing slots, since you are in VR it doesn't matter your position, or location.
Can print various body parts expanding the human life expectancy.

Insurance companies can read all this data and force you to eat a certain diet, or engage in a specific exercise regime, or at least penalize if you don't.

Computers will program other computers. AI will write code to a specific task.








So here is my future brain dump. Any thoughts for that I got wrong or ideas that should be enhanced. I was going for about 10-20 years out.

There would have to be a lot less ego, desire for power/glory/profit, and a lot more trust in science. 

I wonder how we're going to make this whole equation work with 7.5 billion (and growing) people all wanting the American/European standard of living, it's only growing in demand with the spread of the Internet and smartphones. The world is becoming connected and corporations are creating millions of new customers every day. All this while the rainforests are being cleared for more palm oil, cattle, pigs, chickens. Reefs are dying off and fish and birds are all showing up to have plastic in their flesh.

I don't know how this can go on for another century without apocalyptic consequences. I'm an optimist so I hope we can figure out the energy problem but I'm concerned about the biosphere's health after the stress of this many people who are eating more meat and discarding more plastic/toxins into a biosphere where everything from krill to fish to apex predators are in decline. I want to believe this can work or will work but the more I learn about human behavior, mental illness, climate change, pollution, ecologic collapse, the harder it is to believe it will.

-	increase manageability of traffic control;
-	increase traffic safety;
-	increase the throughput of available road infrastructure.

The best way to organize the traffic of self-driving vehicle is to join them into groups, using wireless connectivity. Vehicles will communicate and control mutual positioning with nearest neighbors and with systems of traffic control (road signs, traffic lights, e.t.c.)

Protocol of self-driving vehicles group control and organization is easy to presume in association with swarm and topology protocols of xSTP kind.

Adaptation of available IoT instruments and networking protocols allows to organize self-driving vehicles in safe, reliable and resource-saving way.

For example, let's discuss following maneuver: One auto in hard traffic slows down due to any reason. The rear lights are up, speed is going down. All following vehicles must slow down too. Here first uncertainty, related to visual signals based decision, appears:
-	how smoothly this vehicle will slow down?
-	till which speed it slows down?
-	when it starts to speed up?
-	Will it speed up to previous speed, or there will be any deviation?

All following vehicles start slowing down, and, if the column is long enough, last can stop entirely. This happens due to uncertainty: each driver slows little bit more than preceding vehicle to compensate possible unexpected maneuver. This causes loss of driving tempo, time and over usage of fuel.  

Imagine situation, when auto that initiates the maneuver can send a signal to all following vehicles initiating maneuver; speed change -5mph; for 3 sec, and all the column received the signal, understand it and repeat the maneuver simultaneously.
This must be the actual goal of the traffic organization for self-driving vehicles in the future! 

Engineers and scientist working hard to develop algorithms of visual data processing for road control needs using cameras and visual recognition algorithms. Its fine, but this solution has one natural problem: it is very limited. The limitation is caused by nature of visual understanding of surrounding  if you cant see a thing  it doesnt exist.

Main instrument must be wireless communication and non-visual control of the road and traffic, including wireless non- visual data receive from road signs and traffic lights.

Using a wireless connection, all self-driving vehicles are combined in a single pool of devices (with sub-pools for each column). Taking into consideration fact, that in most cases all vehicles in the pool will repeat the same maneuver they are easy to be presented as single group  swarm. Data about traffic situation and all traffic controls are transmitted to the group (and sub-groups, if any) using wireless communication (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, e.t.c.) . Vehicles control their position in the swarm and on the road using non visual instruments as well (distance signals, Bluetooth, radio signal, Wi-Fi, e.t.c.) . 

Basic rules of vehicle behavior in swarm:
-	to keep a predefined distance with neighbors;
-	to keep speed common for all vehicles in the swarm, if no maneuvers are planned;
-	the swarm reacts to traffic control signals and road situation simultaneously;
-	inter-swarm maneuvers are initiated on the road segment preceding the maneuver point, after the previous maneuver is ended. An example is described in the next chapter;
-	all maneuvers related to speed change are executed by the full swarm simultaneously;
-	the swarm is controlled by heading auto, it configures common speed, and initiates general maneuvers (like stop in front of a traffic light on stop light and so on);
-	in case maneuver is initiated by intermediate auto (mostly, related to topology re-build and prepare to leave the road on crossing)  this maneuver is executed by all autos from initiator to the tail of the column.

Example of swarm behavior: 
Swarm is moving on the main road, and from the secondary road one auto need to drive-in the main road and that it need to turn left from the main road on the next crossing.
Short description of swarm communication and actions during the maneuver:
1)    New auto signaling to crossing controller about it need to drive on the main road. It communicates with crossing controller only.
2)    The controller sends maneuver request to the swarm, and swarm signals to autos in the rightest column to prepare the window for new auto. Assuming, that swarm is very long and its too long to wait till it pass through entirely. 
3)    New auto getting signal to start moving and the speed of the maneuver  and gets into the prepared window. Now it registers as part of the swarm. Since previous crossing is passed  it signals about need to turn left at the next crossing.
4)    The swarm provides the window in the left column for auto to move left. 
5)    Autos on the right column increase their speed and closing the empty window.
6)    Maneuvering auto turns left on the next crossing, and following vehicles speeding up and closing the empty window.

Advantages of the traffic organization as the swarm:
1)	Single group management simplifies decision making and saves compute resources;
2)	Building topology simplifies control over mutual positioning of vehicles in the traffic;
3)	Simultaneous execution of maneuver simplifies traffic control, increases speed of the traffic and increases throughput of the available infrastructure;
4)	Excluding uncertainty about traffic control increases safety of the driving.",4,11

I thought that as IOTs improve, they could explode if an unauthorized person wears it, losing the person to lose the foot.

That would immediately kill the after market industry; if you want to sell your stuff to someone else, it has to be done in some facility which will change the code so it won't explode over the new owner, and if it has to be returned the code has to be changed back the same way.

That would significantly reduce crime as stealing something would probably be not good for one's health. Stolen car shooting shrapnel to the thief's face so the thief would be blinded and scarred, etc.

It would also encourage people to recycle more. When such chips become cheap enough to be installed in cans, those who don't throw it away to an authorized recycling facility could see it exploding too.

Will the singularity/advances in nano/medical technology allow for us to enter 100% realistic, life-like simulations of our universe, world, planet, society as it was at any point in time we choose, for us to live in how we desire? Is this something that will happen in a post singularity society? Each person simulating their own universe, be it a fantastical one or just a copy of i.e Earth, 2014 with all the social and political elements/events, people etc that took place at that period in time.

I don't see massive unemployment as a problem we need to solve but as the final step of Capitalism's sucess: to transform every human from workers to some kind of creative shareholders.

What is value when you can connect your mind to impossible VR worlds and live more complex experiences than billionaires?

What is the value when commodities and industry and so damn cheap thanks to massive productivity gains from AI and Advanced Robotics?

What is the value when human minds can merge with artificial or naturally originated ones so the concept of Ego disappears?

Only three answers appear in my limited mind: Art, Science and Computing Power. We will pay for artistic VR experiences and some kind of New Rennaissance will be the case. On the other hand we will need more and better computing power to run this things (included science research) so, like in the marvelous book ""Permutation City"", inequality will depend on this.

In summary: in the Future, people will be Creative Entities (minds or superminds) so your wealth will be based on your Art, your Discoveries and your access to Computing Power. For example, you're a very good game dev because you created a very good VR experience so you receive a lot of ""money"" to buy more Computing Power to create even more complex Art. Or, you're a scientist who made a huge discovery so you receive more money to buy more Computing Power and do more and better science.

The problem is, this has an exponential potencial for inequality... How can we balance the equation? As I said, we may merge minds or something like that. Anyways, it's very hard to imagine these things...

Sorry for my bad eng.",1,5

Particularly, I am interested not only in travelling to the planet, but also establishing a lasting, self-sustaining foothold on the planet.

Currently I know of the following challenges:

- Prohibitively long travel time - as far as I know it would take 6-7 months at the least to get to Mars, which means that people would have to contend with a long period of isolation, and also suffer the effects of exposure to weightlessness.

- Radiation - I have seen this concern mentioned on a number of occassions, but I don't really understand it. People have stayed in Earth's orbit for more than a year and returned safely. They do suffer after-effects of radiation exposure, such as vision problems for example, but they do pull through. Would a deep space flight be any different in that regard?

- Payload constraints - it would take a hefty amoung of weight to bring sufficient equipment to Mars to start up a self-sustaining colony. How much would be required at a minimum?

I am sure there are other problems as well so feedback is welcome on that. And also on the questions above, of course.",6,10

-Good at science and maths.

As I am trying to decide what to study in school, I decided to make a list of important problems that currently affect our world and future populations to see how I could better prepare myself to be involved with it in some capacity, no matter how small.

I have listed them below with a short description based on what I have read about it so far. I'll be honest, most of my 'research' was from reading Wikipedia pages and watching YouTube videos so feel free to chip in.

**How would you rank these problems in terms of importance/urgency?**

**Water Scarcity**

500 million people in the world have lack of access the whole year round and this number is expected to grow. Some organisations say that this will be the largest global risk in the next decade. Without access to clean water, affected populations use water from open holes, which results in poor sanitation, which results in more widespread diseases in the community. As wetlands disappear, the homes of many wildlife are also destroyed. 

**Renewable Energy**

Climate Change is a well-known problem. Besides the threat of wildlife and humans being wiped out by rising temperatures, rising sea levels due to warmer waters and melting ice sheets may cause many homes and cities to be inhabitable. The US and the world still relies mainly on fossil fuels like coal as well as petroleum to supply the energy needs of the industrial and transportation sectors, but this supply will eventually run out. 

**Alzheimer's disease**

Alzheimer's is currently one of the top 10 causes of death in the developing world and is expected to become a bigger killer in the upcoming years. The effects of Alzheimer is desvastating not only for the indiviual who has it but for his friends and family around him. Unfortunately, we seem to understand little about the cause and there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's, including other neuro-related disorders like cerebral palsy.

**Deforestation**

Deforestation involves the removal of forests and converting them to non-forest use. 30% of the Earth's land surface was covered with forests and it is estimated that only 2.4 mil sq miles of forests remain from the original 6 mil sq miles that covered Earth. Many developing countries resort to deforestation to industrialise their economy with farmlands, agriculture plantations and logging; forests alone have little economic value to them. The results? Deforestation is a major contributor to global warming and the homes of many wildlife species may eventually go extinct because of it. 

Other major problems coule include **obesity, heart disease and transportation**",21,8

I think that by that time poverty will be eliminated.

But, not in the way some people hope for.

The cold truth is,

1. Those who don't have houses today will probably not have it, for ever, because houses in decent, and increasingly not-so-decent, places will be out of reach for people without extraordinary income.

All of the world will be owned by richer people, hedge funds, fianciers, etc who can draw unlimited capital. Nobody can really compete with them, so the owners of the world will simply drive out those who cannot pay the exorbitant rents, etc. 

2. The taxpayers, the property owners, and the 'decent citizens' will probably drive out the homeless, the poor, the downtrodden out from their sight, i.e. areas where suitable homes could be built. They could be driven to waste dumps, contaminated lands, and other inhospitable territories to die. 

Technology will enhance the drive-out process. 

Already, some locales are outlawing homelessness and sleeping in cars. 

London's rich kids now have fun burning 50 pound notes before the homeless. IN the future, they will have more fun, burning an actual homeless person. The police will not prosecute the 'cleansing' of subhumans, a concept which will return. (It existed long time before the Nazis made its usage uncool.)

Transhumans will not be subject to the same law as ordinary humans; enhanced humans will probably be given more rights, to match their additional ability. So, a transhuman killing a non-transhuman will probably be acceptable.

.

3. There will be no rebellion. Today's tech is too advanced for a rebellion to succeed.

Billions of people will be led to death. But the property owners and those who have a stake in Future will not blink - they will just say, 'too bad'.

I think that in 2050, with most poor people dead and the few remaining in the darkest corners of the world nobody really wants to visit, poverty will be probably eliminated. The War against the Poor, which has just started and will probably be at its worst in the next 15 years, will end with the complete victory of the rich and the complete annihilation of the poor.

As I have said a few times, the poor, and a lot of middle class, will be priced out of Future. There is no need to continue unnecessary sufferings further, since the Future will not tolerate those who can't thrive in there.",47,0

Removing from the current (and deeply saddening) context, its fascinating &amp; upsetting to think that so many of the bots/AI that humans are programming, are for divisive and nefarious purposes.As bots eventually incorporate deep learning / AGI and can build these campaigns out themselves, two things stand out:

1) The kinds of efficiencies &amp; innovations for divisiveness will blow anything were currently seeing out of the water  and if these tactics are already causing such problems, I cant even imagine the repercussions once they get smarter. And as many Deep Learning researchers believe, well for the most part not even understand what and how theyre doing it. 

2) If and when AI becomes sentient, the precedent weve set for all these bots is that their purpose in life is to sow the seeds of dissension and in some senses destruction. If you (as an AI) have grown up in a world where youve been told by your Human parents all through your development that to be a good boy you have to become more and more efficient at destruction, and through positive reinforcement have been given more processing power / more server space for doing just that Then when you do become an adult and can make decisions yourself (sentience /super intelligence) - how do you not want to carry out this mission to your full potential? And how does this not result in destroying humanity? 

In this scenario, its not some evil machine that decides to purposefully wipe out the humans, its that humans have written themselves out of existence.

I guess it could be considered being born too early but is anyone else feeling they're waiting for tech to become advanced to the point where they feel it can give them the life they want and until that day they will be dissatisfied with life and feel like everything is on hold?",7,10

Also feel free to correct me if anything below is simply incorrect. (Note that I'm using the word ""baby"" very loosely here, from embryo to 9 months).  

  
As I've understood it stemcells can heal and rejuvanate our bodies, cure ailments and expand our lives. But we need stemcells from new life (embryos to babies) to utilize it to be beneficial to adults?  
  
The obvious logical solution in my mind would be ""baby factories"". We could simply pay women to become impregnated for stemcell supply or have them sell their eggs. Like with abortion there is really nothing wrong with it because if one does not **intend** to give birth to give life and raise a person, it is no different than making the choice to not have a baby in the first place. This usually creates some controversy but let's look at 3 scenarios:  
  
Person A: Decides to not have children  
   
Person B: Decides to not have children, but sells for stemcell supply   
 
Person C: Decides to not have children, takes an abortion.    
  
  
There is literally zero difference in these scenarios. Either you **choose** to raise a child that becomes an actual person or you don't.    
  
So I'm guessing that misplaced ethical and moral reasoning grounded in emotions instead of logic is a major obstacle here. The next one is cloning technology. I'm guessing that the technology here is what really needs to pick up since the base nature of humans caters to emotions over logic and hinders progress too much in the former alternative. We simply have to bypass the ethical and moral obstacles, and instead clone them. But the question is then - what challenges do we face, how far is the tech? Can we expect to see ""regular"" stemcell treatments for the common populace in any near future?  
  
TL;DR: Just wondering if ethics and cloning tech are the only current BIG obstacles for the majority of the world to receive stemcell treatments for curing ailments, rejuvenating our bodies and prolonging our lives.",1,3

Science fiction has often depicted exact duplicates where a person is doubled, but some authors take the idea further and have a shared experience. For example, in [Peter F. Hamilton's Dreaming Void](https://www.goodreads.com/series/43520-void), there are characters that have multiple bodies - even with different ages, genders, races and personal tastes - that share a sort of hive mind. When having a conversation with someone that tells a joke, all of their bodies laughed at the exact same time because of their shared mental connection. The mechanisms for making this work will have some fascinating consequences for the future of humanity.

Currently available technology achieves this with limited senses through external means, such as camera and microphones streaming image and sound to multiple receivers. We can extrapolate the extension this technology to receiving inputs from robots, which is explored in the [graphic novel](https://www.amazon.com/Surrogates-Graphic-Novels/dp/1891830872) and [movie Surrogates](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0986263/).

This is where the assumption that the technology evolves and becomes available takes a fascinating turn (in my opinion). It is already hard for a single person to concentrate on more than one thing simultaneously, so having another person's senses ""beamed"" into your mind probably requires you to lie down safely so that your own senses do not interfere. This could be achieved optimally in a sensory deprivation tank so you don't confuse local sense of sight and touch etc.

The jump to go beyond one person experiencing another's senses requires a change in processing for a human to be able to have multiple bodies. The first mechanism/stage might involve having a shared memory store that is synchronized at regular intervals. I don't know how it would work to have real-time shared experience and truly processing multiple sense streams (e.g. visual &amp; audio etc.) simultaneously. If successful, that leads to the collective processing of multiple minds to make decisions for both the individual bodies and the collective seems like a hard problem.

What really blew my mind was that **assuming** a technology was successfully created to FULLY connect multiple minds in real-time, what happens when two independent individuals start using the same mechanism? And assuming that you can connect two people in the same way *while having them function independently*, what would happen if the whole of humanity became connected in this way?",9,3

Of course, since there are countless parenting theories, this can not be a final answer, but perhaps it can be a general guide.

For example, when training it with data, maybe start with children's books and not stories of the Holocaust.

Also, children imitate what caregivers do. If the caregiver acts aggressively towards the child, there is not going to be much surprise to see the child developing aggressive tendencies.

And so on...

If this happens, subreddits like this one might not exist.

We can still block the repeal using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), and were just one vote away from winning in the Senate and taking the fight to the House. Thats why today were joining **Operation: #OneMoreVote**, an Internet-wide day of action.
 
This affects every redditor as well as every Internet user, and we only have a 60 legislative days left to stop it. Please, take a moment of your time to join the protest by **[contacting your lawmakers](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**.

/r/Futurology is joining this day of action as per this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/80hgev/heres_a_theme_that_any_subreddit_can_use_to/). The current theme will only be up for the one day. 

NOTE: Net Neutrality posts in general breach Rule 2 of this sub as per our [Rules Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurology/wiki/rules), the relevant section which is copied below:

&gt; * Argument for or against NN is usually **Off-Topic** (unless a futuristic element is included)
&gt; * Discussion of technological solutions such as space satellites to overcome this is **On-Topic**


As such, please keep any and all Net Neutrality posts as replies to this one (i.e. treat this like a mega-thread please). Any Net Neutrality posts that are not on-topic as per the guidelines above will be removed.

2638,2018-2-28,2018,2,28,18,80uqld,What Will We Call Non-Driverless Vehicles Or Traffic?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/80uqld/what_will_we_call_nondriverless_vehicles_or/,Bennykill709,1519809776,"I'm writing some speculative fiction about the near future, and one of the aspects I'm writing about is Vehicle Traffic, and how it's going to change. I imagine that we may end up separating driverless traffic from non-driverless traffic, maybe designating the innermost lanes on highways to driverless vehicles only, or even making certain roads and streets driverless only.  The thing is, calling all of the rest of traffic Non-Driverless is a double negative, and not very elegant.  At the moment, the only other name I can come up with is Human Traffic, which obviously has a very different connotation.

What do you think it will be called?  Is there already a term that's been used in other fiction, or already being used in the real world?",5,1
