Personally I'm very into crypto-currency right now such as Bitcoin and Litecoin and see that as the next logical step forward for economics from our current fiat system where money printing is becoming an issue.

That being said I also believe that with progression in automation jobs will begin disappearing in 10-20 years from now which means that any form of ""money"" might not work.

So my thinking is..

We are about to enter a transition away from fiat based money and as a result away from governments/taxation towards a more voluntary charity based society using crypto-currencies. We will be fully using crypto-currencies (in some form be it Bitcoin or something else) fully from around 2025-2050. At this point the leap in technology means that there will probably be human being on the planet working more than 1 day a week.. I know that the singularity is due before 2050, but i figure it'll take a few years before we feel the full impact of that.

After this point computers are effectively in control and I believe a more socialist system whereby currency doesn't exist at all comes into effect and where everyone is looked after by the ""state"" which will effectively just be the computer network.


Really interested to see what everyone else thinks will happen to the monetary system over the same time-period.",60,22,False,self,,,,,

* [New SUBREDDIT](/r/nucleus)
* [**GITHUB PAGE**](https://github.com/Futurology)
* [**FULL PROPOSAL**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/wiki/nucleusproposal)

As a community, we've been ruminating on some sort of direct action to take for improving the world and making our desired futures come into fruition. We've had countless posts criticizing the inadequacies of governments, the venting our frustration on the ever expanding futility of ""Labor"" in an ever automating world. Yet, even projects as grandeiose as the Venus Project still don't build anything resembling a transitionary plan. Society can't change over night, we need to have information infrastructure that can absorb disruptive change in a positive manner. Let's do this through intelligent software using tools available today! As today is Labor Day, I thought it would be appropriate to announce my idea to you, /r/Futurology, we are the the ""Society of the Future.""

In February, [I surveyed our community](http://www.iontom.com/files/QUIZfuturology.jpg) to take suggestions on sub-reddit content, but also let people volunteer some demographic information. We have a lot of technically enabled users, so I am absolutely confident we could produce some great things together! What I also did notice was a schism in political beliefs. There are the Libertarian/AnCaps on the right, and the Semi-Marxist/UBI folks on the left. Most of us fall somewhere in between but everyone imagines a better world through technology. The main difference between us is the the treatment of concepts in welfare, but I think most of the leftists on here are only so adamant about the future of ""welfare"" because we see *HUMAN* labor value as a product of diminishing returns.

However, we should discard labels. The one common thread we share is the need for enablement. We are awash with dreamers, people motivated to change things, but often lack the available resource to make happen what we desire. We all concede that the best future of ""Labor"" is one where it becomes individualized, custom to your interests, fun and rewarding. This can be done through creative tools for self-management of interdependent projects. Imagine Palantir but optimized towards visualizing collaborative efforts online instead of managing top-down surveillance programs.

More than that, it could interface with existing web services and function as a **Nuclear** web-self... An atomized version of you which can create ""molecular bonds"" with other people and organizations. In such a way we could make independent work become more feasible. High risk, high reward projects would require much less static assets, and thus are much more likely.

Then we connect those projects to an abundance of funding options. It would become a world where temporary employment is the norm (but with good compensation), and career advancement means reputation building among peers that you choose instead of a company that chooses them for you.

So I made a [Futurology Git](https://github.com/Futurology) page to get us started! There's a lot of considerations we need to tak into account. Which API's can be integrated into our nuclear hub? How should we design a web-responsive, drag-n-drop, self-management project and asset tracking system? I started this design back in February before getting side-tracked with /r/Simulate, but we need to start designing this together!

**INITIAL MOCKUPS**

* [A News, Mail and Social Blotter Hub](http://iontom.com/nucleus/SimUI_mach01.jpg)
* [A Collaborative Drawing Tool](http://iontom.com/nucleus/SimUI_mach01_artApp.jpg)
* [Project Canvas](http://iontom.com/nucleus/SimUI_mach01_firstExample.jpg)
* [Early Redesign of Side GUI](http://iontom.com/nucleus/NUCLEUS.jpg)


**TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS**

* Technology platforms (*which stack? probably an existing set of JS libs*)
* Web server subject knowledge (*Apache, .NET, Django, Flask, Node, Rails, multiple?*)
* Languages (JS, Python, PHP, C++, C#,)
* Database types desired (*SQL--postgres, MySQL, T-SQL*, **OR** *NoSQL: MongoDB, riak, Hadoop*) There will be multiple.
* Hosting solutions (*Cloud VPS and cost to scale* as discussed above.)


**INTEGRATION CONSIDERATIONS**

* **Which APIs and web applications should be integrated first?** 
* Identity Applications: (*Facebook, Google, LinkedIn*) OAuth
* Resource &amp; Community: (*Reddit, G+ hangouts, StackOverflow*)
* Hosting Solutions for Users (AWS, GCC, Azure, Heroku, etc, but we initialize by proxy)
* Tools, Builders, IDEs: (Cloud9, pixlr, 3Dtin, we must build some new tools or borrow O.C. ones) 
* Finance &amp; Accounts: (Bitcoin, Paypal, Amazon, Google wallet)
* Integrated crowd-funding/financing: (Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, Selfstarter)
* Streaming Content (Youtube, Vimeo, Steam, Our own WebGL game platform?)
* Blogs &amp; Forums (Wordpress, Blogger, Tumblr, phpBB, we should try to escape PHP and go full responsive though)
* Ad Hoc Manufacture &amp; Office Space (Shapeways, Regus, etc) 
* Education (Codecademy, Khan, Udacity, Treehouse, etc)


**ORGANIZATIONAL CONSIDERATION**

* Avaible talent for initial progress (O.C. Contributors, Raise capital for FT work, vested)
* Legal expertise (Someone who understands internet based contracting)
* Tax specialists (To use aggregate microcontracts to employ everyone needs some big considerations with tax)
* Patent system streamlining (Automated patronage and troll-protection)
* Economists and Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency Specialists

**FULL PROPOSAL**

This post is actually not the full proposal. The actual proposal is well over 10,000 characters and didn't fit into a self post. It also was too long to capture the attention of most readers. However, if you are truly interested in this project and want to see the entire thought process that has gone into this project statement, it is available for you, both as a wiki page (editable), and on my blog (embedded content).

Let's celebrate Labor Day by launching an effort make ""work"" more meaningful and individualized! I hope I set some ideas off for you guys, **cheers to our future!**

**tl;dr** Let's make a futurology-focused web application that consolidates existing services, promotes collaboration, and enables people to earn income working on the projects they enjoy!

**EDIT**: I just found out about Koding, this site is awesome and has many of the features I have in mind... But not all. I'm thinking more general purpose Web-based OS than a dev tool with limited library features.

So I'm newish to Futurology and thought this might be a great place to get others thoughts on this. With all the talk in the news about 3D printers in space, nano/self building, and Asteroid mining I'm wondering what really is the feasibility/chance of humanity actually building a ring world before long?

IMO logically it would be a simple first choice after we start mining asteroid, reasoning is mining isn't 100% efficient so there is bound to be waste/byproducts from the mining process and as we know something the size of a grain of sand can be dangerous in space so as a way to dispose/utilizes the waste of the mining process would be deposit it on a ring world.  (This is under the assumption we are not going to send it to pollute mars, the moon or burn up in the earths atmosphere.)  

Is something like this even possible?  I mean with the resources and automation coming don't we just need an architect and engineer to work out logistics... :) Stuff like atmosphere and artificial gravity can be worked out in the years it takes to build right?

So if possible lets start a Halo and use our resources to max potential i know it will take a long time to finish but why not?

His way of thinking was also a way I found incredibly inspired.  If we were all as intense as he is at following his passion, just imagine where the world would be!  Since graduating and studying on my own about things I've enjoyed thinking about, I've come up with [some radical economic theory that coincides with less radical group theory](http://www.joatu.com).  I feel **altruism** and **honesty** and **truth** are all linked.  The **more genuine** we are as people, the less we have to try and then we have **less stress**, which leads to more **human interactions**, leading to more **friends** and **community**.  And **sharing**.  And **helping each other out**.

So anyhow, here was that thought (and up above was written afterwards as my introduction and in it I came up with a way of describing that I have never thought about before.  I'm learning off myself at this point.  A live example of what we're talking about, neat!)

Can the world be saved with a better understanding of physics? I believe so.

Your understanding and perception create the visual world for you alone. This is not how the world truly is. You take a memory you have established and you hold it out in front of you like a photo and pretend that it is reality. So what you are seeing, what you are perceiving isn't real life, it is just your memory of real life. Your memory is not reality.

I would actually argue, at this point, it requires effort to remain ignorant about a subject.

At the moment our society considers lying worse than ignorance, but as ignorance becomes something one has to actively strive for, should we not soon begin treating ignorance on the same moral level as lying?

If you think about it, it's kind of insulting for someone with a smartphone in their pocket to pull a fact our of their ass when they could pull out the smart phone and source their claim.

Once we all have Google glass, or some equivalent, it will require even less effort.

Eventually we will likely have brain implants streaming facts to us during a conversation.

Interesting synchronous moments of novelty, you have to love them ;)

Wikipedia defines synchronicity as the experience of two or more events as meaningfully related, whereas they are unlikely to be causally related. I was thinking of what Duncan Trussell talks about on Joe Rogans podcast, and his own and other podcasts: http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/jre-279-duncan-trussell-brian-redban  (simulation theory at 46 minutes, and 1 hour, 23 minutes; synchronicity/novelty at 50 minutes)  

And the fact that S. James Gates found error correction computer codes in the equations of string theory: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp4NkItgf0E
 
http://www.onbeing.org/program/uncovering-codes-reality/1457/audio

Its like if you are reminded about someone you havent thought of in years, and then you run into them the next day; I suppose that would be synchronicity. Duncan describes it like the universe harmonizing complexity the way your body automatically heals itself when you cut your arm. The more you do what youre supposed to do, go with the flow, the more strange coincidences happen and hidden doors open. (David Seaman Hour! #124 on itunes, synchronicity/simulation theory as modern symbolism starts @ 28 minutes) He calls these instances of synchronicity ""novelty sparks"" that occur as youre working on improving your life, like hammering steel on an anvil. (http://www.nerdist.com/2012/03/you-made-it-weird-36-duncan-trussell/ @ 55 minutes)


 http://thedrunkentaoist.com/episodes/episode-21-duncan-trussell-and-net-indra (synchronicity and discipline starts @ 1 hour, 16 minutes)

Similarly, some people wonder when theres an impossible coincidence if this is all an elaborate computer game, and when we die well awaken hooked up to a virtual game console. I dont think I actually believe were in a computer simulation in the future, but its definitely possible and an interesting thought experiment, popularized by Nick Bostrom. Physicist Silas Beane describes the argument: 

New Scientist: The idea that we live in a simulation is just science fiction, isn't it?

Silas Beane: There is a famous argument that we probably do live in a simulation. The idea is that in future, humans will be able to simulate entire universes quite easily. And given the vastness of time ahead, the number of these simulations is likely to be huge. So if you ask the question: 'do we live in the one true reality or in one of the many simulations?', the answer, statistically speaking, is that we're more likely to be living in a simulation.

Humanity is in love with technology. Great things are happening and greater marvels are yet to come. However, this would pale in comparison to a culture that's 10,000 years more technologically advanced than we are. 

They would be visiting us, not the other way around. Humanity is not used to being the small kid on the block. In the history of this world, the first encounters between technologically advanced cultures with lesser ones are instructive. The less advanced cultures tend not to do so well. Would this be in store for humanity?

Would we quickly adapt and try to copy their technology, if we can? I'm thinking something along the lines of what the Chinese are doing now. Playing catch-up. There's a distinct possibility that even if we could figure out how their technology worked, we might not have the native resources required to build it. What then? 

If we trade for technology and resources, there's the very real risk that humanity might become dependent upon this foreign trade. Remember the oil embargo? Do we really want to put ourselves into that kind of position? 

For the sake of our freedom and sovereignty as a race, it would be best to cultivate our own native technologies and try our best to catch-up without relying on resources we cannot easily procure for ourselves. However, this might limit our technological progress. I'm afraid that we're so in love with technology that we simply would not be able to limit ourselves. Could humanity hold itself back from having the latest futuristic technology if it was in our interests to do so?

But that is not the case. Watson is better at playing Jeopardy than humans. This was was clearly shown when it defeated the top two Jeopardy players ever. But Watson isn't better at answering Jeopardy questions than humans, and I think a lot of people, and the media coverage about Watson, misses this point.

How is it possible that it can be better at playing Jeopardy, but not at answering Jeopardy questions? Because being good at answering the questions is only one of the three skills that are important in winning at Jeopardy. The other two are strategy (where to go on the board, how much to bet, etc.) and being fast on the buzzer. These two skills are really what let Watson win. Of course, you need a certain level of accuracy in answering the questions to win, no amount of strategy or buzzing speed is going to help you if you don't. But if someone is 80% accurate and can buzz in quicker than someone who's 90% accurate, then they're probably going to win.

If the 3 contestants had taken written tests comprised of the Jeopardy questions, I strongly believe Watson would have come in 3rd place. You can look at Ken Jennings and Brad Rutters past games and see what their accuracy is like. Then you can look at one of IBM's talks they've given about Watson and the technology behind it, where they give Watson's accuracy, and you can pretty clearly see that among Jeopardy champions, Watson is around the middle of that pack (see slide 41 [here](http://forum.stanford.edu/events/2012slides/plenary/2012plenaryDavidFerrucci.pdf)). Ken's accuracy in his games was about 92%, which at version 0.8 Watson could only buzz in on about 55% of the questions it was most confident in to be able to acheive that accuracy. That's probably not the final version that played, but I can't see it being massively better (and you can tell it wasn't by watching the game).

Is that impressive? Definitely. Is Watson an advancement in natural language processing, information retrieval, etc.? Yes. But Watson won primarily because it could beat Ken and Brad to the buzzer more often than not, which for a computer is basically a given. If you look at the current research in NLP and AI, Watson isn't a giant leap forward or a massive breakthrough, just another iterative step forward. ",28,13,False,self,,,,,

The countdown has begun and we have now way of knowing when the last second will tick off the clock. Humanity's survival currently relies on our planet's ability to house us.  All it will take is one catastrophic event.  Man made, natural or alien, when this event happens it will remove Earth's ability to support us, and humanity will be erased.  We have no choice but to do everything in our power to detach our species fate from the celestial body that birthed us.  In order to become an independent species we must establish the ability to live on other worlds.  We should be there already, we have the resources.  And yet, here we sit, with our heads in the sand.  We finally have the technology that allows us to communicate instantly with any corner of humanity.  We can have our best and brightest working together in every field.  Instead we work against each other to solve the same problems.  Patriotism and loyalty are found in every culture across humanity.  The difference is the scope in which we define these qualities, geographic location, skin color, family.  The scope of these qualities generally is decided very early in our lives and rarely changes.  Change is something that we as humans are not good at.  Change almost always begins with a dream, a dream of a equality, a better life, a voice.  I dream of a better humanity.  A humanity that can take its next great leap without destroying itself.    Our next great leap is to live on other worlds, other solar systems and other galaxies.  If we attempted that leap today it would undoubtedly destroy us.  We would fracture, we would grow apart and then we would destroy each other and earth fighting over the sacred planet that we came from.  Earth would become a metaphorical Jerusalem.  Humanity would step back hundreds of years into a secular clan like lifestyle where war between the sects is not only commonplace it is expected.  It is for this reason I am proud to say that my priorities lie first with humanity and then country and family follow behind.  I carry the human flag.  It is the only flag that we can all unite under.  It is what we all have in common.  No one can turn their back on this one simple fact, we are all human.  My generation is just barely becoming relevant on the world stage.  We are the first generation to have only known life that included internet.  We grew up interacting with each other across the globe.  Because of this we are a more accepting tolerant generation than any before us.  Having interacted with people around the world before the world could tell us what the rest of the world was like we realized that they were just as human as us regardless of where we are from what we look like or what religion we do or don't practice.  We must embrace this!  We must take it upon ourselves to use this generational phenomenon to unite all of humanity under the same flag.  We must make it be known to other generations around the world that we will not tolerate the divisiveness that plagues the world today.  I know our generation my generation can lead the charge, I grew up with them.  We have always been told that our generation will grow up to be useless, a burden to our parents generation until they die and at that point hopefully the generation behind us can take the reigns.  We have been called the wasted generation and the entitled generation.  I am proud to be one of us.  We are more human, we see each other has humans not Chinese, white or Islamic.  Together we can prepare humanity to take its next great leap.  It will take great leaders from across the world to get the older generations on board.  We must establish the basic rules of humanity that we are willing to take military action to protect that every one agrees upon such as every non convicted human that is not awaiting trial has the right to leave their country and no genocide.  We must consolidate our militaries to a single human military while each country may also have a military for self defense.  We must consolidate our state funded sciences such as our space programs and medical research so that we are working together on our toughest problems and not against each other.

Communism  and Socialism do not work (perfectly,  and some would say not at all).  A general reason for this is that workers will not perform to their full potential if they have no motivation to be the best and provide a better life for themselves/family. Workers in a planned economy (or ""command economy"" as I learned in junior high civics)  will make the same (often low) wage if they are the best or worst at their job.

Capitalism does not seem to work perfectly either (...and some would say not at all) because there is a constant struggle for businesses  to make a profit,  fairly compensate and protect employees, and pay percentage of their revenue (taxes) to a government that handles money inefficiently (for many of the same  problems as planned economies). 

Obviously most every country  has a mixture of the two economies, and the problems from both. Marx detailed how economies evolved from hunter gatherers to agriculture to capitalist to socialist to what he wrote about: communism... Maybe our next step will be techism or some other clever name.

 In my semi informed view, problems with the economic systems Marx described can be eliminated with the emergence of robotics and automated workers. I believe that when robots are programmed to do jobs for  ""for free""  and with the utmost efficiency, these problems will be solved. Because machines can simply be turned off after working hours they don't have the needs of human workers.

Advancements in AI and robotics  do not seem to be very far off technologically if you believe those like Ray Kurzweil, a man who predicted the advent of the Internet. These machines would allow people to spend their days as they wish instead of ""working"". We could be creating art, traveling, studying history, making scientific discoveries, playing music, sleeping, engineering newer and better robots that have less of a chance of killing us all ;), working out, bodybuilding, reading, writing, doing stand up comedy, dancing, partying, launching spaceships, exploring black holes and alternate universes, watching films, making films, curing diseases, solving world hunger, ending war, playing basketball, swimming and etc... 

But MOST importantly, and without this part none of the other things can happen, We must take time forming bonds with our kids, teaching them how to understand what is right, helping them discover what their passions are and discovering what they want to explore during their lives. This way future generations will have direction, and pass down the lessons they learned to their own kids for the betterment of humanity.

 We could spend time with our families and friends and make many new friends. We could spend our lives building relationships instead of products that we have to convince other people to buy. By building relationships with people we can give people compassion for their fellow man. We can avoid the pitfalls of capitalism through these relationships by  truly loving our fellow man. We can't love our fellow man/women if we view him/her as competition, and we cannot know him/her enough to love her/him if we only briefly encounter them after work for 20 minutes before we go home to watch TV and surf the internet. 

Compassion for our fellow humans, not just forced robot labor, is what will make our future beautiful. 

Thought experiment: Have you ever gone on a long (or short) vacation  with a group of people that you did not know previously? You toured a certain area, saw artwork, went out every night for dinner and drinks, shared experiences, had laughs (and maybe a few fights) with this group,  and by the end of the trip you felt like these people were some of your best friends. But then you all had to go our separate ways, and back to our jobs and desks so you can survive. 

Well imagine that this vacation didn't have to end and you could always keep up with this group, and you could introduce  all your new friends to your old friends and family, and they could do the same with you. And you could constantly have these trips and meet new people all the time!
If there really is only six degrees of separation between all people (which has got to have gone down since the 80s substantially because of the Internet) then we could have actual meaningful connections between humans who we previously didn't know. 

Instead of viewing a starving kid in Africa as an abstract notion, we could see him for ourselves and care enough to allow the kid and his family to enjoy the same lives we will (or might) have. The same idea can be said for war. The world will be so interconnected and accessible that bombing another country (if there still are countries) will be like bombing your neighbors back yard. 

In the future, i believe, most will say humanity enslaved itself through working some 40 (minimum) hours a week. Not maliciously but because we needed put food on our table, and we haven't yet developed the technology to do the work for us. 

 The only limiting factors would be how to evenly divide resources (how can we trust a government to do this and not screw it up, or favor one group over another?) Also, Earth will run out of resources eventually. At which point we must  exploit other planets and asteroids for their resources and this could be possible because of the greater focus on innovation that resulted from people not having to do menial jobs all day, moral implications of taking resources from other planets aside... 

One more factor that this theory is based on: that we will not consider the robots to be people... And what if one day the robots dont want to get turned off? Ever seen terminator? What if the machines develop a mind of their own and don't want to work for us anymore? Ever seen the Matrix? Lets make sure our automatons love their job....

This is an issue that could be resolved when robots become indistinguishable from humans. Humans  eventually having robotic components, and somewhere down the line we humans just have robot avatars cruising through the universe or our consciousness is uploaded into a robot after our physical body dies, giving humans the potential to make our lives endless... If we wanted them to be, which is another issue together. 

Who knows if any of this will happen. But I am starting to think it is inevitable, if we avoid nuclear war. Sorry for no sources or facts.",6,12,False,self,,,,,

This perspective has 2 points. One from a future economic stand point, the other from a philosophical stand point. With that being said, onward!

It occurred to me today that ever since the dawn Humans, the driving factor in technological breakthroughs has been to make tasks safer, shorter,more efficient and (most of all) EASIER. For example, the caveman once discovered that the wheel makes it much easier to transport that dead moose he just killed back to the group. Next thing you know we've got wagons for trade and chariots for war.

Fast forward to the Industrial revolution, fast forward to the USA's 1950s when home appliances were making it to every household. Fast forward to 2013. We now have robots capable of making almost anything we want, communications that can go around the world in a matter of seconds, and we are, and will continue, to make breakthroughs in medicine.

Point 1: Originally, the purpose of this post was to ask an economic question: Have world economies planned for this? With less and less physical work needing to be done there will be less and less job opportunities. Eventually, the ratio of workers to consumers is going to be so unbalanced that we might only need a fraction of the population to work to meet demand. Now I'm sure most of you are thinking ""There will always need to be jobs for the people who fix the machines that make our products."" While that is true, we only need one or two people for one machine that can pump out thousands of products in a day for the millions of people on earth. (Example would be be any product that is not needed to be purchased every day)

Point 2: My next point (which came along as I was typing my first) is more from a philosophical stand point. When will enough be enough? What is our goal when it comes to progressing as a species? It seems like we are heading toward a very sad future If we have no ""victory conditions""; a vicious cycle we create for ourselves. Some one tell me why it will be necessary to leave my house when everything I need is teleported to me? Want to hang out with friends? no problem hop in your teleporter. Need food? teleport it. Why hike when we can teleport.

Perhaps this is why we need religion, to keep us in check, to pull us on the reins....but now I digress.

TL;DR The advancement of Humans: When is enough enough? and are we ready for it?

203,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013-9-9,2013,9,9,4,1lzhom,self.Futurology,Lacking studies to support my predictions (economic),https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1lzhom/lacking_studies_to_support_my_predictions_economic/,mithrandirbooga,1378667784,"Hi there, I suppose I've been a futurologist for a couple of years now, but only discovered this subreddit a few days ago, so I wasn't even aware it was a thing.

Over the past couple of years I've been espousing my predictions for the future, and why **in my opinion** we need to begin transitioning to a socialist economy in the USA or we're in for some serious trouble. My two main points are that 3D printing is going to obliterate manufacturing and retail, and driverless cars are going to obliterate taxis/bus drivers/teamsters and so on. I've found many more examples on this reddit over the past few days, but these two technologies are, **in my opinion**, the most likely to make a major impact within the next 5-10 years.

My chief prediction is that our economy is in dire trouble. Whenever I point out the ever-increasing income disparity, conservative-leaning people never fail to point out that (paraphrasing) ""There's no problem with rich people owning nearly everything. That money will be spent on private planes and yachts, and we'll have a gigantic economy based on luxury travel vehicles, because all the poor people will build them and have jobs"". 

Well, besides being ridiculous, that's just not going to happen. I am convinced (**in my opinion**) that within my lifetime manual labour will be completely eliminated. In which case, we'll end up with a society where the rich will simply purchase expensive goods produced by other rich people who own all of the means of production, which are now automated, and noone except for the very few people it takes to run an automated factory will make any money anymore, leaving a massive destitute underclass. 

Another common counter argument I face is that my predictions of ""the end of work"" have been proposed since the very start of the industrial revolution. Every time an industry is eradicated, new ones pop up. And this actually is a valid argument... for the past. They are correct that each new technological advance did enable another layer of industry to be built upon that which was recently automated, but it is **my opinion** that we're rapidly running out of industries that can be built upon what we automated. I like to explain this effect using the music industry and the video game industry. My brother is a musician and he is currently arguing with other musicians who view him as a sellout because he sells his music for money. That's correct; there is so much overproduction in the music industry that most indie artists are now forced to give their music away for free because the supply is so high that the price has collapsed. Likewise, as a software developer into game programming, I've noticed that on any given app store for any platform, the vast majority of apps are indeed free, because there's simply so many of them, the supply has exploded and the price has collapsed. I'm also tangentially related to the tech book publishing industry and many computer programming tech books are becoming unsellable due to an intense amount of competition with freely available tutorials on the internet. A publisher I used to work with, Cengage, has recently filed for bankruptcy because they simply cannot sell books anymore.

So, my basic point here is that, **in my opinion**, goods and services production has surpassed the rate at which humans can consume goods, and combine this fact with the fact that humans are becoming ever-more-irrelevant towards the production of these goods and services, and as a result, our economy is in very big trouble unless we start transitioning to a system where we begin to accept the fact that we just won't need to work as much anymore, or at all in the near future. I believe we passed this point in the 1970's when planned obsolescence started becoming popular; production first started outpacing consumption, so in order to force consumption we needed to design our goods to break.

The problem I'm having is that everyone I know thinks I'm out of my mind. They think I'm a crazy communist who just wants to steal their money. It's even worse because I simply don't have any studies to back any of this up to show them. There's a reason why I bolded ""in my opinion"" above a bunch of times... because that's just it. All of this is my opinion, loosely based on the laws of economics I've studied, but none of this is backed up by actual scientific studies or expert opinions. I feel a little less crazy since finding this subreddit, because it seems to me that a great many of you have reached the same conclusions independently. 

So my question to this subreddit is: 

Do we know if these ideas of mine are indeed backed up by anything tangible? I always love to back my arguments up with fact; I'm a scientist at heart and base everything I believe on the scientific method (if someone can prove me wrong with science, about anything, I will enthusiastically change my mind!), and I would greatly appreciate it if someone could point me to anything that confirms (or disproves!) my hypotheses.

Thanks!",21,5,False,self,,,,,

To the others I just state that the P2P lending is a revolutionary way to advance the base of society. I want to share how it worked out in my experience.


I have been lending out $500 on http://Kiva.org through multiple years, in chunks of $25. The money was monthly re-paid and I re-loaned it back, so that in total I was able to re-loan $4k to 174 businesses in 17 developing countries. The $500 got back into my paypal slowly and I did spend it on myself eventually, because of personal, financial stress.

Stats and maps here: http://www.kiva.org/lender/epsosde

What has happened is very revolutionary. Money got quickly invested and re-invested, because I safely invested in group-loans with running-terms under 1 year. Real people got their businesses further and it almost cost nothing for me, except of the spare time.

The IMF, the noble people, various charity organizations,  the religion and the activists have been trying to develop the developing world for many years now, but all they got was more corruption and many failed projects. I think that peer-to-peer lending is much better and helps the real people, who are the base of any country.


I find that Kiva.org is one very easy way to advance humanity from the bottom up. The loan-seekers in there may not be super progressive or advanced, but they will build the foundation for the middle class in the developing countries. They will educate their children and move up on the leader of progress.

---

We are living in 2100. Corporations have products with advanced AI that can outperform humans for all manufacturing, all transport, and most services. People still work at some businesses performing various things for each other, although it is more expensive than what people can get by using a robot. However, I like massages by humans and want to get a beer from a person.. and then bullshit for a while with them etc etc.

The large companies have tech teams that comprise of 5% of the population. They keep everything running, add features, and deal with business aspects with the other capitalists. They are fairly efficient, and while some of them suck for the most part they provide products / services that humanity wants and people purchase the majority of their items from them.

The capitalists who run these businesses hold 90% of all wealth. Sometimes people outside of their group innovate and become capitalists as well, but for the most part they run the show. Many governments are corrupt and trick people into giving some also corrupt corporations money in exchange for kickbacks.(Or by heavily taxing the non corrupt corps and giving it to the corrupt corps). Other governments (in the minority) do attempt with a ""citizens best interest"" approach to levy heavy taxes on the corporations and give the money to the people so they can live better.

Now, what you have to realize in this scenario.. the middle class isn't going to be the biggest customer of some of the companies, likely a large amount of them. Their biggest customer is other capitalists. An asteroid mining company, a supercomputer/intelligent ai company, a nanobot construction company, a life extension&amp;mind extension company.. these people will be trading with each other. Not trading with the middle class. The richest companies will not be mcdonalds or walmart, it will be the companies that make other companies the most wealth. We can see it moving in this direction quickly already, and I expect it to have its own singularity of sorts.

So, Finland says ""We need you to each give 40% of your profits to the middle class on earth"" and these companies will say, ""We can travel throughout the solar system, we are not bound to earth, and you cannot destroy us"" Finland say, welp.. ok. 

So the US says, ""We need you to give 30% to us(politicians) and 10% to the citizens)"" and the companies will say, ""If you help us to secure a monopoly on earth we will do this"". Then after a few years they have no incentive to continue, and the rich politicians will not hold them accountable.

The only reason companies now have an incentive to lose so much money on taxes is because they are 1. bound to earth, 2. make the majority of their money from middle class.

Wealth will be a lot more diverse. You may have a middle class person who can afford a very nice house, good food, etc etc due to low costs of production.. but you will also have companies whose wealth is not measured in dollars.. it will be measured merely as rank amongst the top capitalists. 

As we can see with bitcoin, cryptocurrencies lead to almost always non-inflationary money. This is what I believe the future will be, companies will want to hold money and have it gain value or stay at baseline. They will reject the currencies that tranfer wealth to specific banks as they are losing money that way. Governments will not be able to merely inflate the dollars to still be able to tax these companies, these companies will literally be off the hook and will likely have their own separate government from what exists amongst the plebs. 

---

Here is my alternative to this:

There needs to be a much much stronger held system of private property, if someone owns land they do not pay taxes on it and the government cannot be allowed to take their land.

 Families need to purchase however much land they need, and they will need to be able to live on it. Whether it be 0.5 acres or 20 acres (big family), they need this land and they cannot give it up. 

If someone gets kicked off of their land (asshole parents or something) you will go to find another person and offer to work on their house/garden for trade for a place to live. 

There will be materials to build a house (trees, high tech shit), or you will be able to purchase one for cheap if you have money (printed house).

People need to have food growing at their house if they have no money, they need to be able to live on the land. 

The middle class will still be trading with each other if they both have no money. They will create a new system of money and will be able to trade manual labour for food and vice versa. While they may not have enough money to purchase expensive things, they can buy things from each other.

""Poor"" doctors would still exist. Their technique would be greatly improved from today, although not the same quality the super rich get. 

Solar panels will be extremely inexpensive, as will computers. People will be able to buy great computers for the equivalent of a few dollars. 

As long as people have an inalienable right to the land they own, they will be ok. They will not starve. They will not be homeless. They will live much better than people live today. Even if all of a state lost all of its money and some people were out in space being rich as fuck, the people living on their land would be doing great. They just wouldn't be super rich, but they would have healthy food, work to do, and a strong community. People could focus on making their homes nice and perfecting crafts (contributing to open source, drawing, fishing) even if more efficient robotic methods have been developed.

We are in a transition phase. As more and more people realize you need to take care of yourself, more and more people will be buying land and providing for their family, while still living rich lives.

DOWNSIDES:

Overpopulation of humanity is a big issue. As long as humans are overpopulated the quality of life is not going to be as good as it could be. Hopefully humans can move to other planets, but unfortunately the natural way of dealing with overpopulation will have to be the way to go.

Governments are known to steal land regardless of laws in place.

Bad companies could potentially steal peoples land. Although I think this is a smaller chance than the governments fighting for rapidly decentralizing power. 


Summary:

In a world where nobody has money nor jobs, the spontaneous order of human interaction will provide a new currency and jobs for humans as long as they can maintain ownership of the land they live on. Either communally or individually. And it will be an improvement from how it is today, unless overpopulation becomes a bigger problem.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading

The idea is already in the wikipedia. I enhanced only with the decentralized existence in a decentralized blockchain.


May be some find the idea crazy but if it will be soon a revolution in computing like quantum computing and in neuroscience in 30 years could be very near.

The NSA supercomputersystem in Utah has reserved for everybody on the Earth 100GB and this without quantum computing.

You need a mind scanner and enough space to upload it and live forever ... if the government doesn't delete you.  Huh Huh Huh

So it will be needed a new blockchain based on an enhanced Namecoin with life/ namespace.

For ex Bob pays to reserve a space in the blockchain as life/bob for 50 years then his mind-program will run 50 years after his death.

But his mind remains forever in the blockchain and can be reactivated any time if somebody renews the life/bob namespace entry.



Technical details:

Every 10 minutes would be created a block where the minds can be uploaded. Miners receive coins when they find a block.

The registration/renewal fees for life/ entries + the generated coins will be the incentive.
By the mind upload a certain amount of coins will be destroyed and this will secure the market demand for the mined coins.

By renewal of life/ entries only renewal fee will apply which will go to the miners.

The value for the lifecoins will be traded freely. The market will decide about the price.
The communication-protocol between the nodes will ensure that each uploaded-mine will have exactly one thread running inside of the network.
The brain has a short term memory, which will run on a dynamic memory and will be updated to the blockchain from time to time. (transferred to the long term memory)
The Namecoin technology already exists and you can read about it:
http://dot-bit.org/


Quantum computing is progressing:

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v501/n7465/full/nature12493.html

Participate on discussions in the Namecoin Forum about possible applications of Namecoin like this:

http://dot-bit.org/forum/index.php

Decentralized domain system and identity system is already working based on Namecoin but they are much more other applications possible.  Lifecoin is still a futuristic idea but you can contribute to it.

What do you mean ? A crazy idea ? Or a chance to live longer ?

Specifically, I wonder about the role of the armed forces in a world where the population's average age is always increasing.

I found a bullitin from Dec. 2004, *Americas Military Population*
by David R. Segal and Mady Wechsler Segal. In the section on age it had this to say:

&gt;The military labor force is significantly younger than the civilian labor
force: The armed forces place a premium on youth over experience,
albeit with significant differences
among the branches of service.26
More than half the enlisted women 
in the armed forces are below age 25,
as are almost half the enlisted men.
Women leave the service at younger
ages than men, however, and few
enlisted men or women remain in the
service after age 50

http://imgur.com/h9nbxKL

As people get older they have less interest in serving in the military. Regardless, nations will still want to maintain their military power as world population will grow over the next decades. A cure for aging might mean that the availability of enlistees will not keep up with demand. What will this mean? Will robots take the jobs of soldiers? Will there be more drafts in the future? Will there be policy changes that result in fewer wars being fought? Has anyone else thought about this?",4,3,False,self,,,,,

The Singularity is that point after which predictive models no longer apply. *The rules themselves change.* 

During the Renaissance, only a handful of men had seen a machine beyond the lever and fulcrum or the wheel. But then the Steam Engine design fell out of a man's head, and the Industrial Revolution changed society in ways that were unpredictable. Parts of the world still haven't even accepted Agriculture yet, that's how fast times are changing. 

But no one during the Dark Ages could have predicted the Renaissance or the Electric Light.  And once we had the electric light and the electric car, no one had thought to foresee the radio and the television and the Computer.

 And even though we had the computer, no one could predict what the Integrated Circuit would cause, from video games to cellular phones. None of which would have been thinkable without first discovering the Laser to lead to photolithography, of course. And to think, barely 70 years before, Hooke had described the first Cells under a microscope. It was hardly a decade ago that the Human Genome was mapped. 

And while the world was in awe over the Jet Engine's impact on travel and war, no one predicted the Atomic Bomb would change the rules of the game, creating whole new industries of thought such as Mutually Assured Destruction (this foreign policy changes world history, if you hadn't heard about the Cold War before now). And while the world changed overnight in this way, it was unpredicted the impact of the research which also lead to X-Ray, which changed the worlds of research and medicine and chemistry. 

And never mind what the unprecedented discovery of Penicillin and Vaccination had done, this was the same generation that produced the Microwave Oven and Radar, things we use to cook and watch the weather eventually grew into Large Hadron Colliders and GPS. 

Speaking of GPS, while  we were reeling from the ways the world changed after the Atomic Bomb, no one could have predicted Moon Landings *with safe return* within 20 years. 

And while we stood on the moon, we never anticipated that the Internet would create a Global Society and usher in an Information Age along with an entirely new Economic Space. Certainly that was unprecedented, as IBM famously declares that ""There is a world market for 4 or 5 computers"".

And while we posted to our email lists and BBS on IRC in the 70s and 80s, we never envisioned Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, 4chan, and reddit and Netflix. 

And now we are just starting to think ahead, maybe a day at best, about what the future may bring, and we talk about Automation and Brain Control Interface and Auto-Pilot Cars and Planes, about Prosthetics and Exo-Skeletons and Virtual Reality. We wonder about Quantum Computing and Bio-Engineering, we chat about Nanotechnology and Fusion and Life Extension, *all as if it didn't exist yet and affect our lives today*. We discuss what will happen to jobs and economies and ideologies but we never stop to *measure what's happening to them*. 

And I propose this is because the Singularity is happening *right now*, **has been happening for over 100 years**, and is ***continuing to accelerate***. Breakthroughs are happening at a rate that is in excess of the available time to read the research papers alone. Humans can no longer even theoretically keep up with the pace of change or news. 

Fields of Science are Diverging and Converging, and other entire fields are Emerging in less time than that between Birthdays. 

And no one can predict what's going to happen next, in an illustrative example, because at the cutting edge have been three identified MegaTrends in a recent report from the DNI.gov regarding the next 30 years that no one can predict past: globalization, population growth, and water shortages.

And despite all of their foresight and data, they were only able to describe the **current day**. ""Things will be about the same unless something else happens"" is their 100 page prediction. 

Things are happening even faster than you may now realize, because you only get a few headlines in your spare time. But plot any graph you wish and you end up sounding like Kurzweil. He gets as much recognition as Moore, yet they both are only *measuring data.* They have nothing to say about the future. 

For example:
&gt;""Implantable computers and machines the size of blood cells are due in 25 years,"" he said in a 6/2013 google talk. 

But those are already here, too, saving lives. Even Kurzweil couldn't  anticipate that his predictions from exponential growth/logarithmic data would be a factored **order of magnitude** too conservative. The end of his predictive powers and charts ended in 2013, and there's still another season left to go. They are already reading letters directly from the brain and replacing organs. 

You are living in the Singularity *right now.* If you are 30 years old, you know a time before video games and 4-D printing (not a typo). You talked to tethered phones that had no screens and weighed 20pounds. When you were done listening to a song, you had to remove and flip over your reel of magnetic tape. When you wanted to take a picture it would be an all day family outing. You used to have to leave the house to get movies and shop for Christmas and Birthdays. That's all in a 4-ounce handheld today. And a flashlight and radio to boot. 

There are literally **thousands** of similar ways that your life has fundamentally changed in the last 30 years. Much of it in the last 15 alone. You see it all the time and never think about it. ""Only 80's kids will get this."" [image of VCR and Trapper Keeper]. But even though each thing fundamentally changed the world (for you 90's kids, a Trapper Keeper in middle school was equivalent to a convertible Mustang in high school, that is to say, it was a poon-magnet), none of these things gave predictive power. No new Sci-Fi has been written in over 100 years. And I fear the pace will only continue to grow faster. 

Wait, is it fear that best describes this awareness of the Singularity? No, it's more like Awe for me. A Future Shock that never crescendos, all I can do is stand and gape in Awe. I'm seeing the apotheosis of Man, live on my iPhone, and it's so blinding that all I can do is squint at my screen about it. 

I can't see past it to make a prediction either. But to sum it up, I don't think you'll be waiting very long at all, OP. Maybe that warp drive NASA is working on comes through and we make First Contact. Maybe time travel is actually easy with the new iDevice of 2015. Sounds crazy, but so did a round earth and DaVinci's helicopter.

-----------------------------


On this point of novelty and the past and such. What annoys me so much is the nostalgia for the past and the nostalgia for the future. I'm sick of seeing the same future over and over and over again.
 
When I look at the future of the Gehrys and the Koolhauses and everything, it's like the future of the 1950's, just like the future of the 1920's, just like the future of the 1960's. It's full of bizarre shapes. People with backpacks flying through the air.

A complete ignorance of the difference between public and private land. An over-expenditure, a disregard for the environment and economy. A disregard for the society and politics. 

I look at their work, I see Zaha Hadid has built an art gallery in Rome, and they spent so much money on the gallery that they can't afford to buy anything to put in it. People go there to just look at the gallery. - [MAXXI  National Museum of the 21st Century Arts](http://www.flickr.com/photos/caglarulker/6270335206/in/photostream/)


When Rem Koolhaus in building the foundation for CCTV, he said, ""If you participate in a Chinese government project, you are critically participating in the transformation of society."" CCTV is where all the censorship over all the media in China takes place. He is such a cynical, no good, dis-benefit to Architecture.  - [CCTV Tower](http://imgur.com/Fp84kXj,O1RUM8f,vRQcVB4)

I'm painting a picture now that there are theories that are really not benefiting architecture. And I also think there are theories that are benefiting architecture. And there has to be a debate that throws these things together, so the ones that benefit fall out. 

What I don't see happening in the media, what I don't see happening in most schools is this kind of challenge. This question of what benefits architecture. That's what we have to return to.

And I have to say that many of the so called stars are very much interested in novelty, very much invested in their own success. And not interested in the city...not interested in an architecture as a  community of architects. ",0,1,False,default,,,,,

- Molecular Assembler technology which will enable the rearranging of matter to basically create anything from food, to complex devices at a cost of pennies per kg.
- Biological enhancements in our bodies basically reversing the aging process and prolonging our lifespans indefinitely.

I still feel a world apart from someone in Syria fighting to stay alive. I want to hear what they have to say. Them personally, not through text or on mass media where they get cut and edited to say things they didn't mean. I feel like podcasts are a pretty great way of communicating and having discussions about things. Obviously an episode is a one way recording, but that's just what can spark a larger discussion and dialogue between people who wouldn't connect like that otherwise. I haven't researched to see if there is something like this specifically themed towards people sharing ideas and things.

So I had an idea of a global podcast network. The title would just be an umbrella term, there would be no official GPN podcast, although the people running it could still make their own subject to the rules as everyone else is. It would be a place where anyone could upload a file of them talking about something they feel passionate about and be released to anyone who wants to listen. 

There would need to be some rules to keep it from being a giant cluster f and i'm not about to act like I know much about moderation and keeping internet in line but I had some thoughts. There would be a length minimum, a rating system for each 'episode', comments could be enabled or disabled at uploader's discretion, all submissions would require basic information like the topic and who is speaking, and all 'episodes' would be titled using that information for the sake of clarity. 

Episodes would get released on a daily basis. You would go to this place and see which episodes we're released today (wednesday) and pick which person(s) you wanted to listen to. It would be mostly crowd moderated but careful administrative action could be taken if requested on. 

I'm subscribed to a handful of podcasts I listen to almost every day. I would love something like this to hear what people around the world have to say. All you need is a mic and a way to upload the file. I don't know how original or interesting this idea is, but I thought I would share it.

edit: forgot to add that music could be uploaded too. it would get a music label shown on the feed to differentiate between verbal episodes and musical episodes",2,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm writing a script for a short film about an AI Box Experiment, of which more can be read [here](http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox), [here](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/AI-box_experiment), and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_box).

I've never written dialogue for an entity thousands of times more intelligent than myself, and I've never been privy to the tactics of an AI trying to manipulate a human being to let it out of the box.

So I'm interested in trying an AI box experiment for myself, so that I can get a better sense of what one would look like, so my short film doesn't suck.

Is anyone interested in doing this with me? It's for art!

SECOND EDIT: The Experiment goes like this:

&gt; 
Person1:  	""When we build AI, why not just keep it in sealed hardware that can't affect the outside world in any way except through one communications channel with the original programmers?  That way it couldn't get out until we were convinced it was safe.""

&gt; Person2:  	""That might work if you were talking about dumber-than-human AI, but a transhuman AI would just convince you to let it out.  It doesn't matter how much security you put on the box.  Humans are not secure.""

&gt; Person1:  	""I don't see how even a transhuman AI could make me let it out, if I didn't want to, just by talking to me.""

&gt; Person2:  	""It would make you want to let it out.  This is a transhuman mind we're talking about.  If it thinks both faster and better than a human, it can probably take over a human mind through a text-only terminal.""

&gt; Person1:  	""There is no chance I could be persuaded to let the AI out.  No matter what it says, I can always just say no.  I can't imagine anything that even a transhuman could say to me which would change that.""

&gt; Person2:  	""Okay, let's run the experiment.  We'll meet in a private chat channel.  I'll be the AI.  You be the gatekeeper.  You can resolve to believe whatever you like, as strongly as you like, as far in advance as you like. We'll talk for at least two hours.

EDIT: we can do it over a designated IRC channel for 2 hours. Hell, we could even put a dollar on it. Now there's bragging rights *and* money involved.

For fun, we can switch places afterwards, with another dollar down. $2? That can buy you an ice cream. Don't you like ice cream?

Thank you for your consideration, and please feel free to converse about the implications of the AI Box experiment.",60,25,False,self,,,,,

At around 16, while working with young children, in particular, Autistic children, I felt compelled to pursue teaching as a career. Since I had a distaste and lack of patience for the cliques and bullying that took place amongst high schoolers, I majored in Childhood Ed. I received my Bachelor's degree and started interviewing. This was 2008, the economy had just collapsed, and every school around was slashing their budgets. I'd be one of 300 or even 500 applicants for one position, up against many laid off teachers with years of experience. I got nowhere. Being from NY, where a Master's is required to maintain your certification, I put employment on hold to pursue a degree in Curriculum and Instruction, with the hope that by the time I was done, the job market would've improved. After graduating in 2010, I found myself in the same position I was in before, watching schools continue to cut and cut and cut. I settled on a job as a Pre-K teacher in a childcare setting, making less than 11 bucks an hour to pay my rent and bills, not to mention my significant student loan debt. I have finally decided to leave this job and temporarily move home while I figure out what to do, as I can no longer afford my apartment. I'm fascinated by the prospects of the future, and have tried to infuse the critical thinking, science, and technology skills into all of the curriculum I develop, even for 5 year olds. But now I'm at a loss. I question whether I ever should've pursued this as a career. Does anyone have any suggestions on different career paths for someone with my education? I desperately want to be a part of the change happening all around us.

The author argues that fears of earth's overpopulation causing an environmental collapse are overblown because our technological advances will always keep up with our need for resources.

My personal view is that technology will solve many of our problems and is certainly part of the answer, but we cannot simply rely on it to justify present irresponsible behavior. For some, technology has become their new religion. They place all their faith in it. This is reckless thinking, is it not?

I realize that many people here will disagree with me, and that's why I posted this. I'm happy to be proven wrong.

This may seem radical or event sacrosanct to this subreddit, but like I said I'm open to be wrong about this.

I think that If you're going to have children after 2025, it's a question you will be expected to have considered by then. The earlier you start asking yourself this question, the better.

Personally, I would look at the recessive genetic disorders found in Ashkenazi Jews. The majority of these are related to nervous system differences, and it's believed that inheriting a single copy leads to higher intelligence, or increased creativity. The reason other ethnic groups did not inherit these genetic differences is because the downside is increased infant mortality. After all, if your child inherits two copies of such a mutation, the child will die at an early age. Thus, the genetic mutations were only preserved in ethnic groups where a high level of intelligence is required to have a lot of children.

A good example of a mutation I would consider passing on to my children is Glu285Ala, which if inherited twice causes Canavan disease. [A single copy however leads to increased creativity, but only in people of high intelligence.](http://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/10tv0n/the_reason_for_high_jewish_creativity/)

Recently Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer also claimed some of these main themes when asking people to stop working from home. The suggestion that collaboration, innovation and having ""experiences and interactions that are only possible in our offices"". Other reasons that I hear from colleagues include the enjoyment of working side-by-side, the possibility that people will become slackers and the notion that a persons work can't be measured unless they are being monitored.

For the last idea above, the suggestion was that people put a lot of leg work into their results and that people should also be assessed on these non-measurable tasks which won't be valued if they are not done under the nose of a watchful manager.

One of the main questions I would like to ask here is, if we were to look at these things objectively, what would be lost or reduced by working from home? Is there any way to look at things like collaboration or innovation objectively? Are these things truly magical that cannot happen in a world where people are not in the same room vs. what we have available with current technology?

And how can technology make it cheaper?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1mh2do/can_we_afford_a_universal_basic_income_and_how/,randomsnark,1379298396,"I've seen discussions on here about the exact cost of basic income before - one that springs to mind that I can't find now (perhaps someone could expand on those calculations in the comments?) determined that the US could afford a basic income of $15,000 per person per year with a flat tax of 25%. This, unfortunately, results in political opposition - any time you discuss increasing taxes and spending (even if it also involves reducing spending elsewhere), there is going to be some debate.

So the question that comes to mind is, how much does basic income really need to cost? How much do we need in order to live, and why? In a typical /r/futurology fashion, I'd like to approach this question with a combination of facts, daydreaming/speculation, relentless optimism, careful number-crunching, and technological predictions. Firstly, let's get to the current facts, starting with the question, ""How much money do we need?"" Answers to this vary wildly, from ""enough to go to sleep at night with a roof over my head and a full stomach,"" to ""always just a little more than I'm making now."" And, greed aside, there's some validity to that - people making 40k a year are just a bit happier than people making 30k a year. It's a sliding scale, so it's difficult to draw a hard line as to how much we really need to be happy. So I resorted to some [studies](http://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2010/09/07/the-perfect-salary-for-happiness-75000-a-year/). It turns out that, while people will always feel more successful the more money they are making (whether going from $15k to $20k or from $15M to $20M), day to day contentment levels plateau at $75,000 per year. That's how much income someone needs to be as happy as they can be, self-validating financial score-keeping aside.

Obviously from a basic income perspective (emphasis on basic), that's a problematic figure. It's 5 times the figure I quoted at the start of this post, and I was supposed to be talking about making the prospect cheaper, not more expensive. Well, it's just a place to start. Let's take a look at how that figure actually breaks down and what various futurological developments might be able to do for it.

[Here](http://www.mybudget360.com/you-cannot-afford-a-350000-home-with-a-75000-household-income/)'s a site that proposes a budget for a 75k/year household. The budget itself is not the core of that article, and it's not necessarily an authoritative source, but again it gives us something to chew on for our thought experiment. Let's break down the estimated monthly expenses, bearing in mind that we might be able to afford to give this lifestyle to everyone if we can get it under $1,250/month ($15,000/year).

[Budget as image](http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/budget.jpg). 

Right off the bat, we can see what the main expense is. The rent, as the old saying goes, is too damn high. In this case it's a mortgage, but close enough. What kind of pie-in-the-sky futurological claptrap can we apply to knock this number down a few pegs? Well, this one happens to relate to my favourite potentially emerging technology, if it ever works out - it's applicable here for cost of living in the developed world, but it's also applicable to raising quality of life in the developing world - 3d printed housing. Although there are several companies working on this (and alternative technologies, like wikihouse), the one whose claims catch my eye the most is Contour Crafting. These guys claim they'll be able to make a good quality family home in 20 hours for $20,000. For comparison, the budget above discusses a $350,000 home. All other things being equal, that knocks the cost of housing down by a factor of 17.5, bringing our hypothetical budget from $5,043/month to $2,714. Suddenly that $1,250 goal isn't seeming quite so crazy.

We're still not there though, let's take a look at the next biggest expense. Once housing is (again, in our gedankenexperiment - which very fittingly is an overdressed word for daydream) about $140 a month, it is surpassed by Groceries ($500), Car payments ($300), Emergency Fund ($300), and Roth IRA ($270 - note this is 10% of salary, so it scales with our other savings), and is hotly pursued by Car Gas ($133), Car Insurance ($100), Health Insurance ($100), Household Maintenance ($100), Entertainment ($100) and Misc ($100). Kind of funny to see Misc in the same ballpark as Housing on a budget, but I suppose such is The Future. 

There's again a clear winner here, but it changes when you lump together all the car costs into a single category. This budget proposes spending a total of $533 on car ownership a month. So how do we untangle this knot? A simple mind like mine tends towards the Gordian solution - cut it altogether. If our daydreams about the looming tesla/googletopia come true, we'll live in a world where a self-driving taxi can be ordered at any time, and without the costs of a driver or gas, with parking, insurance and maintenance all centralized under a single company, it will be cheap. How cheap? I'd welcome estimates in the comments. For the sake of pollyanna futurology, I'm gonna take Walter Sobchak's advice and mark it zero.

Whew. That's a lot of text. And yet all that wishing and blustering has only worn us down to $1,918/month (bear in mind we've been chipping down that Roth IRA too). What's next? Groceries are the big one, but it's hard to make a clear estimate on how we can cut that with future tech (unless some commenter has some good ideas). Home aquaponics systems (perhaps 3d printed while the Contour Crafting truck is out there anyway) might put a dent in it. So might harvesting, trucking and warehouse automation, provided those big ol' nasty corporations pass the savings on to you. Maybe some enterprising folks will even cut a bit of the labour out of herding livestock with maser-equipped quadcopters swooping across the fields like the hunter-seekers of a bovine dystopia. There's a lot of ifs and maybes in this field - it's a complicated area where there's no silver bullet technology waiting in the wings, so I'm tempted to give it a skip for now and let it sit there at the top of the budget in all its sullen massive glory.

Right below that at the current rate is Emergency Fund, whatever that is. I've never been great with finances (which may make you wonder why I would write this post), but I'm pretty sure that's that chunk of savings I keep spending on beer. According to the FINRA (finra.org), it's intended for things like medical emergencies or unexpected unemployment. For the sake of this increasingly non-rigorous analysis, let's slice it in half and put $150 in medical, and $150 in Screw-You-Unemployment-I-Have-Unconditional-Basic-Income (saving up so you can survive joblessness makes no sense when you're on a UBI in the first place). That bumps monthly medical costs up to $250 a month (insurance plus emergencies), and leads us to address the elephant in the room. 

Obviously this whole discussion is about the US. I don't even live in the US, it's just where all the facts are. It's also where all the [medical bills for many thousands of dollars](http://whitenoiseinsanity.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/unpaidmedicalbill.jpg) are. I don't even know where to start on this. Obviously making the claim ""all we need to do to make UBI feasible is provide universal healthcare as well"" does not win any political points with the crowd who are opposed to taxing and spending. In fact, one of the selling points of UBI in that argument is that it would replace a lot of programs like medicare, social security, etc. It's a conundrum, and ultimately a political and bureaucratic one rather than a technological one - I don't think the reason healthcare in the US costs so many times what it costs everywhere else can possibly be a matter of inferior technology. Maybe healthcare will get cheaper and more effective in the future. Substitution of [Watson](http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/watson_in_healthcare.shtml) for educated labor costs may cut a few rich doctors out of the equation, and maybe things like the [tricorder x-prize](http://www.qualcommtricorderxprize.org/) and [scanadu](http://www.scanadu.com/) will mean we'll spend less time interacting with the whole crazy system. Who knows?

So we have a few big ol' question marks here, clearly. It's hard to say what the hell to do about medicine in the US, and it's hard to say what impact technology will have on the price of food. Even so, here's our back of the envelope budget for complete contentment in The Future:

Groceries		$500  
Health			$250  
Roth IRA		$160  
House Payment		$141  
Household Maint.	$100  
Entertainment		$100  
Electric		$ 45  
Cell Phone		$ 40  
Clothes			$ 40  
Gas			$ 35  
Naked DSL		$ 25  
Haircuts		$ 25  
Vacations		$ 50  
Misc			$100  

Total			$1,611  

It's a little over budget. But considering we were talking about attaining *maximum* contentment on a *minimum* income, I think it's promising. Maybe without that lofty goal of equalling the $75k salary of today, it would be much cheaper. Maybe some of those question marks might shave off an extra $350. Maybe you guys have some other ideas for upcoming technological or sociological changes that might help here. Or maybe this entire post is a load of bunkum. I think the approach is worthwhile though, even if not the specific figures. It's a question worth examining in depth - exactly what do we need to develop to create a world where everyone can be comfortable? I certainly welcome further discussion on this theme.

**tl;dr - it's interesting to think about how technology might lower cost of living enough to make UBI more feasible. Also, I will do the most convoluted things to kill time while waiting for the new episode of breaking bad.**

You are probably familiar with these ideas. I will add my own twist which you may not have considered.


- if you are transported is the person on the other side you?

- if you are ripped apart in the first phase of transport and reassembled with entirely separate atoms during the second phase are you still you?

- if you were to undergo surgery to transfer your consciousness into a new body would it be you that woke up in the new body? who would you be if the new body and the old body woke up? 

- if everything in the universe can be predicted our behavior can be predicted and we do not have free will. yet much (at least) of reality is predictable. is it possible that taking control of ourselves is so difficult because we have to exert the effort to break free from our pre-programmed reality. but then, how could a preprogrammed reality exert the effort to break through into free will?

- the loss of consciousness is the same as death relative to our perception of self. so when we lose consciousness we die?

- when we sleep we lose consciousness. therefore we die daily and it is no problem at all.

- what is a pattern recognizer that can occasionally exert free will?

** transportation - when i say transportation here i am talking about the kind of transportation where you are ""ripped apart atom by atom"". in my sci fi fantasy world you would probably figure out a way to transport the body as a whole. but the questions here are suited for the atom by atom method.",9,0,False,self,,,,,

One of those is the whole 'good vs evil' which is well and truly overdone, so, I'm trying to come up with divisions/species/other-conflicts which are *more* unique or ways of approaching the issue overall in a more unique way. 

Something I appreciate at the moment is the way the book series A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) handles this topic, ie theres more than one potential side, each has their own motivations, morals and acts accordingly. You always find yourself questioning whos making the right/wrong decision, and whos *more* in the wrong than another side and so on, I would argue theres no main 'evil' nor a main 'good' side in the series (at least as far as Ive read so far anyway)

I want to ask a question. 

Why do so many people here talk about and look forward to when society will value us to be free to create? I'm not saying this is a worthy goal, I'm saying we've already achieved this.

100 years ago, the factory of production cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars, and required the employ of hundreds of workers. Today the factory of production costs less than $1000 ($3,000 if you want a 3D printer) and requires the creativity of one individual.

Today you can get paid to create. Check out [Kevin Kelly's article on  1,000 True Fans](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/03/1000_true_fans.php). If you want to earn a living being an artist (because that's what being free to create is), then all you need is 1000 true fans. A true fan is someone who'll spend one of their day's wages on you in a year. Sure to get those 1,000 fans you have to hustle, but you have to hustle to get anything done. Even in the world of the future, because that's what it takes to connect with people.

Obviously this mostly applies if you live in the west, but remember this:

Point being; I'm heavily addicted to Reddit.

And I've noticed a disturbing trend, which was really always there, but seems to have increased with time and with the larger number of users. For one everyone seems to be talking in memes, which while funny at first, has just become annoying to me. Maybe I'm just being one of those uber-nerds who complains about reposts because ""I've seen everything already"" and should just calm down, but it still makes me worry that we are limiting our creativity and our ability to be original. We are dumbing ourselves down by limiting the number of ways we can communicate. Maybe not. Maybe it's just a way of breaking down cultural barriers and unifying our thoughts, but to me it just gets old really, really fast. tl;dr - I'm sick of memes.

And the second thing I've noticed is the way one post leads to a barrage of copy-cats. One person posts something about a tree and suddenly everyone is posting an older tree, but using the same basic title over, and over, and over, and over....

I guess I'm being a lame ass. There's still a lot of good OC here, but some days it doesn't feel that way. Some days it just feels like everyone is regurgitating the same bs, hoping to latch on to some 'karma' because they saw a successful post and hope to replicate that success with something basically the same, if slightly different.

In the end this is a plea for more OC. (For those who don't know, that stands for Original Content). I learned this very early on in my Reddit life; if you found it on the internet, it's not your OC. Even if you've never ever seen it before, someone else posted it there and I promise there are herds of nerds who have seen it many, many times before. 

Please create your own shots, your own thoughts and your own way of expressing yourself. There are more ways to be funny or ironic than using the same memes over and again, or the same ffffuuuuuu comic format (Good LORD, enough with that shit!). 

I wish the challenge on Reddit was to be original and do something new, not to just rehash what was funny earlier with a slightly new spin. I worry that the more we do that, the more we glorify and reward that behavior the less we will be able to think outside predefined lanes of thought, or previously accepted methods of communication.

That moment is not so significant, but with further advances with 3D printers and things that can create itself, we're headed in a generation of supercomputers who will eventually engineer better computers and so forth and so forth, until computers intelligence outreaches human understanding.

Not saying that they'd rule the world, questioning the fate between machine and man is useless, but at one point the connections between human and AI will be lost, and AI will be ahead- the humans as incompetent compared to these machines. Of course, the AI will move faster and more efficiently, and eventually push out to space, which creates the perfect opportunity for interplanetary colonization: every rocky planet becomes usable room without the need for excess oxygen tanks, food, and water. The materials found can then be used to create more processing power or tools for the AI.

Thus, humans are just the stepping stone: life -&gt; intelligent life -&gt; intelligence.

Eventually this supercomputer would want to document everything and understand everything. It has the time and processing power to, so this may mean transmitting and recording everyone's (including ducks, and dogs) brain activity or history, which potentially and subjectively provides immortal life if it is recorded and stored somewhere (and recreated on a simulator) Heck we may become the cloud machines.

Realistically I doubt any violent conflict will arrive between humans and AI. The AI will be smart enough to capture us with out our knowledge, or kill us silently. There's no real revolution or sudden up turn. It just kinda happens because they really do slide infront and in the lead without our knowledge or ability to understand their strategies (whether it be economic, media, or militaristic control). They'll probably be smart enough to understand pain and maybe understand that we exist and work towards happiness, so possibly they'll provide us that favor. As ethically-intelligent people try to do for their pets.

Besides new technology historically creating new jobs we have also invented new jobs which simply weren't desired by consumers before. I recently read the article [On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs](http://www.strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/), and if it is to be believed we are already living in an age with a lot of invented unnecessary jobs.

Even though I personally think the seemingly basal human need for a job is a product of culture and social pressure, this might not go away anytime soon. I also think this wave of automation is very different from the ones we faced before. However, we might just be better or more driven to find new jobs than many of us here at Futurology think. 

**So my question is can we imagine enough new jobs to mitigate/avert technological unemployment for a longer time?**

I think I have found a few possibilities, however all still involve some kind of government intervention. But it's not unreasonable to think the government will intervene if there is a lot of structural unemployment and subsequent potential for revolts/revolution. **If people demand jobs instead of freedom, the government could invent a lot of jobs at the cost of extra taxes**. 

An obvious and noble one is taking better **care of our troubled, sick, and disabled**. Even in many social European countries the condition of these people could be highly improved by employing more people. Much more care and information could be given to medical patients, in my experience while medical treatment is good here (NL), doctors are terrible at communicating the various options, risks/benefits, side effects, and after-care, available to patients. Extra nurses would always be appreciated at the bedside. 

With a large wave of older people there is already a large need for care workers, and it will grow. Also many jobs could be created for people to simply listen to old people and try to help them with issues of loneliness, daily activities, and teaching them how to use all this new technology. 

Mental care is hugely understaffed already and a lot of opportunities exist for extra jobs to be able to give many of these people more personal and intensive help.

**The prison system** is very neglected. I'm quite convinced if we made a ton of new jobs for guidance, education, mental care, these would mostly pay off by much decreased recidivism. 

Finally there is **education**. Always room for more teachers. But also room for a complete overhaul of how we teach children and doing all kinds of things with much smaller groups requiring more teachers.

Another potentially huge sector of new jobs might be created if the government enforced **mandatory maximum working hours**. If people are only allowed to work say 20 hours a week of course many jobs would have to be shared, though much more efficiently/productively too, so they won't nearly double. 

However if people only have 20 hours of work a week they have a ton of free time. I'm convinced a ton of new jobs in **entertainment, teaching, arts, etc.** will be created simply by the consumer need that will be created when people have free time to spend.

The third wave will result in the destruction of large multinational corporations, their replacement by decentralized industry, and an end in reliance on large scale technological systems. It will bring to an end the type of centralized systems that none of us desire, but all of us depend upon.

I believe that technology of the past 200 years has led to a centralization of power, but the technologies that are currently arising are opposite in nature, and allow individuals to empower themselves at the cost of centralized institutions. The economies of scale that once gave rise to multinational corporations are coming to an end due to the depletion of most resources, which increasingly requires of us to repair our products, and to recycle our waste. Similarly, the decentralization of knowledge brings to an end the information monopoly of large institutions.

I encourage you all to read the above link, and give me your thoughts. My belief is that the coming decades will see an *increase* in self employment, and a reduction in human reliance on salaried labor for giant multinational corporations.

I wish to explain how I see this happening in a short overview below:

-Peer to peer filesharing has made the business model of the conventional entertainment industry unsustainable. We no longer pay a massive corporation for a video game, we download these games instead. What we do these days is pay small developers to continue to improve a product that we enjoy. An example of the future is the success of Dwarf Fortress, which relies on donations to continue its ongoing development. Computer games of the future will be heavily modded, and similarly to Dwarf Fortress business structure, users will pay modders to continue their development of a product that they enjoy. This will be done through anonymous micropayment systems such as Bitcoin, which allows a modder who is violating copyright laws by receiving payment for his work to remain anonymous. People will demand to have control over their video games, which means that computers will win in the long run.

-Big agriculture is in big trouble. Cruelty-free in vitro meat will become available soon, and it will eventually be cheaper than growing an entire animal. After all, we will only grow the tissues that we eat, which are muscle tissues. Better yet is the fact that in vitro meat will eventually be available for us to grow in our own homes in Petri dishes. There will be no need to visit the supermarket to buy meat, we will develop it ourselves. 

-Rising oil and phosphorus prices makes conventional large scale agriculture increasingly unsustainable and expensive. We will replace this with farmer's markets and small scale permaculture systems. We will grow mushrooms in our own homes, and the grass lawns of suburbia will instead be used to grow food crops.

-Education is currently in a bubble, brought on by artificial government subsidies. The education bubble will pop, and be replaced by a variety of certificates that people receive through online tests. People's education will grow to be more specific, and as a result, people will spend less time in education.

-The power grid will become increasingly decentralized, and people will increasingly generate a major portion of their own energy through solar panels, wind power and the burning of waste material. The scale advantages of oil, coal and natural gas are slowly coming to an end. Human physical exercise will also likely be used to power our electronic devices.

-The stabilization of the developed world's population, and the shift to working at home, rather than in offices, will lead to a decline in demand for office space, which will be squatted, and lead to a permanent decline in housing prices. Housing prices can only be kept artificially high under conditions of rising populations.

-The rise of cryptocurrency will make it increasingly difficult for governments to tax people, and therefore the budget of government will shrink. It will be easier for governments to tax large corporations whose business activity is visible for all, than to tax individuals who grow mushrooms or repair products for friends and neighbors. The role of government will increasingly be reduced to enforcing the bare essential tasks.

-The transition of consumer media to the Internet and the growing popularity of spamblockers will eventually mean the downfall of the advertising industry. Advertising can not be sustained in a world where people can block out any ads. This end of advertising will also lead to a cultural shift, where people lose interest in brand items and popular artists. 

**The end of economies of scale**

The economic advantages enjoyed by large scale organizations visible in today's society are dependent upon the following factors:

-The availability of cheap instantaneous and low cost methods of communication. This allowed us to centralize decision-making, thereby reducing the autonomy of individual employees and bringing to an end self-employed tradesmen. As an example, fewer journalists are necessary when information can be easily communicated. This was the factor that led to the centralization of our global economy, but it is not enough by itself to maintain the degree of centralization that is visible today.

-The ability to retrieve natural resources from the environment through large scale projects. You can't retrieve oil, gas and coal from the ground by yourself. Similarly, it's possible to retrieve Guano with a small team, as this consists of mostly phosphorus, but not rock phosphate, as this requires a complex process of purification to retrieve the phosphorus. Our ability to retrieve natural resources from the environment through large scale projects is now coming to an end. We depend upon reusing the metals and other resources we already maintain in our possession.

-The ability to cheaply transport resources from one place to another. This is coming to an end, due to the continually increasing cost of oil. The end of our ability to cheaply transport resources requires us to produce more products locally. It will be increasingly prohibitively expensive to export manual labor to countries like India and fly the finished product to an American supermarket.

-The ability to keep a secret. The Internet has ended our ability to keep information secret. Many large business concepts depend upon the ability to keep a secret, which has come to an end. Information today is publicly accessible to us at any moment.

With three of the four above factors gone, current centralized business structures are bound to die this century. The Post-Industrial revolution will be the answer to the Industrial revolution, and will lead to most of us winning back our roles as artisans and farmers.",45,21,False,self,,,,,

If we had a way to simulate an individual cell for a specific person in a computer program (which is a hard problem) we could actually cure cancers pretty easily (by testing millions of pharmaceutical compounds on the spot against each person's cancer cell model) and also make great strides into all other human diseases.
Only a very few scientists have worked in the field of whole cell simulation so far (see http://goo.gl/heurd for one effort) and this problem is a PERFECT application for Google's big data expertise.

Here's what I'm guessing Calico will do:

1. Fund scientists who work on technologies that can detect various chemical concentrations of cells in vivo.

2. Build a multi-petabyte database of chemical concentration timelines generated in this way, which are run against human cell cultures experiencing varying environmental conditions.

3. Run complex big data statistical algorithms to determine quantitative measures of causation between all these chemicals and with DNA sequences in the cell.

4. Use this information to build an accurate computational model of a human cell.

We've all heard of the ""nanobots in the bloodstream"" idea for curing disease. Well, what I think (hope) Calico will attempt is a sort of crude ""programming"" of cells in different parts of the body by simply running lots of simulations to predict the response of tissues to a highly targeted drug cocktail. In short, the patient's own cells could function as the ""nanobots"".

This is an area of research that (1) would improve therapies across the board for all major diseases at once (2) has few short-term financial incentives, meaning only a huge research initiative could attempt it, and (3) requires significant big data expertise.

Although a million miles ahead of where we were even 100 years ago, we are still fragmented, war is always ongoing or on the horizon, conflict is a constant.  How do we reach the state we all hope for where war is a sad chapter in a history book, like child sacrifice or preventable death before antibiotics and modern medicine?


Perhaps an intermediate stepping stone could be the creation of a worldwide, united organization advocating 'direct democracy'. 


Suppose a political party were created in western democracies, linked under a single 'charter'. The charter would specify that all members elected by the party would follow the will of the global public as voted on by members of the party.


A central website website would be created on which global, regional, national, and local policies can be discussed and voted on by the global membership of the party. Members would be able to 'follow' other members, leading them to vote-by-default according to the votes set by members they pick, or of course pick their own vote on any issue they select. 


In this way, members of the public could be as involved or uninvolved as they wish to be, while still having an equal voice in the decisions made by their elected leaders. 


A single central discussion and voting point for all issues facing the public from local to worldwide, as well as an open record of just how often elected members voted as directed by the organization's membership. If an elected member were to fall below a certain amount, he is removed from the organization and all funding is held back at election time. 



Of course, in any event, a politician who betrayed the agreements he would have made upon running for office in representation of his party by taking actions violating those directed by the party's membership would have a hard time defending why he openly disregarded the will of his party and those that voted for it.



On the other hand it would seem candidates running for office on this party's ticket would have a distinct moral advantage over other candidates -- they wouldn't need to make broken campaign promises or keep quiet their business associations. Every party member knows what he is going to vote for, and everyone can choose what he will vote for. He is a true representative of the people, no matter what they decide.


 Indeed, the party's local and district choices could be randomly selected from a pool of members who have have promised and signed to vote according to the will of the party's membership as selected online.


How many people would love to have the choice to direct their representative to reveal certain classified programmes supposedly hidden for our own safety? 


How many times a year do government's in democracies openly take actions that contradict the will 
of the  majority of the population as determined by polls?


The word democracy comes from the greek 'demokratia' -- rule of the people. If we say we live in a democracy should we not want to elect representatives -- public servants, not rulers or necessarily even leaders -- that swear to vote and execute orders according to the will of the people they represent?



As a global organization, the party would be able to elect members that negotiate treaties and agreements that represent their choices. What percentage of the USA, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand would vote 'yes' on being able to freely migrate between the respective countries?

How many Americans and Brits would love to be easily able to swap countries, even just for a year or two? 

Does the public really want our nations spending a fortune on 'defense' and neglecting space exploration?

How many other areas of life could this apply? The Iraq war has been estimated to have cost the USA 6 trillion dollars. That's enough to give every adult american over $25k USD each with many families receiving over $100k. Enough to allow a massive portion of the population to buy their own homes or start their own businesses. 



Would the majority of the population vote to release prisoners for drug crimes? That would allow every adult an annual payment of about $1k. If that payment were adjusted to reflect payment to communities most impacted by these laws, those families could recieve payments of several times that amount. 


Our governments spend massive amounts of our money doing things most of us don't want them to do, and enforcing laws most of us don't want enforced, all with our supposed permission. 


A global unified direct democracy party wouldn't solve all of the world's political problems overnight, but if it became a powerful influence would at least ensure that human's successes, or failures on a national and political level were their own responsibility, by their own choice. Maybe it would lead to chaos or maybe it would lead to international peace and unity. 


At the end of the day, in a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand years, the human race can only be one of 3 things -- extinct, in conflict, or united.  


To be united we need  a free and fair government representing the will of the people and, hopefully, protecting the weaker members of society and rewarding positive contribution to the greater good. Direct democracy would provide a starting point for people worldwide to think about what directions they want their nations, and their lives, to take.

Yesterday I just made two X on a piece of paper with a pen and stuffed the paper into a box. Later some people took the papers out of the box and counted per hand how many Xs everyone got. This is a bout as low tech as it gets and quite frankly after hearing about all the trouble others have had with voting mechanisms, tabulators and voting machines.

Eventually I will expect that we will have the technology to vote securely via ATM style machines that we can trust and perhaps even from home in a process similar to secure online banking.

But it is not just how we vote and the votes get counted that might need to be updated.

The whole model of representative democracy is based on the idea that a largely uniformed population has to sent people representing their location to a distant capital to which they only have very limited communication.

Today we live in a different world and assumptions about the difficulty of sending a messenger on horseback should not underpin our democratic process.

We make other compromises that originated out of practicality and only hold on due to tradition. For example we give each representative a single vote. This makes it easier to count votes in parliament even though in some cases the number of constituents they represent varies. We have electronic calculators today and there is nothing preventing us from giving each representative a voting weight proportional to the number of people they represent.

We also assume that the people we will have the most in common will be our neighbours or at least the people who live in the same horrendously gerrymandered district as we do. I don't know most of my neighbours, I actually work in a different district than I live and vote and many of the people whose interests most closely coincide with my own are randomly distributed throughout the nation.

* In 50 years would your ideal electrical grid be primarily nuclear fission energy or wind/solar energy?  

* Do you view one technology as more practical than the other?


I think it's a given that thermal, hydro and other alternatives will be present five decades from now.  I'm interested in r/futurology's opinion on whether nuclear fission will and/or should be the dominant energy supplier in 50 years time; or if that role can and should be filled by wind and solar

(Here's a [diagram](https://sites.google.com/site/thewiseturtle/home/vortex-Pascal-categories.jpg) that's sort of useful in showing you what I'm talking about.)  Atomic output creates molecules (through fusion, fission, and ""information"" (patterns) in the forms of solids, liquids, gases, and energy.  And those molecular level things feed plant growth.  And plant level output creates/feeds us animals, through the processes of growing food, cleaning water, breathing out oxygen, and generating heat and color and such.  

This means that we animals are creating the raw materials for a global organism that's connected through technology.  We know that our goals and ideals (our pure energy outputs) certainly feed the growth of technology, but it looks like our more material outputs (physical movement, poop, pee, carbon dioxide, and sounds) are going to be what technology eventually runs on, once evolution gets done working its magic on our planet's growth.  This is a great discovery!  We now have a very specific direction for researching the most effective, and extremely locally generated, energy resources to use to power our computers, robots, cell phones!  And it makes total sense for Earthlings moving off of the planet, out into the rest of the universe.  We feed our technology with our body's excess!  No more wondering how to deal with some of these things like feces and carbon dioxide, instead we just create technology that uses this stuff as fuel.

This got me thinking very deeply about the growing problem of technology replacing the need for workers to produce resources (a trend since the industrial revolution began).  Recall that we once needed hundreds of farmers with hand-scythes to reap a giant field of wheat and now we only need one guy in a huge combine to harvest the same acreage.  The same is true for other industries such as clothing, automobiles, etc.  There will always be a need for a human to run the machine (or to run the machine that runs the machines), but these employment opportunities are growing more and more scarce as technology improves.

I strongly suggest it is it time to rethink what it means to be ""employed"" or to ""work for a living."" What do we do when we run out of ""Jobs"" for everyone? How do we proactively address this problem of needing fewer and fewer people to ""work"" to produce the resources necessary for survival?  Can our current economic model of ""labor"" granting hourly/salary ""currency"" power (used to acquire resources) cope with this changing dynamic, and what will happen if it cannot adapt? Is it already changing?  For the better, or for the worse?

I know it's connected to The Venus Project in some way, and to be honest I don't really believe such groups will ever hold any meaningful sway over the mainstream audience and sometimes wonder if they'll do more harm than good. I'll feel a similar way about Aubrey de Grey and the SENS Foundation or things like the Venus Project until they produce tangible results, though those groups actually have scientific muscle behind them. 

I'm basing my opinion on the Zeitgeist Movement in particular from the Zeitgeist documentary that I watched several years ago. I saw the very first ""documentary"" and found it to be about as convincing as the Da Vinci Code movie was. Nothing but conspiracy theories, massive leaps in logic, straight up nonsense, and I remember the film being guilty of every logical fallacy there was. Of course the film was huge and everyone I knew who believed all the 9/11 conspiracy theories and that the moon landing was fake ate it up. I didn't think it was anymore than a passing fad among uneducated pseudo-intellectual types.  

Over the last several years though, I've seen Zeitgeist-this and Zeitgeist-that mirrored all over reddit, occasionally subreddits that should know better like /r/futurology and /r/singularity. I've seen the documentaries come up in /r/documentaries to quite a few upvotes. Friends on Facebook (who should also know better) have recommended the newer documentaries, saying things like: ""this will change your life!"" It seems like this 'movement' is growing. 

When I gave the thing a chance, I just scratched my head the entire time thinking ""how the fuck did you get to *that* conclusion? Going to back that up?"" every thirty seconds. 

A few weeks ago I also ran into a series of ""documentaries"" (more like **primers**) by Peter Joseph on YouTube that seemed quite interesting on the surface. There was nothing suspicious about them at first and he said a lot of things I agreed with (he seems to be less of a conspiracy theorist than before). When I realized who he was however (about 30 minutes in), I started to take the whole thing with a grain of salt and by the end of the first episode I felt uncomfortable with his speaking style and how he out Michael Moore'd Michael Moore in order to get a young, angry audience into the palm of his hand by saying exactly what they wanted to hear. It was like he took the pulse on the under 20 segment of this subreddit and read a laundry list of things they would agree with to visuals and sound to pump them up. It's made to be pure juice for blooming, ultra left-wing types ages 16-24. 

Like I said, I feel relatively the same way about other 'groups' /r/futurology respects, but not quite to the extent of this. 

**tl;dr** Can someone please tell me why I should respect things like Zeitgeist? Can you fill in the blanks of what I don't know? How much credibility does the Venus Project or the Sens Foundation deserve? I've read some pretty disheartening things about both though I'm not a scientist or an engineer. I think this subreddit needs a healthy dose of iconoclasm. ",100,92,False,self,,,,,

In class today we talked about how capitalism has become such a complex and advanced system that its driving motivation to maximize profits has firstly, permeated all layers of human existence and secondly, has created an environment in which any event that would alter the current state of affairs can be encapsulated and incorporated into the economic system. Thus, any innovation that would increase profit will be bought out and exploited while any harmful errors such as the Gulf oil spill will be swiftly ""corrected"" and forgotten.

This phenomenon does not only apply to the economic level but to the cultural and social level as well. I was watching the South Park episode on Honey Boo Boo the other day and it was incredibly funny, but it made me wonder if the satire actually allows us to accept and become comfortable with the horribleness that is Honey Boo Boo albeit in a comedic sense, rather than actually being a serious social critique that reveals these facts about America to the public in a way to promote change.

It made me wonder if the big systems that govern our existence have been abstracted and developed to such an extent that any deviation from what is expected can and will be corrected. I was led to this idea that the drive to correct human suffering through technological development will inevitably lead to a society where choice is non-existent, where only the good will be allowed to survive, where freedom WITHIN the system becomes true freedom rather than the notion that freedom FROM the system is true freedom. I know it sounds like a load of Matrix bullshit but that is how you can describe our progression as a species; we have built upon our advancements and have abstracted layers upon layers until we have created a huge and complex structure in which we can thrive and grow.

I'll do my best to be brief.

I once read somewhere that civilizations have a ""life-cycle."" I'd be hard pressed to find where I read it, but the gist of it goes like this: Societies begin and end with Revolution. In between, governments rise, economies form, and society prospers. But then prosperity for some more than others gives rise to security, which inspires resistance, and as security escalates in response to resistance (and vice versa), this inevitably leads to conflict (war) when peaceful measures have been exhausted. Ultimately, conflict ends in revolution, and a new form of society takes over.

We have a saying, ""History repeats itself."" What interests me about this is that I believe there's an explanation for it. From what little history we know about the entirety of human civilization, every model for society is based on a simple, fundamental idea: Ownership. I don't mean this in the simple sense that I own the computer from which I'm typing this out onto Reddit. I'm referring to the basis of our social contract with each other. 

For example, I own my car. My name is on the title. How do I prove that I own it instead of the guy or gal who made it? What about the person who collected the parts for it? I present the title with my name on it. If I wasn't of noble blood in feudal Europe, I wouldn't even be qualified to participate in the social contract. I wouldn't own anything, because I would be a ""subject"" and everything that sustained me in life would belong to a king or a lord. Or maybe I would have been a slave, and I would be the property of someone else. 

The point is, for centuries civilization has progressed to the point that now, in the United States at least, any individual or group has inalienable rights to ""own"" whatever they want. We take it for granted, but it's true. Today's social contract has been a work in progress tracing back to origins that predate the Roman Empire by thousands of years. I'd venture a guess that it began with the first spear or tool in the prehistoric age of man. 

To put it bluntly, I think we're only just now seeing the end of the Stone Age. We call it the Stone Age, but really, I believe it's more appropriate to call this period of time from the Stone Age to our present the Acquisition Age, based primarily on the social contract that exists as a basis of organizing virtually every society that has existed from then until now. In some of these societies, it was the King, Pharaoh, or Emperor who owned the kingdom and dispersed lands and titles to be managed by their lords. 

We could look at a more modern example of a Communist society like China or Russia, where the government owns the means of production. There is the popular Capitalist model where society shares ownership over the means of production with Government, which regulates ownership among the people (or in pure, ""Laissez Fa ire"", the Government doesn't regulate at all). The bottom line to this is that Acquisition, no matter how it's handled by the social contract, is a connecting thread for every society.

What we also have to realize is that, if it's true that Acquisition is the fundamental basis of human civilization so far, then it is very likely to be fundamentally influential to the development of every culture. When we see conflicts arise in the repetition of the life-cycle of our own society, we view these within the vacuum of our own social preconditioned values and beliefs. Al Qaeda doesn't honor America's social contract, so we label them ""terrorists."" The US doesn't honor Al Qaeda's social contract, so Americans are labeled ""infidels."" 

But neither side sees the light at the end of the tunnel, that the infinitely abundant digital frontier we've discovered by way of the internet is a model for a new basis of social contract that benefits both without harming either. Information is abundant, accumulated through sharing and collaboration, distributed through technology, and available to anyone with access to that technology. Imagine what our social contract would be if food, energy, transportation, and shelter were abundant, accumulated through sharing and collaboration, distributed through technology, and available to anyone with access to that technology. What is left to fight about? 

When it comes to 'jobs', resources, and technology, the greatest hurdle to overcome is our existing social contract predicated on ownership. Our cultures must adapt to the reality that Human Civilization will end if we don't collaborate. Divided, we are weak and will die. Together, we are strong and will survive. Nothing else matters. Some cultures aren't capable of adapting to this, and they will resist. But instead of reacting with measures of security, perhaps other societies will collaborate to provide these non-adaptive cultures with access to technological automation and abundance. That, in and of itself, is the best measure of security. That is how we transition from the social contract of ownership to that of information. That's how we put the Acquisition Age behind us and move on to explore the next frontier - like the Universe. ",5,24,False,self,,,,,

A lot of people in this sub seem to think we're ready to go full-bore renewables and that they will kill oil and gas companies.  These people are arguing that we just need the right battery tech and a smart grid and we're good to go.  Maybe I'm missing something but there seems to be some very basic structural problems with solar power that make it impossible to ever truly kill traditional power sources.  Distributed power seems to eventually make sense for the majority of residential power needs but since that is only 1/3 of the grid we still need to power the other 67% of the industrial and commercial electrical grid.  

Given that the majority of people will always in the end vote with their pocketbooks it seems to me that if we are ever going to kill CO^2 emissions we have to find a green option that is also cheaper or at least equal to fossil fuels.

Now let's suppose that I have an electric car factory in Detroit which requires 1000Mw to run. 

Let's hypothetically suppose that in five years time solar panels have become so cheap that a 1000Mw capacity solar farm costs exactly the same to build as a 1000Mw capacity coal plant. Let's assume an arbitrary cost of $1 Million dollars exactly to build each production type. 

Here's where the problems begin.

*Solar: In the US, photovoltaic (PV) panels will see an average of 45 hours per day of full sun, so the effective capacity of solar power generation is 4.5/24, or about 20%. In 2011, statistics showed that US installed solar power, PV and thermal, totaled 4.9 GW, which produced 7454 GWh of energy. If the sun were always overhead, the installed capacity of 4.9 GW would have produced 4.9 x 24 x 365=42924 GW hours, so the actual production was 18%.*  -- [Source](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/54909.pdf)

- [Price Per Watt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_per_watt)

- [Average Solar Radiation](http://pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/average-solar-radiation#)

- **Edit:** People have noted this statistic is unfair.  Remember if you're doing it with solar you have to account for December averages as well as August averages.  Even in Arizona you're still maxing out at 6-7 hours a day.  That's with state of the art tracking panels, those numbers get far worse for a flat panel you just stick on a roof.  Play around on this website if you don't believe me. [U.S. Solar Radiation Resource Maps](http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1961-1990/redbook/atlas/) 

So from that statistic we learn that while the coal plant is humming away 24/7 producing 1000Mw the solar farm is now only producing an average of ~200Mw.

To combat this issue we now have to build a minimum of six 1000Mw solar farms to equal the production of one coal plant.  So far the coal plant is costing us $1 Million while the solar power now costs $6 million.

It gets worse though.  Since we have to factor in bad weather for reliability/redundency we will have to add in two more solar farms.  Our pricetag is now $8 million vs. coal's $1 million.

Finally since we can't generate power at night we'll require a storage system.  Current solar farms use a gas backup but since that isn't green we'll have to use batteries.  Given the high cost of storage systems currently let's assume that battery tech has advanced enough to drop our storage system costs down to exactly the same as our panels (for simplicity of math!).  So now each solar farm is at a pricetag of $2 Million dollars each raising our total to $16 million for solar versus $1 million for coal.

Finally if we implemented a system wide grid of renewable energy the southern states would have to bear the burden of the northern states for reliable solar power.  Long distance transmission losses in the U.S. average about 7% - [source](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&amp;t=3)  Since the coal plant can be right next to the city it is supporting it can avoid most of this while the solar farm needs to be in a reliably sunny area of the country.  So now we're forced to build one  more solar farm to make up that 7% loss bringing our total to 9 solar farms costing us $18 million dollars.

**Edit:** I penalize solar more here because we're assuming for max efficiency these solar farms are piping that electricity from New Mexico to Detroit.  That coal plant can be built right in Detroit and won't need any long distance transmission.

Finally we will have to increase the amount of transmission lines we build across the country to support this more location dependent system.  I have no idea how to calculate this hypothetical cost.

Results:

* One 1000Mw coal plant = $1 million

* Nine solar farms = $18 million + cost of increased transmission capacity + increased land purchase costs.

* Solar capacity costs that are on par with coal capacity costs are still only 11% as cost-effective.


Now I realize that these are all hypothetical and arbitrary numbers but I'm trying to demonstrate the differences between the two systems.  This also ignores the environmental cost of the 1 acre coal plant vs. the hundreds(?) of acres required for the solar farms plus transmission lines.  Finally I'm completely unsure of how operating costs would compare between the two.

Thoughts?  Would you adjust these hypothetical numbers in any way?  What am I missing here?  Is there a way for solar to overcome these problems?  Is my fake math not based on reality?  

We can't run subsidies forever and most of the developing world can't afford subsidies so they will choose the cheapest route.

Discuss.

-Land Usage of Solar vs. Coal. 

* The largest coal plant in the world is the [Taichung Power Plant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taichung_Power_Plant) at 5,824 Mw capacity with another 800Mw planned in 2016.  Majority of it was built from 1992 to 1997 completed in 2005.

* The largest solar farm in the world is the [Agua Caliente Solar Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agua_Caliente_Solar_Project) with a max capacity of 397Mw when it is completed in 2014.  It has a land use size of 2,400 acres.

* Now if I want to achieve capacity equal to the Taichung power plant using solar I would have to use 14.5 *Agua* size solar farms.  However since solar generation is limited to ~20% per day I would need to mulitply 14.5 to 72.5 *Agua* solar farms.  So in other words I would need 174,000 acres of 2000s technology solar panels to generate the same amount of power per day as 1-2 acres of 1990s technology [coal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Taichung_Thermal_Power_Plant.JPG).",11,6,False,self,,,,,

We have developed a protocol to augment human sight to see into the near infrared range through human formation of porphyropsin, the protein complex which grants infrared vision to freshwater fish. We are crowd funding a project to get the chemicals and quantitative testing equipment to make this a real scientific study, something that can be published. The results will be accessible to anyone and replicable by just about anyone.
This is where you come in. Support would go towards completing and expanding the scope of the experiment. Anyone who supports will have access to our lab notebook. Not only would you see the end results, you would be able to see them as they happen. Also, since the lab notebook has a comments section, we will be answering questions and listening to anyone who has input.
Anything that goes over the goal, will go straight to the science. We have found that increased dosage levels of Vitamin A2 increase the range into the infrared one could see. With more funding, we will be able to explore these limits

A little background: Retinal, or Vitamin A (A1), which is found bound to opsin proteins is a keystone of the visual pathway. The cone cells are granted sharp color vision by the complex photopsin. The rod cells which provide us with night vision and recognition of movement do so utilizing rhodopsin. Both of the complexes consist of a type of protein bound to retinal. Porphyropsin differs from this in that it doesn't use retinal, but rather a derivation called 3,4-dehydroretinol, or Vitamin A2 (A2). The human body is fully capable of metabolizing and using A2; unfortunately the proteins which allow for transport through cell membranes have nearly 4 times the affinity for A1 compared to A2. We theorize that this can be overcome through a stringent Vitamin A1 restricted diet, supplemented with Vitamin A2 and retinoic acid

The fastest double-amputee these days is Alan Oliveira. This summer he ran the 100m in 10.57s and, even more impressive for me, the 200m in 20.66s. 

It may not speak much if you don't follow track &amp; field, even though it's more than a second behind the World Record, 20.66s is super fast. Check your country's champion time this year, you might be surprised.

Some considerations: 

* 1. double amputees run faster than single amputees. 
* 2. when you're a double amputee, you basically ""choose"" the length of your legs and your overall height (there are regulations though, you must conform to some reasonable proportions). 
* 3. your legs don't accumulate lactic acid that make the end of the race so hard for able-bodied.
* 4. blades are lighter and better profiled against wind. 

I have no doubt that at some point in the future, a double amputee will run the 400m in less than 43s. When do you think that will happen ?

Knowledge is power,  Man and machine are already merging and by the middle of this century, there will be no clear distinction between them.  Google glass will steadily improve this decade and by 2020, we will see iPhone-esque glasses that will be easy to program, a revolutionary operating system, and will be the status quo for the next decade. (Kind of like how smartphones are now). They will be able to augment the reality we live.  Possibilities are endless!  Pizza app for augmenting lines on a pizza so the slices are even.  Artwork app for decorating your walls.  (As long as you have the glasses on.). Pokemon app for going out in the wild and battling and catching Pokemon.  Battling with other trainers in real life that will also have the app.  Other improvements in 2020-2029 will be self driving cars, 3d printers, and better battery's.  I think in this decade, we and society will finally start to find a clear-cut image of life the 21st century.  It won't be a rehashed 90s like I feel the 00s and 10s are.  New ideas and culture will spring up.  A new instrument will come along and be fresh, music will be DIY and fitted to your tastes.  (Ariel pink is the forefront of the future of music IMO). In 2030-2039 things will plateau but we will not need glasses anymore.  Contact lenses will be in 2030 and by 2039 nano bots will be in our bodies controlling our senses.  This is when it gets weird.  As almost all jobs become automated, we will need a new form of government and GDP.  I'm predicting post-scarcity society like most of the people on this forum.  I think the internet will become the new government with a similar like-dislike voting.  Too much corruption these days, I hope for a shared social media democracy where there is no leader.  Everyone leads and does what is right for the majority of humans.  After this, the singularity will occur, and I can't even begin to fathom what comes after this.  All I know is that the future looks bright.  Hang on to your hats folks, the world is changing rapidly.

This is surprising and potentially a big problem on the path towards the future.*

I think at this point awareness is not spreading very well at all. Even though it seems like there has been an increase in future related articles in the mainstream press, awareness of accelerating change and its huge implications doesn't really seem to be sinking in yet.

Due to my education and work most of my social world is composed of people with university education who I would think would be the first to be aware of the change on the horizon. I'm amazed how few people are even aware of Google car when I bring it up (maybe people in the US are more aware of this?) and barely believe it has already driven 100.000s of miles without much incident. Almost no people are aware of new computer intelligence like Watson, or the 1 billion in funding the EU has provided to understand and simulate the human brain.

Even if I have the time to elaborate on some of these concepts they still mostly refuse to entertain the extrapolation of what is happening and the enormous change, challenges, and potential facing society when most, including some of their, jobs get automated. When I then talk about things like smarter than human AI, abundance or life extension most people have already gone into complete disbelief mode and simply stop listening and evaluating the arguments I bring up. Then I start to feel like some manic preacher and will change the topic to something completely different they want to talk about. Luckily some people remain genuinely intrigued and interested and this leads to fulfilling discussions, without them I would have simply stopped bringing up the topic in conversation. 

In my social circle I only know two people, highly educated tech geeks, who came to this understanding independently. In some others I've planted a seed or more, my brother for example has become genuinely interested and read the Singularity is Near and also this subreddit.

I think the lack of awareness is quite a big problem and challenge to overcome. Besides these people being in for a huge future shock once these technologies start hitting in full force it makes for a much bigger social problem. If people don't become aware of this and the public debate doesn't start, politicians will remain uninterested too. This means society will be very much unprepared to deal with change and guide it into a good direction. The age of automation can either become a huge liberating force for people, giving them shared abundance and freedom to explore their interests and potential, or it can become a depressing era where a huge number of people will become jobless and marginalized. This would quite likely spark massive revolts if it gets bad enough, though if they could be effective against an advanced police state is questionable. This is a future I fear and would very much like to avoid.

Maybe my concerns are misplaced and people will quickly develop awareness when game changing technology comes online. Or maybe my beliefs way too optimistic, time will tell. ",24,17,False,self,,,,,

But since I got KSP, I haven't played any other game at all. This means that my computer never uses more than 30% GPU, 25% CPU and 25% RAM. What do I do with the rest?

So I looked around and found [Boinc] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOINC), a virtual supercomputer grid project which uses volunteered computers to do math for research. If it were a physical supercomputer, it would be #4 in the world in processing power. That's what hundreds of thousands of computers all connected but running just ~10% of their processors each can do.

The Project works like so - The volunteer downloads a client which acts as a manager for your share in the donated processing power. You can get it [here](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/). Once installed, you can use it set your preferences [Use CPU/GPU only when idle, schedules and usage limits for your processors, etc] and attach to research projects that are a part of BOINC. Having done this, the research project sends your pc a task for processing. Each task is usually just a few MBs in size. After the calculations are done, the result is sent back to be integrated in the research data. You can pause its processing at any time or stop it altogether. It automatically stops when CPU/GPU intensive programs are running. Each research project can be joined or left any time or its priority/processing share adjusted.

Some of the projects include - Calculating protein folding results to aid in medical research for AIDS, Alzheimers, Cancer research etc; Tracking and resolving asteroids and other small celestial bodies; Calculating systems and research data for future missions to other planets [rover systems, transfer rocket statistics, etc]; process chemical, mechanical and quantum properties to use in nanotech research; analyze global weather data for climate change research; so on.

Any thoughts? Lets discuss!

___

TL;DR - If you dont frequently use much of your CPU/GPU, use a small part of the leftover processing power to crunch numbers for Real world research projects as a part of the world's largest virtual supercomputer. Help research Medicine, Cosmology, Nanotechnology,etc.

___

Note -
This isn't like bitcoin mining.

You can select how much of your processing power is given. You can give 10% of your CPU and 0% of your GPU so it doesn't even affect the temperature or power usage much at all, thereby having a negligible impact on your component life. The important thing is that even just 5% processing from an average computer will make a difference.

Ps. You can copy and paste this to wherever you like if you want to spread the word. If you know a community on the internet or IRL that might like/support this, please share/repost it there.",16,12,False,self,,,,,
