And for stocks.

I am reluctant to invest in the entire market, as I believe a lot of big players are going to fall within the next decade or two.

I think a lot of small players are going to invent and innovate entirely new ways of doing business and I fear that many of the big players are too inflexible to survive.

I would like to discuss which companiess have the right products and mindset to survive and grow in the coming decades where change is happening faster than ever.


A couple of ideas:

Google: THe obvious choice imo. They have so many interesting projects with lots of potential. A lot of them are going to fail, but all they need is a few home runs.

Stratasys: They are one of the biggest players in the 3D printer space. There are many players and this is of course very new technology, but no doubt that whoever wins this armsraise is going make plenty bananas.

Tesla is another obvious choice.



I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas. I am going to cross-post this ti /r/investing

What's a word to describe a system of governance that's entirely automated by technology, to the point where *all* decisions of governance (not necessarily implementation, commands might only be issued to human citizens) are performed by an AI? Essentially the **Machines** from *[The Evitable Conflict](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evitable_Conflict)* in the final story of Azimov's *I, Robot* anthology.

I'd prefer a word ending in the familiar *-archy* or *-ocracy* suffix. I'm just trying to find the right term to round out a metaphor, and it occurred to me that this would be the right place to ask. So, again - comments before upvotes!

There are obviously endless hurdles and biases to overcome before such a government could ever be realized.

Ignoring those challenges, do you think such a government would be effective?

Considering those challenges, do you think we may ever reach such a state? (It seems to me to be the only realizable [globalized government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evitable_Conflict), let alone interplanetary government, but I may have read too much Azimov as a kid.) And when?",18,13

Suppose future technology can cut down the cost of energy (e.g. electricity) that powers the cars, and without paying for the driver, I'm thinking of free rides sponsored by ads; more specifically, personalized ads, and location based ads. 

What you do is you have this app in your smartphone (assuming smartphone's still the thing, maybe glass?), you sign up for the service, you just plan your destination and time, and the optimized algorithm will send a car on route to pick you up to wherever you want to go. You might have to share the car ride with other people unless you have a full group of people. So there's gonna be screen in front of every seat, playing ads that's personalized for you, or maybe some restaurants deal or whatnot surrounding your
destination. 

Of course you have the option to pay for premium service with better privacy and no ads etc. just like we have free and paid apps today. If bad things happen during the ride, the company has the record from the profiles of the passengers. I might have missed a thing or 2 but the technicalities should not be too hard to figured out. 

The idea is we might just be able to have free rides (might not be perfect but at least it's free) for everyone in a very near future, and one step closer to post scarcity. 

And who's to say google hasn't thought about that already, given what their core business is. ",12,8

My list to start:

&gt;**Programmers/tech:** Someone needs to create and maintain the actual automation! [At a certain point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law) the only limitation in programming will be our own imagination.
&gt; 
&gt;**Engineers/Architects/Designers:** Automation and 3D printing can help us [build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehnzfGP6sq4) and create pretty much anything [of any material](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zApmGFDA6ow), but the human element of design is too crucial. Some aspects will certianly be automated (calculations, material selection, whatever it may be), but these professions span too many industries to go away.
&gt; 
&gt;**Police/law enforcement:** Would the public ever really accept a robocop? Crime scene and detective work especially seem too much to ever automate.
&gt; 
&gt;**Judges/lawyers:** Sort of the same as above; even if you could somehow create a judge to be perfectly sound in his logic and a lawyer to perfectly piece together an argument, would you want to take away the human element from justice?
&gt; 
&gt;**Military officers:** Unless we're heading for a Terminator scenario, someone will always be pushing the buttons on whatever [drones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b1p7Cy40Mg) and [robots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGZoMPXG0MI) we come up with next.
&gt;
&gt; **Astronauts:** Whenever the private space industry really takes off, we'll need professionals running the show up there, [wherever](http://www.elegantresorts.co.uk/virgin-galactic-space-travel/t) [there](http://www.planetaryresources.com/) may be. 
&gt; 
&gt;**Entertainers:** Humans like to watch humans. There may be a market for robots that can [act](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11732995), [sing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDMmcsH0fo8), or [play sports](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/video/2013/jun/27/robocup-robot-football-championship-video), but humans will always want to entertain. 
&gt; 
&gt;**Salesperson/advertising/Business owners:** Can't really see these going away, I don't think you could automate ""business"".
&gt; 
&gt;**Chefs:** People will always cook, but will we always have chefs in a professional setting? If you can program a robot to add the exact same ingredients with even better precision and repeatability than a person, do we still cook our own food?
&gt; 
&gt;**Professors/teachers:** No matter how good computers get at teaching, simulating and explaining, I don't see a world where we wouldn't have a hand in shaping the future of our children. [Then again...](http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/27/opinion/ted-prize-students-teach-themselves)
&gt; 
&gt;**Researchers/Scientists:** Very broad profession with many fields; there's always something to discover or improve upon. Medical, geology, physics, etc
&gt; 
&gt;**Pilots:** Similar to astronauts. Already [heavily automated but](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIaMALJjOEc) it will take a long time before we're able to trust a computer with hurling us through the air.
&gt; 
&gt;**Doctors:** The technology is [already out there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZsPc0h_mtM) for some degree of automation, but as with other professions I can't see doctors completely going away. 
&gt; 
&gt;**Writers:** Someone's gotta make the words appear.

I vaguely remember reading that if we could eliminate both old age and most diseases, that we could live on average to 1,500 years. Supposing that is true, curing old age would lead to many social and economic disruptions. 

I tend to think that humans are more reasonable than we generally give ourselves credit for - and in my eyes we are a more peaceful species with each passing generation. (Check out Steven Pinker's *The Better Angels of Our Nature* if you think our peaceful nature is in doubt) However, how vast would the disruptions be if we didn't die from old age, or even retire? Do you believe this would lead to riots or even wars, or perhaps even Armageddon? 

A few possibilities I foresee: 

    - new heights of prefessionalism might be defined, if you can pursue a career for centuries rather than 
mere decades

    - people who have difficult childhoods, which often lead to criminality, and lagging behind in adulthood, 
might have a better chance at catching up

    - people might be less prone to volatile behaviors, if they thought they had many, many years to look 
forward to

    - people might also squander their lives if they thought they had forever. However, I personally reject 
that argument, since I pretty much acted as if I would live forever until my late twenties (I'm in my early 30s 
now)

    - there might be reduced social mobility if certain people stayed in their positions of leadership in society 
and industry. However I think most people would eventually wish to move on from their high posts. Or artificial 
limits might be instituted, just like leadership positions in democracies.

    - expansion into space might become a natural outgrowth of our lifespan - long travel times and 
far-long-term social and economic projects would be more rational to pursue 

    - people might choose to not have children until their 100s, 200s, etc. and this might have unforeseen
consequences for the viability of the gene pool. 

    - population growth might or might not be a problem - reduced birth rates and unpredictable technologies 
would make this question very difficult to predict. 

What are your thoughts? Your opinions are most welcome, and even better would be references to the works of
 people who have given this question serious thought. 

Thanks!

Let's go ahead and try to make such a list now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hof71/should_we_compile_a_list_of_specific_predictions/,zombiesingularity,1373004843,"***INFORMATION UPDATED, please re-read***

If technology is increasing at such a predictable pace, with predictable applications, then there should definitely be a long series of *specific* events that should occur within rather narrow time-frames leading up to the technological singularity. For instance, if a computer is going to be able to pass the Turing test by 2029 (as Kurzweil predicts) then there should be a whole host of various software/hardware technologies emerging over the years, leading up to that event. The same is true of mind-uploading, or advanced robotics, or advanced nanotechnology/nanorobotics, etc.

Let's try to make a list of specific predictions for the various big events that we're all looking forward to, if they are to occur when expected. One for strong A.I., one for life-extension technology/drugs/therapies, one for mind-uploading, one for biotechnology/genetics/synthetic biology, etc.

**Example:**

* If event X is to occur by 2029, 'y' should occur between 2015 and 2016. If it occurs later, then the following event (event 'z') will have to occur sooner than expected to keep up, and if it too fails, then it's an indicator that the 2029 date would need to be revised. Basically, instead of just listing one event, list how they are actually connected to each other, and the time-frame for each. Not a time-frame of a decade, but a time-frame of 1-3 years. Considering that the rate of change is supposed to be *exponential*, a time-frame any longer than that for a prediction is not indicative of an exponential event, I would think.

----
I am aware that Kurzweil has lists like these, but they aren't as specific or as a-to-z as I'd prefer, nor are the time-frames narrow enough for my liking. Let's do better, so we can *test* the progress of various technologies that are said to be growing exponentially. Lets subject our ideas to some testable predictions; science.


**Further Clarification (Example 2)**:

Prediction A: Specific prediction to occur 2029 +/- 3 years.

Indicators that this event is happening:

* Prediction Z 2015
* Prediction Y 2018
* Prediction X 2021

There is a larger goal, event A, which will be preceded by many events, in years prior, events z, y, x, etc. That way a larger goal's likelihood can be gauged. If z, x and y keep missing their target dates, even with error bars of +/- 3 years, then something is wrong and the predicted event A probably will take longer. 

More importantly, however, these events will have to be increasingly dramatic in their impact. If event A is to occur by 2029, and requires 1000 units of progress to achieve, then there will either have to be a very regular stream of equally impactful events preceding event A or a small number of increasingly impactful events. Or a mixture of the two.

**Scenario 1**:

Event A to occur in 2029, 1000 units (the number is arbitrary, only the percentages matter) of progress necessary to achieve this level.

Preceded by 10 events, each 10% as impactful as the 2029 event. 

If this is the correct scenario, there should be about one event every year or two that can be described as 10% as impactful as event A will be. So if event A occurs under scenario 1 there should be a prediction of around ten equally impactful (10% of the impact of event A) events.

**Scenario 2**:

Preceded by hundreds of slightly impactful events, with very minor effects, leading to event A. But if this is the result of an exponential trend we should not expect such minor impacts that grow linearly or at a stagnant rate. We should expect a few major events leading up to event A, each very impactful, presumably each exponentially greater than the last one. 

If scenario 2 is correct, we should expect to see hundreds of minor predictions coming true, of very minor (around 1% or so) impact. If every single event is very minor, then we should expect to see one prediction of the hundreds given come to fruition every few days to a week or so.

**Scenario 3**:

Preceded by some greatly impactful events, and some minorly impactful events, accruing the necessary amount of ""progress units"" to achieve event A.

We should see a few hundred predictions fulfilled if event A is to occur on time, but with fewer necessary than in scenario 2, because lost progress will be made up for with the occasional (but not frequent) moderately impactful event. So one prediction should come true every few weeks or months (depending on the impact of the moderate predictions)

**Scenario 4**:

Preceded by 5 or 6 exponentially impactful events leading to the accrual of all neccessary progress units in order to bring about event A. 

If Scenario 4 is correct, we need only make 5 or 6 sub-predictions leading up to event A that will be necessary for event A to arrive on schedule, in 2029. We should expect one majorly impactful event every 2-4 years leading up to 2029 if this scenario is correct.",27,51

We're also starting a series focusing on specific rapidly changing fields (less about the implications, and more on the technology itself), called our 'Spotlight' series. 

We'd set a schedule you could meet, and work out an outline before anything went up, and hopefully over time turn it into a series of video lectures as well.

Any business that came of this work would be subcontracted whenever possible to those who had given us assistance.

Finally, if anyone is within traveling distance to Northern Virginia, we'd love to have you on the emerging technology/pragmatic forecasting podcast we'll be starting shortly.

Thanks for your interest,

Colin Popell

The best way to make a simulation more efficient is to use approximations. Rather than simulating every protein in every brain cell, it would be more likely that it would simulate only the approximate behavior of every neuron as some mathematical function of it's inputs or something like that. And then we can't simulate exactly how much each neuron outputs or how it is at every moment in time, if those are continuous variables or close. It would have to be to some arbitrary degree of precision (not to mention the degree of precision to which we can actually scan a brain.)

Well that's mildly disconcerting to me, but it probably wouldn't be that bad. It would still pretty much be you, just with some small changes. Not a big deal. But what if you start approximating further?

We could probably have some advanced AI make the improvements, or maybe we would ourselves. My example doesn't involve any approximation at all. The improved brain and normally simulated brain both run and end up in exactly the same state. But the improved brain caches parts of previous simulations, finds patterns between the way groups of neurons act and then optimizes it not simulating irrelevant details that don't affect the final brain state. Maybe it uses machine learning algorithms of some kind to predict what the response different parts of the brain will be under different circumstances with a high degree of accuracy, but without actually simulating them.

Maybe an experience that is likely to be forgotten is just skipped over in the first place, or only run partially. It's possible you will remember thinking things, feeling certain emotions, even having entire experiences, that only partially happened or didn't happen at all. The simulation already knows what the result will be and just stores that in your memory rather than actually simulating it.

This is especially probable if you have all minds stored in a central location. It's likely many people have at least some groups of neurons that happen to be the same as the one in someone elses brain. And if you are simulating hundreds of copies of the same experiences and emotions and thoughts, there is probably plenty of room for caching and sharing resources. You may think you had a certain experience, but you actually just had one someone else had years ago just stored in your memory.

I don't know how likely this is given how complex the brain is and how difficult such optimizations are likely to be, but if it is possible than I find the implications pretty disturbing. Your consciousness would only partially exist if at all, but no one would notice, not even you.",8,3

My grandmother said this about the washing machine, my mother said this about the internet. Yet, when people no longer had to spend all their time on things like washing clothes, they filled their time with other tasks. Once the internet sped up those tasks, they filled their time with more. 

Do you think we will eventually reach a point at which a slower-paced lifestyle is both preferable and feasible? 

http://onebigphoto.com/uploads/2013/02/home-of-adventures-hobbiton.jpg

A couple months ago I was visiting Hobbiton in New Zealand, and it occurred to me that a lifestyle like that of a Hobbit may soon be more feasible. Spend your days socializing, relaxing, gardening, eating, or whatever else you choose to do. Of course, this was possible for them due to the simple nature of their society, though as more issues are addressed (Food for all, clean water for all, automation and printing producing most goods, etc) then we can begin simplifying our lifestyles again. 

In today's era, we find ourselves faced with problems rarely seen before, such as depression, immense stress, sleep deprivation fueled by caffeine and drugs, and a general wear on our bodies. While we achieve more things each day than every before, we are costing our psychological and physiological health, and people are beginning to step back and seek refuge from the hectic speed of life that we have created. 

So once again I ask, Do you think we will eventually reach a point at which a slower-paced lifestyle is both preferable and feasible? I'm simply a naive idealist who has traveled the world and seen the different speeds of life, and I can only hope that technology will allow us to live simpler while accomplishing more than ever before.

The first is that if we can create a human level AI, it will be able to design an AI more intelligent than itself. This doesn't follow since it's a single average intelligence human, effectively, that required thousands of the brightest minds on the planet to create. If we ever do reach this point without somehow anticipating that it's a dead end, I feel bad for the AI more than anything. It's a hapless, regular person who didn't ask to be born as a building sized machine that costs tens of thousands a day to operate and which will eventually be 'euthanized' because it isn't the wish granting genie we hoped for. This is somewhat like murdering your son because he doesn't become a wealthy doctor. 

The second is that once we achieve the same gross computing power as a human brain, computers may exhibit sentient thought as an emergent phenomenon. I blame Hollywood for this belief. We 'think' not because our brains are powerful but because they are brains. Their architecture is fractal and massively parallel in a way no current processor architecture even attempts to imitate. Simple animals with much less computing power than a desktop PC still think and behave in a distinctly lifelike way because of the properties of living brains that computers don't possess. Maybe the only hope for reproducing those qualities is to simulate a brain in software down to every individual neuron. This would require hardware many times more powerful than the brain you wish to simulate in order for it to think at full speed. When that does occur, you'll have something like the human level AI mentioned in the first example and it will get us nowhere. 

While it's a great thought experiment and a wonderful premise for science fiction I think the roots of the idea are anxiety over our own mortality, the desire to live in a unique, extraordinary time in history different from any others and the very religious desire for something more powerful and intelligent than ourselves to swoop into our lives and solve all of our problems. Singularitarians resist that description because they conceive of their beliefs as being scientific and not at all religious but they both are appealing because they alleviate fear of death and absolve us of the responsibility of owning our own life choices.

Most of what we hope for a Singularity level mega-AI to accomplish can be accomplished just by genetically enhancing human intelligence. I don't think cybernetic transhumanism is likely to become prevalent because I only see white males between the ages of 14 and 30 working in tech related fields wanting to become cyborgs. Does your mother want to be a cyborg? Does your sister? How many people not working in IT are attracted to the idea of invasive surgery to make themselves more like a concept from science fiction? 

Like most futurist predictions about a technology revolutionizing everything and being used by everyone everywhere the reality tends to be that it's used in some places by some people, occupying a logical niche. Most people will have some type of implant in them but it is not likely to be outwardly visible, invasive, or extensive in the way that it replaces their natural functions. I think the only extensive modifications will be experimental, for space travel. Robotic prosthetics will be for those who lost limbs in accidents, possibly only as placeholders while an organic replacement limb is grown. Most people just want their old arm back. 

Things like life extension, genetic modification and so on will happen and are happening but you and I will not live forever. It will require that you be genetically modified before birth and everyone reading this has already been born. I don't mean to bring anyone down with this but there's a sort of evangelistic mania surrounding the Singularity on this subreddit and I think people should recalibrate their expectations so they don't wind up bitter that they didn't get their immortality drugs and augments in the same way the last generation didn't get their flying cars or moon colonies.

I've been formulating a science fiction story set in the future and I'd like it to be at least somewhat plausible. The story takes place in a world where books have become relics only seen behind glass in museums. All information is digitized, strictly controlled and regulated.

In an environment where citizens rarely travel and have become completely reliant on ""the internet"" for information, would it be possible to slowly alter and eventually erase specific histories and geographic locations from the collective consciousness of people on a fairly large scale? And if so, how many generations do you think it would take for people to completely ""forget"" about, let's say, Bermuda? 

Edit: Obviously, this WAS the right place to pose this question! Thank you all so much for your thoughtful responses. And based on your responses, it seems that however unlikely, it is plausible (under specific conditions of course) and has happened or is happening already. If I ever do get around to writing this story, which has grown (in my head) from a short one isolated to one specific island to a globe trotting sci-fi adventure, I will surely give /r/Futurology the first look. Thanks again guys.

I want to collect some data.  If anyone posts prediction that has come true by now, or was supposed to and hasn't, I'll turn it into a data point.  With enough examples, we might get a view of how these estimates play out.

I have been having discussions with people who don't even know about emerging technologies. People are really excited when I mention 3D printed organs!

 Professionally, I'm studying user interface design and hope to help develop future operating systems and application platforms for them. I'm also thinking about writing a comic adaption of a story that I've read that has impacted the way that I think. 

Personally, I'm still wrangling on how to define life post-Singularity. Death is a really driving force for me to get things accomplished. However, I believe that the Singularity is probably one of the best Humanitarian accomplishments we can create for the betterment of all Humankind. ",0,1

&gt;Schmidt chuckles. (The Turing test is when you can't tell if it's human or a computer; Google Now is its ""AI"" system for telling you where to go.) He waffles a bit, talks about IBM's Watson (which won Jeopardy) and suggests that could do it in five to 10 years.

&gt;Schmidt chuckes.

Avoids directly answering the question and instead seemingly praises a competitors work.

&gt;suggests that could do it in five to 10 years.

I think these proposals don't fully appreciate the realities of rapid wear and tear on structures in harsh environments or the unbelievable expense of establishing a settlement of any significant size where every dorm sized hab module must be sent from Earth and landed on the surface by rocketry. 

I generally favor plans to either manufacture concrete buildings from Martian dust or to seal and pressurize subsurface lava tubes. But a third option occurred to me recently I thought I might share with you. 

At the stage in terraforming where pressure is sufficient for liquid water to exist on the surface and temperature is high enough to have melted the caps, Mars will have an enormous shallow sea. It will be possible to establish expansive inflatable underwater habitats at the bottom of this sea with no fear for oxygen toxicity as the reduced gravity means that pressure will increase much more gradually with depth than it does on Earth. And the water itself is what maintains the air pressure inside these inflatable habitats. Water cannot break down due to wear and tear. It's a passive, natural, not-possible-to-break method of hermetically sealing an enclosure. In the event that the membrane leaks, because positive pressure is what keeps it inflated, bubbles will leak out but water will not enter. A bit like letting some air out of a balloon a few feet down in a pool. 

The water does not just maintain pressure but is also excellent radiation shielding. Here on Earth we store spent fuel rods in specialized pools because just a few feet of water is totally opaque to even intense ionizing radiation. In addition, the water is an enormous self replenishing source of oxygen, and a much more spacious place to raise crops like seaweed and food animals like fish than any artificial structure we could put on the exposed dry land. It's habitable space for animals we can raise for food, just not as we once conceived of it. The fact that humans need rebreathers to occupy that same space is still a huge step up over requiring a full space suit for EVAs. 

Here's a video example and exhaustive description of a crudely built DIY inflatable habitat: http://makezine.com/2010/08/27/diy-underwater-bubble-room/

Those were the types of comments that were voted up.

I came to this thread for technology; I never realized I shared this space with so many people who hate the rich.

Do people actually think there is going to be a ""revolution""? There isn't. Most of the riots that occur in the country happen after teams win/lose championships.

Why are there no massive riots about income inequality? Because most people in the country have decent lives.

To think there will ever be a Unconditional Basic Income, and then to think it'll be supported by taxing the wealthy is just delusion.

How do you think these things will ever come to pass?

Recently I was speaking to someone who presented themselves as an intelligent, discerning individual; during our conversation he began to expound on the above technology and its miracle benefits.

Many people expound on Orgonite's benefits. Others claim crystals retain memory, energy, or psychic force.

Now -- I am not as scientifically literate as I'd like to be.
But I am invested in truth.

It saddens me when people whose hearts are full of hope and minds full of dreams are led astray by hucksters, pseudoscience, opportunistic lies.

Will an educated individual help me find the holes in these lies, if they're lies? I've got suspicions, but I'd be a liar if I said I could prove it false.

Why no ""wet-robotics""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1i77va/why_does_robotics_research_function_as_if_the/,zombiesingularity,1373687570,"If you take a look at robotics research, and prototypes, from ASIMO to DARPA's new ATLAS robot, robotics engineers tend to approach motion as if the skeleton is responsible for fluid motion. This is clearly false. The skeleton is nothing more than a scaffolding for the real driver behind motion, namely *soft, motorless, electro-sensitive materials*. If roboticists ever hope to achieve anything reven remotely similar to human motion/dexterity, they'll never achieve it by using motors centered around joints.

If I want to move my arm, my muscles are stimulated, almost like pulleys (to be simplistic about it), but these are stimulated by electrical signals, not any kind of motor or moving part. The signal to move my finger doesn't even need to travel all the way down to my finger, it travels to a ""pulley"" muscle way closer to the origin point of the signal, presumably so as to increase reaction time.

Do such electro-sensitive materials simply not yet exist, or are robotics engineers just completely oblivious to how biological motion occurs? This seems so obvious that it's almost a waste of time developing motor based robots that use mechanical motors around joints. The skeleton merely limits the range of motion and holds things together, it doesn't *move* anything, at all. Are there any examples of ""wet/soft-robotics"" that don't use motors, but rather focus on electro-sensitive materials that are soft and malleable, and more closely mimic biological motion?

He encouraged mathematicians to work on them throughout the 20th century. **19 of these problems were solved within the 20th century**, leaving us with a remaining of just four problems (6, 8, 12, and 16), of which two remain of huge interest in the areas of mathematics (Hilbert's 8th problem) and physics (Hilbert's 6th problem).

Following his footsteps, the Clay Mathematical Institute, in 2000, published a list of [7 important unsolved mathematical problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems) of our time, encouraging mathematicians to work on them throughout the 21st century. One of the problems is Hilbert's 8th problem, the Riemann hypothesis.

The origin of our energy is the sun, collected biochemically through photosynthesis and physically through photovoltaics.  Renewable energy, driven by primal elements - sun, wind, water.  Nuclear energy too, in refined, modular reactors where the danger of large systems is mitigated.  Farms abound, patrolled and upkept by robotic creatures designed and managed by humanity.  A beautiful balance between machinery and ecology, whereby we sustainably produce biomass year-round.  These primary production systems provide feedstocks for the secondary manufacture of consumable and industrial goods.  The extraction of Earthly minerals has ground to a minimum, whilst mining operations have taken to the heavens.  Innovation is driven by free competition amongst public and private entities.  The expansive interplanetary space allows for unfettered growth of the human spirit of industry and creativity.  A new perspective that fosters a healthy respect for the delicate balance of life on Earth.  We may fluorish as we endeavour to push the boundaries of consciousness, outward into the starry night.

________________________________________________________________

This thread is more for me than it is for you. I'm just using this as a place to organize my thoughts - any benefit derived from third parties is just a bonus. 

Do not waste time with this thread if: 

1. You are uncomfortable with a view of the future that is different than the one you hold dear. 

2. You dislike audacious predictions. 

3. You believe that extrapolation of data is completely meaningless, and has no predictive power whatsoever, and that extrapolation is always wrong. 

4. You cherish the ideas of aging, death, and poverty, and believe that it is unnatural to tamper with them.

5. You believe that work and drudgery is here to stay. 

I'll be the first to admit that a lot of what I am about to write hinges on the exponential continuation of Moore's Law. Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles roughly every 18 month. Eventually, we won't be able to cram more transistors on integrated circuits because of quantum tunneling limitations. 

________________________________________________________________

**On Criticism of Moore's Law and Its Supposed Ending**

However, the end of Moore's Law will only represent the [end of the fifth paradigm](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/PPTMooresLawai.jpg/596px-PPTMooresLawai.jpg), and will mark the beginning of the sixth paradigm: 3-dimensional integrated circuits or molecular computing (Chips are flat and we will utilize the 3rd dimension to cram thousands of times more computation into the available space) Whenever one type of technology ceases to provide us with greater computational capabilities, as was the historical case with vacuum tubes, we switch to another type of technology (Such as the transistor). Research pressure yields new advances as we run into the walls of our current technology.

[In their 2004 paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0404510), theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss and CERN physicist Glenn Starkman propose that **the exponential progress exemplified by Moore's law will continue for another 600 years and then stop due to limitations derived from the laws of physics**. 

Indeed, I believe that computers will continue to exponentially get smaller, cheaper, and more powerful for decades to come.  We are nowhere near the 5 * 10^50 operations per second that 1 kg of matter can theoretically deliver. How we will eventually reach this limit is anyone's guess; however, it is a mistake to assume that the future of computation will look anything like the comparatively primitive sort we have today. 

The computer in a 2005 smart phone was 1,000,000 times cheaper, 100,000 smaller, and 1,000 times more powerful than the computer at MIT in 1965 was. That's a **billion-fold** increase in price-performance. We will make that same billion-fold increase by the 2030s. 

This means that **in around 20 years, you'll be able to buy the equivalent of one million blood cell-sized devices for roughly the cost of a single of 2005's smartphones, and each one of those devices will be approximately one thousand times more powerful**. The effects that exponential growth of computing will have upon the world strain credulity; they will be so absurdly remarkable, that we will look back and wonder how we were able to live without them.

With that, I'd like to describe a future world to you. This future world has the potential to be more vast and beautiful than we can possibly imagine. The things that I am about to describe will seem radical. However, as billionaire founder of Spacex, Solarcity, and Tesla would tell you, it's important to think from [first principles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgKWPdJWuBQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=19m39s); what do the laws of physics tell us is possible, and how can we engineer solutions to approach those limits?

**The Singularity: An exercise in logical madness**

The Singularity is an idea of mythic proportions. Never had I before encountered an idea which has such far-reaching implications for every aspect of human civilization. It is an idea with a basis that appears logical and straightforward, but has implications that strain credulity. 

The idea of the Singularity, to me, is an idea which has at its roots the idea of exponential growth. **We constantly underestimate the long term potential of technology and overestimate the short term**, and this is mainly due to the nature of exponential growth and its effects on information technology. 

At first, things start out slowly, and to the untrained eye it often appears that nothing is really happening. However, even a small number that's doubled consistently will eventually grow with *blinding speed*. Exponential growth is something that's most easily observed in information technology, with the most widely known example being Moore's Law. However, Moore's law is really only one example of exponential growth, and I'll discuss others shortly. 

The exponential growth of information technology has **set humanity down a road that is so mind-boggling that it is often difficult to articulate with words just how much humanity will change in the next few decades**. The reason is that any technology that becomes linked to information technology itself begins to grow exponentially, like an old man hitching a ride on a speeding bullet train to the future.  

Looking at solar power costs halving, the exponential growth of the internet, and DNA sequencing costs and volume, it becomes clear that all of these technologies are now concretely improving on an exponential curve, in terms of costs and effectiveness.  

There are three components that will irreversibly and utterly transform our future landscape. These are biotechnology, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence. But before we really dive into that world, I'd like to discuss exponential progress.

**Exponential Growth and the Story of a Drop of Water**

Whenever I tell people about an exponential trend, they tend to look at me a little funny and ask, So what? I hope the following story ([taken from here](http://mobhappy.com/blog1/2010/12/16/singularity-stories-reading-list-for-singularity-background)) sheds some light about the significance of exponential progress: 

Imagine a magic pipette. It is magic because every drop of water that comes out of it will double in size every minute. So the first minute there is one drop, the second minute there are two drops, the third minute four drops, the fourth minute eight drops and so on This is an example of exponential growth. Now, imagine a normal sized football stadium. In this stadium you are sitting on the seat at the very top of the stadium, with the best overview of the whole stadium. To make things more interesting, imagine the stadium is completely water-tight and that you cannot move from your seat. The first drop from the magic pipette is dropped right in the middle of the field, at 12pm. 

Heres the question: Remembering that this drop grows exponentially by doubling in size every minute, how much time do you have to free yourself from the seat and leave the stadium before the water reaches your seat at the very top? Think about it for a moment. Is it hours, days, weeks, months?

The answer: You have exactly until 12:49pm. It takes this tiny magic drop less than 50 minutes to fill a whole football stadium with water. This is impressive! But it gets better: At what time do you think the football stadium is still 93% empty? Take a guess.

The answer: At 12:45pm. So, you sit and watch the drop growing, and after 45 minutes all you see is the playing field covered with water. And then, within four more minutes, the water fills the whole stadium. This means that you think you are safe because it seems that you have plenty of time left, whereas due to the exponential growth you really have to take immediate action if you want to have any chance of getting out of this situation.

The nature of the progression of information technology is exponential. The developments and discoveries enabled by this exponential growth will seem almost absurd, if not magical... We are on the verge of the greatest flood of scientific discovery and technological innovation that the world has ever seen. The first part of the story of that transformation begins with energy.

I know this is a large topic, but I want briefly make a few observations on some of the areas which I think will be incredibly important in the next few decades. I want to briefly discuss the future of energy, biotechnology, AI, nanotechnology. Finally, I want to discuss jobs. 

________________________________________________________________

Part 1. Energy and Biotechnology. 
________________________________________________________________

**Cheap and Abundant Solar Energy**

[As shown in this graph, solar costs are dropping exponentially](http://i0.wp.com/cleantechnica.com/files/2013/05/price-of-solar-power-drop-graph.jpg). 

Solar is expected to [reach grid parity between 2014-2017](http://i0.wp.com/cleantechnica.com/files/2013/06/us-solar-grid-parity.png), which means it will cost less or be equal in price to energy purchased from the grid. The consequences of an abundant and decentralized form of power will be spectacular. 

Cheap solar energy will give humanity access to abundant energy and therefore clean water which can be produced with this cheap energy. Access to clean drinking water will save hundreds of millions of lives around the globe and save humanity billions of dollars in healthcare costs associated with contaminated drinking water. Moreover, the US would be able to drastically reduce its dependence on foreign oil, in turn lessening the chance for conflict in the middle east. 

Finally, solar would reduce our use of fossil fuels so that we no longer have to destroy our atmosphere with carbon dioxide.

It sparked greater and greater conflicts up until they were so separated and divided (and ravaged by war) that they basically dissolved into history due to being unable to come together as a single race of beings again.

Also, there is a policy that one can enact on a star system called ""Corporeal Freedom"" which describes how government regulation, social stigmata, religious and traditional values, kept a tight reign on how much a being can modify themselves; but became much more relaxed after the policy.  This all got me thinking about our own impending transhumanism.

I am curious to know what everyone thinks of the inevitable resistance to augmentation, virtualization, and so forth.

They always say it will ""dehumanize"" us (whatever *that* means...), or it is a sin against God/nature, only the rich will have it (bearing in mind how quickly exponential growth of technology spreads, i.e. faster and faster), calling it impossible, and such else.

Now as far as I am concerned, intelligent beings (such as ourselves, or some types of AIs) should be able to have any body and mind that they wish, and as soon as technology allows for such a thing to begin (though ultimately this would likely be post-singularity) no one should really be allowed to infringe on that, as it seems to me like it should be a fundamental right.

Sometime ago I saw a video on YouTube (I might post the link if anyone is interested) regarding a general and positive outlook on transhumanism as an inevitability and a necessary, that was not sensationalized and demonized (transhuman agenda hurr).  At some point in the video nearer the end the narrator talked about the conflicts this will spark and the controversy.  About how there will be those that choose to become synthetic, those that will not, or cannot.  There was also a depiction of a riot of sorts with humans holding signs with ""augmentations are a sin"" and so forth clashing against police in riot gear.  Would it really get that bad?

Do the religious and ""naturalists"" really despise the idea so much?  I was raised catholic and never saw a problem with anything transhuman, AI, singularity, etc, after I learned of them.  Now I am much more a deist for related reasons, but I could not possibly see how God so vast and alien could possibly care about us small beings let alone our ideas.  It just doesn't make sense to me how people could possibly be against the idea of transhumanism, so I attribute it to various kinds of ignorances.  Like simply not knowing enough about the concept, being indoctrinated by whatever, or other things.

How hard will they fight back?  Will they actively deny and attack those that desire such technologies?  And how much of a delay of technological progress will they cause?  The same could be asked of governments as well (before any AI controlled government is in place at least), how much would they try to prevent it?

More and more, it seems, our culture is fighting against what it perceives as a loss of privacy. But my question is this: should we be? Or should we be more flexible in our definition of what privacy is? Consider this: today anyone with an internet connection can go to a single website- Facebook- enter a name, and learn multiple details about that person's life. Fifty years ago this would have been terrifying, but today we hardly think about it; in fact, we sign up for it. Technology is changing rapidly, and with it I believe our ideas on privacy should also change. The alternative, to me, seems to be either a stagnation in consumer technology or a large amount of civil unrest.",2,3

 I have a proposition. We gather here because we seek small glimmers of hope from the future. Our current mood is produced from our expectation of what will be our tomorrow. We do not have to sit idle.

 Lets take **decisive action** to see our future unfold by setting clear goals for this community. One goal at a time. We do not move on until the goal is finished. These goals do not have to be grand in size, we can start small at first. 

There is one project that I think we can rally behind and help move along that will change the world in unforeseen ways. It will produce new wealth and will change the world as we know it. 

It is the establishment of the autonomous vehicle network.

We need to answer some questions:

What is holding back the network from becoming a reality tomorrow?

Why is the network not set up today? 

Who do we need to contact that is supporting/stopping the network? 

When do we want to make this network a reality? (*I want it now!*)

After answering a few more important questions we can decide the most critical goals to hit in this project. We can even rally to hit financial hot spots for the project if it comes to that.
Futurology, lets take action for our future! 

Please do not leave me to dream alone futurology.

Films like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""The Matrix"" have very strong dystopic settings, both from the perspective of the humans and the actions of the machines.  ""Star Trek: TNG"" also reflects an emotionless android and his sociopathic brother.  It's imagery like this that I feel creates a bias in modern society, potentially limiting the development of related technologies.

We were discussing the future with some relatives of mine and one person made some interesting remarks about unemployment and work which I want to share with you.

The first, we all fear high unemployment figures as we view things from purely economical standpoints, but we could also say, that we've managed to free 197 million people (globally) from work. I had never thought of the matter this way, we basically have a pretty straightforward measure of automation penetration across different disciplines.

The other thing he proposed was turning unemployment benefits into government artist grants (something we already have in Finland). He did this in jest, but I think he has a point.

Currently we have a major problem with the social benefits in Finland; Not working gets you unemployment benefits, and basically any work instantly removes those benefits. You have two options: either you sit at home and get money or you work all day and get slightly more money. Anything between these is a non-option, as it basically means working and not getting any more money.
If the government gave work to the unemployed instead of free money (and allowed part-time working on the side without benefit loss) there would always be incentive to work. Also, the unemployed could be put to good use. Maybe they could choose which programmes they would participate in, they could be anything from minor infrastructure improvements to elderly care, service businesses or anything depending on their skills.

Thoughts?

Some of my friends who are biologists argued that there won't be (and possibly couldn't be) any conflicts between humans and AI because their life-space (Lebensraum) is entirely different, thus, there won't be any need for the machines to turn against biologic life (humans).

Hereby I respectfully dissent.

I think that the very essence of evolution is conflict. Specifically, a conflict over scarce resources. Regardless of the fact that AI may exist in non-biologic life form, it still needs (will need) ENERGY, and always increasingly more energy as it evolves - and energy is currently a finite resource on Earth as far as I know. 

So thus - in my opinion - conflicts might still arise because of energy, a finite resource over which humans and AI will have to share - and we know from (human) history that sharing over resources between intelligent species does not work out in the long term (for example see the case of Homo neanderthalensis and other Homo 'competitors' vs. Homo sapiens).

Even though there is a pre-assumption on my part that AI will not be any 'better' in ethical terms than its creators (humans); however, why should anyone suppose that the creatures will be morally superior to their creators? if there is morality at all when it comes to survival...


So thus I think that the development of AI (at least beyond a certain point - and who knows in advance exactly when this point will come?) 
is equal to suicide on the part of humanity.

I hope that I could cast some light on the subject.

Movies that particularly stand out to me are Prometheus, Cloud Atlas, and although it's a bit older, Minority Report.

I think the thing I enjoy most are the ways the future is portrayed. A bit bleak, dark, yet everything is ruled by technology. I am a sucker for really sleek designs, as well. I loved the designs in Oblivion, and I remember really liking the technology used in Prometheus as well. I liked Minority Report because it had things like the touch screen monitors and the small spider drones that were sent in to investigate buildings. I haven't seen the movie in a long time, but I remember thinking that I wouldn't mind living in that future.

Even if we will never see the future portrayed in those movies, are there any movies you've seen regarding the future that you've loved?

Sorry if this is a bit off topic. I know most of the stuff posted here are articles, but I didn't know where else to post this. I thought it was better than /r/movies since well... I thought you guys would understand a lot better. I just want to watch another movie I can kind of fall into.",0,1

I was mainly thinking about something for low income people who won't ever be able to afford 3d printers.  I don't really know what items would be useful to print.  Just a random thought, anyone want to tell me why this is a dumb idea or a good idea?

Does anyone know of any efforts to implement the 'internet of things' in nature, so that we can track things like pollutant concentrations, water levels, temperatures, pollens and spores, etc.? This is one of the things I saw as a great potential benefit of nanotechnology when I first started reading up on it. Of course commercial interests will get most of the funding and publicity to start with, but I'm hopeful that as these things get cheaper and easier to deploy, we might get traction with things that matter very much.

And eventually, RFID chips could be small and cheap enough that they could get attached to every last blade of glass in a region worth studying (or eventually, the *entire planet!*)

Personally I reckon it would be a much more efficient form of government, especially considering the fact that we're living in a time where science and technology advances a lot faster than politics.

Do you agree and have more reasons as to why we should consider this as a possible form of government? If not, why do you think it's a bad idea?",3,0

This scenario could be possible within 10 - 20 years:

You are going out for a few drinks with friends, so you step out of your house and onto the street. There are a few cars around, most with people inside, some without.
You get out your smartphone, open the 'iCab' app, input your location information &amp; intended destination, how many passengers/luggage, and if you would like to share with other commuters for a discounted rate.
After inputing your details, the app gives you an approximate time of arrival based on GPS and traffic data - in this case it's 30 seconds (average of 1 minute in cities, 8 minutes in rural areas). It also shows you on a map, which electric iCab has been selected (using a complex algorithm based on distance, destination, passengers, sharing, charge left, etc).
The driverless iCab arrives and automatically 'syncs' with your smartphone when you enter so it can charge your account. You head off, and a short time later arrive at your destination after catching up on some emails.
A few hours later...
You have a good night but things get out of hand, and you end up drinking until you can't feel feelings anymore, so you decide to leave. You press the 'drunk' button in the iCab app (which is pre-programmed with your preferences), and one immediately pulls up. You slump inside, pass out, and awake to a loud buzzer and simulated voice informing you that you have arrived at your destination.

Due to most people (not just drunks) now using this as their primary mode of transport, many people no longer need to own their own car and traffic congestion decreases. The rate of road fatalities also drops drastically since the human element is now removed from the equation. And once it is globally adopted, this technology results in a massive decrease in CO2 emissions. 

This scenario also makes economic sense for both the public and companies who own these cabs. For example, you could have a petrol car that costs AU $30,000 to buy new, which = [yearly costs](http://www.theaa.com/resources/Documents/pdf/motoring-advice/running-costs/petrol2013.pdf):
* Car Loan Repayment: $7,200
* Registration/Tax: $650
* Insurance: $1000
* Breakdown Cover: $100
* Fuel: $3,500
* Tyres: $400
* Servicing: $600
* Parts: $650
* Parking/Tolls: $400
Total: AU **$14,500/year**
Or using an iCab you could pay 10-50/km (depending if you share or not) x 22,000km/year = **$6,600/year** (average).

For a transportation company, each electric iCab could cost $30,000 and travel 350,000km/year = $100,000 average revenue/year (this is assuming [advanced li-ion batteries](http://cleantechnica.com/2013/02/19/next-generation-lithium-ion-battery-designed-should-hit-market-within-2-3-years/) continue to get cheaper, more energy dense, and last longer).
Yearly costs:
* Car Loan Repayment: $7,200
* Registration/Tax: $650
* Insurance: $500 (less, due to lower accident risk)
* Breakdown Mechanic Fees: $200 (less moving parts means fewer breakdowns)
* Recharging: $4,600 (mostly renewable)
* Tyres: $10,000
* Servicing: $1000
* Parts: $500
* Tolls: $1000
Total: AU **$25,650/year**
Total Profit: AU **$74,350/year**
With a fleet of 1,000 vehicles = $74,350,000/year profit

If you owned one of these electric driverless cars it would cost you:
* Car Loan Repayment: $7,200
* Registration/Tax: $650
* Insurance: $300 (less due to lower accident risk)
* Breakdown Cover: $50 (less moving parts means fewer breakdowns)
* Recharging: $200 (mostly renewable)
* Tyres: $400
* Servicing: $400
* Parts: $200
* Parking/Tolls: $200
Total: AU **$9,600/year**

Some extra, random thoughts:

The app could also have a function that allows you to set a pickup time and location, for example, if you plan on going for a one way hike and need picking up at the other end in the middle of nowhere.

iCabs could also charge more $/km if you have luggage or weigh a lot (relative to height) due to the car needing more battery power per extra kilogram - thus putting a clearer monetary value on the cost of being overweight. This would hopefully encourage people to eat less and exercise more resulting in less of a burden on the healthcare system and the environment due to over consumption.

1 iCab would replace 15 regular cars.

There would be safety and security measures such as video cameras and emergency buttons, etc...

Mars One is attempting something bold and adventurous, something that pushes us forward when most people are content to simply talk about it as a sort of far-off ""some day"" event. Shouldn't we support this, no matter how the odds might be against them? How is that any different from the first attempts to reach space or the moon?

An open-source social application for the open sharing of all data.

I've begun the initial work on a project which I hope will transform the world of social networking and open up the prospect of open file-sharing to a much wider audience. The primary component of the project is the ability to network socially through the Tent protocol (https://tent.io/). With this decentralized social networking protocol, users remain in control of their data and who can see it. Instead of a centralized database of users, each user's device would ""know"" the user's ""friends,"" and would be able to group them in categories similar to Google+'s circles. Users would be able to selectively share thoughts(statuses) or media with their friends and acquaintances.

The backend of this application would be a massive storage system, used for containing all data that the user has consumed. While this is currently an impracticality due to storage limits, I doubt anyone believes that storage space will stay a relevant concern for the majority of people. Each piece of data is assigned ownership based on the same cryptographic signatures used to verify social profiles. In this way, even if a video that the user takes is made public, its ownership is maintained across the entire system.

However, the majority of the data that users interact with is not made by them or their friends - it's things like television shows, books, movies, etc. These are all pieces of media which can already be found on a decentralized sharing protocol of their own: the bittorrent network. By leveraging the power of the bittorrent protocol, this application would be able to make available the sum of human knowledge: all data that has ever been digitized. In order to watch a movie, a user of this system would be able to look it up and stream it from every other user who had also seen it, simultaneously storing the data on their device for future use by anyone. 

This would create a completely decentralized cloud with near-infinite redundancy. Users would still be in control of any data they wished to keep private, but any release would be irreversible, just like the ancient word-of-mouth system of data sharing.

The technology to create this application already exists, and the only barrier is storage space, as storing all data ever accessed by a user would take up petabytes, at least. Again, this concern will become irrelevant by the time the project comes to fruition.

I open up this project for any and all criticism, suggestion, and debate.",0,5

Basically, we would do this by shutting down the electrical signals that are going to our brain and originate from our sensory organs (skin, eyes, tongue, nose, ears). After these signals are shut down, nanobots would feed in electrical signals directly into our brain that would allow us to directly experience virtual reality with all of our senses. 

Any experience then, that we could have in physical reality, would be immediately available in the full immersion virtual reality that I described above. 

Will physical travel then become unnecessary? ",6,5

I don't believe that the government has the right to spy on you any moment they choose. You still must have subpoenas and warrants and all those other wonderful declarations issued by judges in OPEN court (looking at you, secret NSA court rubber stamping everything). 

That said, what if essentially recording the entire internet in a giant server farm is a brilliant idea? They have been recording the sum total of human electronic interaction - as a scientist this meta-data could be used to understand social networks and the human experience in a scientific and mathematic way. But of course there are very obvious law enforcement applications too; for example if someone commits a serious crime AND if you can get a legal warrant... then with a push of a button you know who he has been talking to and what they talked about as well as where he/she has been (GPS in your pocket). 

Our society has been feeding social media and data aggregating companies (Google, Yahoo, etc) for over a decade. We've already put more info about ourselves online freely and voluntarily than any NSA spy network prior to Facebook could dream of having. Google probably knows more about you than the NSA does... However... It actually is okay for the government to have these server farms recording all the data of our civilization so long as the law is very firm about what access of it is legal. Any access of it that involves our personal or professional lives online (just like offline... strange how it's much harder to open your physical mail than your email eh?) must have a warrant. 

tl;dr I'm not mad about PRISM - I'm mad HOW they did it. ",17,6

What does the next-gen OS look like? I use both OS X and Windows, and I've run several flavors of Linux before (Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, etc.). I can't help but feel like they're all working off the same basic formula, and it's an old one.
 
Up until recently I would've put my money on Linux; it's open source, secure if you know what you're doing, and the community continues to grow - especially in the developing world. However it sometimes lacks basic usability, and often there's no unified UI.
 
The Linux kernel is a wonderful thing, but what else is there out there? I'd like to think that devices like the Oculus Rift will usher in a new type of 3D OS, but not everyone will have one and there are still hardware limitations. There's also the [Ubuntu Edge](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubuntu-edge/) that's aiming to bridge the gap between your mobile devices and your desktop.
 
Now more than ever privacy, security, and encryption are issues being discussed, and there are still a lot of us who distrust the cloud. What developers/programmers are addressing these factors on the OS level?

I am suffering from homonymous hemianopsia after a bicycle accident last year (some asshole thought it'd be fun to smack me with a 2x4). My question is: does anyone know of any research or work in the pipes that could lead to a cure for homonymous hemianopsia? I know of Visual Restoration Therapy, unfortunately I am not a good candidate for that and I've heard mixed things about the ""actual"" success of said therapy. The internet hasn't really been much of a help. Not seeking medical advice, just any interesting news on breakthroughs or something to look forward to.

I'm not really sure but I was under the impression that the issue arises from a lesion between the optical tract and the visual cortex.  Is there any research on targeting specific areas to repair damage/lesions?  I've asked this question over at /r/neuroscience and /r/optometry but didn't receive any real insight into future treatments.  The info seems to be pretty scarce on the internet aside from studies done involving neuroplasticity that are pretty hit or miss.  I function fine so it isn't life or death but it'd be nice to have my full sight back someday. Hell, I'd even volunteer for experimental treatment, haha.  

I hope this is an appropriate place to get a conversation started about future treatment of vision related issues that people suffer from, I apologize if this isn't the right place. Any new information is much appreciated.",8,1

The concern is how will this majorly religious planet adapt? I doubt the current institutions will gladly roll over for this new God. What if they try to stop the creation of God-Ai?

For instance, why would a gigantic future multiconglomerate's headquarters look like a bunch of smokestacks or an office tower from today rather than like the Taj Mahal, the Temple of Jerusalem, the Palace of Versailles, etc?  Why does The Future seem to mean ""things that go beep in the dark"" with very little greenery involved?

In light of recent events and given the history of vaccines, many diseases are on the brink of extinction, leaving mankind with one less thing to deal with. When smallpox was eradicated in 1979, it opened up many different opportunities of prosperity to many people.

Nowadays, the media seems to be giving many vaccines a bad rep, and given the past and what vaccines can do for mankind, I wanted to see the public opinion on vaccines vs. the occasional differing opinion with the media and certain other people.

Looking forward, vaccination could help eliminate so many pathogens and diseases that are detrimental to mankind and could help people live better lives.

It would be great if you could help me out with getting a solid public opinion on vaccination and vaccination going forward. Thanks!

Is that kind of thing the future of the internet? If so, where are the early prototypes now? 

I was wondering why browsers are so ""dumb'""... I mean, look at Google, it can learn so much from you in an effort to make things easier for you. Why can't that technology be applied to browsers? Or even to the operating system? Why can't we have control over the AI (I say AI very loosely here) learning process (it's our data after all). 

Imagine the internet as a virtual world like WOW, with each website a country, city, town, building, house, shed, hammock, whatever. You exist as an avatar/character, and interaction with another person (friend) isn't limited to trivial things such as location (website). You know, kind of like real life... anyway, in WOW you can have pets, in this virtual internet world, your personal AI could be a pet, or robot, or plant, whatever.

Your AI would start off dumb, but the more you nurture it, feed it, teach it, etc, the smarter and more capable it becomes. We're no strangers to caring for and becoming emotionally attached to virtual lifeforms... we've all played the Sims, Pokemon, Digimon, cleaned up shit from a Tamagotchi, etc.

Even for intra-galactic travel, ships would need to be massive to house a colony of humans and their survival equipment.  For colonization of multiple planets, the energy and material requirements become massive compared to that of individual planets.  Most of the energy cost is that of launch, getting this mass of material into and out of orbit.

One proposed solution is the ""strip mining"" of planetoids and asteroids.  Find a chunk of material in space and remove its resources.  Even this solution, however, requires an energy requirement equal to the product of the mass of the remaining asteroid and the ship.  That is, building massive ships out of asteroids and then using acceleration to remove them from the asteroid will, on the large scale, still be energy intensive.

I propose a different ejection system.  Suppose we found an asteroid that would, in a targeted time span, take a near pass by a large gravity well, e.g. a star.  These passes ordinarily result in tremendous tidal forces on the asteroid, which can lead to break up, loss of atmosphere, and other breakdown.  

Now, supposed we divided this asteroid into some number of smaller chunks, each a large ship (with some ""garbage"" chunk included).  This could be a handful of massive ships or a large fleet of smaller ships.  If we can reduce or eliminate the mechanical friction between these pieces, they should break apart in the tidal forces relatively easily and at spaced intervals according to the tidal forces.  Then we have a fleet of new ships exiting a gravity well at spaced and with low material and energy costs.

Maybe that desire is misguided. 

From Zarathustra

""My death, praise I unto you, the voluntary death, which cometh unto me because I want it. And when shall I want it?He that hath a goal and an heir, wanteth death at the right time for the goal and the heir.""

In our high valuation of extended lives, could we be blind to nobler goals and the benefit of our heirs?

From essay

""The traditional idea of secularization, most strongly associated with Nietzsche, claimed that the modern idea of progress and its egalitarian values were residues of belief in God; Biblical values without Biblical faith. Modern egalitarianism and modern progress, in his view, were secularizations of Biblical values. And at the root of Biblical values was the slave morality that glorified Jewish national political failure.""

Could our over-valuation of life be rooted in biblical morals that have been secularized? Could our valuation of life be at its roots irrational?

For over a decade, UAVs, known commonly as drones, have been used for both Military Reconnaisance and Missile Strikes. The ethics of such usage have already come into question, and are already a subject of debate. However, as they have proven effective, more and more militaries are developing unmanned equipment.

The X-47 represents a new kind of UAV: a fully autonomous jet that can either scan an area or strike it. It has already made successful landings on an aircraft carrier without Human control, proving it is able to operate fully by itself. Even before this kind of technology is fielded, it has been hotly debated, and in the case of Humans Rights Watch, been suggested to be completely outlawed.

However, Unmanned Equipment, as most know, is not strictly military, as it has purposes for Civilian usage as well. Drone Swarms have been suggested to set up an immediate communications network in an emergency situation, such as for the rescuing of people trapped by a natural disaster. Drone Swarms are also capable of being used in searching for missing people, being able to cover a large amount of ground quickly.

The applications are not limited to drone swarms either. Unmanned planes or helicopters could be used by highway patrol agencies to monitor the highways for car accidents and pileups. Firefighters could use UAVs to fight forest fires, collecting water from lakes to drop it on fires, or simply using them to monitor the fires, and track their progress. Weather control agencies could use UAVs to monitor hurricanes, tornadoes and thunderstorms, and Heavily Armored UGVs could be used to get up close and personal with tornadoes, getting even more accurate readings than before.

Of course, there is also a negative aspect to this. As law enforcement agencies gain UAVs, they have the potential to monitor people inside their own homes, which can be constituted as an invasion of their privacy. 

Anyways, what do you think? What potential do you see for unmanned vehicles and equipment that I didn't mention? Any negative aspects to such usage? Feel free to comment!",4,0

It would look like this (sorry for the poor quality): http://i.imgur.com/EPuGjA2.png

Initially, the central part would be built on the ground, with only small parts near the stations bunched up, (the dashed line) and dummy cars riding on a track placed below the maglev. Then, as the dummy cars start accelerating, the centrifugal force will start pressing them to the maglev track above. Eventually as they accelerate further, they will pull the whole track above the atmosphere. (the full line) 

Then, to transport something with the hyperloop you will just exchange a dummy car for a cargo car.

What do you think?

Edit: Can you at least post an explanation when you downvote?

Edit2: here is a better picture. Above is the track after construction, below is the track with the cars running at full speed. http://imgur.com/nz7ecuF",33,5

This year will mark the first time in over a century that the US has not held the top spot. 

The quality of Chinese research is also rising rapidly, with China surpassing Russia in research quality per paper last year. China's universities and research centers are now beginning to match and become world class institutes. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is on track to surpass The University of Tokyo as the top research institution in Asia this year.

China's science funding over the last decade has risen faster than any other nations science funding in history, far out pacing the US science boom of the fifties and sixties. China has stated that its science funding will remain a top priority and has promised to continue increasing science funding by double digit percentage points annually. Which means if they match the rate of funding increase of the last decade by 2020 China will be spending over a $trillion on science annually (up from $300 Billion in 2012) which is the combined total of what all countries spent on science in 2012.

I'm personally very optimistic about China's growing contributions to human knowledge. Science is borderless, a breakthrough cancer treatment will work just as well in Guangzhou as it will in Seattle. But my fear is that the US is not recognizing and seizing this great ""sputnik moment"", which I feel is a far more serious ""sputnik moment"" (scientifically, not militarily, I don't consider China a threat) with China an actual scientific tiger, whereas the Soviets were something of a paper mache bear (the Soviets had great breakthroughs and matched the US in a number of fields but overall were very far behind). Yet US science funding could actually fall in real terms this year due to the sequestration and other congressional nonsense.

The rise of Chinese science is happening extremely quickly and extremely quietly, there are no front page stories in the New York Times announcing China's global leadership of gene sequencing, or their incredible synthetic biology teams, or their construction of the world's fastest supercomputer (33.86 PetaFLOPS that the US currently doesn't plan on matching until 2016). And I understand why they don't get announced the way Sputnik did, as advances in genetics and computers ect are much harder to comprehend and not nearly as sexy as a rocket or a satellite over your head, but the implications of the current scientific revolutions for health and wealth will be far greater than the space race could have ever been. 

I hope that China achieves some breakthrough that really kicks the US (and Europe for that matter) into high gear by forcing the government to respond. A peaceful science race between the global powers could have an incredible effect on the rate of our technological advancement, we just have to recognize there's someone worth racing against.
