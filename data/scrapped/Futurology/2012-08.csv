My mother has worked in the medical field her entire life. I know about diseases that ravage the body such as Alzheimer's and various other maladies such as cancers and mental health disorders. My father died of Alzheimer's, my grandmother from diabetes, I myself have severe depression and Asperger's.

I know we have pacemakers that can help the survival of the heart, and I know there are devices called 'Brain Pacemakers' that help with epilepsy and other disorders. I know about prosthetic limbs, I know about Oscar Pistorius and how he's going to be the first double amputee to go on to the Olympics. 

I watched my father die over six years. I saw him suffer, fall, lose his mind and lastly pass on surrounded by his family. I know people are suffering like this every day. There has to be a way we can use technology and implants to stop this disease in it's tracks, right?

How many years out are we from this?",1,1

This is a commercial perspective.
 
. 



**Surrogate 1.0** - 2024 - Model have all your memories, your voice, automated will, programmed desires and direct connection to the web, your surrogate can explain everything available on the web for a kid or to a nuclear scientist thanks to its ultra fast connection speed and ultra awesome neural intel thing. World population is stoked, it's still *very* expensive.  The machine is a reality thanks to the biggest joint venture ever, between IBM, SIEMENS, INTEL, APPLE and NOKIA. Microsoft want it's own version.


**Surrogate 2.0** - 2029/30 - All the features of 1.0 plus an algorithm of your personality and now your eyes can record/stream in HD1080, is also a phone and can cook all recipes ever to perfection. Now the machines are working on their self improvement and the 3.0 version will be completely designed BY machines.


**Surrogate 3.0** - 2033 (first self made one) - 2034 - (fist public version) Real personality and fine detailed memory to even consider your traumas and life experience (past and future) on decision making (it's still a 'repository of yourself'). People start to consider the machines desire to reproduce among humans and other bio machines (as your sperms/eggs can get ""3D bio printed as a new baby"" inside the surrogate reproductive system since this version).


**Surrogate 4.0** - Year 2042 - Humans begin to consider full switch to bio machines as the bio machine is a 102% clone of yourself, you ARE that copy. Thanks to the ""Link"" you and your bio clone can experience the same things in real time if the *link* is on (you or AKA the surrogate matrix). Humanity faces a paradigm because machines are already reproducing among themselves and are on the move to start the colonization of other planets where humans can't survive. Earth 2.0 is a real thing, bio-machine colonized. 


**Surrogate 5.0** - Year 2051 - Bio machines are creating on Mars (now with thousands bio machine citizens) a new kind of 'remote 3D printing' sending information through light. Bio machines can create other bio machines on other planets and suddenly space ships are no longer necessary for traveling (for the bio machines, as they can totally 'print' multiple copies of themselves on other planets and even other galaxies). Humans are considered a deprecated version of the bio machines. Natural humans get massive tech/health benefits from the bio machines intelligence and Earth is now interplanetarely considered to be planet 0. 


**Surrogate 6.0** - Year 2074 - Natural humans can talk for the first time with extraterrestrial beings thanks to bio machines galaxy colonizers. Humans face their ultimate faith challenge and culture trade with intergalactic species is a common thing for kids (both humans and bio machines) that born from this year on. Human language is no longer used among bio machines as machines don't need colloquial logic to 'understand' each other.

My username is NexusXtremeOne, but you can call me Nex.

I got out of college just when the economy crashed. I'm sure many here have experienced the problems described in the most recent issue of Newswseek (http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/are-millennials-the-screwed-generation.html) Upset, I figured that given a few years, things would return to normal and maybe be even better that ever.

Then I saw this: (http://2wanderlust.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/futurism-got-corn-graph-631-thumb.jpg?w=450&amp;h=368)

From the day we were born, we were fed a metanarrative. A narrative where everything was right with the world, everything would end with a happy ending, and everyone was special. Tyler Durden elaborated upon it:

&gt;*""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.""*

Long story short: Our generation and our future is doomed to the same scenario John B. Calhoun created in his mouse utopia.

That is why I am making this proposal. An alliance between subreddits with the aim of finding salvation for our generation and world. The Occupy movement has good ideas, but they're horribly organized and very prone to infiltration.The following are being considered as member candidates for this NexGen Alliance:

* [PoliticalPhilosophy](http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalphilosophy)

The bitter truth is that we already live in times where suffering need not exist, and where the relatively few things which really make us happy and healthy could already be abundant.

Fundamentally, it is a question of power. Those who have it recognise that it is a zero-sum game. For true democracy to exist, pretty much everyone currently in a position of authority would have to cede their power to a democratic entity.

Moreover, those who treasure power can never have enough of it. In /r/Futurology, we should recognize that the current structure of society will only be reinforced, deepened and made vastly more efficient by the advances we expect to witness in the next 2-3 decades.

Does anyone really believe life extension technologies will be granted to all, or that the true purpose of the Dept. of Education is really to plant seeds of wisdom and self-realisation? Surely microscopic flying robots and all-seeing drones will serve only to further the interests of those who funded their R&amp;D.

My boss for the summer has been Jerome Glenn and he is honestly one of the most fascinating people I have ever met.

In my entire time here, I have not been able to find a single topic that he couldnt shed light on, from self driving cars to neural networks to the politics of the separate regions of China. I suggest asking him about any future related topic you are curious about.


There are also several other cool things you can talk to him about. The Millennium Project is currently launching a Collective Intelligence system, which is a better way to integrate the knowledge from top experts around the world on various topics. He is far better at explaining it than I am however, so I will leave that to him. 

Additionally, he has lived a fascinating life. He has contributed text to a book with Isaac Asimov, become a certified witch doctor in Africa and is a champion boomerang thrower. He has also met many of the big names in the futurist community.

My name is Jason and Ive been spending this summer working as an intern at the Millennium Project. The Millennium Project is a global futures study organization. Every year, they put out a report called the State of the Future. You can learn more about that here.

My boss for the summer has been Jerome Glenn and he is honestly one of the most fascinating people I have ever met. He spearheaded the creation of this organization as a way to get humanity to collectively think about our future. In my entire time here, I have not been able to find a single topic that he couldnt shed light on, from self driving cars to neural networks to the politics of the separate regions of China. I suggest asking him about any future related topic you are curious about.


There are also several other cool things you can talk to him about.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/xyika/i_believe_there_is_one_and_only_one_common_cause/,Salemosophy,1344544700,"**tl;dr - I believe Acquisition/Ownership is the fundamental problem in society that manifests conflict at nearly every level of society. Does anyone else see this, or am I entirely alone on it?**

First post. I'd say go easy on me, but where's the fun in that anyway? Fire away with your comments whether you agree or not. I truly post for perspective and to also provide a defense of this opinion where others might have doubts. I seek enlightenment, and this is quite long, but please bear with me.

So, I honestly believe this - virtually every social event (war, social unrest, even day-to-day arguments about politics, the economy, etc.) that has happened throughout the history of all human civilization has been the result of the same thing... I'll get to it in a moment, but there's more. I furthermore believe that this thing/idea/concept is the impetus for how we view and treat each other in the world, that our ""human nature"", so to speak because I really don't care much for the term, is actually nothing more than behavioral reactions to stimuli that result from how we are socially trained to act towards one another in light of this social system. 

What this all boils down to is what I call the Acquisition Society. It's the social condition of having access to things through owning them, paying to use them for a period of time, or generally just making them ourselves and claiming them as our own. And we could really apply this term to virtually any known form of governance, be it to any degree from Democracy to Totalitarianism, and also in sociopolitical terms, like from Capitalism to Socialism/Communism. These -isms all seem to juggle the same question - who gets to own what. Even Religion has its own juggling match with regard to whose God should we worship or what belief system is right - as though we all strive to acquire the truth and use that as its own form of power and control over not only our lives but that of others. Intrinsically speaking, I think this argument among religious doctrine as well as in some scientific discourse has just as much to do with one's own sense of identity - or our perceived value to society.

I also think it's important to think about this system in examining what the future may one day look like, but more importantly as it pertains to 'how' we arrive at said future (perhaps long after we're dead?). And the conclusion I have arrived upon is that this Acquisition Society is in its own way a self-serving, self-perpetuating model that excludes other possible forms of social order by design - it is a model for sustaining dominion over people. So, attempting to replace this model is futile unless the ground work that is laid so significantly undermines Acquisition to the point that, as a social model, it collapses on its own - which in our current society pertains to the global network of central banks, governments, and mega-corporations like media, legal, advertising, and so forth. Money, power, control, liberty, and justice - all of these concepts, at least to me, are constructs of an obsolete system. For example, it's more difficult to define liberty without pointing out first what it means to be without liberty. It's simpler to explain what ""injustice"" is than to explain exactly what justice means. 

So, when people talk to me about how the world would be better if X, Y, or Z was done, I almost always disagree because X, Y, and Z all seem to reinvent the same model of Acquisition over and over again. For example, there are the arguments for regulation/deregulation, money in politics, managing ""greed,"" and so forth. And in all of these cases (and more) I just shake my head in disbelief that attending to any of these will really change anything. In my belief, we are currently no closer to the dream-scape of the future as cavemen were to creating the internet. In many ways, I think it's a reality that until we actually look at the way we live as the reason we don't have the future we dream of having, that's the first and only step for us to actually changing anything in the world. I don't mean to be disheartening or argumentative here, but it really seems to me like we're so bedazzled with achieving the next massive breakthrough in human civilization without recognizing just how similar our society may be to that of our stone age ancestors. On a large enough timeline, maybe we're still in the stone age, defined not by the tools we used but how we interact with one another as individuals and as a collective. I firmly believe we live in an Age of Acquisition that has been ongoing since the first cavemen crafted the first spears or claimed their territories or their women. 

So, is this a delusional state of mind, or does anyone else see it also? Thanks for reading, and I hope something is gained from discussing these views.

I've been following this wondrous subreddit for quite some time, and it has really sparked my thinking on various formerly-untouched topics. A quick bit of background so my main thoughts make more sense.

Senior university student, a week to 21 years of age, studying Computer Science and Video Game Development. I've a year left and then I'll have my Bachelor's. I love making video games and have been happily doing so for a few years.

Now, although this is something I love, I first fell in love with programming. I'm not a savant, but I am well-learned and willing and able to learn and refine as much as I can. This brings me to my first personal question I've pondered: Is making video games the best I can do for humanity?

I have an understanding of code, of information and memory, and what I know doesn't even touch what I could learn given harder studies and years more of it. In my three years of studies, I've never felt confident in myself; I've hovered around a 2.8 GPA, and always felt I wasn't completely understanding in my computer science subjects. But with proper studying and truly applying myself, I know I could understand and achieve so much more than I could now.

Is it my duty to find something I love that will further our race? Is that the way to live as a futurologist? To push myself to learn as much as I can and do whatever I can that best suites me to help advance our technologies into the future?

What are your thoughts on this kind of thinking?

tl;dr - Not sure if my talents should be used for furthering humanity instead of making video games when I know I could push myself to do so much more.",9,9

That idea has been tossed about plenty of times, but I wonder if it every will happen.

The reason is not whether or not brain mapping or some technology like it will be able to sort out neurological impulses into words, but the problem (I think) is simply our minds wander. It's hard to have complete focus on writing a 30 page report all at one time. And how would it only capture conscious thought? What about unconscious thought?

I just thought it would be hilarious and almost likely that a paper would have to be even more carefully edited so that it doesn't read:

I mean, maybe sometime this will be able to be sorted out, but right now, our minds think too quickly, and if there was a thought to text device, that would allow our brains to think even more quickly and have even more cause for error.

My name is Tracy, and I had the good fortune to stumble across Futurology because of the /r/bestof post about the optimistic future. I'm in the planning/research stages of writing a new tabletop roleplaying game tentatively called Terrorform. The basic premise is this: Earth has been so wrecked by overuse, war, etc, that the current United Earth Government (UEG) has decided that the way to save it is to terraform it. All citizens are to relocate to orbital habitats where they will live for the generations it will take to make our home new.

The hook is that not everyone makes it off the planet, and the players in the game will be playing people in that group of ""Forgotten.""

My background is largely in fantasy storytelling, so the realistic/sci-fi aspects of this game (which are many) are difficult for me to get my head around. What are some realistic ways in which this scenario could come to pass? I'm not looking for 100% accuracy based on current or imagined technology, I'm looking for verisimilitude. This needs to *feel* real.

Here is where my questions come in. 

* What circumstances would have to come to pass to make orbital stations the best option? If technology has increased to the point where orbital living is the best choice, why can't we have implemented better controls to have avoided this outcome?

* As a partial answer to the previous question, my current thought is a massive war that has recently resulted in the creation of the UEG. What kinds of technology would have to be implemented in this war to wrack the world so much that the cleanup can only be accomplished through the process of terraforming?

* Speaking of terraforming, my supposition was that technologies such as self-replicating nanoswarms would be used in the terraforming process. If such technology is available, again, why couldn't this outcome have been prevented?

* I don't need the outcome of leaving the planet to fix it to be the only one, but it need to be the outcome that is chosen for the premise of the game to work. The agenda of some kind of megacorporation strikes me a good way to have that work. Strong-arming the UEG into this choice, rather than taking a more moderate approach. This would, of course, be the same megacorporation that worked to fund both side of the war that resulted in the formation of the UEG. What current trends (minus extant corporation names) could be extrapolated to result in the scenario I'm proposing?

* As well, how far distant from our current time would this game need to take place for the appropriate technologies, and socio-political changes to have come to pass?

If this is not the type of analysis that is appropriate for this subreddit, I apologize. If it is the right place, I hope that you all will be able to help me round out the realism of my idea, and help me fill in the holes that the premise currently has.

As well, if there are questions that I didn't ask that seem pertinent, please let me know. This is an idea that intrigues me, but I want to make sure that I explore it from as many perspectives as I can so it holds up under the scrutiny of my intended audience.

TL;DR - I'm writing a tabletop RPG where people get left behind on Earth as the planet is about to be terraformed to fix its problems. How can I make sure this idea makes sense?

Recently, I've noticed a decrease in the time it takes for something to become nostalgic, check /r/gaming for proof. It seems to correlate with the rate of advancement in technology, and was slower previous to now. Older generations were nostalgic for times generations before theirs, and now we're down to a decade or less for nostalgia. 

So I predict that as the rate of technologic advancement increases, there will be an inversely proportional increase in nostalgia time. Possibly resulting in a point of infinite nostalgic retro-ness. The apotheosis of hipsters, if you will.",5,17

Are any of you redditors involved professionally with the future studies industry? How did you get involved? What are/were your qualifications? Where do you work? What kind of work do you do? Do you enjoy the work, or does it make the future a bore? What advice would you give to someone interested in this field of work? 

I know there are several large non-profit think tanks and groups that create reports and advise governments and companies. I am also interested in groups/businesses that do this work for profit, as consultants for forward thinking companies.

As for my background, I am close to graduating with a degree in Writing, Rhetoric &amp; Communication. I'm passionate about technology, societal trends, psychology, and the future. I'd love to turn my passion into a career, but I'm not sure how. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

* With the advancement of AI, a series of turing tests are used which distinguish the clever, targeting them for profundity tests and the mental conditioning involved in preparation for their taking.

* Dysfunction between tiers becomes unmanageable on the path where resentment is cultivated

* Where factions form, the cleverer who wish to, govern exploitatively.

* The aboriginals' prescience, their prewar body of knowledge, becomes intellectual property, guarded at all costs to maintain their cultural integrity and their collective chance at freedom.

* Esoteric knowledge becomes encoded as knock-knock jokes, and the profundity thereof, in the context of a specialized body of knowledge, is the key to identifying yourself as kin.

* On the contrary, the AI has a profundity function, which detects subtle correlations between broad terms, making the profundity metric unreliable if the intellectual property is compromised.

* Insiders are kept inside and outsiders are kept outside only by means of ancient knowledge ressurrected through artifacts, philosophical archaeology and compassionate practice, deepening drastically the body of knowledge with cultural relevance.

""knock, knock""
""who's there?""
""yes, he is""
""yes, he is who?""
""yes, yes he is""

Aboriginals cannot reverse engineer their operations or artifacts , do not understand their operations any better than we can extend our own understanding 10+ years into the future.

* There begins the movement to ascend the ladder. those dualities which map to the good/evil template prevent movement along the axis of literary resolution, or the cessation of suffering. they are the friction to the expression of compassion, and prevent the navigability of knowledge.

* Through compassionate philosophy, it is discovered that the author of ancient texts would have known that, some day, human understanding would become so profound that they would be able to design their offspring, in shorter and shorter periods of time, until the only valuable thing humans possess is memory, which is extracted, carefully.

* The author also would have provided a way to resolve the most fundamental dualities, to help the humans recognize their nature as being greater than what they made, they being products of the universe in all her forms and functions, in her likeness and image, not as we see her but as she is, filling the space of possibility simultaneously, wherein all effects are causes of intrauniversal operation.",0,0

All that said, I'm pessimistic about the future to the point of fatalism and depression.  This is especially ironic because I'm an engineer/scientist - one of those guys who, ostensibly, *build* the future.  Environmental collapse and its concomitant resource constraints and mass extinctions, the widening economic gulf, the rise of fanaticism... ugh.

Reading the news isn't helping me out here, and so I turn to you guys.  I'm not being at all sarcastic here - *please* convince me I'm wrong.

I am Luke Muehlhauser (""Mel-howz-er""), CEO of the [Singularity Institute](http://singularity.org/). I'm excited to do an AMA for the /r/Futurology community and would like to thank you all in advance for all your questions and comments. (Our connection is more direct than you might think; the header image for /r/Futurology is one I personally threw together for the cover of my ebook *[Facing the Singularity](http://facingthesingularity.com/)* before I paid an artist to create [a new cover image](http://facingthesingularity.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/finalv02.png).)

The Singularity Institute, founded by [Eliezer Yudkowsky](http://yudkowsky.net/) in 2000, is the largest organization dedicated to making sure that smarter-than-human AI has a positive, safe, and ""[friendly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence)"" impact on society. (AIs are made of math, so we're basically a math research institute plus an advocacy group.) I've written many things you may have read, including two [research](http://singularity.org/files/IE-EI.pdf) [papers](http://singularity.org/files/SaME.pdf), a [Singularity FAQ](http://singularity.org/singularity-faq/), and [dozens of articles](http://lukeprog.com/writings.html) on [cognitive neuroscience](http://lesswrong.com/lw/71x/a_crash_course_in_the_neuroscience_of_human/), [scientific self-help](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3nn/scientific_selfhelp_the_state_of_our_knowledge/), [computer science](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dhg/an_intuitive_explanation_of_solomonoff_induction/), [AI safety](http://lukeprog.com/SaveTheWorld.html), [technological forecasting](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9ao/longterm_technological_forecasting/), and [rationality](http://lesswrong.com/r/lesswrong/lw/7e5/the_cognitive_science_of_rationality/). (In fact, we at the Singularity Institute think human rationality is so important for *not screwing up the future* that we helped launch the [Center for Applied Rationality](http://appliedrationality.org/) (CFAR), which teaches [Kahneman-style rationality](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637/) to students.)

On October 13-14th we're running our 7th annual [Singularity Summit](http://singularitysummit.com/) in San Francisco. If you're interested, [check out the site](http://singularitysummit.com/) and [register online](https://www.thinkreg.com/events/singularity/).

I've given online interviews before ([one](http://lesswrong.com/lw/8s6/video_qa_with_singularity_institute_executive/), [two](http://lesswrong.com/lw/980/singularity_institute_executive_director_qa_2/), [three](http://singularity.org/blog/2011/09/15/interview-with-new-singularity-institute-research-fellow-luke-muehlhuaser-september-2011/), [four](http://80000hours.org/blog/17-high-impact-interview-1-existential-risk-research-at-siai)), and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have!

You should be able to completely turn around and still be in the room but with 3D glasses as your head turns the camera is still fixed also so it is no better than turning your head away from the tv. The world will not continue and expand on a tv you will just end up looking at your real life wall or floor.. not the screen and this is what glasses do.

I was interested in prosthetics few years ago but from what I saw then, honestly, looked like shit. And [what I saw in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Nx4TvGauDw) kind of surprised me and made me interested in those things again. Of course it's nothing spectacular compared to what they have the game, which is basically prosthetics that are better than normal limbs, but the fact that a prosthetic leg can already do basic things you can do with your normal leg and they already have arms with fully functioning fingers, it's just amazing. Also somewhere near the end of the video that guy says that it's a real possibility that by the year 2027 we will have prosthetics that are better than limbs. I don't know if this is true or if this is just for game advertisement purposes but just thinking that it's a possibility makes me really exited. 

   Maybe there is a TV show or blog of some sort where they constantly provide updates on the newest improvements of prosthetic technology? That video was pretty cool but too short and other videos I've found are at least 2 years old. So if anybody knows any good documentaries, tv shows or maybe cool video that are up to date, let me know! Thanks.",4,1

My question is this: how in the hell did the idea that the first act of a self-aware AI will be to murder us all get so damned prevalent? Whenever I explain the Singularity to a new person, their concern about half the time is the danger of our extinction at the hands of a post-Singularity AI. Why does this have to be the case? Is an AI with empathy really so hard to envision? If we can create an AI that can learn and expand itself on its own, is it really so much of a stretch to assume that we can instill in it a ""human like"" sense of right and wrong? ~~Muehlhauser himself in the AMA said that AI safety research is outpacing AI capabilities research (at least in the projects he's involved with), so why does everyone assume the sky is soon to be falling?~~ Turns out he actually said the opposite, but I believe my point stands regardless.

It just disheartens me that one of the first real examples I've seen of Futurology in ""mainstream"" Reddit is currently being mocked relentlessly as emblematic of ""mad scientists"" just because of an outdated idea more suited to summer blockbusters than real philosophy.

Basically, any sufficiently intelligent extraterrestrial life will create a superintelligence within a few hundred thousand years of it arising. That superintelligence should easily be able to conduct space exploration and communication even faster than the Fermi paradox states, or perhaps whatever ""as fast as possible"" really means. Does this only further lead us to believe that we are alone in the universe? I refuse to believe the notion that abiogenesis is really that unique that it only happened here. Science doesn't support it either!

But, maybe the superintelligence has been programmed with some sort of ""prime directive"" (from Star Trek) to not interfere with other civilizations. Is this something we should strive for as well, as we create friendly AI? That is, should friendly AI we create also be friendly to any potential extraterrestrial life we might find, or programed to hide it's existence from us? That raises the notion that an extraterrestrial superintelligence could be purposefully hiding all signs of its existance from us, which might explain precisely why we have never found evidence of extraterrestrial life. The paradox continues!

Today, I am one of those biomedical researchers who is involved in and surrounded by the many advancements that will lead to human immortality in coming decades. A consequence of being so close to this process, I've often wondered what ethical responsibilities we, as the purveyors of immortality, should shoulder. I realize that as things currently are, we will have very little say in how our findings will be translated into a future without death. That will be determined by things like free market forces and the inner workings of insurance companies. This doesn't seem like the best way to go about determining who does and doesn't last into the future. Not only is it obviously unfair, but it cements certain values into the future ethics of humanity in a very permanent way; people who are rich enough to be able to insist on their own immortality at any cost, for example, are more likely to score highly on metrics of sociopathy because that is the sort of character that one finds among the directors of large companies and drivers of businesses. 

Because we have the opportunity to introduce immortality to mankind in a deliberate manner, how do we (or how can we) (or should we?) choose who becomes immortal?",71,35

When you (lovingly) poke fun at their befuddlement, they're quick to point out that technology will pass us by, just like it did them.

There are two reasons why this will not be the case. 

1. The personal computer / internet revolution is perhaps one of the most significant and radical advancements in human history. There has never been a technology that has demanded such an immediate and drastic shift in the way common people live and work. It's a special case. Furthermore, the revolution has happened. There's not going to be some radically different ""Internet 2"" that will alienate Gen Y, because the framework of global/mobile communication has already been established. The most significant leap has already happened, and now that the groundwork has been laid, progress will be evolutionary (albeit obscenely fast). 

2. We grew up when consumer electronics were hardest to use, and they're only getting easier. Part of the reason many baby boomers have struggled to adapt to life in the digital era is because at first, PCs and electronics were made by engineers, for engineers. The humanization of technology that we've seen in the past decade pushes devices and services to be usable by as many people as possible. Even if technology were to make a leap as significant as the invention of the computer, tech giants now realize the competitive advantage of making products for everyday folk, and actively work to make technology accessible.

Let's suppose that we are able to harvest and deliver unlimited energy without human intervention and minimum or no maintenance requirements. Technologies like hydroelectric, solar, wind, geothermal and tidal energy.

Now that we have unlimited power, we can provide energy for all humanity without cost. With this energy we can also get clean water by pumping or desalinization, and distribute it to everyone.

So let's say that we extend this kind of automation to other sectors... like food growing. We make a farms that plants themselves, grows themselves and harvests themselves, without human intervention. Now we have unlimited food too.

What about distribution? Well, what about there are not cars, just a self driving public transport method?

So, we have food, energy, water and transport. Let's add the factories. Most factories today are almost automatized, why don't we lift it to the next level and automatize everything from the resources input to the finished product distribution?

So this way everything would be distributed and logged into distribution centers. People could go and pick anything or have it delivered to their houses without any real cost. And since everything would be logged the factories would increase or decrease the production depending on the products demands.

This way no human work would be needed for humans to live well.

So, if anyone can have any manufactured product without any cost, why is there any need for money? There isn't, money would be a thing of the past.

So what about progress some may think. Who is going to research new technologies? Who is going to cure diseases? Who is going to teach? Who is going to make videogames? Who is going to make movies? Well, everyone, without any limit. Every person that is passionate about those kind of things.

Everyone would do what they like to do, without economic limitations.

You want to research fusion power? No problems, just schedule a giant laser production to your name to the giant lasers factory. Need a new research facility? No problems, just 3D print a new one.

You want to make a movie? Go ahead, go make one, just get a 4K camera in the distribution center and the latest computers for special effects.

You want to research a cure for AIDS? Go ahead, no pharmaceutic is holding you back, you have all the resources you need, and whenever you have it ready it's going to be available for free in all the world.

You want to travel around the world? Go ahead, transport is free.

You just want to stay in your house reading Reddit? No one is going to stop you.

I wasn't around for Luke Muehlhauser's Q&amp;A about the Singularity, but I've read about his predictions about how this could go very badly for humans and I have a few questions.  I know he's not around, but I'm sure some of you will have answers to these questions and will be willing to discuss the whole thing.

First of all, can someone tell me what Singularitarians mean when they say that a superhuman AI will eventually ""optimize"" the whole planet?  I've heard this prediction that the coming intelligence explosion will begin to alter the physical world, but how so?

Second, as far as AI taking our resources, first, exactly what resources do we think this AI will want from us and, second, aren't we headed for a future full of infinite resources at some point?  Isn't it almost a given that we'll eventually find a way or ways to have more clean, renewable energy than we'll ever need?  I thought that was the consensus.  Also, aren't we headed for a post-scarcity economy where we'll have all the resources we'll ever need?  Aren't we about to start mining asteroids and using 3D printers to whip up designer materials and compounds and whatever else we can dream up?  I feel like he's not taking everything into account.

Also, I have to suspect that even if some super-villain manages to turn his brain into a quantum computer, the rest of us won't be helpless against him.  I have to suspect that enough of us will be enhanced enough to fight back and prevent the human race from being enslaved.

Finally, the article I read said that a peaceful coexistence between humans and superhuman AI would be impossible.  Why?

Even today, successful countries/cultures/peoples have negative birthrates. The highest birthrates are typically in the developing world. Property rights however won't just disappear, since at least for some time the technology to end a human being's need for work will have to be rationed.

In the past, more people was always a good thing since you could send them to work on menial labor. Very soon automatons will be doing most of this work.

What's happening is that a small portion of the population (upper-middle class and up, programmers, lawyers, doctors, financiers) is becoming exponentially more productive, but diminishing in size compared to unskilled workers for whom the demand is waning. 

This is clearly a recipe for disaster. 

George Friedman, CEO of Stratfor, writes in his book about how in ~60-80 years from now major demographic shifts will occur in the western world and Japan. A small percentage of the population will be subsidizing a massive elderly population. This will force us to compete for immigrants, both skilled and unskilled. But his writing focuses on a relatively narrow, geopolitical future and not the macroscopic shifts in human identity of futurology.

So, what are your theories on what the end of work might bring for us regarding property rights and social class?",11,19

I was born in Venezuela, went to university for film and philosophy in Miami, lived in Los Angeles 5 years hosting a show on Al Gore's Current TV network.  For the past year I have been making my own non-commercial content to inspire people to engage big big ideas.  I LOVE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and awe for BIG IDEAS... But my work is ART first.  What I share is my opinion, an interpretation, my effort at creating content that pushes people to see things in a *new way*. I am addicted to being Inspired as an antidote to existential despair. I want to celebrate the best that humanity is capable of.   [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/a-timothy-leary-for-the-viral-video-age/255691/) described my work as ""movie trailers for ideas"" and called me ""The Timothy Leary of the Viral Video Age"".

I think this society would be very humanistic.  A society where you are free to choose and everyone respects differences in opinion.  A place where ignorance is shunned and truth is not relative.  An existence where we use to technology to help and benefit all of humankind instead of using it for personal profit.  A place where we are free to explore the universe and ourselves.  We help each other make positive and logical decisions.  A place where we choose to have a better life because we can.

We don't get fat in the future because technology will only make us more capable and help us realize that staying in shape is just the right thing to do.  Making the right decisions because *we can*.  Have a real shot at **optimal existence**.

I wanted to use that information to make sure my ideas of how to use Earth all made sense.

What I've decided to do with the game is based on the answers I saw here, combined with some additional feedback from comments on my posts. The long and short of it is that I've decided to leave those details up to each individual game group. The campaigns that play out will all follow the same basic concept of a group sent to terraform a planet, with some of them somehow ending up there first, colonizing it as a means of survival. Then, generations later, the ""real"" colonists show up and have to contend with the incumbents.

That's a thumbnail sketch. If you want the full breakdown, check out [this post](http://www.sandandsteam.net/2012/08/21/focusing-down-terrorform/), and [this post](http://www.sandandsteam.net/2012/08/22/through-the-refining-fire-terrorform/) on my website.

Bionic eyes and hearing aids are already a step in that direction.

Medical ""augmentation"" is already existent too. Diabetic people can take insulin to prolong their life where they would otherwise die. A pretty serious real-world augmentation.

We realized that right now however, we mostly have these things in a sense of repairing, not augmenting. We figured mechanical augmentations will probably exist, as it would be pretty easy to sell someone ""night vision"" for example but we couldn't reach a conclusion on the subject of ""chemical augmentation"".

I'm sorry if I'm being confusing, but here it goes.

A great deal of people wake up every morning and have a cup of coffee for the caffeine that they take in. Why not have a time release on the caffeine that would coincide with your alarm clock for example. Or a watered-down version of adderol that you could release when you were feeling especially unmotivated.

For the sake of the conversation we will pretend that you have control over when the drug is released.

This is basically how narcotics work, but I'm trying to think of drug use in a more positive light. What if we could make everybody on earth 10% more productive say, or just a little bit happier. A gray area between sober and cocaine say. Or any other drug. Augmenting your glands to release chemicals that humans don't normally release.

Could this happen from a medical stand-point, and more importantly, if it were possible, would you want it?",4,8

Now, while I firmly believe purchasing a Kindle will still allow me the pleasure of calling myself part of humanity, it's the combined use and updates in technology that eventually change us. Just like the story. 

My personal answer to my question is that our humanity will remain the same. We sought to better ourselves from the birthplace of Africa and crafted ourselves tools to thrive, weapons to hunt and homes to live. We made life easier. This changing technology may just be another tool to help us thrive. That determination to better our lives, I believe, is this context of the human condition. Of course, what happens when/if technology melds our individualism into one another? Will that just be the end of our individual humanity while leaving humanity in tact?

What do you see as the 'breaking point' for our humanity?",12,14

A popular idea is that if you can't circumvent the speed of light, that it's not economical to colonise other solar systems, that [sending our dna and such](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_space_colonization) might have to be the way to go.

I'm going to arbitrarily propose some conditions that may or may not exist:

* Stable artificial wormholes are possible
* Information can pass freely through these wormholes, matter cannot
* No [time travel malarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_of_Other_Days) will screw things up

Whilst this is an arbitrary set of conditions, I would hope that it could be considered a realistic scenario.

Now what's interesting about this set up is that:

* Everyone can get broadband
* We can communicate with the Mars rover in actual real time
* We can communicate ultimately with other civilisations in real time through a matrix of wormholes

Sounding familiar? This is very like the 'internet' as we know it, played out on a galactic scale, like [stargate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate), but with always open connections between all points.

What I found most interesting that should this technology and physics limitations be true, then *this network could already have been built* and exist in some fiddly to access wormhole dimension just nearby. The universal 'internet' could be waiting for humanity to fire up their dial up router and start forwarding pictures from grandma.

Connection to the galactic internet could be man kinds last invention, as we download everything from a mind uploading device, nanobots to the latest pictures of adorable [Kzin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kzin)

I think that a ""utopia"" social order, if not a vastly improved social order compared to what we have today, could very well be possible within our natural lifetimes, say a generation or two.

As a philosopher, I approach this from the perspective of how we can educate people in the ways of living the best lives that they can.  I think education along the lines of what would lead to this sort of ""Aristotelian"" social order - [Part 1](http://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2010/06/aristotelian-life-part-1.html),
[Part 2](http://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2010/07/aristotelian-life-part-2.html) - offers the best hope for bringing humanity to a higher state (not merely technologically, but intellectually, morally, culturally, politically, etc.).  I think it can be done, and without too much time and hassle.  The  crucial question is: how?

I don't quite know at this point about the ways and means of meme-propagation, but I think the internet, a relatively new mass medium and technology, could play a central role in this informational and educational process - for speeding up the progress toward the technological Singularity etc. before humanity possibly wipes itself out.  The idea is to get as many people as possible thinking critically and creatively, and cooperating to develop the most effective solutions to our challenges.  This is based on the idea that the human intellect is the most valuable, most powerful natural resource available to us, and should be actualized to the fullest extent possible.

So how could the program of informing and educating people as to the desirability of such an ""Aristotelian life"" best be actualized, and in the shortest amount of time, using present media technology?

Thanks very much for your time, interest, input and questions.",47,26

Beware knowledgeable of recent developments/discoveries and learning about the technology itself is not enough. I want to develop a mindset that I can take with me wherever I go. I want to approach every daily problem I have as a futurologist would. This requires that I marry myself to futurology as an ideology that drives my every action. 

This requires that I understand the concept of futurology on both a philosophical and emotional level. When people ask me why my passion is important, I want to be able to answer them, and if at all possible, convert them to our cause. 

Does anyone have books/papers or any other source work that  you can suggest for me to absorb in my free time? I would be really appreciative and I can promise you that I will spread the knowledge to other budding futurologists once I absorb it myself.

Usually the economic factor is energy input costs. For example, if 'energy were no object', desalination could solve water problems around the world. Right now, Southern California drains the Colorado River dry, even though trillions of gallons of seawater lap at its beaches. Desalination has been proposed, but always, the cost (due to energy costs) makes it not economically viable. This scenario is repeated in many areas of human need: agriculture, thermal cooling, lighting, thermal heating, environmental sensing and monitoring, and so and so on all are pegged to energy as their basic economic factor -- even space travel for that matter.

So I ask ye learn'd futurists, does it all just come down to energy? If so, why don't we put a larger portion of our human energy and capital into solving this problem? One's immediate response might be, ""We already do."" True, but we work on energy production only because of economic incentive. What I'm suggesting would put investors out of their money because we want to reduce the cost to nearly nil. We'd have to do this collectively.",7,1

Why does it seem like since we've come to a cross roads of the 80s scifi.. there isn't an original resupply of scifi/predictions for the next 10+ years?

The only clear pattern seem to be space movies.  Moon, Pandorum, Avatar and Prometheus all seem to carry space exploration **and have been huge box office movies**.  Today, it seems like it could be a possible future so is this accurate to say?  Space colonization type movies are our terminator/blade runner scifi?

I know I'm wording this wrong but I still hope you get the context.

**Edit**: ok I don't mean LITERALLY.  I know Terminators are not going to be running around anytime soon. I mean the overall CONCEPTS.

I'm wondering if you share one of my pet peeves.  It pushes all of my buttons that a great many published materials implicate technology as the source of suffering, almost as a running gag it seems.  Our tools devour us and we need the cleft jawed hero to save us! (Female protagonists are allowed (Scifi is progressive!) with the exact degree of progressivism clearly shown by how much of her skin we can see on the cover.  

It bugs me, because while any tool *can* turn in your hand and bite you, the tone seems to be that every tool *will* sooner or later, so don't go making any really good ones, you wouldn't want to have to fight them later.  Part of this, of course, lies in conflict being a vital component to human storytelling, but media colors people's opinions, even when it's media they know is fiction.  So, I think the world needs more entertainment that shows technology in a more accurate light, the neutral to beneficial love interest of the human race, our secret power that, like sharp claws or giant muscles, could break us if we use it wrongly, but has led us from the trees to the Moon.  

Thus, I come here to post this post (the very same!) in which I ask you if you could turn your attention, and ideally generosity, towards a project of an artist friend of mine.  She usually works on commissions, giving her little time to create her own dreams and further her career, instead being stuck in a cycle of not having enough time to earn money with original work, so taking commission work, so further reducing her available time and energy.  Still, she has conceived a work, an assemblage of art and prose to expose more positive ideas about the future we could be building, and the sorts of futures we might want to be considering.  But she needs to get a bit ahead of the grinding cycle to have time to work on it.  

So she's started an indiegogo campaign, ([here](http://www.indiegogo.com/migrationart)) so that she might use one of our growing future tools to promote our future tools (and attitudes).  So my plea to you is to see if you can find it in your hearts, minds, and wallets, to throw her a little help in brightening people's ideas of the future, and thus, hopefully, the actual future, which we hope we get to live in.  Thanks for your time and consideration, folks!",2,9
