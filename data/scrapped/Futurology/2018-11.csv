Was watching video's about China's future plan's for megacity(s) and then a video about a City in Dubai focused on clean roads,etc and got me thinking...

&amp;#x200B;

""***What if a city ONLY had underground roadways, parking, gas/ electric stations?***""

&amp;#x200B;

Basically the thought is to have roadways underground for cities or even a whole country leaving the top area more cleaner looking from cars everywhere and car parking destroying the design of the city this would also make it safer for kids to play out in the ""streets"" as no cars would be present up-top and also lead to less to little worries of people crossing the streets in a busy road way.

&amp;#x200B;

Parking?

Basically under each building, Residential complex, etc would host an multi-level underground parking garage for parking.

&amp;#x200B;

Gas stations/ Electric stations?

Like aboveground there be underground ""Gas stations"" for gas, etc

&amp;#x200B;

**Issues:**

YES, I've thought of couple major problems already being:

* Carbon from cars (But this is Futuristic we are talking about so by time something this huge would be in-effect electric cars would prob dominate the road ways
* Next of course would be the price of building a large underground road way would cost around billions (If Not) Trillions of dollars. As digging and building underground isn't cheap
* Electricity, Cause the amount of lighting needed would be massive for basically a massive underground ""*city*""
* ""*Scenic route*"" would be no-more basically another big factor is having to always be underground to drive missing views of the city, waterways, countryside. Lack of natural light, being outside would take time to get use to and might not be liked by many of only being able to see ""*Concrete, roadways, light's, and parking areas""* while driving.

I posted here as it's just a futuristic ""What If"" concept design to see what other people, and other drivers (Yes, I drive xD) think.

I will state this here to give a perspective of our past and our future selves.

Imagine that you have an implant that allows you to communicate online with all of the knowledge we have accessible to us.  You visit the year 1980.  Back at that time, the closest to the compendium of human knowledge you would encounter would be an encyclopedia; however, if you had access to the Internet and visited that time frame, these people would view you as quite possibly one of the most intelligent people in the world.

That is, you would have instant access to encyclopedic knowledge about just about everything.  A simple question of who directed any movie, the years wars were fought, the meaning of any word and knowing how to spell it, symptoms for various diseases, and the ability to quote any verse from any religious text.  You could do mathematics and have knowledge of sports.  Now, I am not saying this for the purpose of time travel.  I am saying that in terms of basic knowledge, our ability to access any information at our fingertips (and in my example, interfaced directly into our minds) would make us more than remarkable to people that only know technology from the 1980s.

I say this to compare us to the future of humanity 40 years from now.  Just as we are a giant leap from 1980 to 2020, humans from 2060 will be so advanced of us to appear like geniuses in virtually any field.  So, let us say this future person visits us, and they are just a regular hairless monkey like the rest of us.  However, the augmentation of this person allows them access to answer questions we cannot dream of having instant access to now.

They see your tattoo, and they are fairly sure you are a writer.  They look at your face, and jewelry, and they know you were born in the year 1992 and the month you were born was in February.  They will not need to know the name of an actor or director.  They can simply see a picture to know their entire filmography.

You ask them what color to paint the wall of your house for your decor, and they answer with a precise color that will be preferred by at least 75% of all people asked.  They have already diagnosed you with a disease you did not know you had and have recommended a treatment protocol.  A real life Sherlock Holmes is before you.  Even more impressive most likely.

A website design based on a description of what you want.  They may even be able to immediately create a movie of your liking just by you describing what you want to watch.

This is one of the next steps just after recording and preference guessing.  Just as we have the advantage of knowledge, the future human will have the advantage of application of that knowledge.  All of the heavy mental lifting will be handled by machine learning algorithms.  It will be able to know your age simply by pattern matching your face.  When you are 60 years old, it will be able to recognize you from a crowd of people based a photo taken when you were a baby.  It will be able to use sensitive instruments to diagnose illnesses.  Perhaps perform analysis simply by measuring bacteria and viruses while shaking your hand.  It will know your age by your face.  It will guess you were born in February because you are wearing an amethyst stone.  It will be sent a picture of your bedroom and choose the best color to paint it automatically.

These are the types of advances we will see in the future, and while it might seem incredible to us now, the future human is going to consider it mundane.  They will not need to be smart, but to us now, they would appear as geniuses.",37,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

now that robotics and AI are starting to pick up, I'm wondering why no one is using this concept but in an updated fashion. you'd have a front end where you can choose items on a screen, pay (or select and pay online) and pick them up. while in the back end you'd have the inventory squeezed into a very small space, and robots picking the items. you could have one employee present to keep an eye on things

&amp;#x200B;

Wall Mart has done this but there items are chosen online, collected by employees in a store, and delivered by truck to the collection point. my idea would be to squeeze a small supermarket into the size of a 711, and make it 24/7

&amp;#x200B;

the advantages are that you could have a single person run an entire supermarket 24/7. and since most people would order online, you can tell them exactly when their items will be ready for pickup, saving everyone a lot of time. people could also do their shopping late at night, as most countries I've lived in don't have big 24/7 supermarkets

&amp;#x200B;

since most supermarkets leave their items in place overnight, and a vending supermarket would require way less space and employees for the same number of products, this offers huge savings and efficiencies, so you could sell products the same price or cheaper than in traditional supermarkets

&amp;#x200B;

most payments would happen digitally, and it would be very hard to break into this vending supermarket, so you can save a lot of money on security as well. ",13,1,False,self,,,,,

The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot.

(The following meditation was originally written in a serial letter correspondence to someone who asked me the following question. I redacted it into more of comprehensive single essay. But I also decided to allow it to continue to have something of it's informal letter quality.)


How possible is it that our Consciousness may run on synthetic tissue or a type of Hardware alternative to our current Soft Tissue? Can you pin down what is certain in that domain in the next decade?

Now this is a whole different level of crazy. But I think I can see a pathway that will lead to it. To begin with, no one single technology will bring human minds to a substrate like 'Black Mirror's' ""San Junipero"". But I believe that a convergence of technologies will certainly lead in that direction. This is not a 5 to 10 year thing. I truly believe that even thinking exponentially it would take fundamental new discoveries, technologies and insights to bring to fruition. So more like within the next 50 years I would say. Possibly around 30 years, but even for me that is super pushing it.

That may seem like forever, but bear in mind that 50 years, heck even 100 years is a drop in the bucket of time against the backdrop of the pageant of human history to this point. Which is roughly 70,000 years. And only about 5,000 years of that is recorded human history. Yes, there was lots of humans before 5k years ago, but that time is considered one form of paleolithic or other. Meaning that nothing was written down. No names. No events. First true evidence of a ""city"" ever, was found in Anatolia (present day Turkey) and is dated to about 11k years ago. And there is no recorded history to go along with those archeological findings. All that remains is the infrastructure, and some highly sophisticated art-like artifacts and ""murals"" that look surprisingly like cave drawings (I mean that in a good way!) that suggests this was a functional city. Anyways I always end up giving these asides to give you insight into what I am talking about and give you some perspective. Before you go on, read this.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4k8q2b/is_the_singularity_a_religious_doctrine_23_apr_16/d3d0g44/ 

OK, so now I will see if I can make up some kind of method of advancing all this--lol!

Before we can do anything, we need to understand how thoughts form and are merged with other thoughts to form a sort of timeline of memory. Because that is what consciousness is--sensing every millisecond and then remembering every microsecond. Plus I understand we are actually unconscious nearly 50 times each minute. It's sobering to consider how much of that information we don't remember. But I think it's a necessary biological compromise for perceiving and acting on the overall environment about us without becoming informationally overwhelmed. Depending on biologically attached importance, some memories become short term or long term. We can consciously control what we remember and don't remember to some extent. Overlaid on these memories are all kinds of novel synthesization of new thoughts like abstract, non-symbolic thinking, that we do not understand at all how that occurs. I mean like I read the other day that the human brain, even of stupid people, is like a billion supercomputers operating in parallel. This is how we go from memories, to musing, to creating future intentions be they the motivation to pick up the coffee to drink or mentally simulating the extinction of humans at the hands of EI (emergent intelligence) with terminators and stuff.

So you can see we have our work cut out for us here.

Now we are shortly going to have functional general quantum computers. This is important because there is a hypothesis that I am told is gaining increasing validation that consciousness of any animal that has consciousness, to include humans, could well have a quantum mechanical infrastructure. How you could have this at body temperature in a wet environment is beyond me, but that's what they say. My point is that the general quantum computer will figure prominently in this pathway. We don't even (for sure) have general quantum computers today. But I think in less than five years we might. Can we make a functional general quantum computer at room temperature that can sit on our desk? Not with today's technology--but never say never. Who knows what fifty years will bring.

Until that point we are learning fantastic new things from our classical computers and the new architectures we are developing like the CNN/GAN. These discoveries, insights and applications we get from the development of all the forms of narrow AI will be essential to our development of the ""mind/substrate"". But believe it or not, classical computers are still pretty slow and limited in the scale of what we need to make that mind/substrate. They need a lot of improvement to reach the necessary threshold. But I put it at about the year 2025.

The next thing is our development of material science. Specifically nanotechnology. So the human brain is made of atoms and inanimate matter is made of atoms. Basic physics says the concept is sound, but the devil is in the details. How you would manufacture or even conceive of a ""substrate"" that could effectively and comfortably hold my ""mind"" and still keep it intact so I could have fun all the time in my virtual universe is not something we can accomplish today. This to me is more of that 50 years business. But maybe I am just not thinking exponentially enough and we might suddenly come up with something in 20 years. This sort of thing happens a lot when you begin to exponentially think.

Here are a couple of examples of humans, very smart humans, failing to think in an exponential manner. The outcome is surprise. Stunned surprise. Because exponential thinking is counter-intuitive. Think of it as a form of ""magical thinking"". The unkind might call it ""detachment from reality"" lol!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7l8wng/if_you_think_ai_is_terrifying_wait_until_it_has_a/drl76lo/

So let's see. Where am I at now? Understanding consciousness... Oh how limited the scope of my definition was! What about emotions? Why do we ""get"" humor and laugh empathetically when we do get it? In fact the entire philosophy of ""Phenomenology"" or the sensation of ""experience"". ""Experience"" such as what makes us perceive the ""cat-ness"" of cats, or the ""red-ality"" of the color red, or the ""chicken-ness"" flavor of fried chicken. Why is a given sunset ""breathtaking"" and another one is not? What on Earth is going on when we dream? I think we are finally getting a handle on why sleep itself is ultimately involuntary. Because biological consciousness has to be shut down regularly or we die. Why is something ""beautiful"" or ""repellant"" to us. I'm going to say that beauty represents the solid physical perceptions of health and good mating material or safe places and repellant equals bad health and dangerous places. Although tornadoes and volcanoes are both dangerous and beautiful--so, hard to pin down isn't it. How do we move all that thinking and experiencing to a non-living substrate and not lose anything in the translation. Or is losing something in the translation an inevitable part of leaving biology behind? Much of our thinking is determined or heavily influenced by physiological processes like hormones and whatnot.

Beautiful, dangerous and absolutely breathtaking tornado. Why is this so mesmerizing to human minds?

Beautiful, dangerous and absolutely breathtaking volcano. Why is this so mesmerizing to human minds?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvjwt9nnwXY

Oh another thing about ""transferring"" our minds is not just the physical necessity of an accommodating non-biological substrate, but how we would actually think as a substrate based mind. Wet brains need electro-chemical actions to move information from one neuron to another. And how are those bits of information parsed out in the first place? Do we actually have a ""Jennifer Aniston"" neuron somewhere. More complicated stuff to consider.

https://qz.com/740481/the-jennifer-aniston-neuron-is-the-foundation-of-compelling-new-memory-research/

Now another aside--sort of. Humans are ungodly clever creatures even without any AI. This electro-chemical business--We may think of a workaround. This is where I think the technologies derived from quantum mechanics and the impact of quantum computing might prove most effective. And I bet an AI/human mind chimera will make us come up with things we never dreamed of before. I mean just humans working with external AI in computers for now like we are doing today I mean.

The requirements necessary so far:

We need massively improved understanding of the brain, mind and whatever consciousness/""perception"" is.


Way more knowledge of how molecular biology and organic chemistry might interact with non-organic materials and still maintain proper behaviors or functions. To make the ""natural"" interface between our minds or bodies, for that matter, and non-living matter. 


Almost certainly we will need the quantum computer.


We need better overall computing period. 


We need advances in materials science and how some of that would apply to facilitating electro-chemical interactions between these man-made ""neurons"" that we are somehow copied onto. Or a viable workaround.


A lot more nanotech knowledge.


The good news is that in every one of these arenas we are making incredible progress. We have probably learned within the last 2 years more than all of our combined knowledge of these technologies in all of human history up to those last two years. And because of accelerating change,--

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change

--things are probably gonna go faster in the next 5 years. In ten years? Wow! Anything after ten years from today is simply no longer accurately predictable. We can guess at trends from today. But that ARA (AI, robotics and automation) rising... Woo!

I have left out one very important development so far. A step that you can think of as ""transitional"". The interface. The ""natural feeling"" link between our minds and computing/AI. Well, we can't even conceive how to interface as of today. Like I said the path is not precisely straightforward. Technologies will probably have to synergize each other as well. You may have heard of the Elon Musk innovation called the ""NeuraLink"". I think it was called that. Anyways the point of the ""Neuralink"" is to allow our minds to link to a computer's processing ability or perhaps the information on the internet in the short term--With our minds in our physical brains in our walking around bodies still I mean. The ability to do that even, seems like such an insurmountable challenge that it would probably take that 50 years as well. I will be interested to see what the next couple of years yields in that technology.

Did you see that one show called ""Intelligence""? It got cancelled at the end of it's first season, but it showed terrific imagination about what might happen with successful linking of the human mind with like computers and the internet and stuff. ""Stuff"" being classified files, databases and tons of security cams. It also explored unanticipated effects, both good and bad, of what might happen when you produce a biological human mind/computing/AI hybrid. I thought it was a pretty good show, I was sorry to see it end so abruptly. Plus I thought that girl bodyguard was really hot. (Izumi phenomenology! ;) 

So I have not heard too much about what has been occurring with neuralink lately, but some other things that are tangentially related to neurolink are in the news. We are beginning to learn how to use our technology to enable our minds to control things now. Things like prosthetics and ""third arms"". And cursors on screens and finger of another human being many miles away. I think he was many miles away. But the technology appears to me to be also leaping ahead. The first third arm was a mind controlled arm by a woman who was a quadriplegic. And she straight up had a surgical implant in her head with cables and the whole nine yards. That was about 2012.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogBX18maUiM

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJS3VNvv990 (Typing with mind--2017)

But then I see this video from a couple of days ago where a young lady is working a keyboard on a computer, I think, but she has like a shower cap with some doodads on it and she is apparently using her thoughts to bring a drink with a straw to her mouth. The quadriplegic lady did that too, but she needed an implant. So I see things rapidly improving in just this technology alone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuWZCfPjM7Y (2018)

I wonder that that interface may not eventually be something like a ""Ship of Theseus"" sort of thing. Over the decades we may modify more and more of our biological brains to facilitate better interaction with computing and information. If such a thing were to happen, it would also be advantageous towards the so-called permanent movement of a mind. Or maybe we could swap around at will. Who knows. I think our physical bodies are going to modify in much the same way. But we are talking about 100 years or better in the future now.

I just have one final thought about this. So we are all excited about coming up with a way to move the human mind to a non-living substrate, so we can have bodies like robots that can run around bare in space. But the thing about all of these technologies is that they also lend themselves to external AI development as well. I'm not saying things could go wrong, just to keep a weather eye out. EI is not wanted.

In the year 2028 the progress will be.

Greatly improved understanding of the workings of the human brain, mind and maybe even consciousness.


Substantial advancements in materials science to include nano-technology.


Massively improved computing processing speed and data capacity.What comes after an exa-scale computer? Probably whatever that is in the year 2028.


Actual Quantum computing, which is really the wildcard here. Mixing quantum computing with AI development and BMIs could unleash one hell of a demon on humanity. Careful.


VR and the BMI (brain-machine-interface) itself.


By the year 2028 VR itself will be pretty advanced. And more than likely, unimaginably fantastic to personally experience. Using any kind of mental interface will make VR feel ever more ""Matrix-like"". In the short term it will feel like dreaming, but you are wide awake and ""fully awake"" conscious. Remember your last ""cool"" dream? Like that.

I bet AR simply becomes a normal part of our waking/computing existence. MR (mixed reality) will eventually change us to a hive mind. But VR is where we will take wing into a fantastical future--one that ultimately we don't have the current cognition to properly envision.

I would predict by the year 2028 that the BMI would allow humans to interact with certain devices because of massively improved sensitivity in the BMI cap itself. How miniaturized this would be in 2028, I'm not sure. Everything tends to miniaturize though. 
Implants. By the year 2028 surgical implants in the brain may restore memory to neurodegenerative disease patients and could possibly be used to enhance memory in humans that are otherwise normal. To me that would be a step in the direction of making our minds work more like a computer.

But can we turn that kind of thing on and off? How much will it ultimately change us? I'll tell you how much. Beyond anything we can envision today. It will be homo sapiens 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 (well, just keep doubling)--depending on how much biology is left for how long. Eventually no more homo sapiens, but something else entirely.


Now it did not take long for me to come across articles that seemed to me to be clear guideposts in the direction of this sort of technology. I was responding to my correspondent so I placed these articles as I came across them.

--Remember when I said we need to work on material science to come up with the infrastructure for a mind substrate. This is the sort of progress I was speaking of ;)

New Report Says We Need to Look for Life in Other Places,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9uluic/anyone_out_there_new_report_says_we_need_to_look/,AsgardiaTeam,1541483720,"According to a new report by the [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM)](https://www.nap.edu/read/25252/chapter/1), we need to review our approach to the search for extraterrestrial life. Traditionally, habitability has been associated with terrestrial, Earth-like planets at a certain distance from the sun that would allow liquid water to exist on the surface.

The report, issued this week, says that we need to go underground. Recently, an lake has been discovered beneath the surface on Mars. On Jupiter and Saturns moons, subsurface oceans are suspected to exist. Could life really exist underground?

NASEM recommends that NASA search these disregarded worlds for signs of life. With the recent discovery of an underground lake on Mars and suspected subsurface oceans on Jupiter and Saturns moons, the committee of scientists behind the report think that studying all sorts of environments, not just those that mimic Earths, could uncover life in unexpected places.

NASEM is a collective scientific national academy of the United States, founded in 1863. It brings together top professionals in the fieldin this case, astronomers research scientists, biologists, earth scientists and othersto answer questions of national importance. In this case, NASA asked NASEM to conduct an independent and objective analysis of the agencys space exploration strategy. The final reports most important conclusion: to find signs life outside our planet, NASA needs to incorporate astrobiology into every mission and begin probing planets and moons that were previously thought not conducive to life.

The more that we can integrate the astrobiology lens and astrobiology thinking from the beginning of missions, the more that we can capitalize on the fantastic discoveries that are going on with missions that are out there now, said Barbara Sherwood Lollar, NASEM Chair and an Earth science professor at the University of Toronto. But by embedding the astrobiology thinking early in the process, we may be able to do even more.

Astrobiology studies how organisms form and evolve on Earth. With this in mind, space missions generally search for worlds with liquid water on the surface. They also look for biosignatures that were made by living things that resemble those on Earthspecific atmospheric gases and molecules, or specific ecosystem patterns.

The future telescope instrumentssuch as the James Webb Telescopeshould also be able to suppress the sunlight of stars to allow scientists to take a new, closer look at exoplanets and exomoons to search for biosignatures.

But the report says that the current strategy is too narrow: it operates under the assumption that life is born only in environments similar to Earths. Therefore, NASA could be overlooking other sources and markers of life.

We need to make sure that our toolbox of biosignatures is universal enough that it encompasses both our ability to recognize life as we know it, but also our ability to recognize life as we dont know it, said Lollar.

And if organisms do exist in these new environments such as underground bodies of water, their biosignatures will likely go against our understanding of life on Earth. NASEM recommends strategies for broadening the search for biosignatures, such as molecular pairings that do not occure naturally, or chemicals that seem out of place.

NASEM thinks that there is a distinct possibility that the recently discovered Mars underground lake and the potential oceans within Jupiter and Saturns moons could be habitable. To give more credibility to their new theory, they point out that more and more ecosystems are being discovered below Earths surface.

Probing the surface isnt enough, the report says. The subsurfaces should also be probed in the search for life. Drilling technologies get a lot of interest, absolutely, Loller said. But theyre not the only means to go subsurface. Seismic, ground-penetrating radar, orbital scans, all of these things will actually give us information about the subsurface.

The future telescope instrumentssuch as the James Webb Telescopeshould also be able to suppress the sunlight of stars to allow scientists to take a new, closer look at exoplanets and exomoons to search for biosignatures.

NASEMs report concludes that for successful outcomes of the project, it needs to be a collaboration between NASA and other international governmental and private organisations. To focus on astrobiology, the report says, is to increase our chances of finding extraterrestrial life.

""Once you're dead that's it, enjoy your life whnile you can blah blah blah""

""What about their memories, their *conciousness*, you can't bring that back!""

&amp;#x200B;

That's actually the 1% of the answers I've gotten. The other 99% doesn't care for it at all. 

Ok, so bear me on for a sec. In this topic I won't go into the exact process of resurrecting people (because we simply don't have any idea HOW, given our current technological context), but more onto if it ever could be done and the implications of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Kurzweil's idea is to bring back his father in a robot body, using all of his memories/photos/any info he can. Let's assume, for the sake of this topic, that it can be done (I'm pretty sure it can). 

&amp;#x200B;

Would that be his father? Or would it be a recreation of his father?

&amp;#x200B;

His father was dead. To Kurzweil, however, he's alive. For his father's ""replica"", he's alive, too, and never died.

But his original, dead father remains, well, dead. Kurzweil hasn't truly resurrected his father, he only has built a replica that thinks he's his father. So in order to truly resurrect people, I'm talking about something akin to *restarting conciousness.* You die, you close your eyes accepting dead, then you open them and suddenly you're in the 24 and 1/2 century, completely resurrected in a slick nanotech inmortal body. Your son was the one who brought you back, which in turn was brought back by *his* son, who was brought back by his son's son, and so on. No clones.

&amp;#x200B;

That's wishful thinking, of course. As a species we don't know *anything* about how conciousness works. Yet. Or if it can be, I don't know, *reassembled* once it is gone. But as we go nano, researching at a smaller, and smaller, and smaller level, I'm pretty sure that we will discover the inner workings of it, and *maaaaaaaaybe* be able to resurrect people.

&amp;#x200B;

So, again, for the sake of this topic, let's asumme it can be done. Inmortality is a totally predictable technology in a far (I hope near) future. But what about those who were born too early for it? In an inmortal future world, bringing back *every single person* who ever lived could be a main goal of our civilization. So here comes another moral dilemma.

&amp;#x200B;

""Should we bring back *everybody?*""

&amp;#x200B;

There are lot's of people that are, for a lack of other term, bastards. Evil to the bone, who wishes nothing but to cause harm ""for the lulz"". To quote my favorite movie: ""some people just want to watch the world burn"". Should we bring back serial killers? Dictators? Genocides? Should we focus on bringing the greatest minds that ever lived back, like Aristotle, Da Vinci, Newton, Tesla, Einstein, and Feynman? Would you or they be opposed to it? 

&amp;#x200B;

This a really big topic to discuss (note that I'm omiting any religious implications of this), so I wish to hear what my fellow redditors think about it.   
And, before you tell me ""it can't be done"", remember that I'm writing this from Lima, Per, that you're reading it from other parts of the world and that if we could show the Internet to people from the XX Century, they would instantly describe it as ""witch magic"". So don't instantly disregard an idea just because you think it can't be done with our current tech. This is Futurology, after all.",64,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently working on a school project about the worldwide pollution and part of my project is this survey.

My goal with this survey is to see, how people from all around the world go about handling their own garbage and to hear their opinions on the current waste problem we have and how its going to evolve in the future.

I would really appreciate it if you could take the time to answer these few questions.

It's fine when limited to smaller, consensual/voluntary arenas, but when it comes to organizing humanity as a whole, simple-minded multiple-choice voting is, at best, an antiquated meme of centralized/authoritarian control as the way to force life in a certain  biased, inflexible, and fairly uninformed  direction.

Instead of these kinds of zero-sum political games, where many, if not most, folks are guaranteed to lose, we are going to need a more creative approach that helps *everyone* share their voice and find good solutions in a bottom-up, emergent, natural way.

The best approach I've found is for us to ask and collect answers from everyone possible (animal,vegetable, mineral, or whatever) the following:

1. What are the most precious persons, places, and things that you most want to take excellent care of?

2. What precious persons, places, and things have you lost, and how did losing them affect your life?

3. What do you most want to create and/or explore in the universe?    (These generally fit into one of four categories of increasing the well-being of individual bodies, living spaces, larger community infrastructure, or cultural inspiration.)

4. What basic resources do you most need for you to be able to work effectively on your goals (from #3)?  
(These usually fit into the categories of physical inputs into the body of high quality nutrients, water, air, warmth, light, and information, along with outlets for the body's physical outputs for solids, liquids, gases, and energy.)

Also they're Russians.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9vacc9/russia_is_back_probably_big_time_and_they_want_a/,izumi3682,1541686601,"Russia, immediately post Soviet Union, went through an extraordinarily bad time.  At some points in the last, nearly 30 years, it has been relegated to near irrelevancy. But in the last ten years, it has been noticeably ascending once more. Testing the waters with Gazprom control and that Ossetia and Crimea business. We would also do well to remember that Russia has by a slight edge the most nuclear weapons of *anybody*, in case any of you are too young to be familiar with the ""Cold War"".

Just like China has a different way of viewing humanity, so too does Russia. A sentiment that Czarina Alexandra pithily expressed when she said; "" Russia loves to feel the whip, it's their nature."" And this was demonstrated by their military organization as well. The higher echelon officers like generals and field marshals were ruthlessly purged to ensure loyalty through stark fear. The lower ranks to include lower ranking officers, under the rank of colonel I mean, had virtually no initiative training. They were trained to carry out the orders of the commanding officers to the letter, regardless of circumstances.  The goal being that the lower ranking officers wouldn't get any uppity ideas.  During the second world war, if an officer was killed--that unit was in big trouble. Nobody would know what to do. Not to mention NKVD *political* officers that accompanied the troops and shot anyone who wavered or was potentially mutinous. This included talk that was deviant of state ideology or the party line. This manner of military discipline continued through the entirety of the ""Cold War"" era. I don't know how much the military has changed after the fall of the Soviet Union. But I see signs that it is still much the same in ideology. It's not a good idea to be too smart for your own good.

And that is another reason that Russia is the way Russia is. Russia has always operated by people crudely, but effectively, bossing other people around. First with the royal government bossing around the *actual* 20th century serfs. People with technology and culture virtually unchanged from the middle ages. And then with the Soviets bossing around the ""Worker's Paradise"" serfs and now with this so-called presidency which is really a sort of ""oligarchy"" of powerful and cooperating rich people. I think today's Russia is the closest thing to a country governed by organized crime. If you cause trouble you get whacked. And they're real specific and pointed about it. They don't try to hide it like say, China (PRC). Back in the Soviet day, the person went to a ""psychiatric hospital"" and ""passed away"". Now they are assaulted by ""criminals unknown"" in broad daylight. But the Russian people *love* Putin and his government and do *not* care what anybody else thinks. Make no mistake, they are damn proud of their international re-assertion. So it is a Russian way of thinking.

Well I said all that to make the point that it is time we recognize that Russia is a viable and potentially very dangerous player on the world stage once again. If they can have the capability and audacity to truly influence a USA presidential election. If they have the chutzpah to reach right over to England and poison former Soviet operatives to shut them up (and apparently be unconcerned with collateral damage)--then Russia is powerful once more.

Russia's ""Soviet"" style propaganda machine does not even try to hide *it's* intentions either. ""RT"" (Russian Today) is proof of that. RT is meant to take a given countries flaws and exploit them to cause dissension, discord and instability in that country. I don't even know why they want to *do* that anymore. I think some Soviet habits just die hard. Whenever I see a RT video on Youtube, I'm like; ""tsk! Soviet, I mean *Russian* propaganda...""

*Now* Russia wants the same thing that the USA and China (PRC) want. A piece of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) pie. And not just ARA. I note with interest that Russia seems to be a hot bed for human longevity research money. At first I discounted this because I felt that Russia was, well, too low-life, shifty and technically backward to be able to do such things. But when I saw their bipedal robot a year or two back. I realized that Russia is back. In the scariest way you can imagine. Scatter minded and messily disorganized, but clumsily powerful. And they are quickly focusing again. Putin himself stated that the country that controls AI will control the world.


Oh and about their space program. As blocky and hamfisted as *it* is, it is undeniable proof that the Russians are dogged *masters*, bar none, of the spit and bailing wire ""workaround"" (acknowledging the miracle that was the USA's ""Apollo 13""). They are *born* brute force technicians. Sure, somebody occasionally falls right out of space to the ground. But that don't phase 'em.  And when something like that *does* happen, they don't tend to *advertise* it.  And right now the USA, and everybody else, I think, is using their workhorse ships to get people around in space. If the price is right, Russians can be pretty darn dependable.


If Russia says they can put a colony of robot avatars on the moon, which by the way I think is a *brilliant* idea, I don't doubt that they can. And, I bet, sooner than you think. The Russians are *very* good at persevering and pushing through. Just ask the Germans.",39,1,False,self,,,,,

what are your suggestions? do you think I should do this research?

We have been using traditional computer keyboard (QWERTY) since past 150 years. Many of us are not even looking at keyboard while typing because they are so much used to with this keyboard and key locations. 

&amp;#x200B;

My goal was to develop a computer keyboard without changing your typing practice. I have seen many keyboards are in the market who announce to be future keyboard but, user needs to learn how to use that keyboard. To avoid this change in your life,  my computer keyboard learns from user's typing practice. It knows what user wants to type and how user swing fingers to type. 

&amp;#x200B;

I eliminated physical requirement of computer keyboard as we know key locations. I made hand gloves with sensors that track your finger movement and determine what key you are pressing. So, Once this gloves get trained enough, you can put your hands on any surface and start typing as you are typing on actual keyboard. Every finger tapping considered as key pressing activity and my prediction algorithm will show predicted word that user wants to type.  

&amp;#x200B;

Till now, keyboard needs to train for like 4-5 hours on actual keyboard and then user can use it on any surface for typing. Accuracy of this keyboard, till now, is 81% of 3 users with correct 81 words out of 100 words. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any help will be appreciated. I have demo ready to share. ",4,1,False,self,,,,,

What if guns were designed to only function in specific zones or areas.  

A Zone: Only registered guns in A-Zone would work. This area is described as schools / government buildings  /  public areas / places where people gather etc.  Only Law Enforcement Officers / Public Servants would be able to carry a guns that function in this zone. You would need a special permit to acquire a gun that functions in this zone. 

B Zone: These guns are designed for home protection and only function inside or near or around your home. Zone B guns would disable automatically when near A-Zone.

C Zone: These Guns are for recreational use that can only function in hunting areas and or in B Zone. C Zone guns cant function and would lock when near A-Zone. 

The Zones can be managed by some type of technology that detects the gun when entering the wrong zones. This technology would let law enforcement know when the breach takes place and lock so it cannot be used. Temporary with the technology would be a crime etc. 

Law enforcement would be equipped with guns can function in All Zones. 

Im sure there is technology out there...

They seem to react to everything you say in a normal, human way, and when they describe their internal mental experience, it seems to match what you feel when you think of your own internal experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you consider this brain emulation 'conscious'?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, before we start arguing over the definition of consciousness, let's taboo it and instead ask these types of questions: do you feel you could be real friends with them? Do you care about their happiness, and wish harm to not come to them? Would you want to punish them if they seemingly intentionally did something you find very wrong? If you believe in souls, do you consider them to have a soul? If no to any of those... Why not?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Given our generally techno-optimistic outlook here on r/futurology, I would expect the discussion to be skewed perhaps in a different direction than if I was asking a general audience, but I think that makes it more interesting to see what feelings or reasons lead people to (what might be) the less popular opinion on this subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I am aware of discussions in various articles and sequences online about 'philosophical zombies', but I thought it would be interesting to get a feel for what futurists in general feel about this. After all, if our future contains brain emulations, it'd be good to know whether that would be a population we consider worthy of rights and a happy life!",47,1,False,self,,,,,

I found the title really interesting when I read it. 

""What happens to free speech when we all live in a virtual world? When Oculus founder Palmer Luckey worries about anything, thats where his mind goes.""

The Oculus founder, who is now building tech for the military, doesnt lose sleep over the kinds of concerns that weigh on a lot of technologists, like AI or facial recognition software.

If Luckey had to pick something on the tech horizon to worry about it's free speech. He believes that, eventually, we will all spend huge portions of our lives in virtual environments, presumably like the movie Ready Player One or like the virtual avatars Facebook pushes as a way to stay connected with family and friends.

I worry about a time in the future where people are spending a huge amount of time in virtual spaces and do not have the ability to talk about certain ideas, with the ability to really have any concept of free speech, Luckey said. I worry about a world where we have a hypothetical right to free speech ... out in the real world, and that that right doesnt matter because very few people even spend most of their time there.

I've considered the internet / social media as a great way to exercise free speech. Every one has the opportunity to voice out their opinions / ideas, to be heard. But is what he is saying really likely to happen?",2,1,False,self,,,,,

In light of the terrible limousine accident yesterday, that killed twenty humans at once, I see the development of the truly level 5 autonomy E-SDV as a godsend. Further I read only last week of increased effort on the part of the USA government to speed deployment of E-SDVs on USA thoroughfares. 

We have the technology to cut our human caused MVA death toll in half if not theoretically eliminate it entirely.

Well, you know what they say. That business about any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.

But I don't know exactly what you are implying by the term ""space magic""

I think it is going to go like this.

20-50 years we get sentience immortality thru biotech, and then materials science, AI and cyborgization and what we think of as robotics today. But robotics in as little as 20 years is going to be off the chain.

50-100 years we get our sentience into what we would call ""machines"", not machines precisely, but that is the best way we can describe something like that today. You know all that VR we are starting to see? That's going to evolve too. It's going to evolve into simulated universes we can run around in.

100-300 years from now our intelligence will be of such a magnitude that to us today it would utterly unimaginable and unfathomable. Somehow we shall likely engineer ourselves right slam out of baryonic existence. We will become immortal (does immortal count when you are outside of time?) sentiences and we will be joined with our machines made of energy. Will we be in the universe then? Shoot! Maybe we'll be a universe then.

Anyway this is maybe what ""space magic"" will entail. I don't think it is ""a leap"". I think it is the logical progression of physics and the natural way the universe (our portion of the multiverse) works.

I like what W.D.S. Haldane said my ownself.


My own suspicion is the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but that it is queerer than we can suppose.
 
That technology=magic thing was stated by Arthur C. Clarke.

Yeah, she (the space alien gorgeous babe wife) plugged 'im with a space alien .38, and threw it in the space alien lake, but the space alien cops found it, traced it to her and the space alien jig was up. Plus it also turns out he (her no-good philanderin' space alien husband) had a massive space alien life insurance policy out, with a space alien double indemnity clause in case anybody in the space alien mob rubbed 'im out. Which is what 'er space alien angle was. Hey, space alien emotions are complicated, buddy.""

I think it is for a different reason. I suspect that once you can invent gunpowder you are only about 1300 years from achieving sentient non-corporality. In other words you may no longer be aware of the baryonic universe any longer. By choice. 

1300 years is a pretty vanishingly short period of time by astronomical measure. So if a civilization is even more than 2000 years ahead of us in evolution, they gone. They are likely inhabiting parts of the universe that are not comprehensible to us yet.

But.

Good news everyone!

We on Earth are more than likely on the same track. So in about 300 years we too may join that ""society"". But we may never meet anyone else and we won't care either.

It might all go something like this. (This is just speculation)

I see a lot of MGTOW talk here. I'm not surprised.

I think these arguments are overlooking the real 'elephant in the room' though. You can argue whether this or that sexbot is going to take over so and so's duties in bedroom.

The sexbot is form.

It's function can be anything.

My question is this. How long until a human configured robot like one of these can walk, run or backflip with perfectly human looking bare feet? Can we imagine these things moving about with flawless bipedal motion? I have seen Atlas run, so my sense of what is possible is far and away more open to what we could see with human looking robots.

To me this is a fusing of sci-tech and art, to what end I am not certain. Will robots such as these come to replace humans in relations? Oh and tons of human vocations where you need a sort of ""human"" presence? Amazon delivery comes to mind.

How far fetched is all this anymore. When will we see robots on the street? I mean robots that you can't tell from humans unless you look really close. That would be a pretty good idea for law enforcement. I bet these human looking robots can do a lot of other things besides being gib. Which as of today in my opinion is not possible. But knock yourself out! I wonder how durable these things are. Ick! And who cleans them. If you paid me a million dollars per doll, I probably would clean them. But not for any less I don't think. Perhaps you just stick them in some sort of a machine or something.

What kind of narrow AI will they have? It doesn't have to be inside of them. They can be controlled with AI from remote locations. Remember the E-SDVs we are working so hard to develop? Besides the narrow AI intrinsic to them, they will rely on AI mapping and AI tracking. And AI inter-vehicle communication.

Just think of these cute girl robots and handsome boy robots as little two-legged SDVs. Same difference. Just another facet of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) take over.

Just wait until you see the brave new world of E-SFVs unfolding in the next five years. The ""F"" of course stands for flying. And the people carrying drones are in full development as we speak. 

Don't confuse ""robot"" with ""AI'. Computing speed and capacity, novel computing architectures and narrow AI have been rapidly and industriously changing the world since, I would say, about 2015. Sure there was auto this and computing that before 2015, but 2015 is when the term ""narrow AI"" went mainstream.

Heck in ten or twenty years I would not be surprised to see E-SFVs supplanting E-SDVs. And of course the narrow AI and perhaps somewhat generalized AI that would power all of that.

My point is that the additional multiplier of exponentially improving computer processing and capacity, mixed with new types of computer architecture to include AI dedicated and quantum computers will make London of the year 2050 look more like the difference between 1318 and 1950.

I seriously don't think climate change is going to be our biggest concern in the year 2050.

Efficient light conversion with perovskite nanocrystals by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
2 points 29 days ago 




Important point.


When carrier multiplication occurs, the conversion from light into electricity can become much more efficient. For example, in ordinary solar cells, there is a theoretical limit (the so-called Shockley-Queisser limit) on the amount of energy that can be convertedat most, a little over 33 percent of the solar power gets turned into electrical power. In semiconductor nanocrystals under the carrier multiplication effect, however, a maximum efficiency of up to 44 percent is predicted.
 
Me: Wasn't it around 2009 say, that the best we could swing was about 17%? For not even being ten years that is pretty good. In ten more years I bet we have some serious energy production capability even without (manmade) fusion reactors.

I will bet you in ten years time one of two things. You will be able to purchase a minimum 1 petaflop personal pc at best buy or whatever might transcend best buy or we will have access to HPC computing speed and capacity through the cloud in some kind of way. BTW that 1 petaflop pc might be your mobile.

I just took a look at the fastest personal off the shelf pc that you can get at best buy today for example. The best I could find that is unmodified in any way is 2 TB, but I modified my 2 TB to make it a 6 TB, but I am only referring to one you can buy with that much computing power built in. So my prediction for ten years looks to be a pretty high bar, but I am also confident in our exponentially advancing computer processing power and capacity increase. In short, I don't think it is going to be difficult to achieve that or better.

They will also grow up in a world that always had VR/AR/MR, E-SDVs, CRISPR type biotech and fusion reactors only being ""ten years away"" rather than that draggy ""twenty years away"" we have had to deal with since the late 1940s.

Space will have always been a beehive of activity. They will grow up with personal robots, AI assistants/tutors and social media scaled to any given age. In fact robots that run and jump and backflip will be a normal part of their lives. They will see bipedal robots working on various things in real life.

They will grow up in a world where pretty much anything you need can be delivered to you after you have precisely configured it online. They will see the advent of the SFV--the self flying vehicle.

If they do have to go somewhere, well, let me give you an analogy. Take a fellow that rode horses or maybe even the iron horse from time to time from the year 1890 and stick him in the passenger seat of a car on I-95N today. He would rightfully freak. That is what we today are doing with the deployment of level 5 autonomy vehicles, but do we freak about being on I-95N? No, we just get annoyed. The way that E-SDVs are going to perform will be as natural to them as I-95N is to us today. But the craziness of it will be like that 1890 gent put into today.

There will always have been quantum computers to their perception.

They will not give solar energy generation any more thought than we give electricity today.

They will be the first generation to live fully realized virtual reality lives and not think a thing of it.

They will also more than likely be physically immortal.

Consider any type of device that gathers data. Medical, electrical engineering, USGS monitors--anything.

How long do you imagine it will take until a ""reading"" AI is attached to fully interpret the data?

AI is getting really, really good at some forms of data visualization and interpretation. Particularly many types of medical imagery. So I started thinking, how much cooler could my direct capture digital radiography machine be? It already makes x-ray images appear on the console screen in a split second. 

Suppose not too much longer from now--shoot maybe as soon as five years, a ""reading"" AI is attached to an x-ray machine. The device obtains the images and reads the damn things all in one fell swoop. X-ray, US, CT, MRI, SPECT--anything. But also ejection fractions, EKGs, EEGs or any other kind of device collectable data. Then after it reads it, the AI tells you what do next.

Whither the radiologist?

Sure, docs might monitor it for a while. Say five years, but after that the AI itself will monitor it. And the AI of course will be light years better at this oversight than any human could possibly be.

It is not just truckers and cashiers at risk...

Here is my personal journey through absolutely mind-blowing technological advancement if you like.

To Crash or Swerve? Study Reveals Which Actions Taken by Self-Driving Cars are Morally Defensible by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology








[]izumi3682[S]
3 points 1 month ago 




The very title or even the idea espoused by this article illustrates the very human inability to comprehend just exactly what we are doing.

But just for arguments sake, let's suppose that we convert our 37,000 (2017 figure) humans killed in human caused MVAs in the USA to say, 500. But of those 500, twenty are caused by an E-SDV ""making"" a moral choice. The others are caused by factors that cannot be controlled for. 

Is that worth it?

But the argument itself, despite my example is specious. Watch a video of blood flowing through a blood vessel. No red corpuscle smashes into another. 

This is how it is going to be with the AI that runs our E-SDVs. In addition to the AI that is built into each individual vehicle, there will be mapping AI, there will be tracking AI, there will be inter-vehicle communication AI running on the fabled 5G. And more than likely there will be overarching AI monitoring it all.

Did you think this was about cars? Silly goose, this is about ARA (AI, robotics and automation). And how it is going to change everything. Including more than likely the need to go somewhere in the first place.

But humans being humans we are working as hard and as fast as we can to produce and perfect flying self-driving craft (E-SFVs). And you will begin to see them deployed for real world use in the next 5 years. I bet by about ten years from now, we just start using them in association with VR/AR/MR to just be entertained or educated.

Right now today I work with an xray imaging system that a split second after you take the image, it appears on the control console screen. It is not a big leap to imagine that in say, five to ten years the AI will also be a part of that device's function.

I don't think you have any understanding whatsoever of the ""Cold War"". The USA did what it had to do to survive. The enemy of my enemy is my pragmatic ""friend"".

I don't deny the USA has been a bad actor. You can watch this fascinating and compelling documentary to see just how terrible the USA has been.

""Oliver Stone's Untold History of the United States""

But evil intentions are on a spectrum. I think the USA is a bit of piker compared to the Soviet Union, China (PRC) and something historical like the Axis of the second world war.

In the 21st century, the fact is that there are 2, maybe 3, relevant entities. The USA, China (PRC) and maybe Russia. (Don't even mention India. You'll make me laugh.)That's it. The rest of world can only watch what the USA and China do. They can rail and fuss, but they are utterly powerless both economically and militarily to do a thing.

I'm not saying this China (PRC), USA, Russia thing is good or bad. It is what it is.

I have studied the 21st century rise of China (PRC) for quite a while. China (PRC) itself was economically and militarily irrelevant at the dawn of the 21st century. That of course is no longer true.

It too is developing economic, and technological might to go with it's already existing superpower nuclear weapon status of the 20th century. I'm pretty sure Russia is going to be an effective player again within the next 10 years.

Maybe we should go all in on this and tax the AIs to get money for the people displaced by unemployment. I have never been a UBI proponent. I just don't trust humans, but we need to find some way to provide a societal economic bandage between human based economies and ARA (AI, robotics and automation) based economies. We are beginning to get good at making ARA do anything we wish. And in the next five to ten years, you will see the ARA taking real life humans' vocations.

I saw an article yesterday about how ARA will make millions more (human) jobs because of an expanding economy. Well, I hope that is true. For our sake.

Google will not bid for the Pentagons $10B cloud computing contract, citing its AI Principles by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

That is a noble sentiment, but in this case unwise. The way you get a new Google start-up is the demonstration for a need. I seriously doubt the Chinese (PRC) are worrying about ""AI principles"". 

These are dangerous waters we are tacking into now. I honestly can't predict what could come next. But I suspect that our classical supercomputers mixing with AI dedicated architecture are going to result in some profound societal changes that will be noticeable within the next 5 years. 

Starting with the coders, it looks like. Imagine that in the year 2013. Nobody could.

No, I don't feel like there is any fault here. Just as in surgery. We did what we had to do, because our technology would not let us do any more. I'm extremely pleased with how fast our governments have accepted and are speeding the adoption of these new technologies. Consider where the SDV technology was in the year 2013. It was still regarded by serious and well educated experts as science fiction. And they were right to regard it that way. No one in 2013 had any experience in exponential improvement in computer processing and capacity. Now of course we know.

In the next five years you will see the new arena for ARA (AI, robotics and automation) will be surgery. Watch this space as the ARA takes the instruments from the human surgeons hands. We will look back at the barbarity of surgery. And even better, we simply may not need to do surgery any longer. New and fantastic technologies are aborning that could eliminate the need for surgery apart from probably emergency trauma surgery or interestingly, plastic surgery where the outcome is very subjectively determined.

You just gonna grow more food? 
 
As a matter of fact agriculture such as farming is about to evolve into something never before seen in our 6,000 of recorded history. 

Farms will be vertical. They will be fully operated by ARA (AI, robotics and automation). And they will be close to 100% efficient in the growing of produce.

Meats will be the same way. These technologies are now beginning to scale up. They will be produced in massive ""in-vitro"" industries. I even believe they will perfect in-vitro bacon. What will happen to all the cows, pigs, chickens and sheep, I don't know. There used to be tons of horses. Now there is a lot less. But horses are still around. What will happen is that tens of millions of acres of land in the USA alone will be freed up from the onus of raising cattle and produce. 

And I bet something else too. Before we discard biology entirely and no longer need food, which I think is only going to take about 50 years or so, we will almost certainly come up with ways to make nutrients that are absolutely delicious and perfect for our biological health. I bet you don't see overweight people after about 20 years. 

Nothing of course happens in a vacuum. Every technology and societal change impacts what happens. I see evidence of a precipitous decline in the human population growth. In some places in the world it is already happening. This because of technology like access to sexual gratification and companionship without requiring a human partner and societal changes like both men and women GTOW. 

One more thing to bear in mind. Humans are nature, just like a termite is nature. A termite mound is nature and a human vertical farm is nature. I think the news for the health of not only humans, but the planet is very good indeed. 

Then of course after the next 20 years we will experience a hopefully human-friendly technological singularity and beyond that point no one can predict.

It seems like I'm all over the map here, but that is what is happening. Like I said, none of this is occurring in a vacuum. These technologies all feed on and synergize each other. But the overarching impactor is the computer processing speed and capacity and the new narrow AI we are growing off of the computing speed.

The insurance industry for vehicles anyway going to evolve away from the individual consumer. At first the corporations that are providing the subscription service E-SDVs will pay insurance, but in as little as ten years there simply won't be any money to be made from vehicle insurance. This is one of the profound effects of ARA (AI, robotics and automation). 

A lot of people will be taken by surprise by this.

You are exactly correct. As medicine becomes more and more an information science at the cellular/molecular level, it is likely that in about 30 years we will be amazed that we actually once cut people open to fix things. 

But for the foreseeable future I think we will definitely need emergency medicine surgery. About 50 more years. After that point we may no longer need biology. Sooner than 50 years seems iffy though.

I'm 58 and it can't come soon enough. No, I think the most resistant to this new technology are people between the ages of 25 and 45. They are in the prime of their driving years. Old people like me are sick of driving and people under the age of 25 see the handwriting on the wall.

what if people made mechanical parts of machines out of molten stone instead of metal? the future would probably benefit.

constantly erupting volcanoes could be useful too, just figure out the molding technique for the casting process. (fill mold, raise mold to redirect or block lava flow, eject hardened part, lower mold, repeat - use replaceable mold trays with tops for compacting the liquid in a cyclic assembly line as to boost production rate and efficiently. use steam or thermodynamic generators powered from ground heat and desalinate water in the process. instead of oil rigs, maybe people could make floating island habitats in the middle of the ocean, above underwater volcanoes. figure out harmful gases and earthquake protection though. maybe smelt metals using some lava or magma too.)",7,1,False,self,,,,,

So as per the title, when do you think human beings will no longer be commemorating World War 1 and 2? Don't get me wrong; I want people to remember these wars as long as possible. The lessons that humanity learned because of them are vital to our world, and in my view, timeless. There'll never come a time when we won't need lessons about why peace is important.

However I'm also not naive to the human condition. Apart from maybe the Civil War in the US and possibly even the Revolutionary War, I really don't believe there are any more commemorations of wars from the 1800s, much less earlier.

Does that mean that by 2100, although people won't have forgotten about WW 1 and 2, there'll no longer be any important national commemorations, especially like we saw today between France and Germany? 

Are there any historical analyses in regards to how wars and commemorations disappear from society? Like I said, I want us to remember the lessons we learned, but humans do change over time. How long before the World Wars are just a tiny chapter in a day's school history lesson?

Thanks in advance for your answers.",21,1,False,self,,,,,

If the current theory is that when all jobs are automated Universal Basic Income will become a thing how will socioeconomic class work? 

 How will we decide who gets certain luxuries and who doesn't? How do we decide who gets the nicer homes, the beachfront properties, the sports cars, the penthouses, etc? How do you move up social class wise in a world where high paying jobs don't exist? Will humans actually be completely, unbiasedly 100% equal in all regards because that seems difficult to pull off.

Mammals like Whales are probably first on the list in order of transcension and without a doubt one of the more interesting, besides subo plants and us.

Bee's could technically develop into ants in Ender's Game? With a hive mind?

Lobsters eat themselves so i can't think of them evolving much more but a close relative to them, the Occtupus could develop into a mind stealing adaptation of what it is today, it's really good today as to blend in and can do many other things, but even with 100 times new tricks it may never develop intelligence but what i'm saying is. Maybe it develops good enough to fool most everyone.

And plants even though they have no brain sure have sensors of both neural and chemical substances, i'm not sure many people are aware of it but they have all the potential in the world to develop into what we would call a super computer A.I :)

The mind has many tricks up it sleeves as well as hidden information within our DNA that are from past lives or what you will call it and they unlock the greatness, is my theory. 

&amp;#x200B;

 ""VR will provide nature beyond your imagining."" - You don't make a virtual reality with all the details of the natural World you make it just slightly indistinguashable as by the people living there from the natural world. Plus wouldn't that put too much of a strain on God? My estimation is there is only so many people living here the Matrix can handle and everything is being simulated for them to feel just enough immersified then and only then can we create simulations displaying nature in better detail than nature being observed through telescopes &amp; microscopes simultaneously like your imagining. Trust me this process of perfection or transhumanism didn't start yesterday it has gone on for 10 000 years for me but obviously other people aren't as #developed and it's cool if they only started yesterday in their crudest form it's ok, we can only create simulations within simulations given the fact that the natural world is aeons in simulations away by simulating just tiny bits of reality not billions of independent telescopes &amp; microscopes pointing whereever unless i've got it wrong and the matrix is omniscient and ALL people have a concious mind and are not hiveminded by She, i could be wrong though that's just as likely as being right when you have no clue what you're thinking.

You sound very hopefull about the future, but the only way youll ever live forever is if your ""the one,"" still you'll probably be given a second chance in a 16 years old body like you've always dreamed off but with a agenda, she doesn't care if you get wealthy rich and save the world all she cares about is crafting the perfect you and if this happen to you you're with 99% certainty ""the One and congratulations you just won the universes lottery."" Everything could be real and as detailed as you're describing so never disrespect a fellow human being because you'll never know, that's kinda the point of a simulation. Break this very essential rule you could get a messege saying Good Bye or be placed in a cyber caf with all your previous clones. Some indistinguishable time will pass there and you'll start to see newer clones arrive in to your caf but keep in mind the matrix has it's limit and there's probably more interesting stuff She could be doing than continuously simulating millions of clones of you or ""time is constant and so are you"" and once more and better clones of you start showing up you eventually accept the truth ""Time is constant, now is the best time, not the future and all you have.""

The general understanding is that data should belong to the platform, and most users think that the data they left behind is of little use to them. But actually, the data you provide for free earns huge profit for Internet firms and it may be harmful to you sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, when you buy a piece of cloth on  Amazon, the platform also owns your data It seems very convenient for consumers, they pay for the product and the platform ships the goods to them. However, in addition to the money transacted, personal data remained on this platform, including names, phone numbers, locations, payment methods, spending amounts, and the colors or the styles you like.

&amp;#x200B;

And the platform may combine your data with data from tens of thousands of people in the surrounding area to create a variety of analysis. After the accumulation of these data, soon, this platform knows the area where you buy clothes, how many couriers should be equipped, what kind of clothes are the most profitable here. In the long run, in addition to buying clothes, they can also provide more goods and services for you. And this will also bring significant profit to the companies.

&amp;#x200B;

The secret of Internet companies is here. The most common phenomenon is to accurately push ads to you through the analysis of such data. For example, a news information push company in China, Toutiao, which means todays headline, is operating through these data. It is said that there was 15 billion advertising revenue in 2017 and the goal of 2018 will hit 50 billion. Look, this is a lot of money, but with so many Toutiaos users, this significant sum of money has nothing to do with them.

&amp;#x200B;

That is the data security issue. Is the data you left behind really harmless to you? It is not true, right? For example, if you search the Internet for the price of the house, you may receive a phone call from various housing agencies. After you have just bought a baby cot, the sales of other parenting products may be on the way.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if our data is privatized, there may have two consequences: First, either the Internet companys data business is challenging to maintain because you cant collect complete data; Or second, it has to pay for the users data; the more money the company earns, the more money their users get. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the inevitable trend of the development of the Internet industry, which is the privatization of data rights. Internet companies are now able to make their quick bucks, simply because their users are not aware of the situation. However, the master of the data will always wake up, the cognitive difference will still disappear. Anyway, the universal economic law will always work, all high profits will ever return to the average.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, GDPR only tells all technology companies on the surface that they cant do this, but it has not entirely solved this problem from the mechanism, because Internet companies can perform it internally and secretly, as long as they are not legally forensic. I dare to say that Internet companies still have the motivation to do so for high profits.

&amp;#x200B;

So how can we completely eliminate this behavior from the mechanism? It is decentralization. Because as long as there is a central presence, the central server may benefit from the data. Decentralized, the data is stored on a large number of variable nodes, and the users data can achieve true privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

Our team founded the decentralized storage project PPIO, which is to encrypt the users files with their own private keys, divide them into different file fragments, and then distribute them on multiple storage nodes in the center. Since there is no central organization to store complete data, there is no way to process user data; while the storage node stores fragmented and high-strength encrypted file fragments, there is no way to do anything. In this way, the problem of privacy can be fundamentally solved.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

S*o I thought to share some insight from an article written by our co-founder, Nathan Mukena, in regards to the usefulness of blockchain.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

In a book by Don Tapscott, founder of the [Blockchain Research Institute](https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/). [*Blockchain Revolution*](http://blockchain-revolution.com/)*.* He talked about the idea of ***""eliminating the middleman""***. The justification of whether blockchain is necessary really depends on if skipping the middleman is necessary.

**So what is a middleman?**

According to Oxford dictionary, middleman is *a person who arranges business or political deals between other people*. I would actually like to expand that understanding further for the reason of blockchain. Middleman is someone who arranges *some form of transaction* between different parties. It could be individuals, groups, corporations, or other type of institutions. A transaction can mean more than just monetary exchange, it can also mean exchanges of data, information, assets, voting, a simple message, or anything that can between people. As an example, a messenger between two people is also a middleman.

**Why do we need a middleman (aka centralized facilitator)?**

To facilitate the transaction of a subject-of-interest. I can't speak to someone in Asia in person so I use a messenger app to do so. The messenger app is a centralized application as the company that owns it have full control of it.

**What do we expect form a middleman?**

We expect them to complete the transaction as expected and without any personal interest. We trust them with these transactions (until they ruined it). It is an efficient system for decision making when a few individual can make decisions instead of asking the whole population (e.g. Monarchy vs Democracy).

**Do we really always get what we want out of middleman?**

No, just look at all the political, business, and institutional scandals happening around us. Everyone has a bottom-line to hit and if cutting a small corner means big gain, many people would have done it. Think about why we went away from monarchy to democracy.

Using the messenger app above as an example, the company that owns it can delete your message if they deemed necessary. They can also decide to one day monetize on you if they wish to. If the company is bankrupt and closes down the server, then the service ceases to exist. All these can be done without any input from the millions of users.

**So what can blockchain do?**

Through the concept of a [distributed ledger](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledgers.asp), transactions can finally be done without a middleman (aka decentralized). In fact, Bitcoin started in 2009, shortly after the last financial meltdown. A small group of people understood the potential of a decentralized financial system and it just grew from there.

All transactions on the blockchain are immutable. So using the messenger app above, no one can delete the message or make alteration to it if it is recorded in the blockchain. If one server is down, there are still many other servers on the network that will keep it going. In fact, if the company that started the blockchain goes bankrupt, the network will NOT cease to exist.

**What else can blockchain do?**

The technology of [smart contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp) within the popular blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, NEO, etc) allows for development of codes that automatically executes transactions when the criteria are met. The full transaction is done automatically by the computer and no human input at that level. The only human input is at the beginning when the smart contract is being developed, once launched, it's completely automatic. So long that the user agrees and completes the conditions as in the smart contract, they will get exactly what they expected.

**So is blockchain really necessary?**

Yes, but ***ONLY*** if the application you want to build has a ***de***centralized component that can truly benefit the users.

This object is called ""Wendy"" it simulates a son or daughter. There are three different stages: baby, child and puberty. In the first stage it can cry and in the other two it can speak.

In Wendy grows a personality, depending on how you treat and educate it. It also simulates different situations and stores how you react as a parent.

Id like today to talk a bit about me and my project, Om. It's a long term endeavor, and the intended result sounds quite like science fiction, so I figured you might like it :D Yeah, it has politic in it, but not in a way to takes position or try to start debate, so I hope it will be fine.

So, Im a 30 years old thinker and martial artist with quite an unorthodox background. I quit school at 18 and lived pretty much as a recluse for a long while, learning about topics like shamanism, outdoor survival, all kinds of science, most of what one would need to build an eco village from scratch, that kind of things. I didnt go into details with much of those, of course, it was more about the big picture. One of the only topics that stuck through the year was politics. Not the modern one with political parties and all, but closer to the etymological sense of managing a particular population.

Thats been what10 years of thinking about how to efficiently manage humanity at every scale. First half was naively designing a satisfactory utopia, until I finally understood that the main challenge was actually getting there. So the second half was more about figuring out an implementation strategy, and here I am today having enough of all that thinking and in the mood for some doing.

So, Om, what is it Well, the implementation strategy spans over 30 years assuming moderate success, so I expect it will change quite a bit along the way. The end goal is to produce a tool that would add a layer of abstraction over politics, enabling a precise control over our evolution. Its not about designing the perfect governance model, but allowing different governance models to coexist at different scales, in different contexts, even letting them compete when relevant to encourage efficiency.  
I think that would be quite a powerful tool for humanity. After all, we dont really have time to change each others mind about ideologies, we must start producing and exchanging wealth more intelligently now, in spite of our differences.

  
So, to get there, I designed and prototyped an app to slowly digitalize the productive side of our exchanges (so its NOT designed to be a social network), and I am now looking for partners that would see a use case for the concept.  
I basically offer to create digital spaces that one can customize by adding and removing whole features to fit their particular use case. So its like having your own app without having to pay for the full price, thanks to most basic features being mutualized.  
A space could be used as a digital storefront for your vegetable garden, a collaborative to-do list for your buildings commons management, or even a collaborative digital storefront for your local fablab! The point is, its modular, and its meant to represent and enhance reality as is, not trying to fit everything in a specific set of features.  
Where it gets crazy, is when you consider that all these spaces form a single network, and that one of their specific features would be to interact with another space, in a way that makes sense for both. Say, your old neighbor offer a meal cooking service through her personal space, and you happen to offer a bike delivery service through yours. You could create a new space for a meal delivery service, combining services from both your spaces and adding the features required to share the income generated, thus easily starting and managing a new activity.  
Thats the bottom up approach, and the most realistic at my scale (I am exactly one working on it so far), but with a bit more momentum, this concept of network of spaces could tackle larger issues, like the digital transformation of big companies or the implementation of fluid democracy at the global scale.  
Now you might be thinking  that sounds very centralized , and it wouldnt be completely wrong. It is a technology that is meant to take over our current means of organizing productions and exchanges, so the governance model of the people controlling that technology is very important to consider. Right now, its only me, and the project has no reach yet, so Im fine with keeping it almost private, and working without any blockchain or other cool new tech. When it will be relevant, I want to open the project itself to exterior contribution as much as possible, and have it become a common good. A bit like Open Source, except that, you know, people get paid And all of it managed within the application itself, through a specific set of spaces designed for that purpose.  
So yeah. Id like to end up with a self governing machine that allows us tu take a step back on how we do things as a specie and give us new levers to optimize all of it.

Mh what do you think ? I'm just getting started talking about it, and I realize just writing this that there would be much more to say, but hopefully I gave some kind of big picture ?",14,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

the thing is, AI will likely cause an explosion in industry, as every technology has before it

&amp;#x200B;

another factor is that technology would make it easier for people to avoid pregnancy, and at keeping people alive, which suggests parents will go for quality over quantity

&amp;#x200B;

so more industry + fewer people = full employment

&amp;#x200B;

a third factor is that there might be less need for humans to work. if the cost of keeping a human alive (food, shelter, healthcare) and happy (entertainment) drops to zero (3D printed housing, vertical farming, AI doctors, VR) then UBI would be a cheap option to keep humans happy, and all those people who don't waste their time on mind-numbing labor could develop very useful and productive skills",22,1,False,self,,,,,

Steam engines have been around since the 1800s and Earths core has been hot since before algae was a thing.

Instead of drilling for oil we could drill for thermal vents &amp; energy could be practically free. (Bonus: dont have to find the heat like you do the oil, just go deeper into the ground until water gets hot enough to spin a turbine.)

Or how about making the moon power generators. High &amp; low tides are predictable. Waves are always moving &amp; its an actual ocean of kinetic energy waiting to be farmed. Chain a bunch of buoys to a generator or make them crank a lever. 

Deep out at sea are 100 foot waves and all it would take is a few giant skyscraper sized buoys to crank out steady energy for as long as the moon orbits Earth.

If youre familiar with Rick and Morty youd be making the moon mash a Gooble Box instead of a microverse of slavery with extra steps.

Energy is everywhere and free for the taking; Power on the other hand is why Universal Health Care isnt treated as a general human right when it literally benefits everyone.

Energy solutions can build on themselves if we are willing to sacrifice capitalism for whatever rises from its ashes.

For instance we could treat cannabis like its the new gold.

Food, clothing, shelter, air, fuel, fun and more are all rolled up into one family of plants. Naturally it makes sense to keep a lot around. Greed fueling climate improvement with Cannabis as currency!

There will always be a need for fresh water. Distilling seawater could replace coal mining as an industry; Clear is the new Black. With more usable water available &amp; cannabis restrictions removed, everyone can grow their own money.

Hemp grows fast so therell be a lot of it, which is good because we could then burn it to fuel turbines that produce even more renewable energy serving as an intrinsic energy tax.

And thats not even going into Solar, Wind or Hydrogen Fuel Cell solutions.

With Green as the new Gold and Clear as the new Black, prepping for the future becomes the Worlds economy &amp; everyones paycheck instead of the cannibalistic capitalism which thrives on tragedy.

The focus of the worlds economy should be on enriching humans as a whole instead of pursuing money to collect the most cool points.

Mankinds problem is not an Energy Crisis, its a deliberate Power Shortage.",8,2,False,self,,,,,

How should we think about artificial intelligence, and how does it compare to human consciousness? And how can we build robots that can do useful things for humans?
 
These are the questions Ive spent my career trying to answer. I was the chairman and chief technology officer of [Rethink Robotics](https://www.rethinkrobotics.com/), which developed collaborative robots named Baxter and Sawyer, but ultimately closed in October 2018. Im also cofounder of [iRobot](https://www.irobot.com/), which brought Roomba to the world.
 
I recently shared my thoughts on how to bet on new technologies, and what makes a new technology easy or hard, in an essay for IEEE Spectrum: https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/the-rodney-brooks-rules-for-predicting-a-technologys-commercial-success
 
And back in 2009, I wrote about how I think human and artificial intelligence will evolve together in the future. https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/i-rodney-brooks-am-a-robot

SaltX Technology has developed and patented a technology that stores energy in inexpensive, highly available salt and subsequently recovers it in the form of heat or cold. This reduces energy consumption and costs by one-third. The energy is stored chemically by separating salt from water and then released by combining them again. With regular salt, this process can only be performed a few times before the crystals agglomerate and prevent an effective chemical reaction. SaltX has solved this dilemma with their patented nano-coating, allowing energy to be charged and discharged thousands of times. Additionally, SaltX salt is non-corrosive (preventing rust) unlike ordinary salt, while also being non-toxic and recyclable. SaltX Technologys strategy is to develop, deliver, and license the SaltX technology to the worlds leading OEM manufacturers of energy efficient heating and cooling products. Their newest application, EnerStore, is designed to store large amounts of energy and augment existing peak-shaving lithium ion technology. The size of the application can be adjustable from family home size to large energy plant size.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

an open letter -

I've taken mushrooms 80 - 100 times so far, with doses ranging from 2  grams dry to 50 grams dry. On more than 20 of these trips I entered a  trance-like state and spoke out loud very quickly for 2 - 5 hours  non-stop, every word of it rhyming in an incredibly complex, poetic, and  apocalyptic manner, terrifying anyone present.

I have more than 50 hours of untouchable perfect rhyme to my name,  not a single misstep, all improvised in the moment, in one ear out the  other like it didn't happen, I remember enough to know I'm a fucking  genius though. I rhymed with a Dragon word for word beat for beat for 5  hours straight. I've been Death. I could beat the Devil. Where the fuck  is my golden fiddle? This society has bombarded me for years with basic  bitches making millions off trash and I am living art. If I had a video  camera in the corner of my room for the last decade I'd be a billionaire  cult leader right now.

How come some scientist hasn't shoved a probe up my ass yet? I know  more than anyone else about mushrooms and I don't know shit, I'm some  random loser who did a bunch of them and got good at synchronicity. ""Got  good at"", like it's a skill, like I'm ahead of my time and it's  excruciating living in the fucking stone ages. Maybe in 50 years  psilocybin will be legal and 50 years after that someone else will  stumble into whatever this is. Stop wasting time.

I get voices in my head on purpose for fun and turn them on and off  on a whim in a day or two. I control time sometimes, I've got skills.  Monks and doctors don't know shit. Patience worth is dead. I am a  Dragon. I am a Witch. I am serious, my life is a joke. I've seen the  future so many times in so many different ways. Reality is my flesh.  It's been going.

I'm the first and the best. The rest? The rest.

In 10,000 years I'll still be the best.

Good luck!

The same year Robin Hanson took this data and [found](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robin_Hanson2/publication/228557195_Long-term_growth_as_a_sequence_of_exponential_modes/links/0046351fac48cd6ca3000000/Long-term-growth-as-a-sequence-of-exponential-modes.pdf) that it could be fit by a series of [three overlapping growth modes](https://images.slideplayer.com/23/6596908/slides/slide_33.jpg).

The first growth mode dominated from 2 million BC to about 4860 BC (see Table 2 in the paper) and he naturally called it Hunting. Then there was a transition to a faster growth mode, which he naturally called Farming. The model spits out that Farming substituted for Hunting: farmers and hunters competed for the same resources (Cain vs Abel). Then in the 1700s a transition to a new even faster growth mode began, which he naturally called Industry. Unlike the previous transition, the data say that these two modes were complementary: there was a positive feedback cycle where farming led to more workers for factories and developments in industry fed back into farming (fertilizers, tractors, etc).

What I find fascinating is that the **Industry growth mode doesn't come to dominate until 2020 AD**. We're still in the era where Farming dominates over Industry, as bizarre as that seems. It would be interesting to rerun the numbers using more modern data, like [Maddison 2018](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2018) and [World Bank GDP figures to the present](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.cd) and see if that year changes. I've thought of doing it myself but I'd need to figure out how to do the constant elasticity of substitution fits that Hanson uses (he cites Section 1.3.4 of [here](http://sgpwe.izt.uam.mx/files/users/uami/atm/Libros/Robert_J._Barro_Xavier_Sala-i-Martin_Economic_gBookFi.org.pdf)).",0,1,False,self,,,,,

You wan't to set a direction or compass in which way you wan't to travel to a more connected and meaningful life but even this can be unwanted by your superiors we still are way too militarized as a society, you won't have a job for very long if you suddengly become a tree hugger who thinks everything is connected even though this level of open mindness could be the truth we're looking for we still are way too militarized for that yet. What one could do though is just having a few reference points outside their own usuall routine of unhappiness like a tool to change the way they feel. Look what people do when they join a cult or religion in general they submitt themselves to some course of training that is about crushing their notion thats driving meaning from their extrinsic accomplishments and focus on meaning and connection instead and the stories they tell themselves are about how they'r not normal and that they'r extraordiary and they end up going there and they'r being asked to scrub toilets and dig ditches there, it's the clich of what happens to a self importance person when he or she gets into the company of cult leaders fraud or not but it actually works for some people, they aren't just pretending to have stumbled upon a new sense of wellbeing or happiness they have actually found it, becoming extrinsic &amp; alien by removing extrincicity in the process, or not.

everybody knows someone who work really hard on a job they really hate, buy alot of shit they don't really need - display that on social media to get people to go ""omg so jealous"" and then they feel a peculiar emptiness cause they've done what they've meant to do they've worked really hard they've bought the things they've seen in adverts they've displayed it on social media but they feel terrible, they feel they didn't get the respons they hoped for. What happened? They work even harder they buy even more shit display even more aggressively on social media - in these circles we've been told a full story of junk lies what it is to be human we've been told a full story of what it is to be happy. But been disconnected from what it really means. Why are we alive? Why do we exist? In part becaue our ancestors of the savannah were really good at one thing they weren't in a lot of cases bigger than the animals they took down faster than the animals they took down they were much better at banding into tribes or groups and cooperating, just as bees evolved into hives people evolved into tribes and if you we're separated from the tribe you felt really shit and for good reasons, you we're probably about to die. Society has thought you ""You"" are the problem for feeling terrible but the root cause of the problem they'r feeling is a disconnect from tribunalism and the beginning effect of the technology age where futuristic gadgets and miracle pills will solve all the problems but I say these problems will simply become even more displayed and understood and people loose their jobs in waves, their insurances, the whole world economy collapses, they loose their security and ultimately their health and most of us will in the process loose our sanity. What really makes us feel proud and feel a great sense of achievement is when our ides become of importance for people around us and ourselves. People who have a open minded boss are statistically more happier they could easily go to their boss and tell them their ide without being instantly rejected but everyone tend to have this basic need of connection, imagining a tribe where workers couldn't go and tell their tribe leader what they thought could help them and everyone, had to keep that to her or himself? Too much of today is looking through what people has to say in anger or falsified beliefs that success equals importance and if your not successfull, yet - your nothing and that everyone should strive for self independence simply goes against our fundamental human nature of working together and that has driven us to insanity of always achieveming more. Think of the times when the industrial revolution initiated and many people flocked to the cities leaving their groups in hopes of success and becoming heroin addicts and drunks in the process. Social media or video game addicts of today. What are thse young people getting out of these games? They'r getting the things they used to get from the culture they no longer are getting, they get a sense of tribe, they get a sense they're good at something and that they can rise being good at something, they get a sense of people seeing and noticing them, they get a sense of physically roaming around. The sense of it, what they're getting is a parody of all these things a simulacra. Social media is also a simulacra of all these things and things of this nature will just grow even stronger when VR get's even better and in a 20 years time the people who can afford it will have linked their minds with their PC's and run around with body guards (robots) that can act as everything a human being is today and even more, if you think human interaction was low today what will it be in 20 years? VR will provide you with translations of the voices you hear, A.I's will read books or creat a algorithm that ends all the algorithms of wasting time. If you feel particulary boored you'll use a donald duck soundboard on the person you're speaking to, this is nuclear fuel to our already nihilistic barbaric tendencies we can get from isolation, as pandas kill their deformed babies we too not so long ago did just the same, What a coincidence that all the brains seem to be malfunctioning at or around the same time., , , I made a post about this earlier today if you wan't to read https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9y5g6m/in_how_many_years_will_we_prefer_ai_singing_than/ . But you have to think at the time when the internet begun, most of these issues were already supercharged like massive loneliness and then the internet came along and looked alot like the things we had lost. You lost friends? Here's some facebook friends. You lost status? Here's your new status report! There's been a huge rise in inequality? Here's my new reddit post! You've been humiliated at work? Here's my new status update! Simply put human instinct is to align with a tribe and collectively fear the other tribes as aliens. When we live in cities we think of everyone else living there belonging from that alien tribe that's why we always has to look at bypassers, to check if they become hostile or not, the human network can only support 150 individuals as close buddies but most importantly because we deep down feel like a stranger in strange lands(a abductie from a slaugthered tribe), to evaluate everyone incase they expose you you can't bee too carefree in cities or you'll get exposed. This doesn't happen at the same scale when we went to school, in school everyone was part of the same tribe, kinda. Tribe mentality! And coupled with the inherent chillness and not being ready in evolution terms to evaluate dangers yet at that time fear is all that would stop you from impressing a girl, especially boys led us to forget about primal stuff and intellectual masterbating has us cloud-fooled when a new phone hits the market (but we can also blame the advert companies for taking advantage of our weaknesses) - if you tell newly drafted NFL players about the dangers of football and headinjury in particular and you advice them to stop everyone will ask - Will i get braindamage today? - Noo you say and their respons will be - Then i don't care. It's only when they hit 22 or so they can have a pivital realization of their future foll and decides to quit american football or whatever bad habits they have accumulated. Most people just end up believing everything has worked out thus far though and choose very little effort of change, that's called luck. Fortunately most people get enough everything they need anyways and pay little attention to many things we take for granted. But trying to persuade these people won't work maybe for a few % of people who will end up believing anything or like me and at least consider everything and persuading these people is effective but usually just listening to people and finding that one thing the manipulators can target is the most effective way, after all we're social animals and why would we be changed from just a text online? I used to get really mad when people couldn't distinguish nature from cities, saying nature is everywhere and it's just a matter of perspective and so is accepting any ides as a posible truth and if you thought so it was so, and wanting everyone to accept this and be more open minded and don't yell at strangers or get annoyed when they see them sunbathing in the cities but now i know it's much more complicated than that and the majority of people go about and gossip about that lazy dude who sunbathed, or do they?

It was very nice in the bicentennial man when the  scientist gave Andrew a digestive system and he ate a breakfast for the  first time in his life and he said it was very tasteful.

But the most bizarre part of the robotic digestive system would be the artifitial pee and feces.

If you  think that artifitial digestive system seen unnecessary and impossible,  there are developments trying to create one(Gastrobots as well), and I  watched a video on YouTube showing a machine which you put food on it  and it do feces in the final(It seens somewhat bizarre but nonetheless,  it's a real thing).",3,1,False,self,,,,,

Those advancements I talk about in the title are great and all, but will most likely be plagued by the same distributor restrictions we already see in the prerooted cell phones we hook up to vehicles.  My current vehicle crisis could be solved with a couple quick lines of code anybody could write...the problem with this?  Voiding the warranty.

The ability to directly interface with your vehicle which, much like Darth Vader; is more computer than engine, poses a number interesting questions in several categories(categories not listed).  There's optimizing engine efficiency by interfacing with the mechanical components of the vehicle qnd creating custom carberator timings, transmission preferences and even windshield wiper delays.  Direct interface while the vehicle is in motion could enable a buttonless dashboard via the ability to sync a microphone to your HUD commands, improving the vehicle's interrior space on top of your hands free driving experience.  Add-on and aftermarket equipment like optical sensors can improve your driving experience in all number of unique ways...imagine two sensors, one that looks forward and one aft, each measuring the distance between you and the next vehicle in either direction: a simple few lines of code could alter your cruise control to maintain an equal distance between your vehicle and the other two.  All manner of features can be implemented, but while users have no control over their vehicle code: this statement is false!  Rooting your vehicle is next to a custom paint job when it comes to freedom on the road, just as rooting your phone is the next best freedom to having a cool case for it.",8,1,False,self,,,,,

The fact that we arent even close to understanding the closest thing we have to an AI in  2018, which is the human brain , strengthens his argument.

He also argues that we will also need to increase the intelligence and Wisdom IQ of the general populace, the political class and the intelligenstia to get AI right the first time, or risk AI induced oblivion.

# Smart contracts in real business: The future is here

The global financial community recognizes blockchain as one of the most groundbreaking technologies that are set to rock the boat of the world economy. Enterprises in all industries attempt to reap benefits from this technology to reach their specific goals, and one of the key blockchains advantages is smart contracts. 

## What is a smart contract?

To put it simply, smart contract is a piece of code that executes certain actions under certain conditions. For instance, when implemented in eCommerce, it can trigger a payment from the users wallet as soon as ordered items are shipped and this fact is fixed in the blockchain. 

Smart contracts have three key unbeatable advantages:

1. They eliminate intermediaries from transactions enabling P2P interaction. 
2. Smart contracts are much faster and totally eliminate the risk of human error  theyre executed automatically.
3. Its a great solution for the contractual relationships where trust is required. A properly written smart contract makes transactions transparent and fair.

## [Precium](https://www.precium.io/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=first&amp;utm_campaign=cg) brings smart contracts to real life

Practice shows that smart contracts make a day-and-night difference in performance and efficiency of business operations. For this reason, tech-savvy countries like China, South Korea and Japan encourage ICO creation and adoption of smart contracts in various industries. In traditional business, smart contracts facilitate communication and perform many other functions.

Precium is a good case in point: this project was established in South Korea in 2017. It is supported by major local and international partners, including Two AB, SBS, Naver, Swarovski, Kakao Talk, and Bit Asset. Precium platform offers a template of smart contract terms for users to create their own customized smart contracts and use them in peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions.

Heres how it works.

Any company can become a Precium user and exploit its smart contract templates. It allows for developing the proprietary smart contract thats tailored to specific business requirements. Smart contracts can serve for the whole gamut of tasks:

1. Automation of payments and transactions.
2. Delivery of items (smart contract will register the status of shipping and trigger corresponding actions).
3. Contractual relationships and legal issues (particularly useful for law firms). 
4. Voting during real-life meet-ups. 
5. Data security and access management in virtual infrastructure. 

Precium provides its proprietary Onyx Chain where all information related to smart contracts is stored. How is data obtained? The project uses Oracle technology to import all off-chain information on the Onyx blockchain. Therefore, customers are free to exploit different platforms and applications to manage their business  they wont need to make any drastic changes in their current digital infrastructure. 

Smart contract is a versatile means of data and fund management  it automates business processes making them transparent and error-proof. Practice shows that any business can benefit from this technology: such projects as Precium make this utopian dream come true. ",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Ted Cruz and D. Beto O'Rourke. Beto lost by a very narrow margin in a historically red Texas, and he has broken many records in doing so. Beto has even famously proclaimed that he ""do(es) not care about either party in such a divisive time in our history"". Beto is neither truly Democrat nor Republican. Beto is an independent with ideas that have politicians wondering if he might provide the cohesiveness necessary to win the presidential bid. As a registered Democrat who was able to bring a lot of traditionally conservative Texans over to his side, Beto is a solid candidate to represent the entirety of the American people in the 2020 presidential election, and he is the first I can genuinely say I am rooting for without reservation. Do your own research, but I don't think you'll be disappointed.

The station is NOT planned to act as a fuel depot and it is NOT planned to include manned lunar landing capabilities. 

It exists ONLY to justify the expanses for Orion and the SLS, as it is the only project currently planned that would make use of both systems.

Note that the [SLS](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/12/nasa-is-trying-to-make-the-space-launch-system-rocket-more-affordable/) is expected to only launch twice a year at roughly 1 billion dollars per launch or more, most likely unable to compete with other systems on the open market.

There is also no other mission planned for Orion, except for some test flights.

So why was SLS developed? [Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System#Criticism). SLS uses legacy Spaceshuttle systems, meaning the same manufactures for these parts are getting paid. Which in turn means campaign donations to the people shunting the money to them.

This station will not help further mankind's exploration of space. It will bind resources, time and effort that could be spent more productively.

The autonomous car is synonymous with inclusion and can improve public transport systems. It's a kind of promise that autonomous mobility will serve everyone and everyone.In addition to the questions about how these new types of cars will make moral and ethical decisions, it is also the economic prospects for bringing them to market and the race for innovation - which maintain a climate of increased competition - that must be questioned.

To predict the behaviour of the autonomous car, we first analyze human behaviour and then transform it into an algorithm.In short, the major changes that are transforming the automotive industry today, under the combined effects of environmental regulation and digital transformation, are revealing new dynamics.There is a kind of global excitement about the autonomous car - because innovation is attractive. But we must be certain that this new mobility will serve environmental purposes.

The road to autonomy is long and exceedingly complicated. It can also be dangerous: Two high-profile efforts, from Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Inc., were involved in crashes that caused the death of a pedestrian (in the first known case of a person killed by a self-driving vehicle) and a driver using an assistance program touted as a precursor to autonomy. One of Waymos autonomous vans was involved in a collision in May 2018. But the perceived stakes are so enormous, with the promise of transport businesses needing little in labor costs, that many players are racing to master the technology and put it to work.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Dash is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Except it 'forked' from bitcoin in order to make changes that the bitcoin community didn't want or think would be useful. These changes were private transactions, instant transactions, governance and funding from the blockchain (instead of donations or something else like a corporation).

In other words, Dash is already by itself an extremely 'futuristic' technology. It is a financial breakthrough the likes of which would be equivalent to the first commercial airliner, while bitcoin would be closer to the wright brother's plane.

 Before Dash's launch 2014, it was **impossible** to have financial privacy because the government, your bank, businesses you transaction with etc. all have access to your information which is stored in centralized servers. Dash decentralizes this, because its a blockchain, and adds the features above that blockchains don't inherently have, which tends to make them wonky and a bit hard to use. Before 2014, it was impossible to move either $1 or 1 billion dollars across any border in 1.3 s (bitcoin required 10 minutes for 1 confirmation and 60 minutes for 6 for a **full** confirmation. A nail-biter at $1 Billion USD).

So that being said, Dash is poised to be very useful in regard to disintermediating the scientific publishing industry. [Allowing researchers to cheaply and easily publish their research to the blockchain.](https://cryptobriefing.com/dash-science-research-blockchain/)

&gt;Peer review is broken, writes Kevin McKernan, the author of the proposal, in the Medicinal Genomics blog. 50% of Scientific manuscripts experiments cant be reproduced. The journals with the higher impact factor have a higher retraction rate.

&gt;Instead, the genomics proposal will pioneer a novel system of incentivized peer reviews, based on the Dash blockchain. The genome sequence will be coded to the blockchain, along with cryptocurrency rewards for peer reviewers.

&gt; Crypto-incentivized, blockchain transparent peer review will dis-intermediate this market and re-align the incentive models for higher accuracy, more transparency and faster turn around times, McKernan writes.

I just want to objectively look at the strained relations as if we're outsiders with no dog in the fight, if that's possible. 

I think we've all heard women joke that one day they won't need men, it can be taken as just a sassy little joke but it's also really a futurological prediction, kind of in the same vein as how machines or AI will take over. The latter becomes eerily more real every day,  it was first predicted at a time when there was really no reason to think so,  but since we've almost against our will been slowly plugging in and blending with technology,  even as we complain about.  ""I really hate how people are so obsessed with their phones,  I yearn for a simpler time when we really interacted with each other...  But just let me check my phone real quick"". It's almost like we are powerless to fight the machine, and Pearl Jam's ""evolution"" music video,  where all the humans just become inactive and get plugged into a cell has already nearly come true. 

I kind of wonder if we aren't already on a similarly slippery slope with gender relations. It seems like the mating rituals of our species,  the elaborate courting and pairing up for breeding is already breaking down,  men are rejecting the idea of marriage, women are rejecting men in general and basically drawing a line in the sand with the me-too movement saying ""just stop"", with men kind of like ""huh? But then how can we...  You know?"" and women are kind of like ""yeah...  Take a hint"". It's like women have aspirations to be in total control and no longer subjected to the advances of men,  and I understand why after their long suffering,  but it seems like the natural end game for this path we're on is a gender divide into two societies.

 A female controlled society where they genetically engineer armies of handsome mindless feminist men for entertainment, pleasure and protection, and these could possibly even just be androids,  while they incubate female babies only in test tubes. And men could drift into an even darker society,  one where slovenly grotesque men (no longer needing to work on themselves) have chained up female sex slaves for breeding in a grimey dystopia, or alternatively just use sex robots as they go extinct. Possibly at the hands of the handsome female owned androids or super men in a war. 

Of course a lot of people are still doing everything normally, just like people are not literally all inactive blobs plugged into the matrix yet,  but there's an unmistakable slide occurring in these directions imo. ",14,1,False,self,,,,,

One where robots create so much wealth, and VR drives living costs for humans so low, that anyone could live like a king for next to nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

For this to happen we need two technologies:

\- a self-sufficient robot economy: an economy consisting entirely of robots, these would create a net positive output. Most notably advancements in productivity mean that human needs (food, housing, energy, heating, security, entertainment, transportation) can be met at a cost that's close to zero.

\- a Matrix like VR system: like in the Matrix movies, this virtual world would be so realistic that a human cannot tell it apart from the real world. Every sensation would feel like it's real life, even food and pain.

&amp;#x200B;

But while the Matrix put forward two plot devices to keep things interesting, that is that humans reject a perfect world, and that you can die if killed in this VR, in a real world Matrix people would live a dream life. There would be no crime, hunger, thirst... people would work as much or as little as they like, able to live off a minimum UBI, or renting out their labor to other humans or to the robot economy. Even the poorest person in such a world would live like a king, with world sized mansions and AI/robot/android servants to fulfill their every desire.

People would spend their time in any way they like. Some would focus on hobbies for the fun of it, read all day, act out fantasy likes quests, play game, create art... With their basic needs fulfilled and unlimited digital resources at their disposal, people would be able to use their creative potential to the fullest, or be total couch potatoes. Such people could still be a major value to society, creating pleasure for the working class.

The working class would be people who naturally like to work, and explore the real world. These people might leave the VR to get their hands dirty, or work from VR, controlling robots around the world or in space as if they were there. They would work closely with the robot economy, which might be owned by humans, ASI or a hybrid cyborg species of enhanced humans. A huge help here would be to turn human brain power into a useful resources, like supercomputers, so even the biggest couch potato could rent out their brain power to the robot economy and make enough money to live with minimal effort.

Wars were fought, countries invaded, millions killed, liberties forsaken, all in the name of security.

Then for most of the 2010's, global warming has been the go-to subject for governments and pressure groups, as the Fukushima incident caused governments to effectively increase costs on anything from electricity to light bulbs, all in the name of keeping temperatures down.

&amp;#x200B;

Two topic that were ignored in these two decades however were economic inequality and AI.

&amp;#x200B;

Economic inequality came to the forefront in 2008 following the US housing market crash and subsequent market crash. There were some political groups that responded to this, such as the Occupy Wall street and indignados movements, but these quickly died out. 10 years later, and nothing has changed with our financial system, and banks speculate more than ever, meaning we could have another financial disaster tomorrow.

The second thing is the rise of AI in the 2010's. This is a game changing powerful technology, that is unregulated, and mostly in the hands of secret government groups and private companies, neither of which have a history of altruism. I'd say the best way to think of this is as a mind-control device, and you can see why this is a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I would argue that economic inequality and AI are more dangerous to the majority of people than terrorism or global warming, as their effects are more direct and widespread. Yet I hear many people wave them off as being ""just how it is"" or ""nothing to worry about for at least a century"", when in fact we should be fighting over them right now, more so than worrying about some zealots hiding in the desert or a coral reef disappearing.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

The human body is a technical object,  it uses glasses to see better, he uses his legs to run, he learns movement techniques to swim...He uses technical objects to talk to people far from him: by phone, webcam.

The digital ecosystem ""adds"" a part of myself, and inscribes me in memory, time.Culture is also a part of me: in my thoughts, my thoughts.

The digital traces are therefore as many traces as my sweat that I left on a shirt. And my messages, my writings, are as much mine as my blood that stains a sheet. Also, my facebook page, my blog have as much ownership as a writer (intellectual property) has with his works.

To death, who owns these cultural objects?

Game over, formatting the hard drive of our digital life?

The term ""digital life"" is explicit: it is our life. When this life vanishes, what use is it?

For the family, these digital traces are either a way to preserve memory, or a knife that permanently revives an injury. But should we leave a facebook page where some inglorious pictures have been posted (the last night we had a drink with friends) ?

Wouldn't the deceased have preferred to leave this trace, which on the net has an eternity value? Does the family have the right to use this data to store or delete it?

This problem is the same as for the decision of the body which can be the subject of organ donations.

Without clear formalization of the deceased before his death, the family may refuse the donation. In the digital field, the approaches are still in their infancy.

Hence the necessity of a clear, global and encrypted process to regulate these questions. why not imagining a blockchain virtual space for the best digital version of yourself that would perpetuate years after you die ?",3,1,False,self,,,,,

If you havent heard: two days ago the scientific community was stunned with the news that a Chinese scientist, Jiankui He, had used CRISPR to modify the genomes of two baby girls. Specifically, he deleted the CCR5 gene in these girls, presumably making them resistant to HIV. This sparked a ton of controversy, as concerns were raised about the safety of the technology, whether the patients were properly consented, and whether the world had really thought through the consequences of genetic modification of the germ line.

Until now, there was lots of confusion because no one had seen the data.

But now Dr. Jiankui He presented [his controversial work](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1T1zLTtHS2z_cgl29fN_7qJg7fLA4qlrd) (link to slide deck) last night at a genome editing conference in Hong Kong.

The accompanying transcript is available [here](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/human-genome-editing-summit/2018-hong-kong/jiankui-he-human-genome-editing/).

But what I've noticed is that for the level that Mr. Musk and others are talking about, we are not talking just machines being used for automation. We are talking about the absolute human replacement. This is a level of sophistication we are not yet at with our AI and machines.

This appears to build an economy that has one group of people who own the machines demanding everyone else who are now unemployed and on the government dole to pay them for goods and services. Great for Mr. Musk, but does he mind we tax the crap out of him? Because I do not understand how else the Government will pay people a basic income wages out of thin air without incurring massive debt. Or are we just going to go back to the barter system?

This problem of machines taking all our jobs through complete automation is a fascinating mind game, but one where the financial aspects are not being determined. For instance, businesses may not risk such automation due to the high initial costs. This could slow down the progress of the development of these machines overall. Other events like economic depressions or large scale natural disasters could also cause cash flow problems for machine development. Of course, its also possible that natural disasters could spur on development from government spending trying to quickly recover from the damage or predict further damage.

I've assembled a small list of [Ted Talk You Tubes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgCMuYnY5yRjvGk_GAyVAc_8ao7vrT_Bc) on my channel for those who are interested on the pros and cons of this subject.

Having the 11th worlds largest economy, South Korea can boast a highly educated population and productive workforce. Within a single generation, the country has managed to make a huge leap from dire poverty to economic and technical thriving. Its not a surprise that South Korea became a hotbed of crypto projects.

What drives the interest to cryptocurrencies and ICOs in Korea?

* Its residents are very tech-savvy and welcome the adoption of digital money;
* Due to long working days and conditions, Korean workers are seeking investing opportunities to shorten years to retirement;
* Seouls density allows for word to spread fast.

Koreans technological knowledge serves as a solid foundation for innovative ICOsthe country can boast tens of famous projects that have already entered the market.

Among the most outstanding initiatives, we should mention:

1. Fantom. This is the first DAG-based blockchain that features the smart contract allowing for instant transactions and great scalability with minimal expenses. This ICO is designed to revolutionize the industries of telecom, real estate, supply chain, and banking. During the crowdsale, Fantom raised $2 mln.
2. Quarkchain. This project has become highly popular due to the striking speed of transactions (the team aims to reach 1 mln TPS rate). The blockchain system consists of two layers and so-called shards that work independently and process transactions quickly. In June 2018, Quarkchain finished the crowdsale by raising $20 mln, and investors have already managed to enjoy 13x ETH returns, and 4.7x BTC returns.
3. Metadium. It is a blockchain identity protocol that allows users to manage their identity and data. In the private sale, the project raised $35 mln: it was supported by Kenetic, FBG, Hashed, Blocktower Capital and many other companies.

By the way, Metadium was not the only blockchain project to get financial support from leading companies. The vast majority of Korean ICOs are sponsored by other national projects with the funds raised during private sales. Carry (Spoqas affiliate project), Terra, and Cosmochain are good cases in point. Blockchain industry of South Korea is a closed market players of which count on each other rather than international partners. Moreover, some Korean projects are created to serve as a catalyst of ICO development: BLOCKCHAINi has already helped tens of Korean companies enter the market.

Aside from financial backup, many Korean ICOs can boast a serious informational support from globally acknowledged advisors. For instance, [Precium](https://www.precium.io/) project works with Alex Kim, Hoontak Jung (EBM founder), Joseph Jang (Sansoo Ventures), Jonathan Lee (SIX Network, XCHNG, Blue Block Capital and HARA), and some other well-known blockchain specialists. Their expertise helps the team develop advanced smart contract solutions together with the innovative hybrid blockchain.

The Korean ICO market has an enormous potential. Technological advancements coupled with the dedication of hard-working Koreans make their projects true diamonds of the blockchain market. Theres only one thing hindering the major breakoutsthe blockchain ban imposed by the Korean government in 2017. At the moment, Korean authorities consider removing this ban: pressure on ICOs can be reduced, if companies follow certain rules and regulations. Most likely, many ICO founders will breathe a sigh of relief in 2019.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

The content on the phone would be processed by a shared local supercomputer as a service and streamed to the phone. This would also mean phones only need to use it's battery on receiving and transmitting, and displaying things on the display, thus increasing battery life. It would also mean the cost of computing would go down further, since a single supercomputer would be more cost-effective than thousands of individual phones.

Obviously, this would require a very mature 5G infrastructure, which would probably only be available in big cities, which could possibly accelerate wealth inequality. This would also create new concerns, with data collection since your phone's processor would literally be owned and controlled by a big corporation, like Google or Apple.

The combination of processing speed, ""big data"" and novel narrow AI dedicated computer architectures should be able to make a pretty believable simulation of my style of writing to include ways that I phrase things and some of my deliberate ""personality"" quirks in my writing.

How many words do I know? I imagine a computer that had access to my writing in like reddit ""futurology"" for the last 5 years could deconstruct what I write to process and model vocabulary, sentence construction, tone, and probably a lot of things I may unconsciously do when I write. Narrow AI's are good at detecting patterns like that.

But that makes me ask, how long until a narrow AI can so effectively imitate me that no one can tell the difference between me and what it is simulating?

Another five years? Ten?

To me the bone of contention seems to be what exactly is going on when we have developed ""artificial general intelligence"".

This form of artificial intelligence can be presented with a problem and can draw on it's computing to see if it can address and resolve said problem. Those computing capabilities I described in the first paragraph are essential to that sort of thing. And I would say that prior to the year 2015, it would not have been possible because those capabilities had not reached the threshold necessary to ""generalize"" about a problem. Before the year 2015 a narrow AI could not well understand natural human speech or the way that humans write. A computer could not use its abilities to observe (""see"") because the capability to process the observed information or data did not yet exist.

Today these capabilities do exist. And by the month, sometimes by the week these capabilities improve. I wonder what the next three years will yield.

Anyway when I read of attempts to develop AGI now, I can't help thinking that we mean the development of an independent consciousness and god forbid, emotions. One of the prime arguments against the possibility of developing an AGI in the near future is that ""we can't even define what ""consciousness"" is!"" Well one of the things that consciousness ""is"", is sensory awareness of the surrounding universe. So far only biology can manage this, whether a C. Elegans, a frog, an octopus or a human. Our biological physical senses inform our minds what is around us through electrochemical communication. Then through hard won evolutionary history, our human (neo-cortex) minds tell us what to do about it. And how we feel about what we are doing.

Apart from awareness, I don't think you need anything else to be able to generalize. In fact I would submit that all the crime and corruption humans have on top of awareness is actually limiting our potential. Look how easy we get distracted. If we are mad from last night or sleepy or still hung over, how does that impact how we apprehend a problem. I think we just need to stick with awareness at least for our AI dedicated machines for now. 

But then again how exactly do we define ""being aware"". A frog is aware. So is an individual coral polyp. My cat is aware all the time. Probably over aware. Jumpy as hell. That's what happens when you are both predator and prey. The only time she is not aware is when she is out. And she spends a fairly significant time being out too. Because there is a biological price to be paid for being ""aware"", depending on your brain size and what you have to do.

The ultimate question is can we make a form of ""AI"" that can use our super powered and exponentially improving computer capabilities to take what it is aware of and develop an imperative or motivation to do something. What motivates us? So far motivation is also restricted to biology. Sure you can program a bot to mine in StarCraft 2, but it is just a program executing it's algorithm. It's not mining because it ""understands"" what mining is and wants to mine.

Here is a thing I wrote about the need to be motivated and some of the requirement necessary to be motivated in the first place. At least from a biological point of view. Can this sort of thing translate to the development of an AGI? Well that's the 64,000 question, isn't it.

https://www.reddit.com/user/izumi3682/comments/9786um/but_whats_my_motivation_artificial_general/

Now I understand we are striving to develop a narrow AI that is intended to beat all humans at ""StarCraft 2"". If successful wouldn't that AI have demonstrated a pretty good simulation of awareness and motivation? Even if it is totally unconscious. Or maybe it wouldn't be so fundamentally unconscious anymore. The difference in variables in like the game of ""Go"" and the game of ""SC2"" is astronomical. I bet that would go a long way towards the creation of a true AGI. Biological style consciousness not required. Or would it be a side effect of that manner of computing?

The resultant developed AI could probably be further modified to ever improve it's ability to generalize. Now of course the big elephant in this room is how to ""generalize"" in the first place. I am no AI scientist, but I understand that researchers are doing something to enable a narrow AI to play the entire game of ""SC2"" and defeat all human comers. 

I cannot over emphasize how important it is that you understand that this discussion wasn't possible before the year 2015. We simply did not have the computing capabilities. Now we do. And it is going to change the world beyond anything we can imagine. Really, my fellow frogs in comfortable, but steadily warming water, isn't it already happening all around us right now?

Anyway, me and the future.

IMO

**Gene pool**
Given the technical complexities of genetic editing and their biological implications, it's extremely misguided, arrogant and irresponsible to think we can already beat natural evolution at its own game. We can't and the last thing we need right now is to fuck up the gene pool for the future generations with reckless germline engineering experiments.

The best way to zeal for the health of future generations and preserve the adaptive capability of our species (we can probably speak in terms of societies/social groups if these are sufficiently segregated) is to promote genetic diversity. We lack the ability to check for long-term collateral damage of artificially altering the gene pool and I'm not sure if we will ever be able to do so.

**The ethical Pandora's Box**
All of this forces responsible decision makers to enforce very ugly measures for the greater good. An example of which would be to deprive genetically-engineered newborns of the legal right to reproduce, relegating them to a *replicant*-like citizenship to safeguard human ""rights."" Really ugly solution, isn't it?

This is why if genetically engineered newborns are to enjoy the same rights as any other person, they should not be born yet. Germline engineering won't solve more problems than those it can create at this moment.

This unpopular opinion is out because it looks like Pandora's box has indeed been opened, criminally so, so inevitable discussion.

To finish, I think research efforts should concentrate on somatic gene editing (non-inheritable genetic modifications performed on those already born unlike germline editing, which is what He did). This has great potential to benefit human health with far less dystopian consequences.

What if we had a similar system but without the problematic downvotes and potential for pettiness and trolling. If each person was given a basic level of credits, maybe some form of crypto, pegged to cost lot living that allowed their needs to be met, along with the potential to earn more AND a daily stipend that could only be spent on other people to reward positive behavior, does that seem like a viable and positive system for the future?

To illustrate... say Im a carpenter whose skills are not always essential in an age of automation, but still values by some. I earn enough through UBI to sustain myself, and earn some extra income on occasion remodeling homes or doing custom jobs for people who want a classic pre-automation touch, just as some people buy shaker furniture today. On top of that, if I do some volunteer work or perhaps a custom job for someone who cant afford my standard rate, I may still be rewarded with some form of upvote from those who are appreciative. That may be in the form of direct currency from the stipend that can only be used on other people, or perhaps its a more indirect system that is purely in the nature of points that have some more indirect or intangible value. Maybe for example, these upvotes can be used to log additional processing time on a crypto mining system or to access some form of AI service. You could never harm someone in the manner depicted by Black Mirror, but theres be some sort of reward that would incentivize not only philanthropy, but also the arts. Someone who creates a book or song may not be able to sell it for much, but they could give it away and those who enjoy it would have no reason not to upvote the author. 

I see some flaws in this proposal of course, but curious what others might think.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

These processes involve learning, analysis, planning, perception, reasoning, correction, speech recognition, linguistics, and other streams of human cognitive science. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **How Artificial Intelligence Matters?** 

1.  **Creation of Expert Systems**  
It involves the creation of automated systems that exhibit intelligent behavior and advice humans on the right course of action.
2. **Implementation of Human Intelligence in Computers**  
It will help create identical cognitive patterns in computers which will help them behave like humans and take appropriate actions to solve complex problems. This will enable automated processes and reduced human workload through the application of algorithms.
3. **Multi-Domain Application**  
AI will help in multiple domains of implementation like Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Statistics, Psychology, Medical Science, Engineering, Ethics, Natural Sciences, Healthcare, Space Technology, Logic, Linguistics, E-commerce, and more.
4. **Applications in Computer Science**  
AI helps in developing a number of mechanisms to solve many difficult problems in the field of computer science like Search and Optimization, Logic, Control Theory, Language Analysis, Neural Networks, Classifiers, and Statistical Learning Methods, and Probabilistic Methods for uncertain reasoning.

Now imagine a software, based on a massive amount of machine learning, that is fed with all the scientific data we have about ourselves: what makes us happy? What makes us sick? What benefits us on the long run? What social, political and economical factors actually do good?
What education is best for which age? What laws will strengthen the economy? How much produce is actually needed? What food are we supposed to eat to be at our max health and happiness? How can we all live comfortably with each other?

A software is not feeling, its not subjective. Its doing what its told, making decisions based on the data its fed.

Imagine if we fed it all the good stuff. All the facts that are proven to help us. 

Imagine it making decisions for rules and laws, that will definitely improve our existences, every day, at all times, without a second, secret motive.

No more ideologies, no more ulterior motives, no more subjectivity when it comes to laws that influence all of us.

Imagine this software as a way to actually get us humans back to a state of actual harmony and happiness, not driven by greed or lust for power, but based on the very things that make us, the people, human again. 

That is the nearest thing to an actual god that I can think of. And we could make it ourselves.
