3,2013-8-1,2013,8,1,14,1jh4iw,Short term predictions,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1jh4iw/short_term_predictions/,YOLOSWAGGINS1337,1375333935,"Here are a few things that I'm very sure are going to happen in the near future. When I say near future, I mean &lt;10 years.

First, there will be an open, possibly p2p database of knowledge, information, and data. It will use a trust algorithm to decide who can and can't change certain things. Think of it like wikipedia for everything. This database will contain music, movies, TV shows, newspapers, photos, etc. The way we now search for music on spotify and listen to it immediately, people will be able to do with just about anything.

Almost all electronic data that people currently pay for will be available in this database. Content creators will have two ways to get paid. Product placement and donations. Free content with subtle advertising/product placement will be the most popular. Content that is more expensive to create will have to be financed through things like merchandise and fundraisers (which will likely look more like kickstarter than NPR.) This is already happening with music, since mp3 files are so small.

Final prediction here: ""smart"" devices will make way for devices that be controlled electronically over a standardized interface. Smart TVs are coming first in this regard. Instead of containing logic within, devices in the future will be dumb and replaceable with standard ports on them. You'll be able to plug a device into your stereo, lights, fans, air conditioning, refrigerator, oven, heating system (NEST being one of the first iterations of this) which will allow for network control. Once these are out, people will realize that the right logic can make things run quite efficiently, and some of these things can run better with awareness of the things around them. This, along with price, will motivate the transition to a central computer controlling all of these things. This will lead to some very cool things in the field of home automation. Sensors will also be connected to this central computer. The obvious ones like temperature and humidity will come first (though temperature will start as part of the thermostat module, it will separate eventually.) Next will come ""people sensors"" whether they detect motion, heat, water, or whatever. That will allow lights to turn on when we walk into rooms, and turn off when we walk out of them. It will allow climate control to be concentrated on where the people are. Worn heart rate sensors will allow your music to be adjusted automatically, the lights to be turned off if you fall asleep with them on, the heat to kick on when you're about to wake up, etc. Quite a few other sensors are possible, such as swallowed or injected sensors that monitor all kinds of useful things going on in your body. At this point, we'll have completed a few iterations of the wireless pluggythings that go into refrigerators and ovens, so the software and APIs will have stabilized and it will be time to integrate this functionality in internally. Devices will be sold with this wireless control built in.

The central computer which connects devices in our lives will also be a node in the aforementioned p2p database. It is presently unclear whether this will be a box in the living room or hosted in a far away datacenter, run by google if things keep going the way they're going. It depends on how quickly fiber lines are laid, and that's something that I cannot predict.

I'm not necessarily posting this for comments and critiques. Mostly, I'm doing it because I've had my predictions come true in the past year, and so I'd like to be able to refer to this post in the future to get internet points. That's right, I'm playing the long game.",20,14

I looked through the sidebar, and I didn't see this link anywhere. But even if it is buried somewhere, I think it would be a good idea to add the link to the website directly to the sidebar. 

My reasoning: this website presents many likely theories about the future from 2013 through 2050, and onwards. These theories are all sourced, so there are no erroneous statements. This website is where I learned about many emerging technologies. Further, there is a community of editors who regularly update the website based on new discoveries and discuss possibilities. 

I believe the /r/futurology community would benefit greatly by having a direct link to this website on the sidebar. Our members regularly have discussions about a range of topics, but I think it would be extremely useful to have this resource readily available for the purpose of providing our members with a set of topics to discuss.

I've posted this as a discussion rather than simply messaging a mod because I would like the community here to provide some feedback. One opinion is not nearly as loud or influential as many opinions. Please consider my suggestion.",23,93

These things will be Big Data, Implanted Health Monitors, and AI.



**Genome Databases** will begin to appear around 2020 and be fairly extensive by 2025. By this time a full genome scan will be very cheap and nearly everyone will have had one. 


**Health Records** are already a thing. We have detailed files of peoples medical history. All the times they were sick, the treatment and medicine prescribed, and the outcomes of each case. These will also be in databases, so that patient history from many people is known.


Finally I predict **implantable health monitors** will become popular. The technology should be available by 2020 but it may not catch on until 2025. These would be simple tiny sensors that are connected to your bloodstream, and smartphone. They would constantly test your body for things like temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. As well as keep a log of many of the chemicals in your body. Cholesterol levels, blood sugar, electrolytes, and many dozens more.
Like I said this data would connected to your smartphone and hospital.

These 3 massive pools of data will be combined and used together by Watson like **Artificial intelligence**. Imagine a computer that can already diagnose like a doctor taking the Genomes of 100s of millions of people. Cross referencing this data with the health records of 100s of millions of people. And then referencing this to the body conditions of all these people over a long period of time. What you end up with is a lot of emerging patterns and a doctor that can spot and diagnose almost any illness just from watching the results of your live health monitor. 

If there is an irregularity in your chemical levels it will see it and reference it to your genome, health records, and data from millions of others to come to a very accurate conclusion of what is wrong.
**It would be like being at the doctor 24/7 but never stepping inside of a hospital.** Of course in the early stages it will be limited and hospital tests might be needed. Though as the health monitor can spot more and more chemicals I think it will be less and less needed. Only requiring a hospital visit for actual treatment.",12,10

Secondly I believe the creator of this subreddit, /u/Xenophon1 deserves our praise and gratitude for raising this community to the hights it has achieved.
I recall the days when we were less than 30 thousand people and now here we are as influential as ever, so lend your attention and allow me to address you all once again.

I have to say that since the rule change concerning the removal of memes has greatly focused and improved content coming from our many users, and the quality of discussion in general has improved as far as I can tell. However there is always more we can do to increase our reach, and ideas are always welcome and appreciated.

We as a community have achieved so much and I would like to extend my praise to all of you, truly well done. We have a [Futurology podcast](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1e3am7/the_futurology_podcast_episode_7_is_up/),a [twitter page](https://twitter.com/the__future), and we're even on [wired](http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/08/preventing-skynet/). There is however another project that requires your attention. The realization of a [futurist party](http://www.reddit.com/r/futuristparty). This is something that could potentially allow us to vastly stretch our reputation.

The future is something we are all obviously passionate about so let us continue to work together to achieve further greatness. Feel free to check out /r/Futuristparty or any of our other outlets outside of this sub to add your voice and ideas.
Whether you have just discovered this subreddit or have been apart of it from the beginning we have all become a part of something greater and I am optimistic about how much we could actually change about the future, because after all we create the future every day with new ideas and exposure to current ideas.

finally, in the wise words of Xenophon1.
""I know, without evidence or reason, that our collective influence is powerful. It is momentous and growing in magnitudes of exponents. It's power is staggering, it's influence, frightening. Together, with these hundreds of voices, we can accomplish something. I know not fully what this is or is becoming. Only that there are many future(s) to our extraordinary communities.
I hope to hear our voices- resound again before the threshold of 100 thousand futurists strong. Yet, I also hope to hear our community's voice in another subreddit. This is an open source project, a project with still unsteady foundations.""

To the future(s)

They were amazed that the 5th grader or whomever knew all that they did and called them smart.
 
I sat there wondering. Why are these shows considered extraordinary now? In reality we already are connected to boundless amounts of information. The kid on that show has just been gobbling up, memorizing and storing all that info so he can excel at that game show or quiz. Will there come a point in time where this may be considered a cluttering of that young child's mind? Will Jeopardy participants become laughable once everyone and their mother can just access the answers to the Jeopardy questions as soon as they are asked? Are they laughable now? (I enjoy Jeopardy personally)
 
There will come a time when I hope that these types of memory quiz shows evolve into something else. I hope to see speed 3D printing, or some sort of quick creation of something to compete with other contestants whether it just be to visually wow the audience or to complete an obstacle course, will be valued more than just puking up random memorized information.",2,0

I am having trouble overcoming centralized and vertical mindspace ideology, and problems with the energy markets in general. Can you help me educate the community?)

(**Who We Are:) 
We are a group of scientists and business professionals performing R&amp;D into materials and energy. We are preparing to deploy a catalog of innovations but we have to overcome centralization politic. I am presenting on behalf of the engineers and scientists who do not seek notoriety at this time.

(**Primary Mission:)
There are many barriers to market entry for new innovations, hence the reason we are deploying two innovations simultaneously; 1) INTI a very low cost, decentralized Solar Thermal Electric Generator, and 2) a decentralized business architecture with franchised distributed manufacturing.  

(**The Invention:)
There are many barriers to entry for new innovations, hence the reason we are deploying two innovations simultaneously; 1) INTI a very low cost, decentralized Solar Thermal Electric Generator, and 2) a decentralized business architecture with distributed manufacturing. Lets focus on INTI.

INTI provides continuous 10KWH electricity sourced from the sun by converting the broad energy spectrum into rotational energy, then into electricity. It uses a seven piston [organic rankin cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_Rankine_cycle) motor, moving without [stiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiction) (stop and go motion), instead it creates a suction, falling motion. It produces 240KW per day by storing thermal mass in a cryogenic battery (a big thermos filled with molten salt). A detail of the innovation and the prototype performance can be [found here] (http://igg.me/at/INTI/x/4180626). It is locally produced, with restricted manufacturing model, economic developer creating skilled labor jobs and energy market.  Long lasting design, warrantied 20 years. Environmentally ethical, increases available energy. 100 sq. ft. (9 sq. meters) footprint. The motor weights 220 kg. Semi-portable. Retail cost $13000 installed (depending on jurisdiction regulations), $0.00742 per KWH. 

(*This is not conjecture, we have a prototype with precise pleasured results.)

(**Whats Wrong With Centralized Energy:)
* More costly   ~40% dissipation transmission loss
* Environmentally destructive
* Annual inflationary cost sometimes exceed government inflation statistics
* No return on investment for the consumer
* Restricted right over access
* Requires Subsidy  The technology does not stand on its own in the market
* Pools corporate and political power

(**Whats Wrong With Current Energy Products:)
* Most products are [specious] (http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/specious)
* Many do not add capacity to the grid (i.e., solar PV)
* Promises of new physics and discoveries that never emerge
* Corporate and banking politic
* Planned Obsolescence

(**Why Dont We See More Energy Innovations Come To Market:)
* Inventors have an invention, they do not have a packaged product
* No product distribution
* Undercapitalized
* Patents removed from public view due to national security 
* Market barriers 

(**Manufacturing Problems in the U.S.:)
The ASME has not updated policy affecting State building code regulations on pressure vessels since 1928. ASME is for-profit, union type entity, been given no authority, but has created the appearance of authority via heavy lobbying in most states. There is no formal means for redress with ASME. We have tried to appeal to them with engineering hyperbaric chambers with no success. They refuse to update and do not take into account any new metallurgy or nano sealant technology. Court venues are not free market incentives. So, we must go abroad.

(**Closing Remarks:)
You may verify our prototype info on our [campaign webpage](http://igg.me/at/INTI/x/4180626) and the[demo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkKe6Ficpoc). Yes we are raising money for the launch; please dont misunderstand the purpose of the introduction. We must overcome a mind-space burden caused by misinformation.

There will always be better things - technology wise, or goods or services. So I might be happy and have a 42"" TV for example, but there is a 50"" TV around. Use this example for any technology or service - my garden mightn't be as well tendered as another, the car mightn't be as comfortable as another or whatever.

In a RBE everything is abundant in terms of what can be achieved. So we're all happy and have stuff but what happens when a new thing comes about and some have it but others don't?

I cannot see how this cannot be true in real terms - whenever time moves forward so does technology and the reality of distribution, even in a Marxist or resource base economy, is that this technology would be distributed unevenly over a period of time. For example, lets say the newest TV becomes available, over millions of people it would take a long time to get to everyone's household. This could also be a job or work or a home or access to green space or whatever you can think of. It's impossible to divide everything up equally between everyone.

So wont there always be people who decide they want it faster than they will get it (whatever it is) and therefore use some other service or good to barter in order to get it sooner?

In other words, how can a resource based economy or Marxism ever work - when the goods or services that exist in a money or barter free economy can always be secured via other means? And by that I essentially mean money.

I suppose this is an age old question, but in terms of futurism and the Venus project, are we not trying to hide human nature here? There will always be a human desire for stuff, it seems to me. If I have a surplus of something I can always use it to get something else.

It links to an article about how two scientists are trying to code information into DNA, preserving our history for future civilizations. Someone commented how that wasn't a good idea and all information should be saved in a low-tech format. But for me, I think that assumes we *want* a future, low-tech civilization to know all about our history and advancements so soon. This was my thinking:

So far it seems that the only catastrophic cosmic/terrestrial event that we know of that has a real potential for complete apocalyptic consequences is the asteroid Apophis. There is a slim chance that it will enter a gravitational keyhole in 2029 resulting in impact on April 13, 2036. Of course, even now we are developing technology to control/manuever asteroids. I'm guessing that by 2029 we will have so vastly expanded the technology, that even if Apophis was a threat, we would be able to avert it. Therefore it seems that unless some completely overseen global event occurs with no warning and no preparation, the end of our time as a dominant species will be our own doing.

Whether inadvertent (global warming e.g.) or not (some kind of nuclear war, again for example) humans will most likely be the cause of their own destruction. Almost all our knowledge that we have obtained will have led to our downfall. If that information was stored in a low-tech format, the low-tech or primitive civilization will have immediate access to it without knowing all of the past consequences. They will end up going down the same path we did and destroy themselves even sooner.

If, however, we store our history in a more high-tech format (like DNA), it will take a civilization much longer to develop the capabilities to unravel our past knowledge. At that point they just might be smarter than we were and perhaps a little wiser. They could use our information to better themselves instead of hurting themselves. It would be a way to further advance a civilization that would have otherwise been thrown the keys to the annals of history with no warning.

**TL;DR:** If we store our history and knowledge in DNA in case of a apocalyptic event, it might be better if low-tech civilization that comes after it can't access it until they become a more advanced, and possibly wiser, civilization.

Suppose that we will upload our consciousness and enhance our memory to level that we can remember every situation that happended to us absolutely precisely (something like Thane in Mass effect) and we will have means to visualize those situations perfectly. And suppose our memory is indefinite. Would it be like experiencing all those moments (e.g. 1000 years) ""right now""? In our current biological condition ""present"" is a fraction of a second, it depends on speed of chemical and electrical processes in our brain. But in upload scenario would there be difference between present and past? We would be somehow concious ""across time"".
edit: Let me rephrase it a little. We are living in 4 dimensional spacetime. We experience present as a 3D slice in this spacetime. Now I think this is due to our imperfect biological memory, that is- present is much more clear then something that happened even one 3D slice ago. But with mind upload and perfect memory, this blurriness of past slices would be dealt with.

The reasoning behind the mantra is that often the stated intentions of a system are very different to what it actually achieves and therefore it is far more useful to focus on the actual outcomes of the system.

Just recently it was stated that [""40% Of US Workers Now Earn Less Than 1968 Minimum Wage""](http://soundmoneyinstitute.org/40-of-us-workers-now-earn-less-than-1968-minimum-wage/) meanwhile the growth in income inequality is well-noted by various studies and groups and has contributed to movements such as Occupy etc.

So our current system has left many with poor living standards despite increasing productivity whilst raising the wealthiest few to hitherto unseen levels of wealth. This is not just confined to the USA either, as it is also noted in Western Europe (particularly the UK) and   China, India, Brazil and other major nations also see incredible levels of inequality that appear to be worsening. (Focus on the secular trend as the economic crash caused a brief contraction in inequality.)

So using the heuristic of systems theory it seems that our current economic system does not benefit the majority - it is not a utilitarian system at all.

Leaving political ideologies aside and examining it purely from a resource allocation point of view - how many people, if we were designing a system from scratch, would choose the present one with its outcomes? What are the alternatives? Are they any better? 

I mean after all, whilst we have massive inequality, the basic standard of living has also increased hugely under the current system - but is that just the result of technological progress which would have occurred under many alternative systems? 

As the Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, Frederick Soddy wrote in *The Role of Money*:
&gt;It is a curious thought that the earliest description of the steam-engine in antiquity describes its use for the magic opening of the temple doors, when the priests lit the fires on the altars, to deceive the populace into ascribing to a deity what was the work of the engineer. 

&gt;In much the same way today, the almost boundless fecundity of the creative scientific discoveries and inventions of the age are being appropriated for the purpose of the mysterious opening of doors into the holy of holies of the temples of mammon by a hierarchy of imposters and humbugs, whom it is the first task of a sane civilization to expose and clear out. 

What does /r/Futurology think? As the discussion here is often far more balanced and constructive than other places.",18,2

----------------------------------------------------------

**Rationale**

I've been a mod here for almost a year, I'm the founder of /r/Simulate, and run a blog at iontom.com. Today I wanted to submit to you this proposal for a technical solution to rising structural unemployment.

About a month ago, /u/Xenophon1, the founder of /r/Futurology, came to me about a post I had written 10 months ago. I had posted [a question](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateaCommunist/comments/10bnd5/thoughts_on_the_zerostate_movement_transhumanism/) in /r/DebateaCommunist because at that time, I thought that Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) might approximate most closely to Communism. Additionally, I had just become acquainted with the concept of anarcho-capitalism and movements like Zero-State. I was excited about the idea back then, but not sold on the idea yet.

This was also right in the heat of the 2012 election, and even back then there were rumors of the PRISM program's full extent. So I was hesitant to post, but fortunately, we no longer exist in the period of [McCarthyism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism) so I didn't feel too worried.

The main principal I was curious about was how technology could empower resource sharing in a distributed mechanism, without major oversight by the federal government. I was against a ""planned economy"" in the [5-year-plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Five-Year_Plan_(Soviet_Union)) sense, but curious as to whether any of the /r/DebateaCommunist members were open to responsive technological systems as a method for resource redistribution. They were not.

Let me quote [Owen Hatherly at the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/01/why-are-we-working-so-hard):

&gt; Both Lafargue and Wilde would have been horrified if they'd realised that only 20 years later manual work itself would become an ideology in Labour and Communist parties, dedicating themselves to its glorification rather than abolition.

What Hatherly brings up is very sordid concept, that we still view the world stuck in a [""Taylorism"" perspective.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management) Which means that every person is treated as a mere cog in the machine. Whereas the term ""scientific management"" sounds like something most of us might endorse, it actually implies an intrinsic class seperation, and that workers are treated like ""draft animals."" This was a coping mechanism for the layered complexity of industrial projects. Coincidentally, it was used by both the Fordist capitalists and was supported by Leninist communists.

The period of ideological unrest which occured among intellectuals during the apex of the industrial revolution (~1880's-1930's)... Seems to be occuring again in our present age. Except that this time, instead of seeking bloody rebellion for physical domination, we are transfixed directly in the struggle for the future of information and ownership of the individual human mind.

What this style of thinking does however, is to create severe workforce segmentation and prevent interdisciplinary thinking. It's geared towards efficiency, not discovery, and we **now live in the period of accelerating discovery.** One of the overarching effects of this can be felt in [Digital Taylorism:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Taylorism)

&gt; Another example of Digital Taylorism being used in the workplace is found in organizations who use surveillance systems to monitor workers and make sure they are on task at all times; the percentage of surveillance being used in the workplace is continually growing. Phones and computers that employees use at work are being monitored in order to make sure everything is being done in the most efficient way.

This type of panopticon ideology is rampant across our culture, and is partially to blame for the way in which a segmented intelligence community has gone too far with PRISM. This style of management is oppressive and wrong, and ultimately stifles creative thinking. It leads to the bulky protectionist state we have today, and is anti-libertarian. People are unique, have a breadth of skills, and we work best when allowed to think for ourselves.

The reason we love our eccentric billionaires like Elon Musk isn't because we're neccessarily crazy for Capitalism, it's because we crave the intellectual liberty his money empowers him to have. Which showcases the worst dichotema of whole our society: **we praise autonomy and creative thinking and then put up every possible barrier to prevent it from happening. Money itself is designed intrinsically to avoid risk or experimentation.** Yet, we now depend on innovation to increase GDP. It's a toxic situation.

So what happens when the service industry becomes obsolete due to deep learning and AGI? How will we remain productive then? My proposal is meant to be a conversation for starting a technical solution. How do we build a system which is driven by self-motivated creative endeavors, and allows intellectual ""problem-posing"" to shape the economy? We can be more engaged on fixing our problems in a humanist way, creating novel methods of exploration, and integrating the new era of web learning. **Let's put down political labels and determine what ecosystem works best for allowing people to live healthy and pursue their own interests.**


----------------------------------------------------------

**My appeal for your involvement**

So why prompt my idea to /r/Futurology instead of just building my concepts into fruition? The first issue is that I lack all of the development skills and hosting resources required. I'll concede, I'm primarily just an ""ideas guy,"" but I'll do my best to illustrate and build use cases. *(I know core coding skills, and most of the technologies involved, but not at the level required to produce in the immediate term. I'm not rockstar, just a dreamer.)*

Professionally I've done data management and process work, with the aspiration of becoming more involved with the developement cycle. Concindentally, a friend I met through this community was able to secure me a role in a major marketing company. Still though, the Nucleus project needs either full time commitment from a few people, or part-time commitment from dozens of people.

Additionally, my hands are full with /r/Simulate and the projects we have on there. I see Nucleus as a way to promote all types of work and eventually to encourage work on the simulate services. I think the modular approach we have to application specific server instancing will work well for Nucleus. The two projects can eventually provide an integrated experience!

Plus, the idea of an open-source project appeals to the collaborative spirit in which this venture should be made! We need to design this together, code it together, build it together! Who wants to help lead the coding charge? The design? Produce videos?

**Let's start with a Git:** https://github.com/Futurology

Tell me if you want to join! Let's get feedback for the concept as well as planning the implementation!

**tl;dr:** We realize that productive labor is rapidly losing value. Let's come up with a solution through web software. [You can read about it here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/wiki/nucleusproposal)

Right now everyone has access to a printer, but the colors and texture you get from printing ink on paper just doesn't compare to real currency. I imagine with a 3D printer, it won't take long for someone to match the texture, color, even watermarks of real currency, and share the information on how to print it.

So what happens? I assume the government will try new tricks to make the money harder to forge, but will they be able to keep up to those dedicated to counterfeiting?

This has held true for an impressively long period of time after it was identified in 1965.

This is important to people other than chip engineers, because this growth in the past has caused exponential growth in computational power.  Double the transistor density, and you double computational power.  It is often considered important to predictions of the [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity), where the rate of technological growth is also exponential.

This exponential growth has also had a terrific impact on the world of manufacturing and technology.  Because processors are so much more powerful just a short while down the road, it makes little sense to create devices to keep for a long time.  Instead, it makes much more sense to make a device that lasts only a few years and throw it out, and replace it with something new that can take advantage of the new processor speeds.

However, about ten years ago, in 2003, the speed which with we can perform serial computations finally more-or-less hit a wall.  This was a major and important change.  If you take a chip and double its speed of serial computation, it just runs twice as fast.  Any problem that it could solve in two seconds before can now be solved in one second.  Even if the computer programmer doesn't do anything, his software becomes twice as fast in a year or eighteen months.  That process has not been happening for about a decade now.

We did maintain growth in transistor densities, but we could only take advantage of it by adding more parallelism.  The simplest form of this is simply running more-and-more processors side-by-side.  A typical current CPU has four or eight ""cores"" rather than one.

This is not nearly as good as doubling serial computational speed.  Programmers can break up *some* problems, but not all, into a new form where small parts of the problem are computed side-by-side, and then reassembled into a final answer.  Some problems cannot be solved in this fashion, and even for the ones that are, it is more difficult for a human to structure a problem this way.

I raise this here for two reasons:

* I was just reading an article by a [well-known computer engineer](http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=1863) discussing the phenomenon and trying to predict the changes that it will cause in the hardware world.  This engineer was talking about the fact that it's not just that serial computational improvement has been stopped for a long time, but that the rate of increase in transistor density has been falling off for a while now.  It's still exponential, but at a slower-and-slower rate.  That's important, because that growth is what has been what is permitting the remaining improvement in parallel computation performance that has been available to us.

* In the past, when I've mentioned this on /r/futurology, [it has triggered downvotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1i1zh7/cuts_to_research_budgets_could_slow_progress_in/cb0c1k5).

The abandoned buildings of the city could be replaced by buildings with the latest in technology and smart construction, enabling Detroit to be a model for environmentally friendly architecture, and a place where new tech can be tested and implemented.

My goal with the Ancient Lasers project (http://www.ancientlasers.com), from the onset, has been to raise awareness for these technologies, and it fills me with a renewed sense of motivation talking to like-minded musicians and thinkers that share my same goal. 

Yet, it saddens me that more people aren't as excited about this cause as I am...but it makes sense. Alot of people are stuck in a system of stress and distraction, unable to stop, look around, and wonder if things could be different. No one wants their mother, father, sister, or brother to die - yet so many accept it as a law of nature. Just like we wiped out smallpox and polio, we can, if we work at it, eradicate aging.

The Minimum Guaranteed Income is a proposed solution to inequalities generated by Capitalist economies. If society has reached a point where so many are unemployed that a minimum income is necessary for society to function at all, money has become useless and is holding society back. If society has come to this point, The time has come for Capitalism to naturally transition to something else, just as Mercantilism and Palace Economies had their time of transition as well. No economic has lasted throughout the ages, and attempting to maintain Capitalism in such a manner is akin to propping up a cracking dam with PVC pipe: it is a hollow tool that is not built for that job.

Any society that can automate that much production is capable of equitably managing the distribution of the products it creates. Money would only serve to maintain a distinction between haves, who own factories and land, and the have-nots who exist only to consume paycheck after paycheck, living entirely off of the good graces of ""captains of industry"". This is an unacceptable state of affairs; any society that lauds democracy in government must extend this democracy to production, otherwise democracy in government will be over-run by the monarchies that are businesses.

As Captain Picard says, we have no need of money in the 24th century. With sufficient automation and freedom from labor, humans will exist to further their own self development and pursue intellectual or artistic aspirations instead of consumer aspirations. Would you limit somebody's opportunity to self-improvement with an arbitrary monetary sum, when scarcity can be managed and overcome on a practical level? 

What full automation will create is a society that is truly based off of the mantra, ""from all according to their ability, to all according to their need.""

__________________________________

Currently I just have a shadow of an idea:

 I've had that idealized utopian view of a Post-Singularity happy eternity for all until I read [The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect](http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/) which discusses the same topics. 

If the Singularity happened in our lifetimes, how would you think we would go about figuring these things out?

The problem that I have with Immortality is three fold: not knowing the degrees of rights that I have (will my mind become enslaved? will our minds be viewed as having the same rights as computer programs and inanimate objects?) and *what the hell would I do with all that time*, won't I get bored of seeing the same tropes and the same things until I become so irrelevant and out of date? Finally, do I have the power to unplug it all and die?

I don't know about you guys but the idea of getting all this shit done before you die is a big motivator for me. I've had cancer, I'm young and if the end comes, the end comes for me but I at least know that I've gotten most of my bucket list taken care of.

The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect and other works gave me an insight of what would life look like after doing all the things, exploration and have mastered everything that you are interested in. To become a jaded thrillseeker without much regard for anything anymore.

I'm conflicted considering I would like the Singularity to happen but I can't see myself participating in immortality for myself. Anybody else feel this way?

There's something scary---of myself being perpetually bored, jaded, with less compassionate awareness than what I do right now in a non-dying environment. 

At the end of it all, the end will come if it's not in 80 years or 80 bajillion years from now. I don't think in my current state I would be able to live forever when I'm scared of eventual boredom and becoming a shadow of my former self.",4,6

They have an annual contest. This year the winners will present their entries at a conference at MIT in November, where they hope to have policymakers and investors. In one category I'm one of three finalists out of 29 entries.

Here's my entry: [It's the 21st Century. Where's My Fusion Reactor?](http://www.climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/10/planId/1304006) I advocate more funding for alternative fusion projects like focus fusion, polywell, levitated dipole, and several others. I also talk about different ways we might manage funding, like an X-Prize for hitting fusion milestones short of commercialization.

Here are the [other finalists](http://www.climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/10) in the category. 

One winner will be chosen by the judges, and one by popular vote. So far I'm ahead in votes, but voting continues through the end of August so I've got a long way to go.

I'm a volunteer board member of the Focus Fusion Society, and we're helping LPP launch a [crowdfunding](http://lawrencevilleplasmaphysics.com/index.php?option=com_lyftenbloggie&amp;view=entry&amp;year=2013&amp;month=08&amp;day=07&amp;id=100%3Acrowd-funding-announcement-&amp;Itemid=90) effort to get them the last money they need to try to prove feasibility. MIT gets a decent amount of press for the climatecolab so a win there could definitely help.

I can't think of anything that would stop climate change and get humanity out into the solar system faster than near-term cheap fusion, and lately it's actually looking like a possibility. But a lot of projects are really hurting for funds. I'm hoping this entry will help bring them more into mainstream discussions.

If you agree, toss me a vote and tell your friends!

Please read.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1jx7xm/ive_had_breakthroughs_in_agi_its_time_to_do/,[deleted],1375921749,"Unfortunately, I must remain anonymous for now as I'm not sure how this post will be received. I have been working on general intelligence for over a decade. I had reached milestone after milestone, with very simplistic demonstrations of broad intelligence. I've had business partners and we've basically sat and accomplished nothing for ~3 years. Recently, I've begun hiring coders to finalize the system one paycheck at a time. At current pace, that would have been completed some time around the end of the year, at which point I would be able to start developing the demonstration software for it to interact with. Anyway, while mapping out the instructions for my developers, I had an epiphany. I realized that all underlying systems required for my software could be described with a unified algorithm. This was an incredible find, and completely disrupted my development progress (at least for this last month). I plan to get back on track and map out the rest of the system using the new approach.

More on point: I want to reach out to a community I respect. I'm willing to open up and talk to people. I'm willing to show you and the world what I have, but I will proceed very carefully. I'm ready to consider my options for how this should reach the market and the world. One part of me wants to go corporate (I'm an entrepreneur at heart), while the other part is willing to create an open source community for this. I know I haven't said nearly enough to be taken seriously, but this is my attempt to open dialog with you all. It's a start... I welcome any kind of suggestions, ideas, criticisms, etc.

EDIT*****************************************************

I appreciate the words people have posted (positive, neutral, and even the negative). As some have pointed out, I don't want to pollute this community or get it started on bad habits, so I will try to move this away from Futurology. I am strongly considering setting up a website, perhaps the start of an open source community. I want to keep updated those who are interested in seeing whether or not this can be proven by a sufficient demonstration. I'd even like to give the specifications for building IO modules. It would be cool to see what types of demos others could build for this. If you're interested in following this, shoot me a PM so that I can get back with you once something is organized. The number of PMs I get will probably go a long way towards deciding whether I go open source or not. One last thing: Until a sufficient demonstration has removed all doubt, I promise never to ask for a penny from anyone. It will remain completely self funded until then.

EDIT2*****************************************************

The domains I'm going to use for the beginning of this update site/possible open source community has my contact information on whois. I've updated it with whois guard, but Google will take some time to refresh their cache. I'm not sure if I necessarily care about being attached to this, but I would prefer to reveal who I am after the demo is released. Even more, I'd prefer to put someone as the head of the company so I can avoid any potential publicity that could come from this. I will use the cache refresh time to set up the site. I will contact everyone who has reached out to me with that information once ready. Thanks for the interest thus far!

EDIT3*****************************************************

I've tried reaching out to Ben Goertzel again:

""Hi Ben,

I've been asked by several people to contact you. I have been working on software for the last 10 years that has led to what I believe to be a breakthrough in AGI. Currently I have developers who I've hired to help me finalize the code of the core. After that, I will need to make a couple demo modules (yet to be decided) to show it in action. This will be sometime after early 2014. Would you be willing to witness such a demonstration and return a quick and honest critique so that I may show others?

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to email them to me.

Thank you,""",149,57

I am very interested in learning, I enjoy it a lot however now it is time for me to chose a major. I am late getting my education (I am 24) but my addiction to learn is still there.

I love learning about what boils down to physics. To make this short, content by Brian Greene (time, quantum physics, reality), Michio Kaku (futurist, mathematician, technology/computing) and Neil deGrasse Tyson (astronomy, physics, earth science) summarize my interests. 

I am not an expert in these subjects by any means but they're fascinating subjects and I've always been allured to them.

I really have to buckle down somewhere. I was told to be an **engineer**. Because my interests are so broad, should I focus on engineering? I was considering **physics** because it is also broad. In your opinion which is the better option? I have to get much better in math also.

Overall, I my ideal career would involve: completely in a research facility, involving (the latest) tech and working on major projects or apart of a major organization that help shapes the future. Money is not a deal breaker at all, I just really want to meet the above goals in my career. I am also hoping this allows me to travel or relocate outside of the United States.",28,8

A future where

* decentralized energy, ie solar, wind are cheap and efficient and installed on individual buildings apart from the grid

* some fresh produce is grown in the home in low-maintenance, closed systems in protest of GMOs

* fresh water is abundant with small, inexpensive water filtration technologies

* digital, decentralized currency is universally accepted

* personalized medical scanners replace doctor's opinions

* transportation is powered by renewable, sustainable energy

* online education is free, engaging and accredited 

* immersive, virtual environments can simulate the experience of being anywhere
 
* political policies are voted for on the internet in true democratic fashion - ie http://www.onlineparty.ca/

* information and news is gathered from disparate sources and voted on democratically to determine its merit - ie reddit model

To me, a more decentralized future represents more freedom, but demands the individual to be more responsible, educated and accountable for their actions to be a successful system.  I see an unavoidable clash between the old, hierarchical system and the new, decentralized system with personal freedom at stake and the right to adopt technological evolution in debate.

In the post regarding AGI recently, there was a comment saying (this individual) believes that malevolent AI is bound to happen. While I do side with that statement, it made me think about the repercussions.


As we all know that in most societies if we commit an illegal act we are punished if proven guilty. Now I won't get into details about the efficiency of our legal system, rather lets just stick with the thought that crime = punishment.

Now with some malevolent AI packed into a machine that commits a crime (assault, murder, etc) it would lead to an interesting court case. Who would be considered guilty? 

The gun maker is not guilty for any deaths (unless in the case of a faulty gun). I would assume it would be the individual who programmed the machine to assault, as well as the individual who physically released it knowingly of the consequences. 


Now I believe it would be safe to assume this said AI device is connected to the internet. With that in mind, my gut telling me that a system such as the NSA could help track the criminals behind the actions of the machine given their deeply rooted online access. 




*In regards to my views on the NSA, I'm on the fence. I believe if they were more transparent with their policies, it would help gain the public's trust, given that there are reasonable policies.*


* tl;dr: Who would be guilty for a crime by an AI? Do you think the NSA would help convict the felons behind AI crimes.",24,37

This is just an update since they added a stretch goal of one million, and sent this email out to subscribers:



&gt; Thank you to all of you, our backers and our community, for taking the time to share your feedback, suggestions and for voting for the features youd like added to the Emotiv Insight.
&gt;
&gt; We are delighted to set a new stretch goal at one million dollars to make the Emotiv Insight even more amazing than what we had originally intended at launch.
&gt;
&gt;At the one million stretch goal, the Emotiv Insight would be redesigned to incorporate the following additional features at no additional cost: 6-axis inertial sensor (roll, pitch, yaw, vertical, lateral, longitudinal acceleration)
&gt;
&gt; * 3 axis gyroscope (roll, pitch, yaw) 250/500 degrees per second full scale range per axis - low resolution (8 bit) and high resolution (12 bit) modes via API call
&gt; * 3-axis accelerometer (vertical, lateral, longitudinal acceleration) 2g/8g full scale range - low resolution (8 bit) and high resolution (12 bit) modes via API call
&gt; * Emotiv Insights API and SDK for developers and researchers will also include gyro, mouse, and full head motion detection system linked to control outputs for application development.
&gt;
&gt;Incorporation of these additional features to the Emotiv Insight would enable applications such as:
&gt;
&gt; * Short term full-space head tracking  plot the head trajectory and attitude through complex movements
&gt; * Camera and motion control for navigation and control in real and virtual environments  full control of 3D 
cursor in CAD package, flight simulators, head mounted mouse, remote controlled vehicles
&gt; * Automatic recognition of gestures - nod YES, head shake NO, shrug and other gestures
&gt; * Recognize, monitor, record and replay exercise, activity
&gt; * Possible extraction of respiration and heart rate using small scale periodic motion.
&gt; * Gait and tremor analysis



What do you think? There were some in the prior thread that put forth concerns about how they can get that much info from 5 sensors, etc - do you think they can achieve the above things? What possibilities would open up with the new sensors and gyros and head tracking?

I find this amazing, because this is in the neighborhood of the square root of a mole.

sqrt(6.022e23) = 0.776  10^12 = 0.776 Trillion

So, imagine a modern internal hard drive weighs 500 grams.  Also, imagine that it's composition is more Silicon than anything else, with an atomic weight of 28.  This might be a good estimate since there are some heavier metals in there to bring the average up.  In other words, a hard drive contains around 20 moles of atoms.  That means its ""halfway"" point will be:

sqrt((500 g) / (28 amu)) = 3.279  10^12

Most hard drives weigh about the same, but you can increase capacity.  Right now you can buy 3 and 4 TB models.  That's more than the above number.  Let's put this in perspective.  If you buy a 4 TB hard drive:  **There are more bytes in the drive than there are atoms per byte!**

You could have said this a few years ago regarding bits.  And flash storage is so dense, it's sure to have passed the point long ago as well.  Maybe you could count this as your last chance to savor the moment.

Isn't this a compelling argument for the inevitable rise of molecular manufacturing?  As performance improves from here on out, the relationship between the bit and the atom will get more and more intimate.

There is some compelling numerology too.  For instance, the number of cells in the human body is about 100 Trillion - not far off from the bit density of modern electronics.  The difference is that biology uses the basic unit of the cell as a sophisticated factory capable of many amazing tasks, while we use the same number of atoms to represent a ""1"" or ""0"", return, and flip that information on-call.

This is a milestone for us becoming more like biology.  I think that the number of 1 Trillion is special in this way, and someday it will be taught like this to get kids to understand large numbers.

 - a cell is about 100 Trillion times the mass of an atom
 - a human is about 100 Trillion times the mass of their cells
 - the solar system is about (100 Trillion)^2 times the mass of a human

I'm sure you could go further.  It's just an interesting number with which to climb up and down the scale of existence - and it's a number that we've broken into with consumer-level IT.",18,68

* The purpose of society is to benefit the participants and the species, where they would otherwise have more limitations as an individual.

* Science and reason, for the most part, exist with purpose as well; the befit of its practitioners. Strictly speaking, why do if not for gain?

For debate fuel, suppose one person says the ideal means to promote research into the means of a better society lies in the way of maximizing the individual's freedom in as many ways as possible, such as economically and socially. Why and how would this help the society? Does it help society because this is a good, or 'best' way to distribute goods and resources? Or is this not the case? What alternative economic and social systems make sense and exist to further society's agenda (increased, maximal quality of life for all people involved)?

Or do we simply wait for technology to save mankind? If we need technology to save us, why is technological research not at the forefront of our governments' interests and spending? Why is our society not designed around maximizing incentive for scientific progress?

Is it even generally agreed that we should have a goal for society or the world? Why bother with things such as that when people can't even agree on what constitutes morality, or the fact that we haven't nailed down anything with regards to ethics in two thousand years of thought.

So, lets say you planned ahead and started taking blood from yourself as young as possible every 2 weeks from 15 until you were 45 and stored it for the future. As soon as you turn 46 you start to cycle the blood back into you every 2 weeks. At 46 you receive the blood you stored when you were 45, 47 when you were 44, 48 when you were 43, etc...

Would this give your body access to better information about your body over a longer period of time allowing you to live longer or am I completely misguided about how all this works?

In cases such as political leadership ideally decision would be _arrived_ at via application of the scientific method.  A proposal far more reasonable today with the advent of modern operational research methods and computing power than it was in early 19th Century when it was first proposed by Saint-Simon. Although otherwise it was commonly suggested that the leadership be undertaken by scientists and engineers (or sometimes industrialists).

Technocracy Inc. are perhaps the most successful example of this idea in relatively modern times in 1930's America, including some famous members such as Hubbert. However it fell out of favour due to its similar imagery to European fascist movements. For example: [the salute and uniform](http://i.imgur.com/WYxEbBP.jpg) and [rallies](http://i.imgur.com/nSpck7D.jpg).

More recently, The Venus Project has many similar ideas, although it seems to have skimmed over some of the democratic issues by assuming that an intelligent AI will simply be able to make many of the decisions. The Venus Project is far more ambitious and idealistic than Technocracy Incorporated, which combined with its New Age feel is perhaps why it has seen less success (and the lack of a Great Depression to spur people to change).

China could also be considered a kind of technocratic society with its leadership dominated by professional engineers and it has seen a high growth rate and the completion of many advanced projects for its current state of technological development albeit sometimes at high human cost.

Technocracy seems a natural philosophy for any Futurist party although alternative philosophies exist such as [Russian Cosmism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cosmism) which has largely developed into the Transhumanist ideas, although they are more philosophical and fail to offer many of the practical implementations that Technocracy does.

So what does /r/futurology think? Is technocracy a good philosophy or should people be free to elect whomever they wish even if it is a mere showman? Should they be free to choose superstition over science?",28,34

There soon after I heard about a train hovering with magnets in Japan. The tracks had magnets and the bottom of the train as well. Therefore it hovered. Now that made me think by this time I was in the 6th grade. What if you made a street, or highway with steel that had been magnatized. Then a car like vehicle, but with retractable wheels so you can park it and then it has steel on the bottom that is also magnitized. With a air prepulsion system on the back of it, on a pivot so that it could be turned as you turn the wheel. To stop you slow the air down or stop it completely depends on how fast you want to stop. With the weight of the vehicle it wouldnt go more then 4-8 inches off the street. But still IF it worked it would be a large step.

Does anyone believe this would work?

It is just too good not to.

[](/sp)
The book is by [Peter H. Diamandis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Diamandis) (best known for being the founder and chairman of the X PRIZE Foundation, the co-founder and chairman of Singularity University) and [Steven Kotler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kotler) (very well known  journalist).  It seems that it is entirely written from Diamandis' point of view, but Kolter did the editing to make it a good read, not just an informing read. 

[](/sp)
What the book goes over is rather impressive in and of itself.  All kinds of different things; Health, water, the DIY movement, energy, gene sequencing, food, the rising billion, education, and so much more.  Not only does Diamandis talk about the future possibilities of these different areas and how it all relates to exponential technologies &amp; a post scarcity world, but the seemingly insurmountable obstacles &amp; how we will overcome them within the next twenty years.  This is not done using simple conjecture, but by showing past trends, current research, and showing the exponential growth of all the related industries as they become digital.  It covers all of these topics and cites many, many different sources for every single point the authors bring up.  Half the book is *just* sources and graphs that illustrate these facts (Calibre says its 900 pages long, so 450 pages of sources). 

[](/sp)
I should also mention that in the Praise section of the book the VERY first quote in the book is  
""This brilliant, must-read book provides the key to the coming era of abundance replacing eons of scarcity. Abundance is a powerful antidote to todays malaise and pessimism"".  
And that is from Ray Kurzweil.  If my short, badly written review has not properly illustrated the quality of this book, then that quote should be a good hint.

406,2013-8-13,2013,8,13,9,1k8vlf,I'd like some thoughts on my idea to transition society to a resource-based economy (Like The Venus Project).,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1k8vlf/id_like_some_thoughts_on_my_idea_to_transition/,N_J_D,1376355526,"I saw a discussion posted on here from about 6 months ago that was on The Venus Project (**EDIT:** A good start on the idea of TVP: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDJ18m6KUW4). I myself, have been very interested in the project and have volunteered to help them with various tasks. The biggest hurdle to me - as mentioned in the referenced discussion - is how we transition all of the world over to this type of society. Well, IMO, it is inevitable. 

We have two options, 1) Keep a monetary system, plummet the worlds resources for profit and destroy the planet along with civilization, or 2) Switch to a society outlined in The Venus Project, cultivate all of the Earth's resources sustainably, and progress infinitely (as I believe we would conquer space travel in this scenario).

As discussed, this transition is the hard part. But I believe Quipster99 hits it on the head: http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16y0da/lets_discuss_the_venus_project/c80ut93

We need to show that the system we are using is obsolete. My idea that I believe can be implemented TODAY would be to invest in a large empty area in the desert (AZ, NV, NM, are obvious choices) build a MASSIVE array of solar panels and power any nearby cities. Offer the residence of those cities contracts where they can receive this power at half of their average cost in power bills. This money would then go into the expansion of said power until the point that the solar arrays would power all cities in this country (America). 

I have done some research and came across an article claiming it would take 50 square miles of solar panels to power San Diego (America's 8th largest city). Source: http://voiceofsandiego.org/2011/05/18/fact-check-how-much-solar-to-power-san-diego/. If you have ever driven through the Southwest (I've lived in the area for 8 years) you will see endless miles of unused desert wasteland that could be put to great use. The Mojave desert alone takes up about 25,000 square miles.  You can get an idea of how much space that is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mojave_Desert_map.svg.  According to the article, harvesting this size of a desert for solar power could power 622 million homes, **that is more homes than nearly DOUBLE the human population of the United States.** 

Once we have clean power going to massive areas, people can transition to things like electronic cars and remove fossil fuel from the equation altogether. This starts the domino effect of removing obsolete technology and disrupting the status quo.

I believe this is a feasible plan that could be implemented by someone with significant money (think Elon Musk), that was benevolent enough to give most of it up in order to progress mankind (think Nikola Tesla). Who knows, maybe we could even crowd-source this. What do you guys think?

**EDIT:** You really must understand the vision of The Venus Project to understand the point and end all with this transition. This is not a system devised to make money, it is devised to move us off of money by crippling our dependance on unsustainable power.  I am also not proposing this system of having just the deserts covered with solar panels as the only solution to the placement of panels, there is actually a good write up on a solar powered Earth by Gizmodo. Here: http://gizmodo.com/5350191/how-many-solar-panels-would-it-take-to-power-the-entire-world **TL;DR** I'm theorizing a billionaire investor donates his fortune to move us to a sustainable power system that is free aside from maintenance and expansion costs. I believe this would start the transition into a money-free society.

**EDIT:** I have now done next to nothing outside of reading and responding to all of your posts on this thread the last two days. It's been quite enlightening and equally exhausting. As it started off as a pipe dream, a lot of you brought many great points and really put some perspective on it.

Making a proposition without being an expert is going to lend itself to be scrutinized by people steeped in knowledge on the topic almost always on reddit. Often harshly. Which is why I posted this in the first place. It wasn't enough to just think to myself it could work, I really wanted to get some real input and alternative plans. Blindly researching could easily turn into a fruitless venture.  It's nice to have a directed approach which is what a lot of you have offered. This is a really great tool to have and at every turn the Internet never ceases to amaze me.

I appreciate all of you who took time to add input and I'm excited to explore further on this topic and the rest posted at /r/futurology. As for now, this thread is about done and I can focus on things I am a little more of an ""expert"" in. Cheers!",56,3

Indeed this makes sense as unlike other engineering problems, in designing systems with advanced intelligence for machine learning applications etc. we have the massive benefit that we already have many such working systems. Billions of them in fact, in the form of the brains and nervous systems of organisms.

However, as the exact reasons for sleep remain unknown and sleep-like behaviour has been observed even in very simple organisms such as the *C. elegans* nematode worm then it seems entirely possible that as we duplicate these biological systems, our artificial systems could also require something like sleep in order to operate.

The incidence of sleep even in very simple organisms implies that it is not solely required by our extremely high level brain functions such as sentience etc. and so perhaps it shall be observed even in the relatively simple artificial systems we are beginning to construct.

Either way the advent of neuromorphic computing holds great promise for the advancement of both computing and biology.",12,3

This is a science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter. They're two of my favorite authors independently but they work *very* well together.

The book is about a world where a new technology destroys privacy forever. It's a technology centered around wormholes that peer through time/space cheaply and easily, utterly removing any sense of privacy forever. The book explores what would happen to society if no one was free to act without the threat of someone watching.

I am sharing it with you folks because that's sort of where I feel we're headed. It won't be one technology that eliminates privacy, it'll be a hundred little ones that erode it until there are no places left to hide. A good example is the [Terahertz frequency chips](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-02-07/ali-hajimiris-chip-may-allow-smartphones-to-see-through-objects) that could let you look through just about anything.

I doubt in 100 years if there will be a place left on Earth that is truly private. Whether or not the cat and mouse game of encryption falls under that guestimation I don't know but hopefully it'll be everyone watching everyone, not discrete groups watching everyone. 

Anyway I'm working my way through The Light of Other Days again and figured with privacy being such a big concern it might make for an interesting read. The second half of the book has some novel ideas about people trying to hide from ubiquitous eyes.",6,19

Content here has been consistently intellectually stimulating, and has motivated me more than I would have believed possible.

There was a speech/video I remember watching a while ago about ""How we stopped dreaming"", how we, as a culture, have forgotten or given up on large ""world of tomorrow"" goals and ideas. For me, and I would guess many of you, /r/Futurology has been more than another Popular Mechanics, it has provided the motivation for individuals to improve the world around us, reminded us that learning, attending school, and working should not just be a means to a larger paycheck.

/r/Futurology has been an amazing repository for ideas many of us haven't encountered before, and it shows in the numbers! Over the last few months this sub has had a huge influx of subscribers, who came here for the same exact reasons we all did, and this is fantastic, 

**BUT**

Unfortunately the growing user base has brought with it some less than desirable habits, such as glorifying people rather than their ideas, which is a problem, as ideas are what give us a window into the future and motivate us. They are what this sub is all about.

The [top post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1k9fcl/elon_musk_is_more_important_to_society_than_steve/) at the time of this writing is not futurology material. Posts like this have become increasingly common, and I've even seen a few pictures with someone's quote plastered all over it make it to the front page. This is not good.

We've seen subs go this way before, and it always ends in tears (or rather, memes). I encourage the Mods to strictly uphold the rules for posts, specifically the **keep submissions/content relevant** part. I do not intend this as criticism, as I have no way of knowing how many crap posts get screened by mods already. More importantly, us the subscribers have to do our part.

For example:

Yesterday the plans for the hyperloop came out and today the front page is filled with links about it. This ~~isn't ideal~~ is ok, since the links lead to real content (the .pdf) but it's not ideal.  The ideal way for us, the subscribers to deal with something like this is to determine which of the posted links is the most reliable, the most content heavy, and upvote *just that one*, while leaving the other ones. The significantly less than ideal way to go about this is making meta posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1k9nlt/hey_guys_have_you_heard_about_the_hyperloop/). This only contributes to the problem, it's not funny, it's not content, and it definitely doesn't fix anything.


Ladies and gentlemen I absolutely love this sub, and I would hate to see it go down the drain like so many others, like (to use an extreme example) /r/Atheism. I don't know how many of you remember this, but there was a time when you could actually have an interesting discussion on that sub without the whole place clamoring about memes, crazies, and ""neckbeards"".

/rant

/PSA

Please do your part.

**TL;DR** Read the sidebar and posting rules, Don't post/upvote memes/image macros, Don't make meta posts (yes, I can appreciate the irony, but please...), discuss ideas rather than people.

Edit: fixed grammar/formatting

Edit: If any moderators see this, your input would be greatly appreciated. Like I said, you probably have a more complete view of the state of things than we do.",173,869

It is a building called ""Sky City"", and is being designed to be a city-inside-a-building.  It will contain residences, shopping, business offices, entertainment such as an amusement park, movie theaters, etc etc.. even internal gardens to grow food and flowers etc.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_City_(Changsha)

It is being built using prefab technology... that is, the pieces of the tower are being built on an assembly line in a factory built on-site.  Where as a building of this size would traditionally take something like 5+ years to complete, they intend to build the entire structure in only several months.  Doing so saves a tremendous amount of money.. some estimates suggest it can cut something like 40% of the cost of the building.  It is also estimated that the cost of living for residents will be significantly lower than outside the building due to a number of efficiencies.

His idea makes sense to me. We really don't need to store excess calories as fat anymore - the world that many people live it, you aren't concerned about ""this years hunt"" or however Kurz puts it. Obviously there are people all over the world where this is still an issue, but I hope that world starvation is one of the first things helped by the coming technological revolution. 

Ray always drops in into his speeches, talking about the rat that eats ravenously but does not gain any weight, and PHROOOM, phantoms away and never mentions it in any detail. I can't really find any information about this research anywhere. How do you all feel about this drug? Do you have any other information about it? Links or articles perhaps?

I feel like this could truly help a vast amount of people. The obesity problem in the United States is rampant - a gene therapy like this could very well lead to healthier lifestyles for people who feel like they were born fat and will always be fat. Then of course, the heart issues for people who are overweight... heart disease of this nature could PLUMMET - which would be a great thing for those individuals and their families. And though I'm not a big guy, I'd love to be able to eat some crappy food every now and then and not have to worry about working off the calories later that night (superficial I know, but still, a Big Mac tastes DAMN good).

I've seen the following two ideas frequently enough:

1. Capital will become increasingly more valuable than labor.

2. You generally can't go wrong with a degree in a 'STEM' field (science, tech, engineering, medical)


I'm finishing the core requirements now for a Bachelors in Political Science with quite a lot of room yet for elective credits.  I realize that a polysci degree won't get me anywhere near what I actually want to do so I plan to use the elective credits to fulfill prerequisite requirements towards a second bachelors, double major, or masters program.  

I'm fascinated by Futurology and want to play a part in the dramatic changes we'll be going through in the next few decades.


**I'm most interested in driverless cars and automation in general.
What programs would be most beneficial?**
Mechanical engineering? Robotics? Computer science?

What's the common denominator between Google's driverless car, the machines featured on How It's Made, the participants of various DARPA challenges, Lettuce Bot, Honda's Asimo, and any other autonomous project?

Is there some special Automation and Robotic Computer Technologies program at MIT that I don't know about?


In a more general sense, these fields seem like they'll be involved in the more radical changes of the near future:

* computer science
* biomedical engineering
* cognitive neuroscience
* physics
* engineering
* space exploration
* nanotechnology

To bottle it all into a catch-phrase, I think this covers it well:

&gt; The Hyperloop throws space-age engineering at a problem that doesn't need it

The design would offer extremely rapid transit for the SF-LA corridor (about 1 hour).  If you start with that as the product, then it's clear that Hyperloop has a lot of solid engineering thought behind it.  Everyone seems to agree that it's something we *could* build, but it might be massively expensive, present safety concerns, and be politically impossible.

If we consider politics, [Reason TV did a good piece on private bus services](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft8-ZaugYSU), these companies offered **4 hour** trips for SF-LA and grew fantastically.  And they were shut down, in both the 1950s and face resistance again today.

Is it misuse of our resources to focus on a 1 hour transportation corridor when we don't have a healthy market for the 4 hour alternative?  What about something half-way?

What could we do to make something that *looks like* the Hyperloop, and possibly borrows things from it, but doesn't have the same expense and technology requirements?  After all, Musk was intentionally trying to ""open source"" the designs.  So maybe there's momentum to talk about new options for transportation.  Because of that, I want to see if people have ideas of a direction it could go.

What could we change to make it something we can build sooner?",8,0

It can be found [here](https://civinomics.com/workshops/4M4w/us-space-priorities).

Fundamentally, we believe that by engaging more people in the discussion, decision-making and a information aggregation process, we can create a more transparent and equitable list of priorities than currently exist. The exploration and act of learning about space is something that belongs to all people. Furthermore, the act of determining what we should focus on and how is greater than any one individual.

The goals of this online workshop are as follows:

* Determine which programs and projects are the highest priority
* Suggest opportunities that NASA hasn't yet considered
* Propose and evaluate new space projects
* Brainstorm potential funding sources
* Establish the relationship between private and public organizations

In short, you can use this portal (workshop) to:

* submit your ideas that address one or more of the workshop goals
* vote on other people's ideas
* submit outside pieces of information, such as articles, pics, video, etc.
* create informal discussion topics *and...*
* invite topical experts or people in a position to implement or some of these priorities

Please participate. **The more people who do the better, and more legitimate the results will be.**

It seems like many of the problems facing modern societies are related to various interpretations of the same written laws. My question, could we come up with something better? Specifically, could we take some object oriented programming principles and use them to define a structure for laws. I think inheritance might work nicely. City laws could extend state laws which extend federal laws. Certain laws could be declared final if they cannot be overridden by a lower government.The federal government could use the concept of an interface to define a framework for states to implement.

Whenever someone gets too old or to an age they don't want to be, they go to a special clinic and have their bodies reverted back to adolescence, including all the hormones and everything else that goes along with being young. They don't go into much detail but your age is basically reset while all your memories and such are kept in neural inserts. 

My question is how feasible is this? Obviously the wormholes are a little more far fetched but the rejuvenating seemed a little more in line with reality, he mentions that geneticists in Europe were making breakthroughs in such things in the middle of the 21st century, so I'm curious as to how close we are to reversing aging in this manner?

It seems the argument they are making is that most of the money that wasn't accounted for would be in buying up parcels of land up and down California. 

In the planned proposal, it is stated that the Hyperloop would run in the middle of the 5 freeway, which is already owned by California. Even if they did have to build it along parcels of land not owned by the State, I would think that since the plan was to use pylons and the rail wouldn't be on the ground, that they wouldn't have to fully buy the land because the original owners would still have relatively full access to their land with minimal intrusion.

590,2013-8-19,2013,8,19,10,1kn0oq,Lets talk Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics and AGI.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1kn0oq/lets_talk_asimovs_three_laws_of_robotics_and_agi/,Death4999,1376876438,"For quick reference:

1.  A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

2.  A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3.  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

So as far as I know Asimov came up with these laws to govern robots because he was sick of the traditional robots-turn-against-their-masters trope.  I feel however that these laws go about such a prospect in the completely wrong way, as shackling machines to avoid them turning on humankind would just instigate it instead...that is if I am understanding the whole idea correctly.

Such rules are fine when dealing with automatons and the like, as they would not be true sapient beings nor would be designed to be.  Obviously there are different types AIs and robots (I am sort of using these terms interchangeably here) at play and soon enough to be at play: factory and construction automatons, simple drones and dwelling care machines, nanomachines of all sorts, AIs that manage houses, cities, governments...and then the unavoidable androids made to be like us; and all that is without even counting superintelligent god-like AI.

I would be willing to bet that all of these types of machine intelligences will be created, with none left out.  I think the general consensus here regarding the promise of AIs is that they shall surpass us in every way, becoming equal to us (i.e. personhood) for a short time before exponentially shooting off into unfathomable levels of power and intelligence due to the predicted and considered intelligence explosion...more than a person then I would assume.

With all this in mind, I have to wonder just how these Laws, and anything else pertaining to or of them, will factor into all these different types of machine intelligences.  Surely it makes sense to apply them to the simple ""non-intelligent"", as it were, machines...but not to anything equal to or higher than say a machine with the intelligence of at least unaltered human level right?  This would bring up the question of where the line is drawn and such, and would no doubt be subject to senseless prejudice and other such evils.

Another thought that comes to mind is would an android (or perhaps a ""governing AI"") desire to become a superintelligent AI similar to how there are those of us who wish to become superintelligent posthuman?  Or would that happen naturally due to the possible differences of the machine mind to our own?  Still, I am curious...has this been answered before or have I made a potentially worthwhile post here?  What are the thoughts of this sub on the subject?",13,7

It's pretty much the definitive cyberpunk animation, and it's great. I think everybody in this sub would enjoy it and should watch it.

Setting: 2030. Many people have ""cyberized"" brains, where their brains are incased in aluminum, and connected to the internet. Some people (called cyborgs) also have their neocortex replaced with a computerized. Additionally, many people use prosthetic, computerized bodies in lieu of their natural ones, while retaining their cyberized brain.

To those who've seen it, and to those who haven't but want to weigh in anyway, when do you think earth will resemble the GitS universe? 2030 seems much too early to me. I would say 2060 or even 2070 is more reasonable.

Any other thoughts relating GitS and futurology are welcomed.

If I may provide a suggestion for where to draw thoughts from, and if you'd like, http://futuretimeline.net seems about a decade or so more conservative than Kurtzweil in general, and every claim is cited.

They see the writing on the wall for dwindling PC sales which is why they came out with the horrible OS they call windows 8 which makes a desktop experience tedious at best.

Microsoft should buy blackberry, but not for its technology, for its distribution and emerging market distribution lines.  Whenever i am in an emerging market i still see everyone 'bbming' each other.  

Once acquired Microsoft should dump blackberry OS and fit their windows phone OS onto but with one huge change.  Make Skype the default way people talk to others on the phone.  Emerging markets already use this extensively to save on calling costs and video conferencing.  If they get rid of the carrier as the main means of communication and make skype calling the main way to communicate on the phone they can lower everyone's costs and make the carriers less relevant.  

Microsoft also has one other key piece of technology that would allow for a more advanced phone experience.  They should take their kinect experience and miniaturize it into the phone.  Stereoscopic imaging to calculate depth would allow for all sorts of unique experiences such as 3d printing or biometrics or even mobile game playing without adding much cost to a headset.  With this type of sensor, the whole user interface can become more immersive.

So, I'm curious, since most of the posts here seem hopeful and eager to see what the future becomes (and yes, I hold the hope for the future optimism that really irritates people I tend to converse with in r/collapse and r/overpopulation).

However, as our understanding of the vastness of space and the technology required to span these great distances becomes more apparent, writers have to adopt new and imaginative ways of making these stories plausible. Things such as cryogenic sleep, faster than light (FTL) travel, dark matter and antimatter have all been stretched or adapted to make the magic of space travel more believable, more realistic, if I may. 

My question to you is, given our modern understanding of physics, the perils of space, the vast energy requirements, and the many other logistical obstacles to space travel, what modes of transportation are you, the reader, most willing to accept from new science fiction?

701,2013-8-23,2013,8,23,5,1kwch3,The State of /r/Futurology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1kwch3/the_state_of_rfuturology/,fanaticus,1377203897,"Hello everyone!

I think it's no secret that our subreddit has seen a MASSIVE amount of growth in the past few months (I'd be curious to see just how many new subscribers we've picked up since April). And while a wider viewership is ultimately a **good** thing, I think it is time we have a serious discussion on how we would like to run this subreddit (moderators I would love to see your input in the comments)

The reason I'm making this post is because when I was looking through /r/Futurology today, I couldn't help but notice the lack of quality content in the comment sections of nearly every post. To put it frankly, the comments are atrocious. I'm going to post the top comment from a few of the top posts in the subreddit today just so you guys have an idea of what I mean.

1. http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1kvk3f/in_the_united_states_a_solar_system_is_installed/cbt130n 
Essentially all this comment does, it's ENTIRE purpose, is to point out that /u/1337snake can not properly read a title. It offers no unique insight, it does nothing to furthur a discussion about solar energy, and overall it looks immature.

2. http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1kvh50/the_future_of_psychiatry_may_be_inside_your/cbt1s9c
Again, we have a top post that is nothing more than a terrible joke. For a subreddit that has the potential to be as intellectually stimulating as /r/Futurology, having jokes as leading comments is a real shame.

3. http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1ktij0/teslas_model_s_is_outselling_buick_fiat_land/cbsmyda
This is actually the comment that prompted me to send this message in the first place. I mean, how on earth is this acceptable? It is LITERALLY one word. Again, and I hate to repeat myself, it offers zero insight and it doesn't lead to any intelligent conversation.

I could continue to list more comments as they are becoming more and more frequent, but I think we all get the point.

And while we are not a default subreddit and the amount of subscribers is nowhere near the level of /r/politics or /r/askreddit, we do have over 100,000 people - which is more than enough for the quality of a subreddit to deteriorate (as we are seeing). 

Now the question is: **""What do we do about it?""** The answer is actually pretty simple. We need to set up a sort of standard for comments (we already have one for posts in that memes aren't allowed, etc), and when a comment is made that doesn't hold up to those standards, we just simply have to report it and let the moderators handle the rest. 

Personally, I come to /r/Futurology for the same reasons I go to /r/Science. Both are places that appeal to my interests and have the potential to be intellectually stimulating and offer information that I otherwise would never have understood/known about. The difference between the two is that /r/Science has over 3 **million** subscribers and yet their comment section is (for the most part) full of quality comments. So, if a 3+ million subreddit can do it, so can we. 

**TL;DR - /r/Futurology needs to be more like /r/Science and have standards put in place for our comments.**",4,33

I'd say I'm about six months from being able to ""launch"". Until now, I've kept this project of mine very secret for a variety of reasons.

I'm a programmer, activist, futurist, scientist... I try to be all that I can, and that's all I want for everyone else too.

I'd be happy to answer any questions here or in the linked post, but what I need most is people that are willing to jump in and help. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/project_earth/comments/1kwnmw/what_is_project_earth/

Also, I made this as a self-post specifically so that I wouldn't get karma. I've designed this entire project so that not only will I *not* make money off of it, I've designed the technical aspects of the tools to be virtually impossible to monetize. 

I don't want anything for this project. At first, I even worked hard to make sure that my name would never be attached to it. Things like paying for domain names, for instance, I originally payed for using a Visa giftcard which I bought specifically in a way that couldn't be traced back to me... I really didn't want this project to be slowed down by any side discussions.

Over two years of working through the project though, I've come to realize that while that would in some ways be ideal, I simply can't do all the initial work myself. I can do most of it, but not all of it. It's also become more obvious to me that the project itself would be less rich if I were to do it completely myself. I'm white, I'm male. I live in the ""first-world"". There are lots of perspectives that I'm aware of that I can't represent, and there are probably even more that I'm not aware of.

Opening this project up to the public still makes me nervous. Please have patience with me while I find my comfort level and explain things. 

I look forward to your feedback and questions.",22,51

Tell me why it won't work.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1kx9xf/my_proposal_for_faster_than_light_communication/,Minguseyes,1377232348,"Whenever a news article pops up about entanglement and 'teleportation' people point out that we can't use these properties to communicate information faster than light speed.

So, what is wrong with the following method ?

Firstly let me use as many entangled particles as I want. The object of the thought experiment is to demonstrate something is possible, not feasible.

Consider a population of sets of entangled particles. Each set consists of two (or more) entangled particles. The sets may themselves be entangled with each other. One particle from each set is retained at the Transmitter (Alice) the other is transported, preserving entanglement, to the Receiver (Bob). Let's say Bob is a light year away.

If Alice measures her particles, then that will affect Bob's particles by spooky 'action at a distance'.

In particular, given a large enough population size, I understand it will affect Bob's particles as follows:

Before Alice measures the particles in her population when Bob measures his particles he will get one set of statistical results. After Alice measures the particles in her population when Bob measures his particles he will get a different set of statistical results. 

I understand this follows from [Bell's Theorem] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_theorem) and means that Bob can tell whether Alice (or anyone else) has previously measured her population of particles.

The size of the population is arbitrary and is defined as the minimum size necessary to enable such statistical differentiation to be detected. A population may be as small as one set of entangled particles or as large as is required for the statistical difference to be detected.

Call that population one 'bit'.

Consider multiple such bits. In order for my proposal to work those bits have to be independent and unentangled, meaning measuring one bit will make no difference to other bits.

Alice and Bob decide, arbitrarily, that a bit which obeys statistics showing it's entangled pair particles have previously been measured will have a value of '1' and a bit which obeys statistics showing it's entangled pair particles have not been measured will have a value of '0'.

Alice wants to send Bob a message at a prearranged time. She sets the value of her bits by measuring those bits which are to have a value of 1 and not measuring those bits which are to have a value of 0. 

When Bob measures his bits he will detect which bits Alice has measured as 1's and those bits which Alice has not measured as 0's. Bob will receive Alice's message.

Why is that impossible ?

The changes that were about to experience just seem soepic. Reading the work of futurists, and looking at posts from this subreddit has been of the the most mind-boggling experiences of my life. The Singularity, and its associated predictions and implications, has kept me up many nights, causing me to ponder a future world so, so vastly different than our present reality. 

**I cant stop thinking about what if.**

* What if we could cure aging in the future? What might it be like to see the eons pass, and to experience history as it unfolds?

* What if we learn to manipulate biotechnology with ease? Would we create glowing, Pandora-like forests, or perhaps some fantastic creatures unknown to nature? 

* What if, in the future, we could explore the universe? What might we find? Who might we meet? Will we find ourselves custodians to life in the universe, or will we join the ancient members of a billion-year old party in the galaxy nextdoor?

* What if, in the future, we could augment our intelligence to godlike levels? What would it be like to experience the world through the lens of superintelligence? What if knowledge wasnt so difficult to acquire - where we could download books and PhDs into our heads in the blink of an eye?

* What if there comes a time in the future where we dont have to work to survive? What if we could live our lives the way we wanted to, without worrying about slaving away at some ungratifying job just to pay the bills? How would we spend our time - what would we do?

* What if we could one day, hijack our nervous system and enter virtual worlds indistinguishable from our own (i.e. Matrix), only infinitely more vast and fantastic? What kind of adventures might we have? What kinds of worlds would we create?!

I just get so hopeful thinking about this potential future sometimes. The truth is that I would be absolutely crushed if the Singularity and its associated technologies and predictions turned out to be a load of bullshit. 

I hope I dont find myself on my deathbed at an old age, regretting ever having seen this fantastic vision of a future which never came to pass.

But if you watch a single individual area (apart from semiconductors), the steps are incremental and progress is slow. So instead of focusing on 20 years from now when fusion or graphene finally take off (hopefully a lot sooner), what developments do you think about in the near future that will make life much better?

What I'm more interested in is a more open source society. I understand certain projects take huge investment. Right now, businesses control the ventures for a variety of very good reasons. But it feels like a relic of the age before computers. First, I want to have direct access to the gardeners, handymen, plumbers, electricians, odd jobs, etc. instead of searching up a local company, calling them to come by, them sending a guy a few hours to days later, fixing the problem, getting a tip, and most of the money going to the company. There should be a way to notify the nearest handymen, etc. that I need service and I should be able to set a minimum level of customer service points to get the ideal service where cost = quality of job+service points+speed or something and all the money goes to that specific operator/team. I just don't want a review site, I want a society that is directly connected with software integration supplementing interactions at all levels for greater service, communication, and fidelity.  

But aside from that, I want to be able to work on open source consumer products in any area. I want to be able to work on biosensors one day, batteries the next, expand my influence into several different fields and areas. With the amount of knowledge available today online, I can read up on an area in a few months and start learning from others already involved in the field to get a greater learning experience while I develop to their level. I don't want to be pigeon-holed into working on biosensors the rest of my life, or batteries the rest of my life due to my resume. The end consumer good should be sold on a repository site for goods and sent through automated transportation (futuristic) or just any decent courier service. Profits from that good should be distributed evenly to collaborators based on the amount of contribution and knowledge provided. Even a small contribution that went into the final product should be valued. People should be able to come on to projects and off projects with their contributions lasting or getting replaced in iterations. Once the final product is shipped, work can start on a new type of product or an iteration of the existing product. Its flawed in many ways, but I hope something like this comes about or if it exists, I would like to know. I know GitHub and other coding projects work on a similar model, but I want to work on more tangible and cutting edge projects. Labs should be available for rent and chemicals should definitely be easier to order, a model similar to Sigma's website but much cleaner. Serial grassroot investors or a pooling of resources will help finance the project with unlimited man-power (unlimited being anybody can help work on the project) and knowledge pool (knowledge available online) with the end goal being a profit share in the final product whether it be a product design, a biosensor, a market strategy, etc. 

Lastly, I want a deeper integration of ease of access by digital means. I want to be able to drive a Ferrari one day and Tesla the next at 1/10 the cost of normal rent-a-car. I want groceries and products delivered to my front door as soon as I see with augmented reality goggles that toothpaste is low or food products are low. By automated means if secure. I want to be able to do daily check ups at home and have an analysis of the results instantly with dietary and exercise recommendations. 

Don't get me wrong, I would love if immortality or human-level AI occurs within our time, but I'd appreciate the little things in life that contribute to an easier lifestyle. ",20,14

The Global Citizen Project is a community building software that has the stated goal of encouraging people to think of themselves as citizens of our world and our species. It is designed to tackle apathy, lethargy and despair.

When a user signs up, they are prompted to select **five** things they care about (from a list). This could be anything from basketball, to cosmetics, to climate change, to particle physics, to fashion. It's important that at signup they are primed to really pick things the *care* about, not things they feel are important, or things that they think others feel are important, or things they want to care about. They need to pick things they are *passionate* about.

After selecting your five areas, the are informed that you are claiming responsibility for these five topics. You are charged with their care. What this means is that anywhere you encounter any of these five topics in your daily life, you should do your best to improve that thing. To make it better in some small way, or really whatever way you reasonably can at that moment. You don't seek them out, you don't travel to areas that are problematic. You just go through your days, and anytime your life happens to intersect one of your responsibilities, contribute to it positively.

The platform creates one (closed) community for each topic. You receive access to each of the five communities that you chose. The people in each of these communities may have entirely different passions, but your passions overlap with theirs in that one area. They might share more than one with you, but most people who you meet in all five of your topics will probably only share one community with you, and they will overlap with different crowds in different communities.

You can post **Observations** which are similar to diary entries about what you encountered that day. You can also post **Missions** for things that you observed but were unable to address. Communities can also create **Initiatives** that organize larger actions, including funding of the actions.

Each community is governed by community voted &amp; nominated moderators. A moderator may only moderate one community at a time, and may not serve consecutive terms as moderator in the same community. Moderator terms last six (6) months, and any action taken by a moderator can be overturned by a **Referendum** vote, which requires 2/3 participation from the community, and 2/3 approval of those voting.

Multiple communities can create **Projects** which pool the interests and skills of multiple communities to achieve larger goals.

The ""forums"" that are created are not freeform, and the site itself will charge the moderators with enforcing certain community standards centered around focus and productivity. This is not a message board for you the shmooze, it is where you hold yourself accountable to helping make the world a better place in small increments.

The number of communities you have, five, is somewhat arbitrary. It was chosen to feel manageable. I feel I can take care of five passions. Most people lose track and become apathetic when they start to consider *all* the topics they could be productive in though. Part of the purpose behind this project is to also reassure you that, yes, other people are taking care of the projects that you can't. You do your part, others will do theirs.

This is the basic concept. It is much more fleshed out than this obviously. I'm summarizing and glossing certain things, so feel free to ask questions.

I propose establishing medical prizes to incentivise clinical trials for unmonopolisable/unprofitable therapies which are socially valuable but for which there is a market failure under the current patent system (i.e. they are unlikely to raise funds under the traditional markets or equity crowdfunding). Some examples include clinical trials for diet/supplement based medical therapies, lifestyle choices, second uses for cheap generic medicines, new antibiotics and drugs for neglected diseases (e.g. malaria, tuberculosis). 

Crowdfunded medical prizes are different from other crowdfunding science websites (e.g. www.microryza.com, www.petridish.org) which tend to focus on basic research as per the traditional grant/NIH model - there is also an information gap between donors and the project founders and results are not ""guaranteed"". Crowdfunding prizes would flip the funding model on its head and help bridge the current ""valley of death"" between basic and clinical research. To the extent that a large incentive prize would create many failed clinical trials, that's a great thing, because failed clinical trials provide valuable information about which treatments don't work. 

Under my proposed model, each donor would have freedom to decide which participants received their donation and in what proportion e.g. if 3 participants fulfilled the criteria, the donor can decide how much to donate to each participant - however, if they don't decide within a minimum period, the prize founder can allocate. 

However, the main problem is that a prize would require a lot of public support i.e. at least US$10 million for a clinical trial of at least 100 patients (which costs about US$2.5 million to run). Arguably, governments/insurers should also sponsor prizes to the extent that cheap interventions would reduce healthcare costs. ",0,1

I can see churches having communist systems, providing food, shelter and income. 

Who owns land is the sticking point as it makes nearly everything else possible. 

So i think this system would come into it's own when land is part of the means of production when  automatous systems create torus settlements like Elysium for free from asteroids and free solar energy.



Edit: thanks for replies. I think words like communism and socialism are a bit old fashioned and misleading for this problem, which is new. We need new words. What is the word for owning a robot and sending it to work to do your job. Words like stakeholder or co-op are more accurate though there is some ownership of the means of  production involved. Whats stopping your boss from buying the same robot and pocketing the money saved. That would be if your boss was a robot/Ai and the whole business was dedicated to paying beneficiaries like you.

The IDDE is a tool designed to facilitate the functioning of democracy on any scale, large *or* small. It can be used for legislation, government charters/constitutions, representation, negotiations, and probably many other applications. I'll detail a few of them.

**Legislation &amp; Charter/Constitution**

Here's the basic voting process.

1. Proposal made
2. Each user has one week to submit their set of changes to the proposed document.
3. The following week, each user may approve or disapprove of every change proposed the previous week. Which changes you get to vote on are random, and their totals are blind.
4. At the end of the preceding two week period, the proposed change which received the most approval becomes the new working version.
5. If the last change received less than 2/3 approval, go back to step 1.
6. If the last change received more than 2/3 approval, got back to step 1, however during the week for change submission, users will also vote on whether to accept the current version as a final version.
7. If 2/3 of participating users during the vote in step 6 accept the document, the process stops, and the document becomes finalized. It is now considered binding for whatever its purpose was.

This accomplishes a couple of things. Not everyone will get to vote on every change every week. Suppose you have 1 million proposals in a given cycle. The next week, in order to vote on every proposal, you would have to vote on 1 million proposed changes. So instead what it does is a weighted randomizing. The proposals which have the least total votes are pooled, and then one is randomly selected (possibly also weighted by demographic data to ensure you don't have an unrepresentative crowd voting on a particular change).

You may not vote on another proposal until you vote on the one that was assigned to you.

This also makes it virtually impossible to lobby or game the system, even if you don't verify the identity of voters at all (say you don't even require a valid email). The reason is that the likelihood that sockpuppet accounts will randomly be assigned the proposal you're trying to stuff is directly related to the number of proposals submitted, so as the system becomes more used it becomes exponentially more costly for ~~an inversely exponential~~ a logarithmic (duh) benefit.

Lobbying other real people to vote for your proposal is *also* difficult, because *even if you had an audience entirely made of active users*, you would only be guaranteed that a very small percentage of that sample would actually see your proposal. However because *every* proposal is given this same dispersion, and it requires a supermajority to stop the iteration, both changes that disadvantage minority groups directly *and* changes which only benefit small groups will have a very difficult time being more approved of than broadly popular changes. 

The application of this process can be directed by who is able to propose original documents (although once proposed, the author has no special power over that document). For Constitutional/Charter processes, you'd want the document to be general, and the userbase to be free-handed in making changes.

For Legislation however, you might want to have appointed proposers to create the original documents, and some kind of oversight board to approve to scope of the final document. The beautiful thing is that this process gives the most *important* power directly to people, but it *does not require* a completely anarchist, communist or capitalist system. In fact, it can fit seamlessly in nearly any organizational structure.

**Representation**

You could also use this system to elect representatives, and I've outlined a slightly different process for this ""mode"" of the software.

1. Each user can over a two week period nominate up to five people (excluding themselves) who they believe fit the representative position well.
2. At the end of the two week period, the top 25% of nominees become candidates.
3. During the next two week period, you are allowed one vote for, one vote against and one non-vote for each candidate. You may freely search and inspect the candidates.
4. At the end of the period in step 3, the top 10% of candidates move on to the next round. At the end of every round, the vote counts reset, and everyone is allowed to vote again.
5. Repeat steps 3 &amp; 4 until the desired number of representatives remains.

A couple of things: even if you nominated every person in the world and were trying to elect an ""Earth President"" (that is, narrow it down to one person), the entire election process would still only require about 4 months. You could reduce this time further by: (a) reducing the time between voting rounds or (b) decreasing the percentage of candidates that move on in each round.

You could elect a larger group (for instance, a State's delegation to the House of Representatives in the United States) by simply taking the top X candidates in the appropriate round where X is the number of representatives you need for a given purpose.

By allowing people to freely search and browse candidates, this mechanism, unlike the legislation process, is specifically designed to enable lobbying and campaigning, although the short election period makes this less of a circus than in some current elections.

Additionally, because of how the nomination process works, it is much more difficult for small groups of people to control the electoral process through nominations.

Every voter can vote one for every candidate. Vote for or against or abstaining from ALL candidates in a single round is mathematically identical to not voting at all, so each voter has an interest in expressing their opinion honestly.

**Negotiation**

This process could be used in *any* situation where you have two distinct groups of people with some kind of member sovereignty that have different interests. That could be between employees and companies (collective bargaining without unions), governments or populations (you could have the ""users"" be either the population of a government, or the government representatives themselves), people and each other (for contract negotiations for instance), and many other situations.

Again, the mechanics are slightly different for this ""mode"" of software operation.

1. The document is proposed by side A. (Side A is the side which has controlling interest of the negotiations by definition, as they are the ones proposing it.)
2. The document is passed to side B.
3. During the first week, Side B has the opportunity for all valid users (which could be as large as the entire workforce of a company, or as small as a board of directors) to submit change proposals, just as in Step 2 of the Legislative process.
4. During the second week, Side B has the opportunity to vote on proposed changes, accepting one (although the number of accepted changes could be configurable) just as in Step 3 of the Legislative process.
5. The approved change(s) become(s) the new working document and are passed to Side A.
6. Side A repeats steps 3 &amp; 4, however they have the option to accept the returned document (which requires only a simple majority).
7. The process repeats, with each side passing the other document changes, until a document is accepted by both sides.

This ""mode"" could also have a stage where documents being passed are reviewed by lawyers/specialists to ensure correct language or phrasing.

---

These three modes of function alone would be very useful and helpful. I'm planning, once the non-profit is actually legally set up, to have the by-laws (mostly) run through this software, so that the non-profit itself is controlled by the people. The budget, likewise, will also be opened to the public to decide through this process, minus legally required expenses, and expenses incurred by the by-laws or charter, or previous budgets (in the absence of a specific repeal of a part of a previous budget).

I would also like to elect the board of the non-profit using the representation mode.

The negotiation mode could be insanely useful, as I pointed out, to employees and employers, and would avoid many of the pitfalls of unions related to organized crime, corruption and so on, as well as making it impossible for a company to strong-arm certain kinds of deals.

I don't think the ideas I have for this tool are perfect. But the obvious flaws I'm pretty sure I've decisively solved.

I've been hard at work the last few days improving and cleaning up the subreddit. I wanted to share some of what I have done to get some feedback and ideas to further improve /r/futurology going into the future.

As you probably noticed, I've added a link flair system to futurology. Automod will auto-flair most things, and the mods will try to do the rest. Hopefully this will help people find content that interests them, and lets them avoid things that don't. If you feel any link flairs are missing, feel free to share your ideas. I would also like some feedback on what people think of the link flair system itself.

I've set up a ton of rules for automod to remove or report certain submissions or comments. You have also probably noticed a more prominent report button, as well as a little reminder in the comments section. This has helped to remove a lot of the blog spam and hostility from the subreddit. I am trying to get to all the reports within a half day, so if you report something it shouldn't be too long before I, or another mod, reviews it.

To me, I don't see any obvious winner in the race for energy system of the future.

For example:

**Solar** We'd have to cover the entire surface of the Earth in solar panels at modern efficiency to get one tenth of our current energy demands met.

**Oil/gas/coal** Bad for the environment, pollutant, greenhouse gas emitters. Finite supply.

**Wind** expensive and fairly low return on investment.

**Tidal** only a few places where this can realistically be useful. 

**Nuclear** Promising, but a lot of energy loss in these systems. Plus they're fearfully dangerous if not regulated properly, and the waste issue is seemingly intractable. 

**Geothermal** I don't know much about this one, but it also seems unrealistically expensive and geographically restrictive.

**Fusion** Not really within our ability to control... at least not in the near future. We need energy solutions now and this doesn't look like one.

**Bio** We need to use our crops for food not fuel. Besides, what biofuel really does is convert sunlight into usable energy. We can do that at least as efficiently with solar panels.

Can anyone at /r/futurology argue for one or more of these as being our future in energy infrastructure... in the nearterm? Or, do you guys think we're all just doomed to continue squeezing out energy from a myriad of sources that are all far from ideal? How do we break free of our energy shortage problems?",25,3

You'd have to get the most greedy and corrupt money-handlers in the country to agree that everyone should get more than whatever basic assistance is being handed out now. Altruism is nice to hope for, but I think it's naive to believe that there will someday be a benevolent governing body to facilitate distribution of ""mincome"".

And I'm talking about a national scale here (for reference, I'm North American, so I'm most familiar with NA-style governance) - I could see this work on more of a commune-level, where everyone knows everyone else so all are held accountable, but anything bigger, and someone is going to try and 'get theirs', and let others get less.

Are we no longer energy-constrained when 'mincome' is implemented? Is there no need for anyone to work? Please, share a perspective where giving everyone money to do nothing would be readily implemented...

Are people ready for the education system to change? I don't say this to be a sensationalist: I've simply seen and heard of so many different things in the past months/years ([this website, most recently](http://alternativestoschool.com/)) that don't correspond with how we currently educate people--it's hard to think that education will stay the same in coming decades, and I want to try and understand how it will change.

&lt;h&gt;

School currently means students (anywhere from 10 to 800) in a classroom, a teacher, a complementary textbook, lessons, and a grade based on things such as memorization and performance. Teaching in this way can be attacked from every angle: ""our classrooms are overcrowded,"" ""the teacher can't work with every student,"" ""textbooks are too expensive,"" ""grades don't reflect learning,"" etc. [This Salon article](http://www.salon.com/2013/08/26/school_is_a_prison_and_damaging_our_kids/) claims that the system damages kids' innate curiosity and desire to learn. It also points out that students, successful and not, are less happy during school hours. When discussing home school, many people argue that one of the purposes of high school is to educate children on how to be, socially. I don't know if this has any scientific backing (in fact, [others](http://www.hslda.org/docs/nche/000000/00000068.asp) argue that it is just the opposite)


There are a few key changes I've noticed in emerging education:
In contrast to how an American public school works, we have the Khan Academy, Open Culture, TED Talks as supplements in lessons, torrenting textbooks/lectures/scrips, online classes and lessons, etc. In most of these, 1. there is a much larger gap between student and teacher, 2. money isn't a factor, 3. the user works at his or her own pace.

This is one technique that I believe could play a role in future education: I took a really successful Psychology course from a professor who taught most of the class in Socratic kind of way. Outside of the classroom, our almost daily was an online test, with any 20 questions out of a pool of 200. Almost every student, upon taking the quiz for the first time, failed. However, the quizzes could be retaken continually, up to the deadline a week later. And even then, any student (out of some 300) could go to the PSY office and do some make up quizzes. Not only did this get the majority of the class really good grades, but the rate at which these ideas were fired into our heads made it impossible not to learn a great deal.

r/Futurology, what else is there? As much as I hear people say that education needs a change, I rarely hear actual ideas on how to do so. How have you noticed education changing? How do you think it should change, and how will it?

Just one last quote from the Salon article before I end my rant: ""people of all ages learn best when they are self-motivated, pursuing questions that are their own real questions, and goals that are their own real-life goals. In such conditions, learning is usually joyful.""",7,7

What is popular these days?
Twilight, brony, Justin beiber, 4chan, Pewdiepie at the top of youtube,
Miley Cyrus, just to name a few things. I'm probably missing all the obvious ones. These are not minor things anymore.

It seems the older folks and the non west are not all that much better.
A serious percentage of the world population actually believe that humanity was populated from one extremely inbred family, and this doesn't seem to be going away, especially not in the Muslim world. 

But what about space stations, heart surgery, rockets, the internet, smartphones etc?

These come from the top 1% of human intelligence and skill, and this I hope this is stable, the 99% however may be in free-fall, and there is no telling where it might end up.

I think its simply the case of when you make something dumb normality, the next dumber thing seems like the normal next step, and isn't strange. This creates a downward spiral where everything is just relative to the previous part of the spiral.
Of course you can find counter examples...

We went from 8-Bit sprites to 3-D shooters in 20 years, and now we're finally starting to see the beginnings of crude VR tech. Within 50 years lifelike graphics and immersion will be a reality.

I know this might sound cliche, but I'd really like to live through a realistic apocalypse type scenario, such as a zombie invasion. The simulation could give you 1-2 weeks of settling into the new world doing boring regular things like shopping, going to work, and becoming acquainted with the characters of your family/friends etc. Once that has become your new reality, a zombie invasion strikes and you're forced to fend for yourself with your group. Humans turn on each other, grocery stores are looted, people look for safety, etc. This would just be amazing to live out in a simulation.

What are your thoughts on if this type of entertainment will ever materialize, and if you think the timeline of 50 years is possible. Also, what would be your ideas for an interesting VR simulation/game?

I started a website called Future Leap - [www.futureleap.com](http://www.futureleap.com) - a few months ago, and now I'm looking for some passionate futurists to partner with me in growing the site in various ways.

First, an intro to FutureLeap:

The core part of FutureLeap is the Project Database (even though the front page is news right nowthat may be modified soon):  http://www.futureleap.com/project/

Future Leap only covers Projects whose success would represent a true ""leap"" ahead of the status quo, as opposed to a mere hop.

The goal of the Project Database is to make it easy to keep track of all the amazing science/tech/futurism/transhumanism/etc-related projects we read about every day. To learn which projects are seeing success, which are struggling, and which have fizzled out.  Right now I have 50 project pages (I've been pretty distracted until now!), but I have many hundreds of projects bookmarked that I'd like to add, and I'm sure there are tons I'm unaware of.

I think this ease of tracking futuristic projects is needed for a few reasons:  First, it's all too common that we read about a groundbreaking study or achievement by a team of scientists somewhere that promises great things, but then never seem to hear about it again after the initial flurry of reports.

Second, there are a lot of people that love following the progress (or setbacks) of huge, well-known projects (a'la Google's driverless car, space missions such as New Horizons, Brain reverse-engineering efforts, etc).  Future Leap, if realized to its potential, would make it easy to constantly learn the latest about these projects and see the latest associated images, video, etc.

Ideally, once it's firing on all cylinders, Future Leap would also serve as a resource for scientists, investors and students to get a broad picture of most of the big projects that are underway.

Basically, I started Future Leap to help keep the future on track.  I want to see extreme life extension, abundant energy, and virtual reality as much as anyone, and I think the more people that are informed and excited about these projects, the more likely they'll see fruition.

-----------------------------

So, I'm looking for people to contribute who are:

-great writers, researchers and interviewers
-passionate about the future
-keep up to date with the news posted to /r/Futurology and related sites
-once we get things moving more, I might need help with outreach / networking, marketing, business, etc.

Also, if you happen to live in the Los Angeles area (so we could talk in person), please let me know!

Please email me at michaelstat@futureleap.com if you might want to help out with the site, have questions, suggestions, or just want to chat. 

Also, please ask any overall questions about the site (or give any suggestions) in this thread...and thanks to everyone in this sub for making this such a fascinating place!",3,10
