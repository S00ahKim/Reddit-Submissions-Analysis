[in-depth],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7ngaaw/what_are_some_implications_of_a_breach_on_a_fully/,YZET00,1514827730,"The likelihood of several countries reaching a fully autonomous transportation system in the near future is very high. This means each car would need to communicate with each other in order to ensure a coherent system. Although an infraction on such a system is very difficult, the possibility can't be left out of the picture, especially considering those who work closely with the development and maintenance. If one day the system is affected by such a breach, even if it only touched a small population with limited casualties, mass controversy on the future security and safety of the major transportation system would ensue. 

At this point in time, everyone would be required to have an autonomous car or use some form of a ride sharing service, or a fully self-controlled system would not be possible with human drivers. With this in mind, the cars would most likely not feature human input, such as a steering wheel. 

So, whether it is a breach or a system failure, no matter what level of testing or security there is always room for error by today's expectations. What it more concerning it how society will react the days following the incident. 

I would assume that the masses would refuse to use the autonomous system due to them realizing that the system is in fact not fully secure and could lead to more casualties in the future. Would society as a whole stop functioning due to this basic rejection to use the system? After all, there would be no common form of transportation around where individuals would have full control.

and the upper 0.1% becoming Homo Deus and conquering space,

is inevitable. it is historical destiny.

The cognitive elites don't have to give a shit to those under them. In fact they had been too generous over the last century, which led to the wastage of too much resources which could have facilitated Singularity earlier instead.

Technology makes things efficient, and benefits its owners but not the rest. Sure, the rest benefits a little bit, but not as much as the inventors.

During industrial revolution, the tech innovators were not paid too much since there were no copyrights and any fool with a blueprint could reproduce the tech very easily. 

But that is not the case. The owners of tech keep their secrets very well, and copycats don't stick since there is now an insurmountable moat between existing giants and the newcomers. Any new tech will be quickly bought by today's winners, and either be developed if profitable, or just shredded if not.

I think the gap between the richest and the poorest will grow to 1 billion: 1, and eventually 1 Trillion :1. large enough to call them gods for all practical purposes.

That is the first step towards Homo Deus, and a good preparation for post-singularity humanity in Civilization 2.0.",29,4,False,self,,,,,

127,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2018-1-3,2018,1,3,0,7nn09k,self.Futurology,What are AI researchers' thoughts on giving post-singularity AI's emotional intelligence?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7nn09k/what_are_ai_researchers_thoughts_on_giving/,goreblood001,1514906361,"Tl dr: Shouldnt it be possible to create super-emotionally-intelligent AI's that understand morality better than anything we can think of, analogous to how 'traditional' post-singularity AI's have an IQ higher than anything we can think of? Basically, can we create a super moral/spiritual leader as an AI, a ultra-gandhi computer?

Something I've seen many people discussing the potential and dangers of future AI say, is that there is no reason to believe intelligence is something only biological brains can possess. Their reasoning basically comes down to this: we know that there are *some* configurations of atoms (namely human brains) that produce atoms, and we have no reason that these configurations are in any way special, so it stands to reason that *other* configurations (namely computers) could eventually also possess intelligence. Since we also know that AI's could continuously self-improve, it seems likely that such an AI would exponentially increase it's own IQ, quickly surpassing us by orders of magnitude we can't even comprehend.

A point I haven't seen discussed as much, is the exact same point, but just switch the terms intelligence/IQ with emotional intelligence/EQ/empathy. We know that *certain* configurations of atoms produce empathy, and theres nothing special about us, so it stands to reason that it should be possible to design AI's with empathy. Further more, if we could design an AI that's sole function is to increase it's emotional intelligence as much as possible, we could create a sort of god-tier level gandhi-computer.

If we then integrated what this AI had taught itself into a more standard post-singularity AI (with an insane IQ), I could invision a computer that is genuinely capable of killing everyone and everything, but has so much empathy for everyone's suffering that it simply chooses not to.

A possible objection to this would that this AI might try to artificially make everyone happy by creating a dystopic 'pleasure-box' where everyone is in an eternal orgasmic existance but serves no other purpose. Or, that it would take the side of all the other organisms on the planet, and turn on us so that the animals could be 'happy'. 

My response to that would be that this AI would be so emotionally intelligent, that it would realise that neither scenario would be desirable outcomes. Humans want to feel in control, and this AI would know that, and would feel so much empathy towards us that it would never even think of taking that away from us.

And even if I'm wrong about this, we could test this. Because of the way we program this super-emotionally-intelligent AI, it would be an AI with immense empathy but relatively puny IQ, and thus would be easily outmanoeuvred and out-thought. If it turned out we didn't like what this AI wanted to do, we could just destroy it and start from scratch, or change tactics.

The reason I'm wondering about this, is that in a best case scenario I can imagine such an AI being something similar to a genuine messiah like figure, or at least a major spiritual leader. Someone with immense power, but the restraint not to use it. Someone who genuinely knows the best way to live with one and other, and also knows the best way to persuade everyone that they are right without forcing them to. Someone how to let those that stubbornly disagree with them live happily without trying to change their mind.

So basically my question is this: how feasible is it to create a all powerful super-prophet AI that has a better understanding of morality than anything we can ever dream of, instead of trying to create an all-powerful super-scientist AI that is smarter than anything we can ever dream of?

Has there been an attempt to feed a deep-learning neural network academic material? Can this not be accomplished in the same way a young child starts to learn maths, first by training it to solve basic equations, then showing it examples of more complex equations?

Humans die and their knowledge dies with them. The first person to successfully begin training such a system would essentially have created the first immortal ""brain"", capable of learning for hundreds or even thousands of years, surely exceeding the intelligence of any living human.

In major towns like Belfast, Derry, Dublin or Queenstown (which the Irish renamed Cobh after 1922), there were Industrial Civilization, with educated people and machinery and all that.

In places like western and southern Ireland, central authority was weak and people , largely subsisting with potatoes, potatoes and more potatoes, spoke Irish, could not read or write and only capable of manual labor, abounded and multiplied.

The pop of Ireland was 8 million when the pop of England, Scotland and Wales combined was about 18 mil. 

And the famine hit. I wrote about this on here.

https://kulmthestatusquo.wordpress.com/2017/08/31/the-1846-irish-famine-helped-civilization/

Problem solved.

===

The extreme bifurcation will divide the world to the 'connected', those who get quality life, have decent jobs, etc, and the rest. 

Right now, the 'connected' live in a cocoon. They might see the 'rest' but don't really think too much about it.

However, some thinking people, like those who study HBD, have realized that it is not possible to lift the ""rest"" up, and it might be cheaper, more efficient and less damaging to the earth to let nature and evolution take its course.

I wrote about a massive penury, a police state which will make the Matrix world look like a paradise, and a bleak future for the 'rest' quite a few times.

That is unavoidable, as wealth gets more concentrated among the top because of financialization and unbelievable efficiency of everything which leaves no slack to the unqualified, who are reduced to very cheap manual labor, gig jobs like uber drivers (which are  already a dying breed thanks to the arrival of driverless cars), and other menial jobs where they will be stuck. And that's for the luckier ones. Others will have no jobs at all.

What should be done about them? Continue to feed them? For what purpose when they won't be useful to society? 

Richer people will be more and more above the law. For now there are social programs because the elites still have some use from the masses and are still a bit afraid of them, but as technological advances can make them completely immune from attacks while the 'rest' do not have anything to offer to the top, 

something will give.

The Ancient greeks, like Socrates, Plato and company, had no concern to waste about the helots. They could care less if the helots all disappeared - Civilization was not driven by them, but by hi-IQ people like Socrates and the Gang. Sorry.

reality is reality, and cold truth is cold truth. There will not be an active genocide like what happened during the 1940s-  it won't be needed. Without firing a shot, Charles Trevelyan (who became the 1st baronet of Trevelyan because of his contribution to Civilization) solved the problem with no blood shed from the 'connected' at that time.

I think that only about 200-300 million elites, and maybe about the same number of 'servant class', will survive into the New Stage of Civilization, fulfilling the prediction of Georgia Guidestones (although the people who erected them didn't know HBD and added Swahili to the mix of languages. I don't think Swahili and some other languages in that mix will be spoken after the Transition- in fact it is likely that only English will be spoken, and a few other languages kept alive for religious purposes only).

It is not tragic. It is not horrible. It is no different than cicada getting rid of her larva skins, or phoenix diving into a fire and being reborn. It is just a necessary step before the world gets ready for a New Stage of Civilization.",49,0,False,self,,,,,

So we could create a system whereby the network assesses the communities needs and creates jobs that need to be carried out. As this is new wealth been created just like a bank prints money then these jobs don;t need to be profitable in a corporate sense.

As a society we have reached a tipping point where we can have autonomous vehicles of all distinctions, but should we?  
Jobs will be lost. For every programming, retrofitting, and service job created a professional driver will be eliminated from the work force.  This will happen.  I am warning all of those who hold drive for a living you are going to lose your jobs.  The financial incentives are just too powerful for these businesses to pass up once they have proven themselves.  Im telling you this now in the hopes that you will take this time to transition into another job.  Jobs on the chopping block include CDL truckers, taxis, both gypsy and professional, pizza delivery drivers, and a number of related fields. 

Add to that collision centers, parking structures, municipalities due to a sharp  you might say cliff like reduction in moving violations, and even car thieves.  So with all of this doom and gloom why does the industry seem hell bent on giving us this kind of a burden?  It is simple, autonomous vehicles (AVs) will revolutionize our world.  Everyone imagines riding to work in comfort while watching the end of your favorite show, or napping in the passenger seat while your miracle whisks you toward your destination. Let me give you a few you may not have thought of that can be as well received. 

Parking  You live in a large city where parking spaces are such a hassle to find that you end up leaving forty-five minutes or more earlier just to get where you need to be on time.  Wont it be amazing when you can pick up your phone and say go find a spot to park and Ill call you back when I need you.  Your car then travels five blocks away and finds a nice spot, and then sits there waiting for you.  It found this spot because one of its fellow cars just broadcast the fact that it was leaving and the location of where it was to the closest vehicle.  Your meeting is wrapping up so you call your car back, it reaches out to the internet and other cars, then utilizes its own telemetry to calculate how long it will take to return and then sends you that message.  You step out the door and your car is waiting for you, cool in summer, or warm in winter.  

Ride sharing  You are at work for eight hours a day, wouldnt it be nice if your car could as well? Imagine pulling into work and sending your car on its way in ride share mode.  An organizing entity keys in on your car and dispatches pick up points.  The car does its job and funds are deposited into your account.  I personally wouldnt want some sweaty man with an aversion to deodorant sitting in my car, but you may want the money more than I do. 

Greatly reduced insurance  Autonomous vehicles should lower fatalities by 90%, but what about non-fatal accidents? What about theft and vandalism? What about hit and run accidents? Autonomous vehicles will have complicated sensor arrays around the vehicle.  In a short amount of time these will include full UHD cameras on all four corners of the vehicle.  They will be recording 24/7 and then recording over that data after a certain amount of time.  When some kid comes at the car with slim jim, the car can send the relevant frames to the proper authorities the instant it recognizes an intrusion.  Ill go one better, due to the wide variety of sensors around the car you will be able to get a height and approximate weight for the perpetrator.  With the inter-vehicle communications ability, youll be able to tag and capture several images of any sort of incident instantly.  All of this means fewer payouts for insurance companies, which leads to remarkably lower premiums.  This is already the case for anti-theft systems, airbags, and other safety systems in newer vehicles.  

Ive talked a lot about this inter-vehicular communications system but what am I talking about? Im talking about a military level encrypted wireless signal that creates an adhoc network between groups of cars and back to the internet.  Beyond wifi, but on the same general idea.  Fully autonomous vehicles join the interstate among the dumb cars.  The AVs recognize these vehicles as vehicles by using LIDAR, SONAR, and/or visual processing but when they send out a WHOIS signal and receive nothing back they treat that vehicle as an unknown.  AVs give those cars a wide berth because they have no idea what the person inside is going to do.  AVs on the other hand will be able to sync up and share information. On the highway they could be given free range based on road conditions, traffic, and hundreds of other permissive logic gates that if met will allow the vehicles to train.   Imagine five different cars sharing information to maintain a one foot gap between each vehicle.  The middle car knows where the front car is going, it knows how fast it is going, and it knows what is in front of it as well.  Highway speeds could safely be doubled under optimal conditions.  If a dumb car would happen to try and join the train, the train would break apart to safe dumb car highway distances, and speeds.
  
Training would divide the air resistance between multiple cars or trucks essentially hypermiling any time they are on the highway.  Imagine fully loaded semi-trucks traveling down a deserted stretch of interstate at two oclock in the morning one foot from each other five deep at seventy or eighty miles per hour without a soul on board.  No rest periods, no log books, just a completely predictable schedule that can be monitored anywhere in the world. 

Another interesting feature could be priority.  While you drive you are constantly forced to make judgement calls.  When to let people go, when to speed up, and by how much, when to slow down.  These judgements will be something autonomous vehicles have to make as well.  What if you could tell your car you want priority because youre late, the car cant speed because thats against the law but it can firm up its shift points, safely pull away from the stop line a bit quicker if there is open road, etc.  What if it could go one further, you tell your car you want priority, and in turn your car tells others around it that it has a priority request.  Any other vehicles on that route could give all judgement calls to your car shaving some time safely off your morning commute.  I know what youre thinking, Ill just get in and say I want priority every day.  Well no, that obviously wont work, but a banked system would.  On a day youre not in a rush you put the car in passive mode, or comfort where the car might take a less congested route to your destination, and give priorities more weight in judgement situations.  The when your bank is empty you are forced to use normal mode. 

Lets talk about other benefits of this CarFI.  Each car being linked together and sharing information based on expected routes will come with additional perks.  Many AVs will also likely be EVs with some kind of regenerative braking system, so a car stopped at a light will broadcast its telemetry including stopped time.  The vehicles will be able to slow down using only regenerative braking, or just not accelerate into the stopped vehicles. 

By slowing down where appropriate it will be able to time the lights and not have to come to a complete stop.  This will be good for wear items like brake pads, not to mention a smoother ride, and it will be good for both fossil fuel cars as well as EVs.  It takes more energy regardless of how it is stored to return an object to motion vs. remaining in motion.  Another benefit will be hyper accurate traffic.  With all AVs knowing where the slowdowns are occurring they can take an alternate route with less traffic.  They will also be able to offer up their databases to the NTSB in order to optimize traffic flow patterns and make everything smoother for AVs and non-AVs alike.  Mountains of data generated by these vehicles everyday will help city planners with construction projects, it will help keep mapping software accurate, and that will make the entire road system more efficient. 

One of the first questions I get from opponents of this technology is, What about when the hackers come and wreck a bunch of cars?  Well first, military level encryption.  We dont seem to worry about the drones too often, and that is the type of system Im talking about.  Secondly, the cars and trucks will have multiple banks of sensors, if the CarFI becomes corrupted or gives data that conflicts with the other banks of sensors the car will be able to ignore that information, all be it at a reduced speed and increased margin of error where it comes to distance.  If the vehicles become incapacitated for any length of time they could be told to pull over, or insist on self-drive from the licensed occupant if one is available.  All the while broadcasting a warning signal back to a central location, if there are several signals in the same location the authorities will be contacted and sent the relevant data. 

 Another feature would be: should anything happen using the CarFi network groups of vehicles could be patched as exploits are found. The only downside is this network would need to be entirely secure without penetration, so Jail breaking your car would have to be impossible.  With that being the case though, the software should immediately be standardized, all AVs talk to all other AVs, utilize the same sensor data, and speak the same language to one another.  The system should be open to all vehicle manufacturers so that there is complete standardization across all platforms.  Completely available for network security specialists and open to penetration testing with generous rewards.  If AVs are to usher in the next hundred years of travel they need to be safe and secure. 

One more aspect of the AV platform is the vehicle should have access to all of the body sensors.  With a computer onboard the vehicle will be able to track how long it took the car to stop from when it applied the brakes and within a reasonable margin for error it will be able to alert you when it needs service, but better than that it will be able to take itself in. Instant MPG calculations or MPC, and with little effort the vehicle should be able to make some determinations about its own condition.   It will be able to monitor tire pressure sensors and vibration sensors to know when and where the trouble is coming from, and it will be able to alert you.   If the vehicle passes an unsafe to operate threshold it will give you the option of insisting on service or parking until it can be serviced.  As in any relationship, communication is the key. 

I mentioned retrofitting dumb cars earlier, so Ill dive a bit deeper into that.  Many vehicles have the main components to be an AV already installed.  Electric steering; many vehicles in the past few years have ditched the steering box, or rack and pinion steering system for an electric motor.  If you can send an electric signal from the steering column to the front wheels and turn them, you can do that using a computer.  The next component, ABS brakes.  ABS or antilock braking system utilizes a pump to create pressure and alternated it between wheels.  With very little effort that system could provide even braking to stop an AV.  Third is fly by wire throttle.  Like the other two systems FBW utilizes an electric signal to operate a servo that opens the butterfly on the intake and signals the computer to fire longer pulses on each injector.  Weve had cruise control on cars for decades and intelligent cruise control for years.  When you tie these three systems together with a large CPU and feed information from sensor pods mounted around the car you can see how dumb cars can become AVs.  An entire aftermarket will spring up to accommodate this new market.  As for older vehicles and large trucks, servos, motors, and pumps will be able to take over the important systems. 

Finally, as all things change so must we age.  One of the worst things about growing old is losing your independence.  As we age our reaction time slows, our vision weakens, and we slowly become a danger to ourselves and others.  AVs will give us our freedom and let us hold on to our dignity far into the future.  Your car could take you to the doctor, or pick you up from surgery, it could even pick up your prescriptions while you finish with the doctor, with only a few tweaks to drive through pharmacies.  In an emergency it could even take you to the hospital and signal ahead for help.  

One major concern I have is this, the vehicle will have to make a choice at some point of who lives and who dies.  In an event where a number of things has gone horribly wrong, the vehicle has made all of the calculations and it must choose between hitting a building and probably killing the occupant, or hitting kids walking across the street. The car will be able to do the math faster than I can type this but in that event which path does it choose? I dont have that answer and I hope someone far more intelligent than I will put some serious thought into it.  

In summation, yes, people who drive for a living will need to find new work, they will need to be retrained.  There are too many upsides to AVs but you have some time to begin the retraining process.  I suggest HVAC technician, they pay well and are always in demand. Now for the leaders of this new technology I urge you to keep this vision, standardization will be the only way forward, differentiate yourselves based on amenities.  We are all counting on what you do next.

Its naive to say that were doing completely great or absolutely horrible as a species right now, because it seems to be a constant battle between good and evil (though even saying that seems wrong, because nothing is ever truly just good or just evil, so I think the yin and yang structure is applicable here). For every uplifting story we hear of a child who overcame the odds to become a success or an animal rescued and rehabilitated, theres always the flip side: somewhere else, a child died alone and forgotten, or that animal didnt get help. Of course, on the other hand, for every the world is doomed story or species extinction, we hear that scientists made a massive breakthrough towards saving our planet or that we saved another species from extinction.

So wheres the truth in it all? Are we really in some golden age, headed towards a prosperous future? Or are we too late to save our planet and our species from an extinction caused by ourselves?

Its hard to say that theres one universal law, because everyone works differently, and Im sure theres some who would disagree with me here. But Id have to say if there was one, it would be that balance is key. Balance, the perfect middle ground, seems to be the best solution for every problem. Bringing back the good and evil debate, balance is the best scenario in that case. While Im sure everyone thinks it would be great to have a perfect world with no death, crimes, hate, or violence, only good, it wouldnt. You cant have good without bad. Good is the opposite of bad, and vice versa. So realistically, balance is the key to solving our problems. 

Yet despite that knowledge, it always feels like theres no hope heading forward. We hear equal parts good news and bad news about our future, and I want to believe humanity is balanced, but it feels like were heading more towards an imbalance, with more and more bad every day. It feels like no matter what people try to do to save humanity and Earth, we cant balance out the bad. Its impossible to ever truly unite on one issue.

So what should we expect and do going forward? Can we really strike that perfect balance, or is it all hopeless? What do we do from now on going forward?

People in Gail Tverberg's blog are still stuck in the 1970s where smokestack industries still existed.

But, the cold truth now is that we don't really need all the infrastructure and mass manufacturing anymore.

Big companies like GOOG, AMZN, etc own no manufacturing facilities. They don't need these expensive facilities.

As most people will be very poor and only the top 0.5%-1% would have any kind of money to spend, everything will turn for-demand. Richer people in the hinterlands will move to the major cities, like a lot of absentee landlords in the past, and the dirty work will be done by local middlemen.

End of mass production means a lot of resources now being spent can be saved.

3-D Printing and all that are not well suited for economies catering to the masses, but they are very great for economies catering for the top 1% or so of the world (less than 100m).

As today's worthy are gathered into futuristic cities like this

http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/24/news/economy/saudi-arabia-mega-city-neom/index.html

all the food and industrial products will be produced in areas associated with the city, and no more mass production which creates so much waste.

Economy won't be hurt. Since the masses have no money, property and purchasing power to speak about, they will be cast out. Sorry.",10,2,False,self,,,,,

You do have cavities, don't you? And to prevent future cavities, you have to brush teeth and floss, which are annoying to say the least, a few times every day for the rest of your life. And once they are damaged, there is no way to restore them. You would have to use fillings or crowns that are imperfect and deteriorate over time. Not to mention, that the treatment is expensive and painful.

All these miseries could be forgotten, if we could just regrow/restore teeth, which some other animals can. Our body could do it too, but it is just that we do not know how to tell the cells to regrow the teeth, right? We did regrow teeth once, why not twice? Most of my tooth decays originated from my childhood when I did not know much about teeth. If only we had another chance.... (second ""permanent"" teeth at age 30 or something), I would even visit dentists every month, to prevent cavities.

I read a news that said scientists might be able to do that, several years ago, but I have not heard about it again. A quick Google search gave me [another such news as late as one year ago](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/01/09/end-fillings-sight-scientists-find-alzheimers-drug-makes-teeth/). But I am afraid I would ever hear about it coming to reality, because I have been deceived so many times so far.

Are scientists actually working hard on this subject? Will we ever benefit from the new technology before we die?",46,48,False,self,,,,,

https://aeon.co/ideas/if-work-dominated-your-every-moment-would-life-be-worth-living

The article was notable for what it did not mention, which is that all of this material is discussed and debated constantly in history. It's these historical debates that I'm mindful of right now. 

As a future society, it's almost certain that these lessons of history will be preserved in a database. But will they be integrated into the culture so that they can inform us? 

I would imagine a post singularity trans-human organism (hive mind, corporate organization, or other) having access to these discussions, would delegate analysis to whatever AI becomes. 

The question being, Is this adequate? I think we're already seeing the myopia of current culture thickening, almost drowning in the deluge of new information facing us every minute. 

This is another of those present day dangers, not in that the sky is falling, but in that we are more and more prone to repeat past cultural errors. 

The current mania for cryptocurrency is a case in point, with the iconic example of market madness being the tulip bubble in 17th century Holland. 

Is it just a coincidence that the tulip bubble incident is now considered semi-myth? Discounting of the past is nothing new, there are far too many historical mistakes that we can't possibly avoid repeating them all. 

Yet this is exactly what we would call wisdom, a perception and weighing of current events as they relate to history. Can this be incorporated into machine analysis?

With automation becoming more and more widespread, going to college for many professions will no longer be economically viable due to the cost of the education and also the amount of jobs available.  An example is one day lawyers might be automated and run by AI.  Many will choose other professions rather than study law for many years and pay huge tuition bills.

In addition, if a basic income comes into play due to automation, this could be a one-two punch to education since many people might choose not to go to college or university at all (since they chose to go to school mainly to make them more marketable in the work force).

And yes, education (at the university level) might be free one day (maybe it is free today to some extent), but most people only choose to make a committment to school if it gives them a good return on investment.  While I do think people are inherently good and strive to be the best, I don't think most people will pursue an education after the basics (age 18) if it doesn't provide them with a  monetary reward or status. 

I just wanted to start a discussion and hear other people's viewpoints and ideas on this subject.  Thanks

The message to counter this movement was basically to make your voice heard which I imagine most people would take to mean shout, stomp your feet and let everyone know how you feel.  Basically protest. However i was thinking, that protesting has become almost socially normal to the point where the marches are planned and police even provide escorts etc.  This really doesnt make people take notice, protesting of the past often ended in violence and conflict, which unfortunately people do take notice of.   So how can we illicit change without violence and blood shed which i hope we can all agree is unwanted? 

Money.  Basically if you disagree with what a corporation is doing such as the recent com cast stuff etc, then the best approach is to use social media to institute massive bill payment strikes.  If money is the new voting system then a strike on your bill payment (organised on mass) will surely illicit change to their policy.  

I feel like this is a fantastic way to actually take our voice back as a people against large corporations who look after their own interests in a progressively more business oriented world.   

If social media can be used to do this then it may also work as an educational tool to tell people about the sorts of things their money goes to and how they can essentially boycott undesirable corporations.  ",15,9,False,self,,,,,

Entropy means that reality constantly adds complexity/detail (taking larger, simpler things apart and making more complex stuff with the different pieces) which means that there are always MORE things. Just that those things are smaller and more detailed. (This is also evolution!)

So, reality is like zooming in on a fractal (like the [Mandelbrot set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jGaio87u3A)). We may never see (large, simple) suns again, but we will continue to see new, tinier, more weird forms of concentrated energy (like batteries! and... mitochondria!), as well as forms of life that are microscopic AND more complex than even humans. 

Eventually, whole planets could be the size of an atom at some point, essentially. This meets the laws of conservation of matter/energy, while also meeting the laws of entropy. More stuff, and seemingly more ""space"" between the stuff, but it's really just adding smaller basic building blocks of matter and energy. Which seems insane if you think that atoms are literally indivisible, as the word originally meant, but we know now that they are not. We know that *now* atoms have smaller building blocks. And those building blocks have even smaller building blocks. So the universe can just keep breaking apart those seemingly unbreakable things to add complexity, infinitely. No heat death. No end to life. Just ever smaller and more complex life. Infinitely.  Just like we can calculate pi forever, in ever increasing detail.

Perhaps reality is nothing more (and nothing less) than some grand function generating new fractal patterns and (our collective) consciousness is simply the function being generated at that point in time.

Maybe this isn't how it actually works.  But it's interesting to consider. And would explain a lot.",24,1,False,self,,,,,

Nevertheless, most people I talk to seem to believe that the rise of automation will lead to human labor being worth essentially nothing. I'd like to take a look at the other side of this. Now I'm thinking mostly tangible goods, not services here.
If you go to the store, and buy a set of plates let's say. All those plates will be (hopefully) near-perfect and identical. Probably made by a machine.. But if someone *makes* you a similar set of plates, those plates will be alike, but each one will be unique. Each hand-made plate would be imperfect. Still, most people (at least I would) prefer the imperfect, hand-made plate.
Do you think the rise of automation will cause a rise is the cost-difference between comparable hand-made and mass-produced goods?",10,2,False,self,,,,,

Disclaimer 2: This discussion is very long.  

---

In ""Homo Deus"" (HD) Historian Yuval Harari takes an anthropological approach to predicting the future, and educates the reader about a number of topics that are very illuminating - especially to someone who is more versed in STEM topics and traditional narrative history rather than overarching *theories* about human events.

One of the most interesting concepts he introduces (which I'm sure is commonplace in academia, but I had never heard of) is the ""intersubjective"" myth - a kind of self-fulfilling fiction that humans tell each other, originally for reasons that may be mundane or even crooked, but which become socially true by shaping the actions of people.

He shows, quite convincingly, that almost every entity that exists in modern society - corporations, nations, ethnic groups, religions, etc. - is an intersubjective myth.  That all these things that guide, dominate, victimize, liberate, and terrorize the lives of real human beings...are just stories that individuals tell each other to make sense of a vastly complex world.

We are shown that new dominant intersubjectives arise historically in response to technological changes in the state of humankind.  For instance, with the advent of agriculture and its centralizing influences on power (and elevation of the human above other animals), traditional hunter-gatherer religions that saw humanity as just one of many types of being gave way to monarchial pantheons, and then to monotheist religions that excluded everything but God and Man

HD follows this logic through additional revolutions as, for instance, industrialization marginalizes the theistic religions and increasingly emphasizes the human being in various facets.  And this is where it gets interesting, because as with any good futurist vision, HD *starts* with the past and leads into the present, but does not stop there.  

Indeed, Harari articulates the idea that the IT revolution will at best marginalize and possibly destroy humanism, **exposing even the individual human as an intersubjective myth** arising out of biology.  And as a matter of scientific fact, this is not even debatable - the human being *is* an emergent property of blind physical movements on the chemical level.  

But society thus far has been willing to tolerate the idea of the human being by consensus because the alternative thus far (totalitiarianism) had been attempted and proven destructive.  I will offer my own reflection that it's miraculous that humankind survived those experiments: Adolf Hitler was *maybe* two years away from an atom bomb when his regime fell, and there were several occasions where the refusal of Soviet military officers to follow protocol was the only reason the world did not end during the Cold War.

We may not survive subsequent experiments that compromise or do away with the human being as the dominant intersubjective value, but HD is very convincing that such moves are inevitable and indeed occurring as we speak.  The human mind is being mathematically unraveled into its constituent streams by advanced algorithms, and each layer individually hacked for the purposes of whoever has built and is running those algorithms - social media companies, advertisers, and authoritarian political states.

Harari asks the question, ""Is that really a bad thing?""  After all, some of the algorithms will be guided toward helping human beings, even as their very operational essence denies our intersubjective value.  Then he answers his own question, ""Yeah, probably it's a bad thing.""  The algorithms that advance the fastest will be the ones that serve themselves, not us, just like in biological evolution.

Which is not to predict a Terminator future - quite the opposite.  Terminators are how a humanist mind interprets the nightmare of a post-human future - machines built like human skeletons, embodying death, and bent on our destruction.  But in all likelihood humans would not be eliminated - at least not deliberately.  Why would we be?  Do *we* make an effort to scour the seabeds of all the microscopic scum that still resembles what we evolved from?

Of course not.  We just end up poisoning the oceans as a secondary consequence of serving ourselves, and the default result is that an ever-increasing proportion of non-human life goes extinct as a default result.  It may come to pass (my thought, not Harari's) that all wild, non-human life will go extinct, and the entirety of the ecosystem will consist of us, our machines, and our pets / lab specimens - and that's even if human beings remained the dominant force on Earth.

So it's not much of a stretch to go one step beyond and put humans in the column of pets, lab specimens, or the vast and growing category of extinction.  After all (and this is Harari's ultimate thesis), if the new ideology is that life is data processing and humans are inferior at it, any optimizing algorithm would ultimately exclude us.

**But**...there is an issue at the root of Harari's thesis, and ultimately all Singularity-based futures.  Whether or not everything is data processing, something has to determine *what* data is processed and *what* information is sought from the process.  

This is the old Hitchhiker's Guide epiphany about Ultimate Answers being irrelevant without knowing the Ultimate Question that spawned them.  An algorithm that is designed to optimize the profits of a given company, may blindly do so to the point of destructive consequences for the world - indeed, it may end up back-hacking the psychology of its own corporate decision-makers to let it fulfill its core programming if they end up interfering due to ethics, politics, or other considerations.

So it is very likely that the data revolution may spawn nightmares that threaten humankind in the same way that totalitarianism did, and they may ultimately be what does us in.  *But* if they did so, it would be because they are blind processes lacking in context, not because they are superior as Ultimate Data Processors.

---

**Conclusions**:

Indeed, to answer the questions of what should be processed and what information is desired from the process requires minds - it requires *axioms* or instincts.  We can give such things to algorithms, but they will just be copies of ours, so if they and we both survive the infancy of AI supremacy, we would simply have built...more abstract humans.

The alternative would, intuitively, seem like an algorithm that is rooted simply in trying to act out physics more efficiently, but what's the point of that?  Its endpoint would regard the best outcome as uninterrupted photons flowing through space forever without having to go through all the trouble of being processed by matter - so just eliminate life, eliminate planets, and turn everything into a homogeneous quantum soup without meaning.

Maybe some monstrous, virus-like algorithm like that would threaten the Beings of the universe some day (see Vernor Vinge's [A Fire Upon The Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep)), but there's no reason to think it would have any adaptive superiority to algorithms with different instincts.  Indeed, those which seek to increase the complexity and information-richness of their environment would appear stronger than those embodying entropy.

So while there are a lot of near- and medium-future threats from ""Dataism"" (as Harari calls it) - everything from mass-unemployability to the increasing impossibility of holding anyone (or anything) in power accountable due to the complexity of systems - it does not seem to me that what arrives out the other side would be some unknowable soup of quantum calculators simply driving at maximum physical haste toward the Heat Death of the universe.

Rather, it seems quite likely that it would be kaleidoscopic in nature, conserving (as nature itself does) everything that was *ever* generally adaptive.  Just as within ourselves we retain the basic blueprints of amphibians in our fetal development, and within our brains the basic blueprints of the reptile and primitive mammal, is it not likely that the human blueprint - everything about us that was ever beautiful and noble - would abide and continue to shape even superhuman beings we don't understand?

Even down to our very cells are mitochondria that were once ""free"" bacteria, having been engulfed in symbiosis with other types of microbes, we encompass within us that which we evolved from, and echo the ancient even as we elaborate into new patterns.  Provided we or anything survive at all, rather than some Cosmic Filter placing an absolute ceiling on existence, this is what I think would be the shape of things.

The universe we inherit is already a strange place we comprehend so little as to be constantly surprised by it, so would one comprised of our own technological derivatives be any more or any less wondrous?  Any more or any less confusing?  Any more or any less dangerous *and* nurturing, under varying circumstances?

The IT revolution will create new types of beings, and blindly intelligent but unconscious servants thereof, but it will also just create...humans.  Again, and again, and again.  Humans like us,  humans dumber than us, humans smarter than us.  Humans bigger than us, humans smaller than us.  Humans that live forever.  Humans that live for a millisecond.  

Humans that, in addition to being psychologically human, also happen to be planets or stars.  Why?  

*Why not?*

And these humans will inhabit a universe of beings diverse beyond comprehension...

*If we don't already*.

The socialists seem to think we dont need the rich but they fail to realise the reason we have most our technological products are due to the high risk high reward system we have. The capitialists seem to think that the system will look after itself and it will come to a natural medium. But this is not what happens. The people at the top pull up the ladder behind then to stop other from gaining in order to become super wealthy. 

In order to stop this more regulation should be introduced to stop this happening. It would only take a small bit of legislation to improve the economies. One example i thought of is if all companies have to meet certain percentages of payments made to employees. ie. the bottom 90% of employees must be paid at least 50% of the total remuneration paid (ie wages, shares, bonuses, etc) to employees. So this would allow the lower wage employees share in the success/failure in a company. The employee would be paid his/her normal wage and would recieve a bonus at year end. This might mean a bonus of 5k at the end of the year and would allow each employee feel like they made an impact to the company (which they would have). This just stops huge bonus payments paid to the top few people. The top people still get substantially rewarded due to the work that they have done but are not overly compensated and all employees are rewarded.

This would cause a huge multiplier affect in the economy and each person would feel more loyality to their company. This is just an example so I have not included all benefits or drawback this may have but I think it would have a huge effect. This would increase growth in the economy by 5% in its first year as money is now circulating around each local economy and not just the banks or financial institutions.

I know this is not going to solve every problem but it will definately help. I know this system would need to be introduced in a nearly all countries for it to take full effect but we need to try something else. I know they may be problems with this method and I would like to recieve feedback and see what other regulation could be introduced to help the 90% not just the top 10%.",51,14,False,self,,,,,

&amp;nbsp;

There's a lot of upcoming technology that makes me feel like we might already have the pieces to pursue a (kind of) post-scarcity world and that we need to figure out how to put them together. One/some of these technologies are trying to implement digital currency that can be freely, securely and instantly sent to anyone, anywhere. 

&amp;nbsp;

Rather than trying to explain the many different ways that people are chasing this goal right now, I wanted to get more conceptual about how this technology could be used to dramatic effect. While I know there's no single application that would propel us into post-scarcity, I also know that there has to be a logical means of handling finances that's fundamentally better than what we do now.

&amp;nbsp;

[This is what I came up with (long Google Doc, full text in comments).](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdFTEpxpNvwuvIeACm-PQZE8JbFLO0l4FbSxaUMuEBc/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;nbsp;

Keep in mind that I'm a programmer, not an economist or writer. Also, I'm not expecting it to be perfect right away. There could be some basic reason that this would fail and I'm hoping you'll find it where I can't. If you have a potential solution for a problem that you or someone else found, even better. Otherwise I'll try to come up with one myself. All input is valuable!

&amp;nbsp;

The point is to iterate on the idea until it's conceptually sound. If something this universally beneficial becomes conceptually sound, then it will attract the resources it needs to become a reality. It'll become a goal for everyone.

&amp;nbsp;

So ask questions, suggest edits, comment, poke holes in the system and let's see if we can figure this out.",10,5,False,self,,,,,

the reason for this large difference in estimates is because people base their estimates on past trends and speeds in technological evolution. so for example for self driving cars to take over most transportation within 7 years seems insane, because technology has never had such a big impact on our society at such a speed. be it technologically, socially or legally, this has never happened before

and that's the whole point, what's coming is something that has simply never been seen in history before. that's because technology is about to evolve at speeds that overtake what you'd see in the average sci-fi movie or book

and we will adapt to it, be it socially, economically, culturally or legally, at a speed never seen before in history. if only because technology will help us make that transition, hell it's likely SDCs will not even be the most disruptive technology by 2025

so I will argue that when trying to predict what the year 2025 will look like, try to imagine what 2037 will look like, you'll get a better estimate

and if you want to know what 2050 look like, try imagining the year 2150",51,2,False,self,,,,,

With automation eliminating most 'good' jobs and the only remaining jobs would not pay for 'first world' living, people under a certain level of intelligence and/or wealth will be living in a penury which will not be envied by the characters of the opera La Boheme.

2. So therefore any talk like basic income, more entitlement, etc are detrimental for Civilization since that is diverting resources from the more successful to less successful, and the fit to the unfit,

and  the fact that Kazuo ishiguro, known for only two books (the book I discussed and Remains of the Day, about a butler who stoically accepts his fate as a servant during the decline of the aristocracy) got the Nobel Prize show a lot of things.

Those who run the world know where we are going, and want the people to behave like Ishiguro's characters; resistance is futile, and it will only retard things.


There will only be penury, suffering and hopelessness for the most. 

However, reaching Singularity, conquering Space and eventually advancing to Type 3 Civilization (around 1000 years from now) will outweigh the suffering of more than 7 billion people who will be left out.

As the topic of Basic Income is so perennially popular on r/futurology, and this is a chance to talk to a centre of global excellence of research on this topic,  we thought we might use this opportunity to put an r/Futurology FAQ together, with the help of their input, citing the very best research and data on this topic.


This post is to throw open discussion on the scope of such an FAQ and how it should cover such a topic. Were not interested in discussing Basic Income in relation to the present day, so this isnt the place for small government UBI discussions i.e. UBI to streamline Social Security bureaucracy - our focus is purely on the future &amp; AI/Robotics automation. 


For example questions we might want to  discuss could be
research sources on the rate of automation. McKinsey Consulting &amp;  economists like Erik Brynjolfsson are often cited here.  Questions - how is the data calculated?, are there differing models used?, Their reliability, How to AI &amp; Robotics developers see the rate of  development - is there discrepancies? Do past predictions about AI and Robotics development compared to actual development have anything to tell us? Etc


The current state of orthodox Economics thinking on this topic - Pros/Cons, shortcoming/flaws/questions.


Alternatives to Basic Income &amp; Basic Income in context - I think it's important this FAQ becomes something a lot more than merely an advertisement for Basic Income.  Basic Income would only be one part of a future automated post scarcity economy.   What might the rest of that future economy look like?  What alternatives might there be two Basic Income in that economic context?

I'm not sure I would call myself a futurist. I am a realist. Yes, it's fun to think about where we might be in so many years, what might happen, etc. But what about where we should be, or where we really **need** to be, in order to survive?

We talk about going to Mars. But right now, all that talk involves a one way mission. We should not be sending people on one way missions to planets which are essentially in our backyard. By now, we should have already set up a space station around the moon, and around Mars, and probably a colony on the moon as well. You send someone to Mars, then when theyre ready to leave, they get to the Mars space station, then transfer to the Earth.

This idea should not be futuristic. This concept should already have been implemented. We do not lack the resources, the technology, the science, to accomplish this feat. We only lack the drive and vision. I blame the L5 society, at least in part, for sucking the energy out of the space race. But thats a debate for another time.

So why do we need to worry about getting to Mars anyway? Well, with a space station around Mars, it would make mining asteroids a lot easier. But more importantly, there are just too many risks if we all stay on Earth. There are asteroids that could hit the Earth, theres risk of pandemics, nuclear war, super-volcanic eruptions, just to name a few of the many dangers that **will** destroy us eventually, if we dont at least start to spread out.

All right, I have not contributed anything to the advancement of any technologies, so it is not that I am blaming others, but it is just that now is not the exiting future I was expecting in the 1980's.

If I could somehow show the current world to 1980's myself, 1980's myself would not be that surprised and probably understand most of the new things in a day or so without much astonishment. Far from the 2020's I saw in TV shows of 1980's. In short, everything other than computers got just slightly better, and even for computers, they just got faster so things that we already knew how to implement but could not have done so due to processing speed are now possible, but other than that, computers are not different from 1980's.

Cars look more or less the same. The do have some small GPS guidance device, but it is not that surprising or magical. There are not K.I.T.T. like cars or hovering cars. Most of them are still driven by humans and using petroleum. I have heard of self-driving cars, but I cannot imagine when a fully automatic cars (that you do not have to drive at all) will be of the price of current cars.

There are no human-like robots. No, Google Assistant does not seem to have a human-like A.I. I have a Google Home, and it feels to me that it just a very complicated and long if/else programming, than it actually understands me even at a 5-year old child-level. It does not understand or respond like a human. It says the same things over and over again; it does not understand even a simple question, if it is an unusual question that the engineers in Google did not expect. I have lowered my expectations and am using it mostly just for simple things like asking time/weather, setting timers.

Houses look the same. Refrigerators, microwave ovens, washing machines look the same. There are some ""smart"" ones with just basic Wi-Fi capability, but in my standard they are still dumb. And they are not even prevalent. 

There are not so many diseases that were impossible to cure in the 1980's but now are curable. I mean, we still die from cancers, Dentistry is still using drills. We still cannot even eradicate simple viruses like herpes that hide inside our body.

Ray Kurzweil predicted a fundamentally different world in 2045 (27 years from now). I can hardly believe it. Yeah, he says acceleration of changes, but it feels more like an excuse. I kind of expect the year 2045 would not be that different from now, other than we have some faster/smaller computers.",19,9,False,self,,,,,

companies like Facebook provide mostly free services, meaning that if another company could provide a better service and experience, and for example transfer all your pictures and posts in an instant, it would be relatively painless for people to transfer to a competitor

Airbnb like Facebook doesn't do much beyond providing a paid service, here too a new innovation or technique which offers an edge could easily see consumer choosing a different service

Back in around 2011-2013, I've watched a documentary about AI and futurology in general (brain mapping, the new kind of AIs, nanotech (I think) and transhumanism/the singularity).

I've been looking for this documentary since then but impossible to find it since the web has been drowned by a plethora of other similar documentaries - mainly bad ones - in the last five years.

So, could you help me find it ?

This is what I specifically remember about this documentary :
- A person from Google was interviewed. Could have been Larry Page or Sergey Brin but I don't think so since I couldn't find the documentary by Googling them. It a was an important person from Google though. If I remember well, he was talking about the 2 ways of approaching human-like AI : either top down (with neural web/deep learning) or bottom up (with the mapping of simpler brains first, like a mouse brain, and then the mapping of more complex brains until the mapping of the human brain)
- A vegeterian/vegan was interviewed and he played the game of ""guess my age"" where he was actually something like 55 but looked like 30
- A young student from Harvard or MIT was interviewed. If I remember well, he was speaking about mapping the brain of a mouse and entering the Singularity University.
- I think several other technologies were mentioned like nanotechnology and medecine
- I kind of remember that the production value was pretty decent compared to the other documentaries of the kind but my memory might be biased since it was the first I saw on the topic

From radio to television we have argued over how these innovations have changed the world for better or worse. But regardless of how exceptionally amazing each technology has been in turn, they all have one thing in common, even advances like the internet and VR/AR. When you are done with them, you return back to ""real"" reality and continue to live your life in ""actual"" reality. A place where you have to submit to your biology and the laws of physics, for better or worse. Also ""real"" reality just looks and feels a heck of a lot better (Hopefully that is. It can be pretty hellish at times too.) than VR. For now.

Within less than 10 years I am confident our computing power, AI and VR technology (I'm sure AR will advance too, but that is not really my point here.) will advance to a point where my VR experience is far and away better than your ""actual"" reality experience. We see a primitive hint of this in the soon opening ""Ready, Player One"" motion picture. The special effects in that movie look truly amazing! *What* a universe awaits us!

I would imagine that by the year 2045 or when this movie takes place that such a technology as envisioned in the year 2016-2017 will appear laughably quaint and limited to us. Think ""Lawnmower Man"" CGI.

Today VR is large bulky, facially abrasive, sweaty and claustrophobically isolating hmds. And the lenses smudge easy. Well goodness, VR has been commercially available for what, about 2 years now? Think of the first commercially available mobiles in the 1980s. The concept of such a device being a supercomputer in our pockets was over 30 years in the future then. We still had 10 to 20 years of making a decent *phone* out of it yet.

Todays VR is so far from our ideal. The resolution is abysmal. The FOV is like a ski mask or a diver's mask. If you really want to see decent VR you have to be tethered. If you have not experienced ""tethered"" VR, not counting the PSVR, then you have not experienced VR. I have an Oculus Rift and I know. I also have an abundance of mobile VR devices I can stick my IPhone X into. It's keen, but in no way constitutes the presence and immersion of tethered VR.

But new gens are on the way. Resolution and FOV are at the top of the list of things to improve. The content itself is a bit more subjective. It depends what you want to see in VR. But I would state that right now it is ""limited"". What I would really, really like to see for example are some of my alt rock songs presented with VR imagery like a sort of VR MTV. I was able to pretty comfortably piss away most of my ""1980's"" watching MTV. BTW if you did not personally experience MTV in the 1980's, you do not know what MTV was. There has never, *ever* been anything like it since. MTV permanently lost my interest by the early 1990s. Diversification (Ugly, but true. It is a human problem that society *must learn to see with better eyes*. Something I believe our arc towards a VR future may render irrelevant) and replacing videos with programming=MTV death. What a godsend phenomena that was in it's heyday though. I think such an application to VR alone would make a true ""killer app"". Heavily balkanized to each individual taste I guess. And of course with better resolution and FOV. Hollywood is making tentative, year 1889 style steps towards making motion pictures for VR. 

But earlier on I stated my VR would be far superior to your RL. I want to expand on that and what it means. The technology to bring the rest of our senses to VR to include removing the urge to vomit from ""sim"" sickness are all in the works as well. Humans are a clever species and we shall quickly make convincing tactile sensations a reality. Easily less than 10 years. Already gloves and suits are close to commercial release within a year or two. You know, for all of it's laughable CGI and screenplay ""Lawnmower Man""( A motion picture adaptation of ""Flowers for Algernon"" with a twist.) was dead on right. In the 1980s it precisely knew what the future held when it came to the VR. I think we shall be smart like him too, but that is a topic for another text post day. I think the more difficult aspects will be enabling convincing senses of smell and taste.  And *how* we would be able to experience proprioception and orientation in true virtual worlds to me falls under the auspices of ""magick"" rather than engineering at this time. But I think we will figure even that out too. Every teeny tiny detail of reality we shall figure out how to simulate and exploit within VR. Tour the world in far better detail than ever possible IRL and need never leave your living pod, or in my case, apartment. My personal belief is that it will just take minor resolution and FOV improvement to make VR a potential severe societal ""addiction"" issue.

Because my VR world will be far superior to your RL world, you will also seek my VR world. So will everybody else. And this to me is what will mark the change in humanity. Also bear in mind that there will be some pretty awesome AI in various forms in existence too by this point. Remember that nothing is in a vacuum and everything tends to synergize everything else. Our forms of computing, our forms of energy generation or exploitation and the AI that I suspect will be part of us by then will have a tremendous influence on what happens next.

I believe that in the next 50-100 years that we shall reach a critical mass of humanity or what humans may already be starting to derive *into*, that we shall figure out how put VR into our heads without going anywhere or doing anything. I try to think of dreams where I actually am running or driving or swimming or flying to get a sense of what that would be like. A sort of ""structured"" lucid dream experience, wherein you remain fully ""reality"" conscious. The virtual world or even universe of that point would allow among other things, true magic, within a given realm. Things like X-men and vampires and zombies and fireballs don't exist IRL because they are not supported by physics as we currently understand it. In a screenplay or videogame that sort of thing exists just fine. Now extrapolate that into virtual worlds. In a very real sense, all of that could actually ""exist"" in their own realities of our digital making. If our coding (if we can still call it that) says it can exist, it can exist. On top of that we would have true ""superpowers"" of our own. The ability to ""fly"" being prime. To inspect a given scanned structure from any angle or distance. We can already do that a little bit even today in GoogleEarth VR or ""High Fidelity"". I already discussed that at length in an earlier commentary if you are interested.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6h7xtt/gamers_arent_buying_the_vr_hype_and_game_makers/diw60gy/

Beyond this point, it becomes difficult even for the brilliant likes of *me* to prophesy-- I see our science today in the year 2018 learning to understand ever finer ""grains"" of what makes reality, *reality*. Observing that is one thing. Exploiting such is yet in the realm of the impossible. Well, by 2018 standards anyway. Will we one day be able to fool with the quantum probability waveform? Our time-space? ""Other"" dimensions? (I mean like travel to other dimensions like in that show ""Fringe"". I mean if they actually even exist.) Not the ""curled up"" teeny stuff ""dimensions"" that may yet constitute our reality. Those are two very different concepts of ""dimensions"".

--But I will try anyway. The first thing I see falling by the wayside is biology itself. It is true that we realistically do not have a clue how consciousness works today. And we may not even 20 years from now. But the thing about humans is how clever we are and how we figure out workarounds for different things. Also don't forget about that darned AI and the soon to debut quantum computers. They are totally looming over all of this. Oh I almost forgot! The exponentially improving ""classical"" computer processing power alone!

 How we would move my ""self"" to a ""nonliving"" substrate, but I would still theoretically be able to have fun all the time, is thinking that is way over my pay grade. Oh yeah, and it has to be ""me"" too. Otherwise it is a lucky *copy* of me and I'm stuck in my ratty old biology still. Man, *that* would be for the existential birds, wouldn't it! Nevertheless since our brains are made of atoms and non-living substrates are made of atoms, well, I'd bet it is probably physically possible. In say like one or two hundred years or so. We'd need some new discoveries and insights between now and then I'm sure. The concept and early development of the BMI (brain machine interface) even today gives me confidence that we shall succeed in this. We are making humanoid robots today that are pretty stiff yet, but they are getting better quickly. Remember all those suspension harnesses and ""wrist thick"" cables from a few years back? Where did they all go?? I seen the other day that they are getting ol' ""Sophia"" walking even. Pretty soon she will be running. And jumping. And backflipping like all the other robots are going to.

 We will merge our minds with those forms.

This gif is a bit primitive in concept, but just extrapolate it into about 10 or 20 years into the future...

""Holy Shit! I Caught It!"" https://i.imgur.com/LSb2R9v.gifv

So the interim sees us as ""conscious robots"", for lack of a better term, that may yet explore ""reality"" like space and stuff, but pretend we are biology still in our virtual worlds. This is kind of the part I'm looking forward to.  As in I am a *god* in this VR universe, but I can self limit myself to be a lowly little human and just experience humanity and simulated history and stuff. But I can't get hurt and I'm comfortable all the time. And ""flying"" as a superpower would be the tip of an incomprehensibly immense ""iceberg"". By this point, without getting too sacrilegious, we would be approaching the omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. Unlike this crappy real life reality where I actually *am* a lowly little human who had to get a root canal yesterday for crying out loud. Blecch. (Major props to my *awesome* endodontist and 21st century technology though!) Unfortunately I am looking at all of this through the ""smudgy"" lens of a 57 year old life in the year 2018. That ""AI mixing with humans business"" may make us beyond anything I can fathom or even imagine. For example we might have VR universes all right, but to 2018 me it would all look like math or fractals or TV static or some other weird thing that does not make sense to me. But would make perfect sense to 2518 me. Yes, *That* soon. Yes. And in the meantime *plenty* of cool, interesting and entertaining VR stuff to keep us occupied. Just the arguments in r/futurology alone..!

I would add some more predictions like us turning into a fully hive minded non-corporeal sentient energy that can exist outside of what we think of time and space, but that is getting too far from what science can do for us today and more meta than anything. (Although, I think this is how it's actually *going* to go. Maybe in less than a 1000 years too!)

TL;DR OMG! The VR is going to *rock*! It is going to be beyond anything you can imagine in less than 20 years. It is going to become a societal addiction problem. Everybody is going to want it so much that we are going to engineer our minds to live within it. We will derive into VR and VR will derive into us.

We used to think of photos the same way before the advent of photoshop and other advanced image editing techniques. Though we do know to take them with a grain of salt now and fake photos can easily be debunked once the original photo is unearthed. 

Audio recordings have been around for a while now and though we have been able to edit audio, there are often telltale signs either to a layman or an expert if they are edited. And once again there did have to exist at one point to be an unedited video. So again, we take things with a grain of salt and know that audio can be edited and to be wary of anything too nuts you hear.

So now, that brings us to video. We know videos and their audio can be edited. You can splice a video and edit parts in and out but that usually has a telltale sign. You can CG something into a video if you have the talent and time or money to pay someone. But this hasn't proven to be much of an issue because of the time and/or money commitment to doing a good CG job on a video. And once again, the original video exists, so there is always proof of it being fake somewhere. 

With the Obama edited video that came out last year and the rapid advancement in machine learning and neural networks and the likely eventuality of quantum computing and other massive breakthroughs we haven't even thought of yet, it seems only inevitable that within the not too distant future, video and it's audio track could be not only edited, but entirely fabricated from scratch to the point that no humans could tell the difference. 

Now, at the same time we are seeing cameras put everywhere and people are taking more and more video recordings. 

The smoking gun for crime and best case scenario for any prosecutor, outside DNA and matching physical evidence, I imagine, is an actual crystal clear video of the criminal committing the crime. Even DNA could always have been (not saying it is) planted or in the case of a he said-she said where one person says it was consensual, the presence of DNA doesn't prove a crime was commited, just that they had sex. But a video of the incident would be accepted now (rightfully so) as incontrubutale proof of what occurred. 

But what happens when we can no longer trust video? What happens when people have the ability to fabricate convincing video footage easily. What happens when corporations can do this. Most scary of all, what happens then governments of the world have the ability to do this. If it doesn't happen it the next 20 years, it will in the next 100. 

Once we get to the point that even a trained professional can't identify something as fake, are we simply going to devolve into an arms race between fabricating videos and having computers and software that can somehow identify the fakes? Can one computer fool another computer? What if the software and everything is run by AI? How do to computers running their own AI compete against each other?

What happens when we truly can no longer believe our own eyes and ears to anything that doesn't literally happen in front of our face?

What does an arms race look like between two competing AI systems? Is it all about the code input to start the AI off that defines the winner? Or could one AI system ""worse"" written to start it off compete and win against a better positioned AI opponent as it starts figuring out some shortcuts on its own because it was forced to work harder since it started off at a disadvantage? Is there a sociological and psychological aspect of an AI?

What about people in places like North Korea (if it's not wiped off the planet by then) or other dictatorship run regimes? This would seemingly be the perfect tool to keep your people in line. 

What happens if the AI systems identifying fake videos end up being at a disadvantage to the AI systems making the fake videos and we can no longer (even partially) trust a video? ",37,37,False,self,,,,,

we probably remember The Venus project in some way shape or form. To be quite frank a resource based economy (RBE) has surprisingly been around before the The Venus Project. in fact, TVP has it's roots going back to the 1930s group called ""Technocracy inc."" Technocracy inc. had proposed a similar system to a RBE based on the amount of energy it takes to produce a product called a ""energy accounting system"" (which is not a carbon tax). this is the cliff notes version of how it would work.

let's assume that john doe wants to get a gallon of milk, and the cost of milk is based on the allocation of the energy of producing 1 gallon of milk is going towards : milking, pasteurization, bottling, shipping, storing, etc. basically it's a database of how much resources are being extracted, produced and distributed at a given moment in time.

now if this was post scarcity economy i can see an energy accounting system being used as an alternative to investment in a price based system when it come to the creation of mega projects (ex. a space colony) or as a transitional system from a price system to a post scarcity (without a UBI). unfortunately, due to human nature, it would take a very painful transition or it might fall on deaf ears

Look the Dr. who does this claims the stem cells will also heal spinal cord injury, a pilot who crashed in a plane and was paralyzed can now walk again, people were ridiculing this guy back in 2011 here on reddit saying he was a fraudster https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/f7720/that_post_about_a_pilot_with_spinal_cord_injury/

But now you got Mel Gibson and some other high profile people who have been treated and say they were completely healed. IF THIS DR. REALLY CAN CURE SPINAL CORD INJURY THEN THATS HUGE NEWS AND WORD NEEDS TO GET OUT!

p.s. From what I understand the stem cell therapy will only work on spinal cord injury if the accident was recent.",24,7,False,self,,,,,

That is right. The revenge of the nerds, high-IQ and high-functioning people is online, and the world is getting very hostile to the lower-IQ hoi polloi.

Thanks to idiots like Chuck Fitzclarence, whose forgotten act was more detrimental to Civilization than whatever Hitler, Stalin and Mao did combined, the 20th century was a century for the masses, both in the advanced and not-so-advanced worlds, and even in the poorest hinterlands the standard of living improved. (read: more resources were wasted.)

But now the pendulum is swinging to the other side. If the 20th century, which stated in 1914 and ended sometime in 2015-2017 (future historians will set a date), was the century of masses the 21st century will NOT be.

Too much money has been made in the tech and other high-intensity sectors, and not much to go to the rest.

And it will continue forever, since the advance of tech does not seem to know an end now.

William Rees-Mogg predicted this in his Great Reckoning, a 1992 book. The investors are going to win.

I think that technofeudalism is inevitable now, with those who made money in tech, real estate, and finance buying up all the properties around of the world, and - simply pricing the rest out of existence.

The top will get about 99.9+% of all share of income, since there will be no demand for well-paid jobs and the only kind of 'jobs' people will have will be like that of the child miners of Congo, jobs today's Western people won't take even if room and board are provided.

The poor in the 19th century lived in conditions the inmates at Auschwitz would not have envied. That is coming back too. No more reason to spend resources to those who won't be successful.

The gap between the rich and poor will be like night and day. We already have such situations in India and Brazil, except a massive expulsion of the shantytowns will take place by the gentrifiers who want better condition and safety for those who do matter.

With even the most primitive hut in , say, Botswana priced out of the poorer people, they will face the fate of the folks who were led out of Florida during the Trail of the Tears, and a new world of smarter, ruthless, efficient transhumans will conquer the world.",15,4,False,self,,,,,

Does anyone have any thoughts on why this may be the case? 

I would expect that stories covering advances in AI and other fields increase in number, more and more people would be interested in futurology. I suppose there could be a saturation point where most of those in the subsection of reddit users and futurologists have already joined up. 

Or I could be overestimating the prevalence of articles covering advances in tech, because I follow it so I mostly only see that. Though, the popularity of series like Electric Dreams and Black Mirror may stand as a counterpoint to that. But again, it could just be bias that it seems to be that this is newly popular, and it may be that shows featuring advanced tech are still at the same level of popularity as they have been.

Maybe it is part of a larger societal shift, or due to other events shifting people's attention away from tech advances.",4,15,False,self,,,,,

To preserve civilization, and prevent the masses from overwhelming it, I think human rights will be redefined to match the cold reality.

Many middle east countries do NOT grant citizenship to guest workers, who are warehoused in shitty compounds with bad food and very little rights to move around, and if they are bad they are deported (and they are expected to pay for their own deportation, which is why some of them just kill themselves when they fall into such situation).

The world is moving towards that, and I think further measures to ensure the masses not having any voice about how society, tech, etc to be run.

Right now the pop in less advanced countries are about 6 bil - 6.5 bil, and the pop in advanced countries are about 1 bil - 1.5 bil. (The difference mainly comes from how to treat China's pop; only a few provinces of China could be considered ""First World"" and the rest stuck in the past, but it is hard to tell how many Chinese have entered the advanced world because there are pockets of wealth in other provinces.)

If everyone in the world had a voice, the Third World would quickly overwhelm the advanced world.

The Manchu Qing dynasty had a law where the Manchurians, about 1/300 of the total pop, had an equal number of officials with the Chinese. In other words,  there would be a Manchu and a Chinese official for each spot, and if they disagree the Manchu's decision was supreme.

That system did work, until English cannons undermined the Manchu authority decisively in 1842. 

We will probably enter technofeudalism, and a timocracy (the richer people running the govt), like the ancient greek city states, will return with a vengeance. People who pay more than, say, $100,000 /year worth of tax would be eligible for public office, and people who pay , say, $10,000/year of tax will be eligible for vote, etc. 

Those who pay more taxes, say $250,000/year, will be given more rights, like policing powers (i.e. the power to kill people of lower rank if they feel like it).

Those who don't have rights will be denied from any compensation if they are injured, doctors would reserve the right to refuse to treat them if they are sick , etc. Judges would be encouraged to make decisions in favor of the citizens.

Camus' book the Stranger is about a Frenchman being executed for killing an Algerian native, who had no rights back when what we call Algeria now was an integral part of France. (Algers , Oran and Constatine were departments (provinces) of France, just like Ile-de-France and Normandy. Of course the Algerians had no vote.)

Camus felt that was wrong. Owners of a country should not be punished for killing a non-citizen which has no stake on it. 

[Naturally, the Algerians did not like Camus' idea, and blasted off anything which had to do with him after their independence, although I think that all third world countries will be re-colonized by the tech lords which will be another topic.]

Tl, dr, human rights will be given to those who can pay for it, or in some rare cases , like Carl Friedrich Gauss who was sponsored by the local baron, smart enough to get the richer people's attention.

Capitalism is based on the tension created by scarcity on offer and demand, it's based on a scarce physical world full of constraints against the limited human nature but, what about a posthuman world where our minds can be connected to the Metaverse and the hardware needed to maintain it is cheaper and cheaper, and more abundant?

I think Communism will return but only for this kind of physical world where unity and coordination is required for full optimisation of production. On the other hand we willl keep Capitalism for intellectual property, creativity, imagination, VR goods etc. 

Of course there will be limitations in the physical world so some things will become scarce like computing power, but this scarcity will be so limited to a few products things that it will not save physical capitalism because we will just need sand to keep computing power/capacity growing. It's just a good, or more, but just raw materials, atoms, easy to manipulate etc.

This may sound stupid and maybe it is, but consider we are moving towards the world of ideas, from it to bit, and matter becomes more and more cheaper while knowledge is what gives products its price.

He believes that robot automation will simply lead to job growth in other areas, such as maintenance of the robots.  My argument to this was, no matter what way you look at it, there will be a net loss of jobs, rather than a net gain.  And besides, once you repair a robot, it doesn't need regular maintenance, it only needs occasional maintenance.  Not to mention, that would be considered a ""skilled profession"", which would require school / training / experience.

The conversation ended because we cannot possibly have the answer until the day of reckoning comes, which makes me think, ""doing nothing about anything in the mean time seems like a fantastic option"" (sarcasm of course).

I'm curious if there's any way unskilled workers will survive the robot automation apocalypse that's coming in the 2020s, and if society or the government won't be burdened with record high unemployment resulting in the beginnings of a universal income masquerading as unemployment benefits.",63,19,False,self,,,,,

(a good summary of the book)

The author, Jean Twenge, also wrote ""Generation Me"" about the millennials.

In any case, she laments that such kids are not prepared for adulthood, but she appears to be mistaken.

Such kind of docile, tolerant (to existing conditions) and less happy youths are the people of Singularity, where there will be less opposition and more acceptance to the status quo, and no futile attempts to obtain happiness will be made.

&gt;Twenge believes that smartphones and other screens promote antisocial behavior, prolong childhood and increase loneliness, depression and political disengagement

All of them are good. less participation on political debates means less energy wasted upon useless political arguments, and more loneliness means no futile resources are wasted on socialization.

The world is slowly preparing itself for Singularity, with a docile, accepting-of-one's fate, obedient, not rebelling citizens. Just described in the Nobel laureate Ishiguro's characters in ""Never let me go"", going to their deaths without resistance.

With more docile people, the world inches closer to singularity every day.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

Seems hard to find a clear answer.

When people talk about terraforming worlds in our solar system they're generally talking about Mars and (eventually) Venus. Both have their problems (need to warm up the former, cool down the latter) but both at least meet the minimum requirement to have enough gravity to hold an atmosphere.

We know that Mars had an atmosphere for maybe half a billion years before its geological processes slowed down, its magnetic field waned and the solar wind blew 99% of its atmosphere away. The same would eventually happen again without human interference, but it seems clear the atmosphere on a fully terraformed Mars could last (on human timescales at least) a long damn while, thousands of years.  This is with an escape velocity just under half of Earth's (5.02km/s vs 11.18).

I was wondering though about all the smaller worlds in the solar system that are generally ignored because of their low surface gravity. Not tiny asteroids obviously, but the dozens of large moons, dwarf planets, TNOs and some large asteroids with escape velocities of 1-3km/s.

Titan proves smaller worlds can maintain an atmosphere, with an escape velocity of just 2.64km/s. However, Titan is in a deep freeze. I found a useful calculator for the speed of gas particles vs temperature - http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Kinetic/kintem.html

Earth's temperature averages 15C. Plugging the numbers in, a molecule of oxygen (amu 36) moves an average of 393m/s, for Nitrogen its 420m/s. On Earth, this is almost never fast enough to reach escape velocity (and our magnetic field protects us from the solar wind). Of course, this is the average (or 'most probable' speed). There is a curve, with half the particles moving faster then this. A tiny portion will move several times faster.

I lack the mathematics to calculate exactly what this curve looks like and how long an atmosphere could be retained on bodies of a certain size. I did hear a 'rule of thumb' that if the escape velocity is over 6X the average then leakage is negligible and an atmosphere could be retained 'in the long run' but without defining this period.

If we plug Titan into our calculator, its temperature is just 94K (-180C) so an average speed of 236m/s for Nitrogen. This is less than 1/10 of its 2.64km/s escape velocity, so looks good. If we heated Titan up to room temperature (using giant mirrors or nearby fusion reactors as artificial 'suns') we're back up to a figure of around 400m/s, flirting with the '6X' limit. 

I also found this useful chart - https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Solar_system_escape_velocity_vs_surface_temperature.svg

It lays out the relationship between escape velocity and temperature quite clearly. However, it seems to be based on a 'geological' rate of atmospheric loss. Here, nothing smaller than Mars can retain a Nitrogen/Oxygen atmosphere at room temperature over billions of years (and even then its borderline). 

Notably though, even something as small as the moon could maintain a 'Xenon' atmosphere (a heavy Noble Gas). So if you could pump enough Xenon in (and maybe Argon/Krypton, etc) you could form bodies of water and people could walk around with just a breather mask - only lacking oxygen. 

But the question hasn't quite been answered - Luna, IO, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto and Titan all have escape velocities of over 2km/s. This is 5X the average velocity of an oxygen/nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. Only a tiny fraction of molecules could escape at any given time. This seems manageable enough that their atmospheres would take millennia to bleed away, and could be maintained without huge difficulties.

If we warmed these worlds up (and dealt with other issues, like Luna's long day due to tidal locking with Earth, radiation levels on IO) then alongside Earth, Mars and Venus, there could be at least nine worlds in the solar system which could eventually be terraformed with oceans and breathable atmospheres (indeed, most of them would be purely ocean worlds). The next candidates, Triton, Eris, Pluto etc, have escape velocities of 1-1.5km/s, which seems just a tad too small, unless you kept the atmosphere very cold (like -200C, but then what's the point?) The 'Xenon atmosphere' could be an option if we could scrounge/produce enough of it (through nuclear fusion) but this is very likely impractical.

Am I completely wrong in this analysis? How long would their atmospheres last?",10,10,False,self,,,,,

But something else is happening in parallel, at a slower pace, that may define the era *after that* - something that may begin to have a real impact late in this century or early in the next: Drones.

On the surface, the mechanics of drones today are not that big a deal: They are literally just an incremental evolution of toys - what used to be called ""RC"" (remote-controlled) aircraft, and were available in toy stores beginning generations ago.  But via drastic advances in signal technology due to the mobile phone revolution, advances in camera systems, and in robust, lightweight materials, the capabilities on offer have exploded.

Today, that has radically increased the options available to photographers, filmmakers, scientists, soldiers, and others for whom agile insights from various angles and altitudes is useful.  But because there are still humans at the controls, drones are commercially and legally still barred from the domains once envisioned for ""flying cars"".  The signals from remote operators are not perfect, nor is signal security, and placing the pilot at a distance is hardly any solution to the problems of the flying car.   

For now, it's typically very rich people who have access to point-to-point VTVL (vertical takeoff, vertical landing) aerial transport - in the form of helicopters.  But helicopters are (a) wildly expensive as a transport value proposition, even just hiring individual flights (which is why a normal person will, if ever, only ride in one as a tourist over some amazing attraction); (b)have a dubious safety record compared to more traditional aircraft; and (c)are loud and utterly obnoxious, limiting where and when they're permitted.

The above factors, plus the economics of the helicopter market optimizing for luxury consumers at low volume (a business trap that I'm sure has some technical name I'm not aware of), have ensured that helicopters remain generally expensive and rare.  But drones are approaching the same aerodynamic technology (rotorcraft) from the opposite end of the market, pursuing *high-volume* business because the systems are physically small, retail consumer items.

At some point, there will be a convergence: Most likely through upscaling of the drones rather than adoption of drone technology into the helicopter market, since the latter is much more heavily regulated and ossified in the traditional aerospace industry.  But movement will occur from both toward convergence.  

Drones will deliver bigger and bigger packages, as they already do in a few limited applications, and both remote piloting and on-board automation of controls will advance steadily.  The helicopter industry, meanwhile, will - with grudging, feet-dragging slowness - adopt more and more of the technology from the drone industry, making copters lighter, more efficient, safer, and cheaper.

So there will be a period of several generations (let's call it late this century) where a lot of different things are going on simultaneously: 

* The streets (and perhaps bored tunnels beneath the city) will be flowing with automated ground vehicles moving with the smoothness of an abstract liquid.

* The air immediately above the streets, trees, and buildings will be flowing with cargo drones of various sizes and types, probably quietly.

* And the air above *that* will have advanced, safer, quieter, more affordable helicopters carrying the ""minor rich"" (high 6-figure and above professionals) from point to point within cities and between nearby cities.  They will be *attainable* status symbols, like the automobile was before mass-production.

* Cities will adapt to the drones and more ubiquitous helicopters with more advanced landing infrastructure for both.  It's an interesting thought to imagine ""ports"" in the sides of skycrapers that are constantly receiving and emitting drones.  Although most buildings most places would probably just have some little landing cradle in a corner of the roof with its own recharging systems.  Helipads likewise will probably get more elaborate than just a square with an H painted on it.

But the process will not stop there.  Just as the emergence of self-driving cars will precede the adaptation of infrastructure to their presence by decades, the same will be true of the increasing three-dimensionality of transportation in the subsequent stage.  Cargo drones are *normal* in this Intermediary stage - they swarm like vast flocks of birds (perhaps like *vultures* if you're a cynic) around urban cores, and in nice, pleasant streams in the quieter cities and towns.

All along, plenty of hobbyists will have made human flights on passenger drones.  Rich people will have their versions to augment or compete with their more robust, late-generation helicopters.  But there will come a Killer App moment for human drone transport that tips the balance, and society will be so used to the systems themselves that the transition to carrying humans will seem trivial.

Maybe it will be in the form of a Model T sort of system that bridges the economic gap between the robust helicopter technology and the cargo drones, or perhaps it will be a mass-transit platform - that's not clear yet.  But both are inevitable branches of the main technological flow.  By this point, probably everything is downscaled, highly efficient jets rather than rotorcraft, BTW, so just assume things move fast.

Another several generations pass and you're now in the Late Stage of transition, and something interesting begins to happen - ground-based transport becomes a narrower and narrower application, for the first time in human history.  Here's why:

* Small distances in your own community can be walked, biked, take trivial little electric systems like e-bikes or scooters, or even just slow-moving little platforms that wander around perpetually (and are slow enough to step on and off, but convenient if you don't feel like moving).  If you want something but don't feel like going to get it, a drone delivers it.

* Long distances, like thousands of kilometers, you're probably riding a rocket or hypersonic aircraft above the atmosphere, or some advanced underground system like hyperloop.  

* Intermediate distances within regions, you're zooming *straight* to your destination as the crow flies well above the built environment, in an automated aerial vehicles, and nothing other than extreme weather will get in your way.  Geography, traffic, and construction will not slow you; there will be no hours spent going through security, baggage check, baggage claim, etc., and even the most terrible accidents suffered by others will have *zero* impact on your travel.

Where are cars in this equation?  Even automated cars that are so fast, agile, and highly intelligent that speeds are consistently very high, and accidents exceedingly rare?  

They will still exist, of course: People will still love the experience of speed, even if it's objectively much slower than air travel, because you can appreciate it more from ground level.  People will still love the experience of driving some scenic routes along the ground, even if they can see more from above.  Some people will continue to be afraid of flying, enough so that even blacked-out windows in a passenger drone won't be enough for them. 

But daily life is what drives the construction and maintenance of infrastructure, not so much aesthetic pleasure.  The vast road networks all over the world will be used less and less, becoming more and more local.  The grand highways that were the pride of nations and empires in this and the previous centuries will become, in some instances, like the abandoned industrial railways that rust today.

Some areas will be repurposed as parkland - massive versions of the High Line in New York or the Cheonggyecheon in Seoul.  Some torn down and deliberately returned to wilderness.  Some particularly interesting stretches preserved for historical purposes.  And others put to use for purposes that we can't guess at.  But that is one clear conclusion: **Long-distance road networks will evaporate** in an aerialized society.

It is entirely possible that it won't stop there: That movement through air will become so well-understood (surprisingly, aeronautical engineering is still a very tricky and pioneering discipline); the available energy to power it so abundant; the automation to pilot it so superb, even under very unstable conditions; and the cost of use so low; that roads will simply not have a purpose.

The **generalization of mobility** from a specific technology to a black-box application seems, the more deeply you look at it, to make air the inevitable default.  Humankind will be constantly *swimming* through the vast volume of air above us, not merely hitching a ride from time to time on a passing whale of a jumbo jet.

We will, in essence, **de-invent the wheel** - at least as a ground-contacting traction device.  And with that, the world created for the wheel - the road - may become more of a notion than a part of life.  

Even the visual evidence that people were once stuck mostly traveling two-dimensionally may strike future civilizations as disturbing and claustrophobic, like the narrow warrens of some ancient catacomb.",0,3,False,self,,,,,

These micro-governments would serve their own needs first and foremost, freely distributing their products and services to their members, and then excess stuff would be offered to the larger network, also freely, so that a global flow of specialized products and services were available to everyone, everywhere as efficiently as possible.

Individuals would usually be part of multiple collaboratives at a time, based on what their interests are, their geographic location, and their needs.  

For example, I might be a member of a library/media-lab collaborative because I like making educational/entertainment stories in video, audio, books, etc., and I might also be a part of an online science research collaborative because I like to understand systems theory, and I might be a part of a permaculture collaborative that grows food in resilient ways, and, of course, I'd be a part of the micro-government collective where I physically live.  I'd get most of my physical needs met through my neighborhood collective, where we individuals would offer whatever excess resources we had as individuals (all voluntary offers, never a non-consensual tax) to one another.  We'd work together to find ways to meet our needs as well as possible, using local resources.  I'd get my higher needs of meaningful work met through my other hubs, which would offer their work freely to the world at large, whenever appropriate.

We'd need some kind of global database and resource matching system, to help match offers and requests or outlets.  This might be blockchain-based, perhaps.

And education for kids would be primarily aimed at helping them discover and refine their own unique skills and interests, so that they can be happy and feel like their lives are meaningful and rewarding, regardless of what they choose to do.",2,7,False,self,,,,,

Envision a cabin the woods. Maybe youre seeing a Walden-esque cabin -- Overlooking a lake and nestled in a forest of pines. If you look closer, there are some antlers hung just below the A-framed rafters and a fireplace accompanied by a stack of freshly chopped wood. This rustic image stands in stark contrast to the idea of modernity (defined as the quality of being modern). Present-day modernity is thought to exist mostly in the city where theres an abundance of art, culture, and technology. But our definition of modern life is transitioning. The cabin described in Walden (circa 1854) doesnt have wifi or renewable energy and is an outdated description of Life in the Woods. Cabin-life is changing, and so are the people who live in them.
 
Cities have long been regarded as the bustling hub of commerce, art, and technology. But now this connected hub reaches far past city limits for those with access to internet. Until recently, internet access was limited in rural areas due to the expense of laying fiber optic cables. Satellite based internet access is solving this problem by obviating the need for cables all together. While most of these data plans are still prohibitive for extended video streaming, its a vast improvement over no internet at all, and the quality and cost are steadily improving. 
 
Internet isnt the only technology cabin dwellers crave. While many cabin owners pine for connection via internet access, they still want off the grid with regards to energy use. Advances in solar panels and batteries are making it easier than ever to unplug from the grid.  Solar panels have doubled in efficiency since early adopters started outfitting earthships in the 1970s.  Efficiency has risen from 14% to almost 30% as of 2016. Just like computer chips, solar panels arent just getting better, theyre also getting cheaper. Many residential solar projects completely pay for themselves in under eight years. Solar panels alone arent enough to have a sustainable, off-the-grid cabin. Recent advances in battery technology are making it possible to keep a cabin powered at night and on cloudy days without relying on a utility.  Companies, like Tesla or ViZn Energy, are making affordable and reliable batteries to meet this need.    
 
Technology connects us, but it doesnt replace real-life creative collaboration or the interpersonal exchange of ideas. For meaningful cultural, artistic, and creative outlets, people will have to leave the solitude of the cabin and venture out into their community. The good news is, big ideas and creativity are no longer limited to big cities like Chicago, Boston, or New York.  It used to be that thought leadership and big ideas only flowed in big cities, and slowly trickled down to the people in small towns. But now, small towns and the people in them have access to the same big ideas as those in a city.
 
For example, a university in Missoula Montana is collaborating with NASA on an astrobiology project right alongside their academic peers at MIT in big-city-Boston. Aside from a university, this mountain town of 72,000 has a contemporary art gallery, natural history museum, and a thriving local economy. Theres more than just mountains in Missoula --There are jobs too. While tourism and education make up a substantial portion of jobs, theres still plenty of diversity with local video production agencies, biotech start-ups, and consulting firms. Big ideas flow in this small town.
 
Missoula, Montana may sound like an outlier, but similar mountain towns abound. There are bigger towns like Boulder, CO (Population 108,000) which sits just at the foot of the Rocky Mountains and hosts panoply of culturally rich opportunities. Smaller towns offer similar amenities like: Spearfish, South Dakota (Pop. 12,000), Bozeman, Montana (Pop. 45,000), and Eau Claires, Wisconsin (Pop. 68,000) just to name a few in the midwest.
 
The cool mountain towns and the technology are there, but is the next generation of homeowners interested? Millennials arent called the Green Generation for nothing. The desire to protect nature, stems from this generation's love of the outdoors. The number of North Americans who go camping have risen steadily by 1 million households each year and this growth is largely due to millennial interest in the outdoors. In 2016, millennials made up 31% of the overall population but accounted for 38% of campers.
 
A connection to nature is one reason millenials want access to Life in the Woods, but connections to friends and family are a much more important factor. 80% of US cities have populations of 10,000 or less. These communities are seeing their youth off to college, but are not seeing them return. For small-town America, education and career are pitted against relationships with friends and family (a sure contributing factor to the loneliness epidemic). Moving away from friends and family is the only option for many educated millenials from small-towns. This doesnt mean it has to stay the only option. Think back to that Montana town with NASA collaborations. More small towns could end up like this one if more people choose cabins -- Especially if those people choose to build a business along with a cabin. Just like the age of cabins in the 1850s, this new age of cabins will also be spearheaded by pioneers and entrepreneurs.
 
The urban model of living will probably always be around, but this preference for cities over smaller communities currently dominates our culture -- leaving few career options for those who prefers a smaller community with access to the outdoors. But this paradigm is shifting. Towns like Bozeman and Eau Claire are gaining popularity, and similar communities may begin to emerge and flourish. When this happens, the cabin in the woods will no longer be the home of the luddite or the recluse. It will be the home of the future.",3,5,False,self,,,,,

People will try to create new content and become the super stars of the world or they will be home watching and voting on their favorites.  Better favorites lead to better rations. 

As such people will want to use some of their extra rations to eat at a restaurant. Some guy sees an opportunity and decided to open that restaurant, because he loves to cook and could use the extra rations. 

When he gets done at night he goes home tired and the trash piles up. There is still  mild stink from the fish, which us stuck to plates.  So the owners choice is to use some of his profit to hire someone to come clean it up or work more hours.

Hence an economy is bring out of people videotaping their antics and lives. 

People would want to one up each other or pass on knowledge. They may want to show interesting ways to spread your rations.  

I believe we will end up where we are today but with a better overall minimum standard of living. This is done by putting maximum salaries in place and better food and nutrition.  

If you are unable to or just don't want to, you will be given a minimum of four walls, food,plumbing, nutritious food. 

If this I mildly interesting to you, I see each of these as being at least 10 animated podcast. I could write it, but need someone that would want to animate it.  Someone that believes in it firmly.

All the wars, destructions, etc only occur in bush league countries where no civilized people would be found dead.

Everything is so efficient, so effective and so prompt that there is no room for a slack, which had been exploited by so many people from lower social ranks to raise themselves.

There is no more room to do so anymore.

Today's upper class will be forever. They will be the upper class of the Local Group soon when space is conquered, etc. David Wingrove already talked about it in his Chung Kuo series.

There is simply no way for the rest to overturn the structure, because today's elites have a tech, financial and military advantage which the hoi polloi can't even dream about catching up.

In some sense, the Singularity has already arrived for the Elites.

When we reach the next level of Civilization, the Elites will become gods by transhumanism and other enhancements unthinkable today, leaving the rest to share the path of Ishi, the last Yahi. The elites will conquer the space, while the two-legged apes will be left to rot in a radioactive, dying earth.

People who know where the world is going know this is the only path remaining. The other available path, if tech is developed too late, is the world running out of critical resources and falling into eternal chaos, but I predict a massive enclosure to deny the poorer people from resources, which would reduce pop to maybe 100m-1000m (anyone's guess), which will buy at least one more century.",52,0,False,self,,,,,

There will be large companies (or gvt organizations) which will operate, control and make available fleets of hundreds of autonomous vehicles from one central location.

These vehicles will come to your home when you need them. You schedule them say for your daily work, for errands or whatever. You call a vehicle from your app or computer, it will take 10 mins and the car will be there.

After the car did its job to take you to wherever, the vehicle will be on its way to the next ""client"". These fleets will operate 24h, day and night.

These large fleet-owning companies will have elaborate software-operated systems in place so their fleets will operate as efficiently as possible. With the least down-time, the most effective routes etc., always punctual and dependable etc. This will be a major new industry in the not-so-far future. (Amazon, Google, Tesla etc....)

--&gt; You won't require to own a car. Logical, seeing that your car, right now spends 80% sitting on your lot/in your garage anyway. The benefit of owning a car consists in that it is *available* to you. When you have a self-driving car coming to you and take you places reliably, whenever you want, why would you need to own a car?

--&gt; Since these fleets will operate centrally controlled and much more efficiently than cars that are owned by people, this will also mean that a lot less cars in total will be necessary for all people.

--&gt; This will also mean less pollution, less accidents etc.

--&gt; Since large fleets of cars will be driving autonomous and on their own, this will also mean cities may look differently in the future. They don't need to be designed around streets and highways, because cars can drive underground etc..

--&gt; ""Flying cars"" are actually not an illusion at all. There are already test runs with little electric helicopter-like 1-seater or 2-seater ""flying cars"". Of course, right now these are not practical and there are loads of problems, mainly safety. But with all of them autonomous, controlled by a central system, ""self flying cars"" may become reality before you know it. This will lead to a massive change how our cities and landscape will look because streets won't be needed anymore.

The issue of limited battery power of electrically powered vehicles is also easily solved as part of the central control system, by the companies who operate these vehicles. The automatic schedule for the vehicles simply takes this into account so that it is ensured that ""charged"" cars/flying cars will be operating and the others will (autonomously) return to a central place (or some charging station elsewhere) where they will charge. When they are charged, they will simply make themselves available to the fleet again. This all happens automated of course.",55,48,False,self,,,,,

I have been working on my own social network for few years now. Few years back I created Kickstarter campaign. It didnt go well since I didnt know how to make a proper campaign. I was young as well. But one of the reason I create the Kickstarter campaign is to gain popularity. Now we are planning to launch this year. We havent start any promotion yet since there is few more work to do. But this can be our first step into promotion. One of the main reason Im posting is to get public opnions. No matter if its negative or positive all comments are welcome.

Here is a brief description about my social network. Let me know what you all think.
Youre on Facebook: you can chat, and you can play games. But what if you want to watch a video? Buy something? Sell something? Now youre not on Facebook: youre on Youtube or Amazon or eBay. Lets say you want to produce and host a radio station or your very own TV show. Where do you go now? The answer isnt always clear, and even when it is clear, more often than not, youre going to have to go to a different website. That takes up your resources, most precious among them being time, and beyond that, you know instinctively that you could get much more done if all of these services fell under a single, encompassing heading.

Every time you leave a website, your computer is forced to break its communication with that websites server and then open up a line of communication with the next website you visit. This is costly for you, the user. Youre spending processing capacity unnecessarily and wasting time as these connections open and close, open and close, open and close. You know youre going to move around from service to service during any given session: doesnt it just make sense to keep these services in one central hub?
Beyond this technological issue, there is also your own personal efficiency to consider. If you could open a chat box, watch a video, and make a purchase without ever moving around from one page to another, you could save precious minutes every time you had something to do. Dont take this lightly: those minutes add up. Over time minutes turn into hours, hours into days, and days into a lifetime. Anytime you have the opportunity to conserve chunks of your own (lets face it, limited) time, you have a responsibility to take advantage of that opportunity. Youre worth it. We can help.

In order to keep things light, we have all sorts of small bonus features planned for this one-stop social network. When its April Fools Day, users will be pranked, sharply but with a friendly touch, and on Christmas and other religious holidays, observers will see a personalized landing page that wishes them well. We also hope to integrate our business with the work-for-hire model, which is growing more and more popular every day. From design to programming, beginner, intermediate, and master workers will have the opportunity to make money by helping us out with any tasks that come up.

Now this isnt the end. There will more features will be implented and we will reveal those day by day when we are close to the launch as a promotion.

Think about it, the hosting fee would cost substantially less than it would today, it wouldn't cause economic issues with cities, and it would get a lot of publicity. Think about the Opening Ceremony, it could be held completely in VR. And you could have Artificial Celebrities introducing you to the show. And then a show relating to the theme of that Olympics could occur.

It would attract Billions of viewers but it would be the first profitable Olympics since 1984. I heard that for some sports, they could host it in real life and some of them in a Simulation. Apparently in the future, the Winter Olympics will be entirely simulated because the former venues will no longer have any snow to support it.

(Japan is not exactly Asia. It is part of Oceania; it is only grouped with Asia because of cultural, not geographical, reason.)

The independent countries of Latin America and Liberia were considered to be American turf, and nominally independent countries like Abyssinia and Thailand were under varying degrees of Western control. China was in a big shit, divided into spheres of influence.

I have discussed the incalculable crime Gavrilo Princip and Chuck Fitzclarence did to Civilization many times so I won't repeat here.

But, as the gap between the advanced and not-so-advanced, the 'wired' and the not-so-wired world grow even faster, and more wealth is accumulated to the top of top like radiation accumulates to the bones.

it is inevitable that those with lots of cash and financing will buy out all of the world.

Today's smart money will probably not bother with places like the Sinai, the empty zones of Sahara, and other places where private airfields won't be built, since they are economically valueless and the folks living there would pose no harm so they would probably be left alone.

However, for spots with resources worth bothering to take, colonization will return, because valuable resources can't be left to the whims of local governments and warlords.

Instead of countries colonizing other regions, it will be companies, like the East India Company. In fact EIC ruled India until the Sepoys foolish rose up in 1857. All of Congo was ruled by the private company of King Leopold.

We will go back to there, with drones and other tech. Too much is running around, and they have to go somewhere. It will be used to price out the hoi polloi from the future, and also to buy out anything which is valuable. or might be useful in the future (to deny them to the competition).

The days of lower-IQ governments ruling lower-IQ people are ending. They can't beat the smarties running today's leading companies. Just like the local sahibs of India couldn't beat the East India Company; only one of them, Tipu Sahib, put some reasonable fight because he was able to hire some French officers who lost jobs during the Revolution, but there was an English officer Arthur Wellesley who outsmarted him. (Tipu's belongings still grace the mansion of the current Duke of Wellington now).

Global colonization is coming back. Only the most godforsaken spots of earth where no civilized person would be caught dead will be safe, assuming it can defend itself from the disenfranchised people from the city. The whole world's resource will be grabbed by the tech lords, to be used at their whim.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

He cut the heads of Sophie Scholl and her fellow conspirators, but after WW2 he also cut the head of Nazis, with the help of a guy from Kansas. The kansan got to admire Reichhart.

To his last day, the names of Sophie Scholl and other anti-Nazis were taboo, and he only referrred them as their case numbers.  He lived in a comfortable Munich suburb, living with the income from his rental properties he bought during his days as a headcutter, and his tombstone appears to be quite expensive. To this day it is said that his descendants NEVER consider Scholl, etc as heroes.

He was 9th in the line of executioners (his older son, who would have been the 10th and often helped dad, killed himself because West Germany abolished execution and ended his job prospects).

Another person of the future is Saito in the 1962 Japanese movie Hara Kiri.

Tl,dr, that is about a homeless guy in a personal tragedy who exposes the hypocricities of the day, but Saito, working for a powerful clan, cleans up the story very efficiently, killing anyone who knows the truth and brings the honor to the clan he is working at. Saito and his progeny would probably serve the clan for generations, and his line would live while the line of the homeless guy and the retainers he killed would die out.
Such kind of people, who can feel nothing, efficient on the job, and very, very ruthless, effective and spotless, are the people of future.

As everything is now quantified, we don't need compassion. A person's value is largely determined by the person's intelligence, income and wealth, and all other values are now tangential.

Education should deemphasize on teaching humanity; instead, an almost militaristic culture of efficiency would be forced. Tried in Korea by the Japanese during 1910-1945, and created a kind of people who lifted a third-world country to an economic powerhouse (although as such people began to die out things are not going well there anymore).

The purpose of education is to create people needed for the economy and society, not for the benefit of the individual.

USSR had enough people creating space vehicles despite of all repressions. If failure meant the gulag, something was going to come out.

A rational, super-smart, merciless and  emotionless kind of people is what we should strive for, not caring, 'nice', understanding kind of people. Those who can't fit in should be removed from the society, and by corollary, the future - the Future will look like a machine-ruled society even if organic bodies might remain.",27,0,False,self,,,,,

Sure, AI advances, life extension, implants and artificial body parts should have the spotlight, but I still personaly find it sometimes frustrating of how little discussion future progress of cosmetic surgery gets.

It WILL have a large impact on society in the far future, because when you are able to change every single aspect of your body seeing a person that doesn't even look remotely humanoid will become a mundane every day thing.

Anyway, what do you envision cosmetic surgery will look like in the years
