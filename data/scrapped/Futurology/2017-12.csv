I've been re-watching Black Mirror recently in preparation for the new series, and it's got me thinking about something that I often do. If you were able to remove certain elements of your memory, would you do it?

The reason I mostly think about it, is when watching films or tv shows (hence why I just thought about it with BM), I really wish that I hadn't already seen it. There's so many great films an shows that you can happily watch again,  but they're tarnished slightly because you know the outcome or the big twist at the end. Sometimes knowing this information can make you see things slightly differently the second time around, but you'll never get that big shock moment again.


I also think about this with music. Just imagine being able to listen to a great album again for the first time.

Obviously then there's much larger scale idea of it. Erasing memories of a relationship, a la Eternal Sunshine. Or a traumatic event. Then this raises the thought process of whether ultimately certain things are good for us even if we can't see it at the time. Say a failed relationship that hurt at the time, but sent you on the path to a better one.

Or then there's the cause and effect angle. Whether randomly pulling things out of your memory is going to cause chain reactions of thoughts and lost thoughts in your mind. Say if a certain song always made you think about something else. What happens if it's suddenly gone?

Anyway, what do you think?",18,6

Many old, and popular games have been completely remodeled to fit it's requirements, along with new ones being created solely for it. The graphics themselves would be almost life-like, and the AI would be rather realistic themselves. The system would be able to support massive worlds, and I'm assuming at this point in time we'd be advanced enough to easily power such a device, and have it run efficiently in most households. Now, to get to the point, what kind of effect would this have on a user? This is mainly aimed towards Horror, Action, and other 'Violent' games. How do you think dying in VR would work when in full-dive? What about playing a Full-Dive VR game similar to Outlast, or Amnesia? How would such functions effect a players choice of killing an NPC? I hate to draw this on for so long, but I've just been so curious about this for a while. 

I hope I get some good answers!",14,16

Proposed adaptations:
1) tax the machines (heavily) and distribute money as basic income

Proposed adaptations (revised according to MMT)

1) preempt taxation of the machines and print money and giving it to individuals as a GBI. GBI to be at a level to cover basest needs. 

Would this drive up costs due to market forces?
Production costs or a grapes of wrath scenario?
Assume automation has driven down production and transportation costs (food). Govt can regulate these industries to keep costs low.

Today's economy is like an autopilot mode. Today's darling stocks will rise forever, because there is virtually no marginal cost for these companies and their overhead is very negligible.

As economy grows further, real estate prices will rise forever as well. Those who don't will be basically shut out from the future, as rents will rise forever and those who can't afford to buy a decent property will be like the landless peasants of the old.

There will be still opportunities for the very smart people, but their numbers will be negligible enough to make it irrelevant in the big picture.

No more crashes, and big fishes will be bailed out invariably when real estate price falls, because it is now proven that we can print money as long as it stays in the financial sector and used to bail out huge players, whose wealth will continue to grow forever.

Rebellions will be quieted down with superior  tech, and most non-elites will be herded to places which Civilized people will never see, like Marshall Brain's Manna. 

Eventually people will learn to live with despair, and learn that they CAN'T beat the cognitive elites, and will quietly go to their extinction while the cognitive elites will perfect singularity, transhumanism, space travel, etc, enter a new Civilization and conquer the space and beyond.",6,4

So you use the toilet in a friends house, then you step toward the door and speakers in bathroom say ""Josh, can you please put the toilet seat down before you leave"" you do and it says ""thank you"" It can't see you in there but it saw you go in and sensors tell it that you used the toilet, where you placed your feet and that you used the sink afterwards.

Later, you leave the bank and a speaker says ""Josh can you please put the pen back, it belongs to the bank. Thank you. ""

Today, people wont cross the road all the time because they know human drivers might not stop and hit them. Because human drivers might not be looking. Now self-driving cars are always aware. I can see they working well on first world town where people respect this but on other countries I can already see, people just crossing without looking or doing it as a joke just to stop cars. I can already see bored teenagers pretending to cross the roads only to make all the self-driving cars to stop all the time. So how does self-driving cars deal with this?

2. How about animals or children running into the road?

Fringe/weird/out-there topics are a plus!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7hs9ag/recommend_podcasts_about_futurology_that_relate/,guessworks,1512503404,"In short, I'm looking for a podcast that is both very up to date on the newest tech developments, but also considerate of the cultural  angle and not just some hosts talking about the newest of the newest technology.


Ideally, the podcast would consist of one or more very (tech-)knowledgeable hosts interviewing artists, other tech experts, philosophers, filmmakers, etc. about the future and about technology. Perhaps a filmmaker is programming robots/AI to be his camera crew. Or perhaps a clothing start-up is creating clothes that makes it harder for facial-recognition software to recognize you. Or maybe some activist has been spying on corrupt law enforcement using home-built advanced technology. Those kind of subjects and beyond.


I liked [Singularity 1 on 1](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/singularity-fm/id398887225?mt=2&amp;ls=1), but it looks like they've stopped producing new podcasts and I am looking for something that's keeping up to date on new inventions/developments.

Singularity 1 On 1 was good because one week you'd hear an author's or an artist's perspective and the next week you'd hear a Silicon Valley tech expert's perspective and so on. The mixture of state of the art tech knowledge and also different cultural considerations is very appealing to me.


And it's *definitely* a plus if it gets into some really out there, weird or fringe-y stuff and not just the usual suspects (3d printing, internet surveillance, VR glasses, Bitcoin, etc.). The weirder the better as long as it doesn't go to far off into pseudo-science/conspiracy theories. 


If someone talked about 3d printing weapons or discussed micro-dosing LSD in a podcast back in 2009 then that would be considered fringe-y back then, since in 2010 there were no Wired-magazine articles or Vice documentaries about those subjects and they were not widely talked about in the mainstream. 


I'm looking for a podcast that does that in 2017, only they are talking about things that *might* be a thing 5-10 years from now.",4,1

This sub has a higher population so I decided to post here to see if I can get more people to give me their insights)

TL;DR at the end. First post too, bear with me plz.

What do guys see in robotic warfare's future (please no fearmongering, only level headed analysis)?

Today the U.S. carries out drone campaigns in 6 countries that 30 years ago would have been considered wars and they hardly make the news today muchless are they considered wars. A few days ago we decided to add Niger as a 7th after the events where some spec ops guys died. People don't seem to care much or they're just unaware of these events in the first place. I know it keeps our guys safe but it also seems to be killing higher proportions of civilians (I know civilian deaths are a tragic consequence but a reality of war but the proportions are higher). Are we becoming more cavalier towards war as a consequence of robots because it has no direct effect on our population?

As we know the level of robots used in all aspects of life are expected to increase dramatically in the future, including war. From boat and jet swarms to submarines, quadcopters, the Big Dog, and many others. I see this problem only worsening in the future (prove me wrong, dammit) with climate change and increasing tensions around the world.

Will the future be (At the most extreme extent) super powers carrying out perpetual wars with robots for assets, interest, and resource wars to keep their home population safe while those people don't do much about it because it doesn't effect their lives and would potentially ruin their cushiness.

For example there have been articles recently about China trying to acquire massive amounts of lithium, because they want it for cars (let's assume the articles aren't being dramatic for the sake of the example). Could we, in the coming decades, see small wars fought at these mines (in countries that have their own sovereignty, like Bolivia) to control the mines. So they cause death of locals (And probably some soldiers) and are unlawfully occupied to assure access to the resources. 

I know the media likes to blow things out of proportion, but drone warfare is only the beginning and it's not made up or a future specualtion, it's happening now.

Is it going to be Herizon Zero Dawn precrisis?

I'm just a dumb college freshman though (studying robotics), what do I know? I'm fairly worried m8s.
(Not meant to be sarcastic)

TL;DR - what's the future of war with increasing number, complexity, and proportion of robots?",7,5

The research is still in early stages and human trials are not anticipated to begin until later in 2019 at the earliest, therefore we are not currently seeking volunteers and are unable to offer this treatment at present. It is however hoped that in the next 5-10 years or so the method could be introduced into dental practices and be available to the public, but this will depend on establishing links with appropriate commercial partners. For current questions regarding dental work, we suggest you contact your local Dentist.
 
In the meantime we thank you for your interest in this research.  We hope that the continued developments in dental research will bring new possibilities in healthcare in the future.

In his masterpiece Never let me go, it shows a bunch of clones, whose only purpose to exist is to provide organs for those who need them and are disposed after they do 4 transfers, accepting their sad fate to be hid behind the screen, never allowed to travel or have a real fun, and be killed when their purpose has ended.

It showed a great guideline for how the people who will be left behind to behave. After all, Ishiguro is Japanese (he didn't bother to get an English name although he spent most of his life in England, and his first two now-forgotten books were about Japan), where people who are not elites are expected to lead a marginal existence, and not cross the fates of their betters, even now.

I wrote about this last year too.

Most of the gains of economic growth and tech advances will be monopolized by the top 0.5% - 1%, who will not throw a peanut to those they do not deem necessary. However, if they cross their way, like a homeless person at an intersection to a richer neighborhood, they will treat the hapless person as an eyesore, and will deal with it like an exterminator deals with pests. No different.

The cognitive elites tend to believe in evolution, and the less intelligent are, I have to say, less adapted to live in the world which we will face. So, though no fault of their own, they are on the way out since evolution is survival of the fittest and they are not fit.

As the wealth gap between the 'enlightened' and the rest would grow to, say, 1000:1, the masses will be angry. But unlike the old days, we now have enough tech to neutralize any kind of rebellion with a brutal efficiency. 

One advantage of USA is that it has so many ethnic groups which will be very happy to fire on other races. The French used Vietnamese police in Algeria to keep order (though Camus didn't find them worthy enough to be mentioned in any of his stories), and things in there didn't get hot until the Vietnamese had to go back following Dien Bien Phu (1954). Until then the brutal Vietnamese had kept the Algerians in order.

There is no way, and no use, to let the masses to enjoy the gains by future techs. The 1% and those who were lucky enough join in time would be richer, richer and richer, and there is no room for the rest.

It is fate, and people should accept it. That today's rich will be always rich, today's social position will probably be permanent. If the masses do not revolt they will mostly be left alone and allowed to continue their meager existence as long as they don't cross the elites' way, but if they rebel summary retributions will be the norm.

Leaving them behind is not cruel, brutal or barbaric. It is just evolution ; the old humanity getting out of the way for a much more efficient, smarter, higher-able and probably mechanically, genetically and AI enhanced species whch can no longer be called humans and will have no mercy on the old humans any more than the Cro-magnons had on the Neanderthals.

Sure, if the hive mind is stronger it benefits the general pop, but an average IQ does not advance Civilization.

As Gregory Clark has shown, England came to dominate the world because its social structure was conducive for the culling of less intelligent. Smarter , richer and more ruthless people reproduced more, and their smarter genes drove out poorer and less intelligent genes.

However, even though today's smarter people are smarter than those from previous generations thru Flynn effect and other reasons, there is a limit to their intelligence.

It is necessary to implement eugenics, etc to prevent less intelligent people from creeping up into higher echelon. But that is just part of the solution.

The fundamental solution is to enhance intelligence significantly. 

One bad story is Daniel Keyes' Flowers for Algernon, a story which has significantly retarded intelligence-enhancing experiments. 

I have called for unlimited human experiment. I think that such experiments should be conducted asap, to find out what measures will be the best. They could be conducted in jurisdictions which do not have laws against human experiments, like ""NovoRussia"" (the two breakaway regions of Ukraine which are Russia's puppet states but where no international laws apply) or Somaliland, which is independent for all practical purposes and is surprisingly a stable region, a rarity in Africa.

Brain implements and other enhancements should be put in. Too bad for those who will die from it. Rats live too short to show changes which will benefit this field.

To reach Singularity, etc, we will have to enhance intelligence, by genetic, mechanical and other means, and by ethical and unethical ways as well.

The first goal would be make today's IQ 135 become like tomorrow's IQ 65. Not literally, but figuratively. Or that goal could be reached in ways I am not going to elaborate any more.

Tl, dr, We need superintelligence, and we won't get there by gentle, humane and ethical way. ",62,0

&amp;nbsp;

With the recent release of the games of AlphaZero vs Stockfish8, several questions emerged.  


&amp;nbsp;

In simple terms, what are the differences in the code (or design) between Alphazero and Stockfish?



How to best explain this ability to self learn, and to represent to itself a set of possibilities when given rules, and does it need those rules to function?



 With AlphaZero learning within a closed environment, to take action towards a defined goal, could it try (accidentally or not) to function or find possibilities outside of the confines imposed on it? Or does it fundamentally need (so far) a direction for it to exist?



Can we potentially see a similarity to the way the human brain works, and could its search for possibilities be equated to the human notion of curiosity, and by extension, the desire to ""
understand"" and escape the world it navigates? 



And with that in mind, if given a world without rules, or clear goals, would it wander and create information that could be abstract or artistic? 


&amp;nbsp;

I am aware these questions have been around for a long time and explored in a variety of literature, but for people who work in AI and fields related to it, how are these questions being tackled, now that this possibility is finally palpable? And finally, for people who work in fields where this type of machine learning can be applied in the near future, how do you see it affecting your field? 


&amp;nbsp;


I apologize for the wall of questions, but I hope that it can help us understand this subject a bit better!


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you all

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngZ0K3lWKRc

The cold fact is that it's not going away. If anything, we're on the cusp of an era where AI-created media is dominant.

A recent story that I liked was:

[Nvidias new AI creates disturbingly convincing fake videos](https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/12/04/nvidias-new-ai-creates-disturbingly-convincing-fake-videos/)

&gt; Researchers from Nvidia have created an image translation AI that will almost certainly have you second-guessing everything you see online. The system can change day into night, winter into summer, and house cats into cheetahs with minimal training materials.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VC0c3pndbI

And you also get to media synthesis with:

[AI Generated Music Based on Listener Feedback](http://www.judgemysound.com/index.php?lang=en)

[I suck at drawing, so I asked a deep neural net to draw a worldmap for me from this MS Paint sketch](http://imgur.com/BZQ2O3h)

[deepart.io - become a digital artist](https://deepart.io/)

In other words, human creativity enhanced by artificial intelligence. I can't be 100% certain obviously, but I can guess. And I feel that, in 2018, we're going to start seeing AI programs that help you create things. Image translation, image synthesis, gif and video synthesis even. 

A solid challenge, I think, would be for someone to create a comic or manga based purely on image synthesis. Find an art style that you want to replicate, then begin typing descriptions of scenes and text, and finally compile everything so that it makes sense.
This might not be done in 2018 and the initial results will be sloppy, but hopefully it could get started then. If it's accomplished, it'll unleash a brave new world of media. And it will soon be translated into animation. Not just 2D animation, but 3D as well.


I believe someone mentioned that these sorts of content synthesizing algorithms can also be used to smooth out CG we've achieved photorealistic CG graphics a couple years ago, but only as static images or with very, very limited animation. Realism costs money. The closer you get to photorealism, the harder it is to break out of the uncanny valley and the more expensive it gets as you need more and more artists and programmers. And what good is photorealism if physics are wonky? Physics cost even *more* money. Yeah, the way the water actually moves around a player character's hand may look amazing realistic, but it's easy to forget just how much time and effort went into doing that. And if your system isn't powerful enough, it won't be able to run it anyway. AI can rectify all of this, meaning you could create a basic animation in DarkBASIC for all one cares and the algorithm fills in all the blanks, turning it into something indistinguishable from real life. 


And of course:

[WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/)


[Lyrebird claims it can recreate any voice using just one minute of sample audio](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/24/15406882/ai-voice-synthesis-copy-human-speech-lyrebird)

Want realistic-sounding speech without hiring voice actors? There's an algorithm for that too.

[Japanese AI Writes a Novel, Nearly Wins Literary Award](http://bigthink.com/natalie-shoemaker/a-japanese-ai-wrote-a-novel-almost-wins-literary-award)

Want an epic, thought-provoking novel or poem but you have virtually no writing skills? There's an algorithm for that too. And if you're like me and you prefer to write your own novels/stories, then there's going to be an algorithm that edits it better than any professional and turns that steaming finger turd into a polished platinum trophy.

I support these endeavors because while it's true that content creators get screwed, I can only think of all those millions more creators there are whose imaginations go untapped because they simply lack the time or the money or the physical talent. For all we know, the average Joe who fucked up your cheeseburger could have the concept for the greatest movie franchise in history, but since he doesn't have $500 million lying around in his closet (unless he does and is just trying to piss you off), we'll never know about it. Maybe you despise the way a show ended (if it actually ended and wasn't just canceled) or even the way it played out and feel you could have done better. Obviously you can't actually do that because you'd need millions of dollars, but if you had a program that could whip up such a thing...

Or maybe you love a classic game, but when you load it up, it's really showing its age. Maybe it could use more levels, or the levels it has need fleshing out, or the graphics could be wholly improved. There'll be a program for that one too.

In 2018, my prediction is that we'll see the public release of more media synthesis AI. A lot of it will be super rudimentary compared to what we'll see down the pike (2020-2023 is when we'll likely get into the really fun territory, and it'll likely be matured by 2027). Hollywood and various creator studios ~~might~~ will object, but it'll be the start of something amazing. 

And like I said, it will probably start with something like someone using these media synthesis AI to create a comic. A short comic, but a comic nonetheless. One that can be registered as an IP and sold for money. I'm tempted to say ""animated short"", but I'm being conservative. Even creating a comic/manga with AI would be a moonshot for the field.

As for the realm of general AI, I don't see much happening in that area in 2018. Narrow AI will get stronger, much stronger. We might see more clustered narrow AI as well. But I'm more excited about media synthesis.

Well, excited *and* frightened. Because if you can use a computer to create new entertainment, you can also use AI to create new ""facts"".

Sure, the Indians might have been innocent and were just trying to defend their land. But they had to go - too bad.

Whether the people who were victimized were innocent or not, that did not matter. The winners simply forgot the past, the dead buried , and progress occurred.

That is the story of America. Do not feel guilty about anything. The killings are justified since the losers were not going to amount to anything. The losers die because they were weaker; and there are new frontiers to be conquered no matter what the collateral damage might be. It is evolution in action, and life just taking course - nothing bad about it. It can be justified.

Expansion toward a new Civilization or a new world (like Space) will be like that. The Americans have experience on that, which is why they will be willing to go through a lot of steps to reach the goals, such steps unimaginable to people in other countries.

A lot of people will be left behind. One could feel guilty about them for maybe a second, but moves on, leaving them behind, even though it is not their fault that they will end up poor, destitute and will probably die in despair. Same thing with any aliens we might encounter in the space - they are our future slaves, and the 14th amendment (which was actually not ratified as any legal scholar can tell - it is there as a 'common law', but there will be a moment when it will be 'discovered' that it was never ratified and many 'citizens' will lose their rights, but that's another story.) won't apply to aliens.

Lots of sacrifices, lots of suffering, and lots of misery and tragedy will occur as we enter a new Civilization and conquer space. 

But that is inevitable, and those who lead the move, the more able people who will be the winners of the Future, will learn to ignore the plight of the unfortunate as fate, and will continue their inexorable march toward the Future where a new Dimension and the riches of the space await them.

But in this context, the more advanced we become, the larger and more accurate our scope of predictions on future developments, and thus when we reach those milestones the accomplishments become less and less of an novelty, of an achievement. That's why I think so many envisionings of the future are romanticized as extremely dystopian or utopian worlds, in an attempt to give the feeling of a radical transformation to an alien setting our parents and grandparents likely felt.

For instance, setting up a colony on Mars feels like a much more realistic goal today than what people would have thought about putting a man on the Moon before the Space Race, despite being a task magnitudes higher in difficulty.

It will have to be a truly earth-shattering discovery that changes the way we perceive our entire existence to create a reality we have not yet dreamed by the end of the 21th century.",25,4

(1) What are challenges that you are pretty sure (with &gt;90% probability) AI wouldn't be able to solve within (a) 2 years (b) 5 years (c) 10 years from now?

(2) What future AI achievements would make you think that with &gt;40% probability human level AGI is within (a) 1-2 years (b) 2-5 years (c) 5-10 years ... (d) less than 1 year?

(3) What statements can you make with what probability (or probability distributions) about concrete AI development timelines?

---
**Below are my own answers, in inverse order.**

**(3) What statements can you make with what probability (or probability distributions) about concrete AI development timelines?**

Here are my estimates:

(1) AI would beat human champions in either StarCraft or WoW with human-like APM limits  p=70% for 3 years from now, p=80% for 5y (by Dec.2022). 

(2) AI would pass ""Turing test"" against professional humans on En&lt;=&gt;Fr translation on WMT'14  p=70% for 3 years, p=85% for 5y

(3) 1000 words written by AI from scratch would pass Turing test against random excerpts from human written fiction books  p=80% for 3 years, p=90% for 5y

(4) ""one model to learn them all"" gets performance better or on par with human on all tasks mentioned in that work: ImageNet, En&lt;=&gt;Fr and En&lt;=&gt;Ge translation, MS COCO captioning, speech recognition  p=60% for 3 years, p=80% for 5y

(5) A single AI architecture can learn to beat humans on several hard games like StarCraft, WoW, Warhammer, Civilization  p=60% for 3 years, p=75% for 5 years

(6) AI would get A on high school graduate tests on both math, physics, literature and history (generating both answers and reasonings for those answers, and essays when needed)  p=50% for 3 years, p=75% for 5y

(7) [set of human geniuses in AI, physics, psychology etc]-level AGI  p=40% for 3 years, p=65% for 5y, p=90% for 10 years (assuming no major wars, major voluntary/involuntary restrictions on AGI progress rate, etc).

And some others:

(8) AGI safety solved in a local sense (measured by universal agreement of 9/10 of Nick Bostrom, Eliezer Yudkowsky, Elon Musk, Stuart Russell, Yoshua Bengio, Yann LeCun, Andrew Karpathy, Roman Yampolsky, Paul Christiano, Ian Goodfellow)  p=8% for 3 years, p=12% for 5y, p=15% for 10y (a significant portion comes from AIs reasoning over AGI safety).

(9) Unsafe AGI seized power over the Earth  p=15% for 3 years, p=40% for 5y, p=65% for 10y

(10) Safe AGI controls the Earth and guarantees our good future  p=3% for 3 years, p=8% for 5y, p=12% for 10y (a significant proportion comes from unknown unknown suprises like acausal trade with Nelson friendly AGI)

(11) Most humans are tortured by AGI for years or forever  p=5% for 20y (mostly for acausal trade reasons like ""first AGI in Universe wants other AGIs to not exist so it makes huge amount of simulations and tortures AGIs arised in them after simulation ends if they didn't torture their creators (especially successfull AI researchers) -- to make incentive for people to not create AGIs because of obvious acausal trade which would make created AGIs to torture their creators and probably suicide thereafter"", and also for unknown unknowns) 

PS. Certainly, those estimates are subject to change in future after more evidence arrives. However, I'm pretty sure (&gt;80%) that overall picture would stay the same.

**(2) What AI achievements would make you think that with &gt;40% probability human level AGI is within (a) 1-2 years (b) 2-5 years (c) 5-10 years ... (d) less than 1 year ?**

(a, 1-2 years) One of the following:

 outperforming humans in translation + being able to generate consistent pages of text instead of current mild schizophasia + being able to reason explicitly while successfully solving high school math problems + simultaneously be better than human in a wide range of tasks (like ""one model to learn them all"" but with performance better than human)

 being a chimp-level AI (including motoric skills)

 passing fair Turing test where judges have to distinguish it from random people (4 to 7 years old) without any intellectual disabilities. Only text messages are allowed so motoric skills might not exist at all. 

(b, 2-5 years) Outperforming humans in a wide range of tasks (sensoric, games) except may be one or two sets of tasks (language, motorics) -- 2017 is certainly qualified as that while 2015 isn't.

(c, 5-10 years) Outperfoming humans on image recognition (2015) because several dozen percents of the (similarly built throughout all its length) human cortex is devoted to image processing 

(d, &lt;1 year) one of the following:

 passing fair Turing test where judges have to distinguish it from random people from 14 to 18 years old without any intellectual disabilities. Only text messages are allowed so motoric skills might not exist at all. 

 being able to reason explicitly while successfully solving high school tests in most subjects.

**(1) What are challenges that you are pretty sure (with &gt;90% probability) AI wouldn't be able to solve within (a) 2 years (b) 5 years (c) 10 years from now?**

Alsmot the only thing I can be sure with that much probability as p&gt;90% is that there would be no [a set of human geniuses]level AGI within next 1.5 years.",3,11

Mods will continue to apply our rules and remove any other off-topic posts as per our rules - please refer here: https://www.reddit.com/r/futurology/wiki/rules

The FCC [just voted](https://www.battleforthenet.com) to repeal all existing net neutrality protections. They are giving giant ISPs like Verizon and Comcast the power to control what we can see and do online with new fees, throttling, and censorship. This will ruin the fundamentally open nature of the internet. **This fight isnt over though, there is still a clear path to victory.**
 
The organizations behind [Battle For The Net](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) are launching a new campaign to demand that Congress step in and restore net neutrality via [Congressional Review Act](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R43992.html) (CRA). 
 
The CRA lets our elected officials in Congress overrule actions taken by Federal agencies like the FCC. And its different from a normal bill because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate and House to pass. Given the level of public backlash and polls showing that 83% of voters from across the political spectrum oppose the FCCs plan, and given that several Republicans have already started to publicly criticize the FCC vote, we have a real chance to making this happen. **But it wont be easy, and it can only happen within 60 legislative days of the order going into effect.**
 
**We cant stop now. [Contact your reps today and demand that they preserve net neutrality through Congressional Review Act](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)**
 
Youll see a script on your screen, or you can say something like this:
&gt;I support Title II net neutrality, and I urge you to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a resolution of disapproval reversing the FCCs December vote to repeal the Open Internet Order.
 
**You can also text BATTLE to Text ""BATTLE"" to 384-387 to use a simple chat-bot to send a message to your lawmakers**
 
We can still win this. Even if youve already contacted your reps, now is the time to call them again. We need all hands on deck. Please, take a moment and make the call, then spread the word, sticky this post, or help drive traffic to https://www.batttleforthenet.com

Earlier in 2016 when the courts rules that the internet must be treated as a public utility, source: https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3F95E49183E6F8AF85257FD200505A3A/%24file/15-1063-1619173.pdf, a very anti-competitive regulation was introduced. Suddenly, all smaller ISPs were told that they needed to step up to a level that many simply did not have the ability to, whereas while the big dogs grumbled, they knew they'd won. If you go back to the breakup of Bell/AT&amp;T during the infrastructure subsidy days, source is from this book: https://books.google.com/books?id=okSaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=at%26t+bell+subsidized+infrastructure&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z8IO9wlygK&amp;sig=klaWMf7qalExUVgGDkPwpVyLxro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL3IvLxYrYAhXCRSYKHX1bAaIQ6AEIUjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=at%26t%20bell%20subsidized%20infrastructure&amp;f=false,  you can find out why they're so happy. Most of the infrastructure they are currently using was paid for by the taxpayers. They are secure in knowing that the infrastructure they have can handle any load required of it, and smaller ISPs not backed by massive companies like google simply can't.

Why should you care about that? Well, let me tell you: if competition is destroyed by regulation, you will only ever have companies like Comcast/AT&amp;T/Centurylink/etc, and they will no longer have to worry about competition and can focus all their efforts into bleeding you dry.

[Anecdote]

In my city, we only have Spectrum. No other service, not even DSL or dialup. There are two small isps operating, both of them have been running at a loss and 1 of them has approached end of operations multiple times. Their prices? Currently, Spectrum charges roughly $85 a month for their 100down/10up package. Small ISP#1 for the same package? $450 a month. Small ISP#2(this is what I use for my business)? $250 a month. The latter two primarily cater to businesses, because they simply cannot build up infrastructure and remain solvent with current regulations. They simply cannot compete due to the extensive infrastructure, already prepared infrastructure they are against.

Now, let me explain the game that is being played. The big providers want there to be less competition, because they consider every person not currently on their services as potential profit. The price gouging/greed is calculated. People are scared, they want protection from the big providers, so they not only agree to but wholeheartedly support anti-competitive regulations which in turn gives the big providers more business. It's really a win-win for them no matter what happens.

What can you do about it? Read this: https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pgak38/the-fcc-cant-help-cities-trapped-by-predatory-internet-deals-with-big-telecom

Familiarize yourself with the issue, and the problems that lead to the issue. It's easy to cheer for regulation that you think is beating the big providers down, but really, they're just pretending it hurts while sneaking their tendrils into more wallets.

What does this mean for the future of the web? Well, quite frankly, nothing good. Several companies have become the arbiters of all platforms of communication. This is an almost unrivaled power, able to inflict massive damage if used irresponsibly. ",3,1

[in-depth],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7k2zv7/at_what_point_do_we_say_no_more_indepth/,arctofire17,1513375510,"Technology is mankind's greatest gift. It has vastly increased the comfort and quality of life available to him, has enabled him to overcome biology's constraints, such as infant mortality and plagues, it has enabled him to access anything his mind desires at the touch of button, and perhaps most importantly,  it has created a society of abundance, relieving the need for classes.

I am constantly dazzled by the wonders of technology, and in many regards I am looking forward to it's future. Nanotechnology will relieve us of our needs for excessive anti-biotic use, stem cells will allow us to regrow to perfection facial disfigurements, we will find cures to every disease and give people longer, happier, and healthier lives, 3D printing will revolutionise production in the interests of the individual, you get the idea...

But if you look at how fast in the past century technology has moved forward, from the age of cavalry to the age of computers, what will technology be like at the end of this century? And most importantly, do we want it?

There have been some elements of technology which have been negative. Increased ease of communication, whilst having been a great good for human progress, has also increased totalitarianism. To take an example, no totalitarian regime of the extent of Nazi Germany and North Korea existed in the middle ages, there simply wasn't the means of communication of doing so, and so in a peasant village you could criticise the regime in the private sphere with little repercussion. However, by the time of the 1930's, post, railway, radio, television, etcetra had increased the ability of governments to control their citizens. These days, we have even more potential threats to our liberty, CCTV, online tracking....

What if by 2100, all of this virtual reality technology comes into fruition, and what if, it's used to track the thoughts of individuals...?

George Orwell warned of these kinds of thought detection technology's in 1984, and I have to say I find anything to do with virtual reality extremely troubling. I believe that not only will it decrease our freedom, but we will also loose our humanity. We will no longer value the physical world, and instead live inside computer systems where people become addicted to it and loose all touch with real life. I've seen predictions for future technology's like this and they seem to be extremely excited about this, but I'm not at all. It will seem like the very material fabric of human existence will cease to exist.

I fear that the Oculus Rift is the start of that process, the process when human beings loose contact of their true selves and indulge themselves in corrupting self gratification.

And what of AI? I am enthusiastic (or perhaps a better word is indifferent) about some aspects of AI such as self driving vehicles, and the medium has moved at an incredible rate. I'm often remarking to numerous friends and family of mine that we're living in a science fiction world. Alexa, Siri, and Cortana are existing forms of AI, and not only do they seem like something out of Star Trek; if you look at what computer tech was in 2000, and what it is in 2017, just under two decades later, what will it be like when I'm 49 in 2050? 

I sincerely worry that AI systems will start to develop human, or worse, greater than human intelligence and could turn on us and start wiping us out. What will it do to romantic relationships? Will we become addicted to these perfect robots, best most loving personas possible, can satisfy all sexual fantasy's that human partners seem no longer appealing, calling the entire future of our species into question?

CCP Grey did a video on why death isn't something we should accept, but should instead cure. He doesn't for a moment think the most obvious point which is, How the hell will we manage population growth. People need to die, it is part of the natural order of things, and it is essential to keep order and balance so to make room for the next generation. In a way, humanity is reborn like a phoenix with each passing generation of life, but if we attempt to cure death, we disrupt that process, and order goes out of balance in favour of overpopulation and environmental destruction.

I want us to have a say in what technology's are developed. Capitalism constantly needs to create unnecessary technology for the sake of profit, but any intelligent person will recognise capitalism is in it's late stage, and it's demise by the turn of the next century is one of the few things that is virtually certain.

 Under a socialist society, I like to think we would be able to decide what technologies we want to be invented, but are humans even capable of making such decisions, or will we succumb to our lust and greed and ensure our own demise? It's something that greatly troubles me, possibly more than anything else since I feel it does not have a definitive answer. We know how to solve climate change, we know how to get rid of capitalism, but because of ever advancing technology, the future of our species is put into grave question of whether we will live on or be replaced by our creations

We often like to think that humans have such a degree of importance in the history of the world, but in fact, as every great scientist has shown in a variety of ways, it is a blink of an eye. If I'm scared of 2100, what of 3000 AD, 15000 AD, 1,000,000 AD. Those periods will come, as we are literally living at the very beginning of human history. Will humanity as we know it exist in those time periods...? I'd like some detailed discussion and answers to these points. ",24,10

Pool/billiards combine the physical, the mental, the need to plan in advance, a random variability (e.g. in table speed, humidity, etc). 

My guess: fifty years or more. 

Edit: 

I guess I defined scope poorly.
It has the same constraints as the human; it needs to navigate the table in the same way, and it has the same basic physical structure. It can't be some large robotic contraption that can surround the whole table and shoot from distances that an average human would be unable to reach (but that is not to say that it cannot operate with superior accuracy from difficult distances for a human).

Edit 2: (First, I know no one will ever read this.) I appreciate the feedback. The question I was really asking is: imagine the game that for you combines the physical, the mental (i.e. strategic planning), and the instinctual (i.e. learning from experience and creating heuristics) in the most difficult way possible. How many years until a robot/AI defeats the best human at that game?

This has been occurring since the days of the Neandrethals; first discovery of fire, discovery of the wheel, formulation of language, the first tool etc. It is intrinsic to our nature to be scientists. Before we even knew how to communicate with each other we knew how to be primitive scientists and use our curiosity to make discoveries. Thinking about it I realized that scientists are the ones that mold the course of humanity. Everything around us has been advanced through innovation and technology. Making discoveries about how the world around us operates is not something that should be forgotten about in modern era. It seems as if people have forgotten how to be curious. Distracted by the society we live in today, we are bombarded with more information than ever before. 

We are now approached with more questions than ever about how far humanity can go. Our knowledge of the universe is only just beginning to be understood and is approached by more questions than we have answers. We still have no understanding of how the universe is expanding faster as time goes on or what 95% of the universes composition(dark matter and energy) is, just to name a couple. We are only beginning to understand the quantum laws of physics and the rules that dictate subatomic particles. We still have minimal understanding of time beyond Einsteins general relativity. 

We are on the cusp of an evolution of human understanding. Technology is taking us to places never thought to have been possibly conceived. A computer-brain merge could be a reality in the very soon future. Think of how far we have come and how lucky we are to be alive in the most exciting time in human history. Thank you to the scientists and future scientists who keep the wheels of human evolution spinning.

The aspects of spaceflight that continued to evolve, did so slowly and largely served Earth-bound communications purposes.

Today, there is hope that spaceflight will again ignite, and this time in far greater glory and profusion.  But the question should be asked, was the delay necessary - did humankind need to pour trillions of dollars into evolving our global information technologies before we could hope to have practical, scaled human space travel?

This is not at all obvious.  The fact that the approaches being taken today to pursue space colonization are IT-heavy reflects the fact that such computing power is *available*, but does not argue that it is fundamentally necessary.  

After all, half a dozen human Moon landings occurred with all the computing power of a clock on board, and less power even on the ground in Mission Control than is in your pocket.  So we know that, all other factors ignored, it was at least *achievable* to send human beings that far, on short missions, however complex and expensive.

But suppose that, instead of trillions of dollars having gone into the IT revolution, the same investment had gone into reducing the cost and complexity, and increasing the reliability and scale of human spaceflight.  Quite a bit of advancement in IT would have happened anyway by convergent utility, but where would spaceflight be today?  And where would IT be?

There is an intuitive appeal to the idea that technological progress oscillates along an attractive mean over time - that sometimes it lurches forward, and other times stagnates, but over generations or centuries moves with linear regularity.  Would it be the case that prolonged focus on spaceflight vs. IT would ultimately have just converged on the same results at some point in our future that current advances are driving toward?

Or could it be that humankind made a mistake, and IT has created a psychological quagmire - a global solipsism - that the capability of spaceflight will be hard-pressed to break out of?  Would a civilization that had been spacefaring and pioneering the solar system for the past few decades have been more resistant to the distractions and lures of their eventual internet than this Earth-bound society has been?

Would it be more in contact with its humanity despite having left its home planet, or even *because* of that?  Would it be more firmly grounded in the physical and empirical, and thus more resistant to the delusions, totalitarian impulses, and unhinged conspiracy theories of today?  Would it be more confident in itself, and more cognizant of human value, when it could look at the stars and see infinite possibilities rather than a hollow and unreachable background mocking its own limitations?

Human expansion into the cosmos is urgently needed for the species to maintain its sanity and hope, but it would seem we are cutting it very close - the electronic illusions and possibly AI threats will chase us wherever we go now.  Could that have been avoided, and a firmer foundation established - a more rigorous humanity that would find the adventures all around it more attractive than fantasies and nightmares?

Introverted, but more intelligent and hardly able to feel anything other than themselves, INTPs are destined to lead the world to Singularity and all that.

There are a lot of people who don't like the world becoming emotionless, hard, tough and basically a loveless and feel-less society. I don't have a problem about that, since I don't really feel about anything other than myself, but I do agree that some people don't like the loss of emotion, love, etc.

However, I would rather see Civilization advancing than stagnate. 

An ideal world would be people (or , by that time, transhumans) operating like higher AI machines, with absolutely zero regard and consequences for their rational, direct albeit blunt, actions. We reach higher stages because there would be virtually no overhead.

I see a prison planet for the rest of pop, those who can't join the show. But that is just a small loss for reaching a higher stage of being and conquering space. 

Harry Harlow's monkey experiment did a lot of harm to the future as well. I would rather see children raised like we raise cattle or hogs, with those destined for higher things being treated differently (but with no emotions whatsoever, of course). 

Too many people of higher ability wasted their time because they could not control their emotions or thought about consequences.

The future will move like a huge ship, with only those who 'fit' in there, and the rest will be left behind. The future, and the higher stage of being which will come after it, will be led by those who can stomach the consequences (and deal with it, like Charles Trevelyan who solved the overpopulation problem of Ireland once for all and became a Baronet because of that, a title which still exists today). The faster , the better.

The future will look like a monastery, with the higher-status people wearing better clothes, eating better food and using better machines, but very few pleasure and very few stuff which makes things 'fun'. It is better that way, since more resources can be used to advance Civilization. No more playing games, I would say, and those who can adapt better in that situation will drive Civ better.",60,0

These are three tasks that are basically impossible under the current state of robotics, and will signal the arrival of the technology's maturity once achieved: 

1)  **Hitting a home-run from a pitch thrown by a human.**

An independently-mobile robot must approach the mound on its own, judging where to place itself.  It must grip a standard baseball bat, and then hit a home run from a pitch thrown by a skilled human pitcher intended to cause a strike.  Let's say it must repeat the performance enough, with different pitchers, to demonstrate basic proficiency - that the run wasn't a pure fluke.

2) **Safely, reliably operate an automobile designed to be operated by a human being.**

A general robotic system enters a car designed to be operated by a human driver - a car with no autonomous capability - and operates it safely and reliably in a variety of conditions over a significant length of time.

3)  **Giving an adequate haircut, in reasonable time, to a random customer based on common instructions.**

This is the hardest of the three tasks, because it involves aesthetic judgments rather than purely physical ones.  It must have very fine sensory processing that can approximate aesthetics in the human eye, and fine motions that can act precisely and efficiently on that data while working with something as complex and dynamic as hair.

A human sits down in a barber chair, gives common instructions, and receives a haircut to their satisfaction.  Repeat a few times to ensure there are no subtle shortcomings. ",0,5

If you think I'm mistaken and there must be corrections, tell me :)

*******

2020s

Deep Learning and other machine learning algorithms are actually quite simple. It's not hard to write them down into bizarre math but this simplicity negatively correlates with the ability of a human mind to understand what happens as a whole inside this kind of software. In the same way, we can't enumerate all the reasons why we love so much this guy/girl or why we like to play guitar solos. I mean, we can guess some reasons but the overall cognitive process remains a mystery for our ""limited Consciousness"". I guess there's a point there, maybe only the tip of the iceberg must be visible in order to be able to use such monstrous computing power representing our Subconscious. 

Today, science says that the cortex is composed of separated and statict modules made of hierarchized layers of neurons so connections can change between these modules (neuroplasticity). Sounds like sociology don't you think? The fact is that our unified experience is a sum of unchanging and very similar units interacting in a dynamic and adaptable way, but for sure more shit is happening there... 

This modules then form specialized regions able to do things like riding a bike or be an expert on something. What's the problem with this? Maybe it's not very obvious but, what if we can have the best possible specialized region able to everybody instead of having to rely on others brain regions (let me explain)? Today there are AI apps able to do in seconds what a human takes decades of work and some luck to be the best. Im talking about apps that can detect skin diseases or tumors in X-rays better than the best doctors in the world combined or to drive with 0 mistakes in a F1 race. What Im saying is, why should I rely on a single person instead of accessing the best one with less limitations? This is the true revolution: now theres no need for armies of humans trying to be available and good, with one single app we can do it the best way and make it ubicous. We are unifying expertise and learning in a few single entities.

But, why arent these apps available now? I like to think that with integrated circuits we achieved to mimic those brain modules but we were unable to link them in a dynamic and organic way. Now we have this three things: powerful AI GPUs, the Internet and Neural Algorithms. Sounds like the best context. Theres only one limitation: this [one](http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MooresLaw2.png). We need more Titan V chips, more silicon into the equation and, of course it must be a lot more cheap. Im not sure when, because I dont know how to do the maths (ask Nvidia, Intel, AMD) but Ill bet that by the end of the next decade, we will have a lot of this weak AI apps as services, products etc. A legal problem? Lets look for a good app Oh yeah, this one uses AI Is this contract legally valid?; A cop is saying me that I cant use my camera; My boss said me that. Answer:  Ok, Will, (I have used a giant AI server to read billions of cases, documents etc, Ive even read the full paper youre talking about, Ive compared it to others users cases and documents maintaining legal secret, Ive done all the stuff that requires 1 billion years to do by 1 billion best lawyers in just 6 seconds) This clause is invalid so you can cancell your relations with this agent. Best approach considering my database is to. I mean you get what I mean. OMG Im wrinting too much

So, by 2029 we will live in a world where specialized intelligence is the best possible, ubicous, cheap and fast as light (with AR glasses fuck yeah!). BUT, the sum of all these weak AI No! We cant link them in order to make a human mind! Or can we?

*****

2030s

Now, after all the shit youve read (sorry for that), Ill make my main point: we will achieve Super AI (ASI)/ god like AI before or at the same time we reach AGI (human level AI / General) and this is gonna happen in the 30s if, and only if, the same step of making posible dynamic communication between modules in order to create  expertise regions is made at a region level. How can we do this? I dont know but as I said in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7b1quc/the_10_years_cycle/), its very likely to neural links to be a thing. So, imagine a world where we have the best specific intelligent apps possible in the cloud and we can connect our mammal brains to them via brain wifi. Its very hard to imagine, I know, but Ill make a bet again.

I want to think that progress is congruent: things happen if the context allows it. So, I think ASI will be a thing at the same time we connect our brains to it. We will build this new God as a part of us, not a separated one, we will be this God and I cant wait for feeling that orgasm.

We should be able to calculate the optimal distance to hit a perfect global temperature. But of course, the real solution would be to actually fix the carbon cycle to an optimal value.

But even if we move to a post-human existence we might want to preserve natural flora and fauna as they're our cousins who helped us evolve into what we are today.

Would this work to prolong and preserve our World Heritage into atleast several millions years as the sun progressively gets hotter.

If you think it is not, how does it need to be reformed in its core, so it would be stable in itself and impossible to undermine through lobbyism and corruption?
How can populism, shortsightedness and extreme forms of nationalism get eliminated?

If you think democracy is too unstable, what could be the best alternatives? 
Can a different form of government preserve our human rights we cherish in democracies if we take away the right for everyone to vote? 
And how would it have to be set up so it can maximize utility for everyone long term and make sure the best ideas and policies win out?
Please dont use this thread to discuss about current US politics. 
Its also not supposed to be about individual laws, but about how such a government form would have to be set up from the ground.
Please share your ideas, you dont need to think too pragmatic for now. Think big!

Here's a short introduction:

NREL is one of 17 federally-funded national labs owned by the US Department of Energy (DOE). Along with universities, the national lab system is the foundation of basic scientific research in the US. The research spans uncovering the origins of the universe to curing cancer. Ostensibly, the NREL mission is the advancement of the science that underpins renewable energy technology.

This AMA is a consequence of a number of colleagues approaching me and saying, ""Hey, you're on the front page of Reddit!"" They were talking about this: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7gljhw/solar_powered_smart_windows_break_11_efficiency/

There were lots of comments and critiques. I'm here to give you HONEST responses to comments and critiques like those and answer any other questions about my work on solar windows, solar windows in general, the future of renewable energy, life as a scientist, etc. Anything is fair game, but I should get this out of the way: Any statement made here is my own, and does not represent NREL.

I got replies such as being a care taker, CEO, designing other robots, shrinks and stuff like that. But I think that perhaps some of these are possible.

A robot CEO would be similar to a ""sociopathic boss"", one who is devoid of emotions and acts only on the good of the company. I assume there could be an algorithm that weighs each persons productivity vs their profit and it could fire those that are inefficient. 

Maybe a sophisticated enough robot could be a shrink. You can compile a huge list of common emotional problem solvers and use that database as a means of problem solving. Maybe it can be similar to the game ""Akinator"" where it can ask you questions and it can derive a solution/cause of a problem.

Now a care giver robot is different. There are so many things that a child could do. Would it be possible to program a response to every scenario? 
I know there are already robots that can change their own code to improve itself, but could a robot, if given the access, fully program and construct a better version of itself? 

So im asking on how would a robot be able to relate to emotions and the unpredictably of humans? Would it be possible to program a robot to respond for every scenario? How does a program know its weaknesses and how to fix them?

Please explain, would robots be able to take over seemingly pure humane jobs?

That is right. 

the top 1%'s money, assets, etc are being used to support the rest.

During the days of Noah (who was the Jared Kushner of the day - his father-in-law Lamech was the most famous person on earth at that time) people were not being productive, and G-d (those who ran things) decided to start anew, with Noah and his family being the only survivors. Flood myths are everwhere; there must have been something like that long, long time ago.

With automation and high-tech weaponry, the reason to hire workers and draft soldiers have been largely eliminated. Humans are hard-to-please, get sick too often and could be treacherous. Machines are much less likely to do that, so they are preferred as servants, 'employees', etc. 

As time goes on and wealth discrepancy grows larger, the top 1% or so who will get access to the latest tech gains will be sick of supporting the rest, and will probably transition into something else, which could be called 'transhumans', enhanced electronically, genetically or both. The ""Homo Deus "" described by Yuval Harari. (ironically, the name Yuval comes from a son of the aforementioned Lamech)

The 1% (or, more accurately, the top 0.2% or so) is increasingly getting sick of living with the rest, and the day of eternal separation is being hastened every day. It can't be stopped or prevented; it should NOT be stopped and prevented. It is better to have a much less, but intelligent and competent, position who are much better equipped to the new Civ and conquer the space.

2. Pensions are going away and people are being moved to 401k's which leaves them vulnerable to market volatility (and, the  machinations of company contributions being made in company stock by default which leaves the employee with greater exposure to company health).
3. Meanwhile, politicians continue to slash away at funding for health, education, and it is rumored next year at the holy grail of ""retirement security"".  What????

There are a multitude of areas Id love to see flourish, but two in particular are biomedical engineering and bionics. 

Now the question becomes, how to contribute?

It would be fascinating to study bionics, but I dont have the money to return to school. I hold a BFA, which means I can contribute visual ideas and create media/interviews etc.

On the medical side, Ive been running protein folding software.

I recognize I dont have a STEM degree, but it doesnt feel right sitting on the side line while all these innovative companies like Googles Calico or Musks Neuralink are happening etc.

The consensus seems to be, vote for pro science/medicine politicians, earn to donate to areas you support, educate and inspire with the skills you have etc.

So, if/ when all the sources of energy used by us will be renewable, what will be it's immediate and long term effects? (Please consider the large scale of energy requird by humans). For example, in case of wind energy, redirecting it may affect rainfall of nearby areas. Similarly the solar energy is also supposed to do something when we are not using it for our needs.


If possible, please compare the following two scenarios:

A- When none of the renewable energy was redirected by humans (e.g. stone age).

B- When whole world will use renewable energy for their needs (e.g. whenever the world is able to achieve this goal).

Remember when Hayao Miyazaki called an AI-created animation ""an insult to life itself?""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngZ0K3lWKRc

The cold fact is that it's not going away. If anything, we're on the cusp of an era where AI-created media is dominant.
A recent story that I liked was:

[Nvidias new AI creates disturbingly convincing fake videos](https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/12/04/nvidias-new-ai-creates-disturbingly-convincing-fake-videos/)

Researchers from Nvidia have created an image translation AI that will almost certainly have you second-guessing everything you see online. The system can change day into night, winter into summer, and house cats into cheetahs with minimal training materials.

What they're doing with generative adversarial networks these days is _insane_. Watching them in action is the first time that I've felt jobs are at risk. I could imagine the possibility and talk of how future AI and robotics will lead to such an age, but until I discovered GANs, I never really had an idea for how it would happen. And the craziest thing is that, despite all the reassurances we've been giving ourselves about how robots will only do the jobs we don't want to and that the future will be filled with artists, it's the _creative_ jobs that might be going away first.   
  
If I could have the chance to coin a term, ""media synthesis"" sounds good. I mean it sounds _dystopian_, but there are amazing possibilities as well.  
  
There's a slew of news stories about media synthesis coming out in the past few days.

A year-old video talking about image synthesis:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAbhypxs1qQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAbhypxs1qQ)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOxxPcy5Gr4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOxxPcy5Gr4)  
  
  
These are not images that are plucked from Google via a text-to-image search. The computer is essentially ""imagining"" these things and people based on images it's seen before. Of course, it took thousands of hours with ridiculously strong GPUs to do it, but it's been done.  
  
Oh, and here's image translation.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4C1dB9UheQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4C1dB9UheQ)  
  
Once you realize that AI can democratize the creation of art and entertainment, the possibilities really do become endless for better and for worse. I choose to focus on the better.   
You see, I can't draw for shit. My level now isn't much better than a 9-year-old art student, and I've not bothered to practice to get any better because I just can't seem to overcome depth in drawings while my hand seems to not want to make any line look natural. Yet I've always imagined making a comic. I'm much more adept at writing and narrative, so if only I didn't have to worry about drawing you know, the part that defines comics as comics I'd be in the clear.  
  
GANs could help me do that. With an algorithm of that sort, I could generate stylized people who look hand drawn, setting them in different poses, *generating a panel in a variety of art styles*. It's not the same as one of those filters that takes a picture of a person and makes it look like a cartoon by adding vexel or cel-shading but actually generating an image of a person from scratch, but defying realistic proportions in lieu of cartoon/anime ones.  
  
Right now, I don't know how possible that is. But the crazy thing is that I don't think we'll be waiting long for such a thing.  
  
And it's certainly not the only aspect of media synthesis that's on the horizon.  

[WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/)

[Lyrebird claims it can recreate any voice using just one minute of sample audio](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/24/15406882/ai-voice-synthesis-copy-human-speech-lyrebird)

Want an epic, thought-provoking novel or poem but you have virtually no writing skills? There's an algorithm for that too. And if you're like me and you prefer to write your own novels/stories, then there's going to be an algorithm that edits it better than any professional and turns that steaming finger turd into a polished platinum trophy.  
 
And this is from 2016:

Need to create a world map for a story or video game? There's an algorithm for that.

[deepart.io - become a digital artist](https://deepart.io)

Related to what I mentioned before. Just doodle whatever, and the algorithm will take care of the rest.

[OpenAIs co-founder Greg Brockman thinks 2018 we will see perfect video synthesis from scratch and speech synthesis](https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-74-towards-artificial-general-intelligence-greg-brockman/). I don't think it'll be perfect, but definitely near perfect.  
  
All this acts as a base for the overarching trend: a major disruption in the entertainment industry. Algorithms can already generate fake celebrities, so how long before cover models are out of a job? We can create very realistic human voices and it's only going to get better; once we fine-tune intonation and timbres, voice actors could be out of a job too. The biggest bottleneck towards photorealism and physics-based realism in video games is time and money, because all those gold-plated pixels in the latest AAA game required thousands of dollars each. At some point, you reach diminishing returns based on time and money investment, so why not use algorithms to fill in that gap? If you have no skills at creating a video game, why not use an algorithm to design assets and backgrounds for you? If we get to a point where it's advanced enough, it could even code the damn game for you.  

I hold no delusions about the time frame very little of this is going to be on your computer within five years. You can use DeepDream and DeepArt and various DL voice synthesis programs, but it's all still very early in development. There will still be voice actors and animators in 2025. They'll still be fields you can get into and receive career payment. Comic and manga creators also won't be replaced anytime soon. If anything, it might take a bit longer for them precisely because of the nature of cartooning. Neural networks today are fantastic at repainting a pre-existing image or using an image it's seen before to create something new. But so far, it lacks the ability to actually stylize the image. There's no way to exaggerate features like you'd see in a cartoon. We know networks understand anime eyes, but they don't seem to be able to create an actual anime character based on images they've seen if you fed a computer 1,000 anime stills and then inputted your own portrait into it, it wouldn't give you huge eyes or unrealistically sharpened/cutened features it'd just recolor your portrait to make it toon-shaded. Likewise, I can't make my friend look like a character from the Simpsons with any algorithm that currently exists. He'd just have crayon-yellow skin and a flesh-colored snout but otherwise wouldn't actually have his skeletal or muscular structure altered to fit the Simpsons' distinctive style. 
No network today can do that. It might be possible within a couple years to at least get a GAN to approximate it, but it won't be until the mid-2020s at the earliest that we'll see ""filters"" that could change my portrait into an actual cartoon. As of right now, making an algorithm ""cartoonify"" a person simply means adding vector graphics or cel-shading.
 
Now that won't be a problem if you were to use text-to-image synthesis. You could phase out the middleman and go straight to generating new characters from scratch. And in 2018, I bet that we might see the first inklings of this in a very basic way. In a lab, we'll get a comic created entirely by algorithm. 
Input text describing a character if I had to come up with something, I'd make it simple and just go with ""round head with stick figure body"". 
Do the same thing for others. Describe the ways their limbs bend. If they have mouths, describe whether or not they're open. If there are speech bubbles, what do they look like and how big are they? Etc. etc.

Perhaps you could be more daring and feed a network thousands of images from a pre-chosen art style, but I'm being conservative. 
 
Right now, a neural network that can actually make narrative sense is a damn-near impossible thing to create. So if you want to achieve causality and progression in such a story, you'll still need a human to make sense of it. Thus, this comic will likely be organized by a human even if the images are entirely AI-generated. 

The ones that require static images, enhancing motion, or generating limited dynamic media will certainly take off. In ten years, I bet the entire manga industry in Japan will be crashing (the industry over there is so overworked that it wouldn't take much to cause a crash) and burning while American hold-outs cling bitterly onto canon-centric relevance while all the plebs generate every single disturbing plotline they could imagine with beloved characters.   
  
The early 2020s will be a time of human creativity enhanced by algorithms. A time where you can generate assets, design objects without requiring to hire anyone, and refine written content while still maintaining fully human control over the creative process. I can already see the first major YouTube animation with 1 million+ views that's mostly animated by a team with AI filling in a lot of the blanks to give it a more professional feel alongside generating the voices for the characters. Dunno when it'll happen, but it will happen very soon. Much sooner than a lot of people are comfortable with. But don't expect to type ""Make me a comic"" and expect to get a full-fledged story out of it. The AI will generate the content for you, but it's up to you to make sense of it and choose what you think works. So you have to generate each panel yourself, choosing the best ones, choosing good colors, and then you have to organize those panels. The AI won't do it for you because early '20s AI will likely still lack common sense and narrative-based logic.  
  
  
**TLDR: researchers are working on/refining algorithms that can generate media, including visual art, music, speech, and written content. In the early 2020s, content creators will be using this to bring to life professionally-done works with as small of teams as possible. It may be possible for a single person with no skills in art, voice acting, or music to put together a long-running comic with voice-acting and original music using only a computer program and their own skills at writing a story. This will likely be the first really major, really public example of automation takin' teh jerbs.**",0,11

Health care is very expensive, especially in America. Many people can't afford it. 

Supposedly a lot of companies are going to try to enter the market to change that. Amazon and Walmart are making inroads into health care. 

However, I don't know how much it'll matter. Isn't a big part of why health care is so expensive due to regulatory capture? meaning powerful industries have lobbied congress to pass laws preventing competition? If so, then you can't just create a way to provide health care for 70% less money and enter the market, because there are tons of regulations to make that impossible. 

Health care is very very labor heavy, and would benefit quite a bit from advances in automation. I know I, like most people, just google our symptoms. Some doctors get upset about this, but I've had multiple instances where I'd google my symptoms, then have a doctor just repeat what I already know. Medical diagnostics will hopefully get much better. 

But a big part is just treatment. Treatment is wildly overpriced. Surgery, scans, medications, etc. Can technology drive down the prices of these things in the near future? 

The system we have now is unsustainable. I'm hoping technology can vastly improve productivity and quality, while prices decline in the coming decades. But I worry due to regulatory capture, that that won't happen. What do other people think? 

Some people think that all this automation and AI will make us healthier, which will reduce costs. But unless they also stop the aging process, that isn't true. Leading a healthier life doesn't reduce overall costs because life expectancy goes up. So having tons of sensors that makes it easier to manage diabetes or prevent heart attacks in your 50s sounds like it'll save money, but it won't because that just means instead of dying at 77 from diabetes, you die at age 91 from Alzheimers. 

In the long term future, when aging is cured, then health care costs will drop (most health problems are fundamentally problems of aging. The average 21 year old spends $1500 a year on health care. The average 91 year old spends $20,000 a year on health care (these are older numbers, probably much higher now). ",61,42

The idea of an exponentially advancing AI that we could merge ourselves with or even just get advancements from, or VR technology that will one day create a reality indistinguishable from ours and our species will recede into this world where we'll live as Gods or be inundated with pure pleasure, terrifies me. I'm down for immortality and technological progress, but to think that the experiences of love, family, failure, etc, could all be erased doesn't strike me as something I'd want.

And that's why I called this post Amish 2.0. I see myself more and more making a commitment to forego the aforementioned, or similar, technologies. And I'd probably recommend, even beg, my friends and family to do the same. 

So I guess my question is: what thoughts have all of you had in regards to this? Are you excited for these eventualities, impartial to them, or downright terrified like I am?

He always argues that when given the money to have all of your basic needs met, most people will cease to pursue anything and without a purpose will live sad, unfulfilled lives. I had a ""foot in my mouth"" moment when I was telling him about how one of my friends has been given the opportunity to  get into a situation where he didn't have to pay rent, living in a guys basement so he could ""finally focus on music full time"". I told my friend that that was a bad idea because without a tangible goal to reach of paying rent monthly he was going to let time slip away and not actually work towards it. When I told this to my dad he called me out and said ""that is my exact argument against UBI!""

My question for you more science aware people
- is there any other solution offered if we reach a jobless society other than UBI?

- do people who support UBI have a good argument against this?

The Future is an extinction event for most of humans, as I have described a few times. The elites and the civilization-drivers do not see a reason to prop them up anymore, and would rather not see them and there will be faithful enforcers who make sure to get it done, like Baronet Charles Trevelyan whose genocide of the Irish made him a Peer and his grandson, the illustrious historian G W Trevelyan, did not find a word to describe what his grandpa had done. (He wrote lots of history books, but not one sentence about his grandpa's achievement.)

The dead is forgotten, and the alive advances to the stars.

I do not treat the servers and the minimum wage people well, since there is no reason for me to do so. Such attitude will be the norm in the future. Right now discrimination laws still exist so one can only push the envelope so far. In the future, the tech darlings will be able to whatever they feel like to the underlings.

I wrote about the Global Enclosure. Sooner or later, there will be no place for those who can't fit in the tech world to go. Their fate will be similar to that of the Tasmanians.

It is evolution - can't be helped or avoided.

Social skills will die; automation will replace the need to deal with people, especially with those with less ability.

The wealth of today's winners will grow forever, period. It is like a perpetual machine.

Josiah Willard Gibbs, Jr. should be exhumed from his tomb near Yale (he never married and willed everything to the university where he was born and died), and blasted off, because his theory of thermodynamics limited human reach for many years.

With AGI and space conquest, human reach will grow virtually forever, and today's winners' wealth will grow forever as well.

Right now, there is no trillionaire. But 200 years ago, Fitzwilliam Darcy was considered a very rich person with an annual income of just 10,000 pounds (about 5 million pounds in today's money, respectable but not that super-rich). Alexander Stewart, USA's first department store king who died in 1876, had maybe $50 million but at the time of his death was richer than Rockefeller.

Their wealth will be just a laughable matter as we near AGI and space conquest.

In the future, wealth of today's tech lords will be measured in , literally, googols (10^100). Of course those receiving fixed incomes would have been long died out by then. Those who were wise enough to buy the tech giants' stocks earlier would be well off; those who didn't, probably not, and long written off from the evolutionary chain.

Main reasons include:

- Struggling economy (Russian GDP now ranked 12th in the world - just ahead of Australia)
- Low oil prices (coincides with above. Prices have recovered somewhat since 2014 but Russia still bleeding money)
- Declining population (has remained roughly stagnant since 1990, predicted to decrease from 145 to 120 million by 2050)
- Changing demographics (Muslims in particular make up 10% of population - predicted to be 30%+ by 2050)
- Breakaway regions (22 of Russia's provinces/territories are semi-autonomous 'Republics' home to various ethnic minorities, many of which may choose to break away if given half a chance)
- Outside pressure/sanctions (mostly from the west after 2014 seizure of Crimea. More worrying are rapidly developing Asian nations, especially China, hungrily eyeing Siberia's vast resources with a very long border to defend)

We also know Russia has a history of sudden collapses (1917, 1991) which weren't necessarily predicted in advance. So the scenario, if it happens again, could look like this. We'll set it in 2025 right after Vladimir Putin dies aged 73:

2025, July  After a lull of some years, tensions flare in Chechnya and several surrounding Muslim Russian Republics in the Caucasus region. With Putins death, mass protests begin, overwhelming local law enforcement. Initially some ten thousand troops are sent to the region, but this number quickly swells, growing to some 50,000 within a matter of weeks, with nearly daily reports of violence in the 'Third Chechen War'

2025, August  with Russia distracted by internal problems, Ukraine seizes its chance to regain the breakaway regions in Donbass, the conflict having been largely frozen since 2014. Ukrainian troops move into Donbass, surprising the local forces, and suffer only a few score casualties. To the disappointment of the local rebels, help is not forthcoming from Russia, already struggling with the crisis in the Caucasus

Emboldened by their success, Ukrainian forces begin massing near Crimea, with tacit approval from NATO (who have no issue with Crimea falling back into Ukrainian hands). Local commanders seek orders from Moscow, but the new government is ambivalent over the sending of costly reinforcements. Poorly paid and equipped due to Russias weak economy, local forces begin surrendering en masse upon the approach of Ukrainian troops. Within three days Sevastopol has capitulated. Crimea too is back in Ukrainian hands with minimal casualties

2025, September  News of the sudden fall of Crimea reverberates around the world, particularly within the Russian federation itself. With Putin gone and the new administration seemingly lacking the resolve or means to defend Russias integrity, opportunists both within and beyond its borders begin to take action 

Of Russias 21 semi-autonomous Republics more than half see immediate protests, with at least some local politicians calling for independence. Several other cities and regions with large ethnic minorities follow suit. By the end of the month, more than a dozen different rebellions of one sort or another are in motion. Like the Warsaw Pact countries in 1989 or the Arab World in 2011, much of Russia is in anarchy

Late 2025-early 2026  Finally realizing the extent of the crisis, the central government in Moscow begins marshaling what forces it has available. Complicated by the onset of winter, large forces are mobilized and distributed to put down local rebellions. The largest concentration of troops (now over 200,000) are sent down to the Caucasus to bring the local Muslim Republics to heel. 

Several divisions worth are sent to the region between the Volga and southern Urals where several more republics, particularly Tartarstan and Bashkortosan, have proclaimed independence. Meanwhile in Siberia, isolated garrisons find themselves playing whac-a-mole with local protesters. Towns will be secured and pacified only to declare their autonomy or independence again as soon as the army withdraws. Maintaining control of the countryside becomes increasingly difficult, especially as the weather worsens. In several places the trans-Siberian railway is cut by separatist rebels

2026, February  Rapidly losing faith in the integrity (and overall purpose) of the Moscow government, a meeting of Siberian government and separatist leaders is called in Krasnoyarsk (the third largest Russian city east of the Urals). Representatives from four different republics, six Krais, two oblasts and three autonomous okrugs (altogether representing more than half of Siberias 40 million people) meet to seriously discuss the idea of independence

Many participants are ambivalent, however on day three of the conference a brigade of Russian army forces arrives in the city and attacks the regional parliament building. Local police and militia return fire. Some of the local officials are arrested while the rest flee to another meeting place. The crackdown only exacerbates tensions. 

Two days later local officials declare the independence of a new Republic of Siberia. Protest marches are held in most major cities east of the Urals and thousands of volunteers assemble, now determined to fight for the new state. Outnumbered and at the end of a long supply chain, the Russian Army unit soon withdraws, but the fighting has only just begun

2026, March  More than 100,000 mostly Muslim protesters march in Moscow, the protest soon turning into a riot. Only by deploying tanks are Russian authorities able to disperse the crowd, causing hundreds of casualties. Many around the world condemn this event as Russias Tiananmen Square, seriously damaging the credibility of the Russian government at home and abroad. The Islamic insurgency in the Caucasus rapidly spreads to the rest of European Russia, bolstered by the arrival of thousands of foreign fighters (as in Syria a decade earlier) with near-weekly bombings in major Russian cities

2026, May  Amid growing violence, the Russian president (Putins successor) resigns. Dozens of members of the state duma have already done so. A new president is installed, but is considered by many a mere puppet of the military. With the State Duma sidelined, Russia is effectively under martial law. Despite fresh crackdowns, the new regime is rapidly losing authority beyond the major cities west of the Urals. Loyalist Russian forces begin a siege of Kazan, capital of Tartarstan

Mid-2026  fighting intensifies for the major cities of western Siberia, which produces most of Russias oil and gas. By this point the rebel Republic of Siberia, despite some schisms, has largely coalesced around the Krasnoyarsk declaration and controls most territory west of Novosibirsk. Several nuclear bases have been captured intact, giving the nascent Republic the world's third largest nuclear arsenal, much to the worry of foreign diplomats, though Siberian officials promise there will be 'no offensive use of nuclear arms'. Vladivostok, home to Russias Pacific Fleet and a large garrison, so far remains loyal. 

2026, June  Local governments in the historic 'West Karelia' region, along the Finnish border north of St. Petersburg, organize an independence referendum. It passes with more than 90% in favor of breaking away from Russia. The next month, the newly independent state invites Finnish forces in to maintain law and order. Cautiously, several thousand Finnish troops enter the region. By this point, the Russian government is in no position to object. Another referendum occurs in August 2026, when the region is incorporated into Finland proper. The nearby Republic of Karelia (or 'East Karelia') considers a similar move

2026, July  Announcing their response to requests by local politicians, Romania announces an act of union with Moldova. Romanian troops enter the country the next day, encountering almost no resistance. Two months later a referendum is held. A majority (though not overwhelming) of 62% of the population votes in favor of union with Romania. However, in the breakaway region of Transnistria there is some resistance. Many there boycott the subsequent referendum. A local insurgency persists for some years afterward 

2026, July  In the far east, Russian military garrisons in the Kuril islands (subject to a dispute with Japan) have been greatly downsized in recent years, leaving the islands almost unoccupied. Seeing the carving up of the Russian state ongoing elsewhere, the Japanese commence an operation to quickly retake the islands. Simultaneous amphibious landings encounter little resistance. The few Russian troops that remain quickly surrender. Most of the populated islands fall in a day without a shot being fired.

The Japanese move causes tensions with its neighbors. China and Russia both protest at the UN, though Japan has the tacit support of the US, which blocks a resolution calling for a Japanese withdrawal on the justification that the ongoing disintegration of the Russian Federation shows that it could not maintain control of the islands in question in any case

2026, August  In perhaps the boldest move so far, Poland (with the tacit backing of NATO and the US) announces its intention to intervene with a peacekeeping mission to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea (curiously, there were no previous reports of violence in the oblast). Having gained the quiet support of the local authorities beforehand (who no longer believe any support is coming from Moscow) the oblast is occupied in two days with barely a shot fired. Some criticism comes from those who see the Poles as selfish opportunists taking advantage of a neighbor's weakness, but these are ignored. Notably, Kaliningrad contains a Soviet nuclear storage site at the Kolosovka naval base. The Poles quietly invite US authorities to remove and dispose of the nukes. This draws a sharp protest from Moscow, but no further action is taken

2026, August  After a year of fighting, total casualties from the ongoing Russian Civil War top half a million

2026, September  seeing that its forces are more needed elsewhere, the bulk of the Loyalist Russian army withdraws from the Caucasus, where six different Islamic Republics have attempted to declare their independence after more than a year of fighting. Local insurgents celebrate their victory, however tensions quickly flare over the exact borders of the new states. The Russian army withdraws to a line approximately between Volgograd, Rostov-on-Don and Astrakhan. In what is seen as an attempt to be patriotic, the military authorities rename the city back to Stalingrad and emphasize its heroic struggle against the Fascist invaders in WW2

2026, September  Japan makes an offer to buy back the oil and gas-rich island of Sakhalin from Russia for $200 billion US (five times the islands annual GDP). The offer is, for the time being, ignored

2026, October - With the bulk of the Russian Army gone, Georgia re-occupies the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, meeting only sporadic resistance. With the Caucasus region still in turmoil, a buildup of US troops occurs in Georgia, as well as nearby Turkey and Poland. Talk grows of a larger intervention into European Russia, mostly to secure the country's vast nuclear arsenal

2026, October - Republic of Siberia forces besiege Novosibirsk, the largest Russian city east of the Urals. Moscow's dwindling authority is increasingly constrained to just European Russia

2026, December - Worst fears are confirmed when CIA intelligence indicates a detachment of troops from the Novorossiysk Naval Base on the Black Sea have defected to a local Islamist group. Rebel forces storm the base and occupy the city, several dozen nuclear weapons falling into their hands in the process

NATO takes prompt action. A no-fly zone is declared around the city and a blockade is quickly instituted by sea. After rapid preparations, advance elements of the 101st Airborne are inserted by helicopter. Within days some 30,000 US troops surround the city

Bitter street fighting begins amid a desperate hunt for the loose nukes. Within two weeks the city has been retaken, though with much of it destroyed in the process. Most of the stolen arsenal is accounted for, but between four and six nukes are still believed missing. Further troop deployments begin across the Caucasus with the goal of restoring order. US forces are bolstered by troops from Georgia, Turkey, the UK and Poland

2027, February - In the aftermath of the 'Novorossiysk Crisis', a joint US-Japan task force (led by the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit) lands at several sites along the Russian Pacific coast, including at Fokino, Vladivostok, Mongokhto and Vilyuchinsk, to secure further Russian nuclear stockpiles

Strong objections come from the Republic of Siberia and China. The latter begins mobilizing its army along the Manchurian border for a possible intervention. Most of the Russian bases quickly surrender, though sporadic and confused fighting occurs inland as local Siberian troops (many of which had been besieging or harassing the bases) respond to the US/Japanese incursion. The US government promises to withdraw once all nuclear stockpiles have been neutralized. Intense diplomacy follows between Washington, Tokyo and Beijing over Siberia's future

2027, March - Kazan falls to Russian forces after a ten-month siege that has left tens of thousands dead and hundreds of thousands homeless. Reinforcements are sent east to relieve Novosibirsk

2027, April - Facing a resurgent Russian army to its west, US/Japanese intervention to its east and a mobilizing China to its South, the Siberian Republic sets off a single nuke at a remote site 500km north of Lake Baikal, in an apparent show of force and as a warning to foreign forces to withdraw from its claimed territories, which is nearly all of Russia east of the Urals. China offers to mediate between Moscow and Krasnoyarsk 

2027, April - Tensions further skyrocket when, without warning, a nuclear explosion destroys the city of 'Stalingrad', killing nearly half a million people, including over 20,000 loyalist Russian soldiers. The perpetrators are breakaway Islamists from the Caucasus region

For a time the world seems to stand on the nuclear brink. Now seeking to support Russia before the situation can deteriorate further, NATO expands its commitment in the Caucasus, which soon sees nearly 250,000 troops deployed between the Black and Caspian Seas to maintain order and hunt for any remaining loose nukes. With the threat of nuclear escalation, fighting between Loyalist Russian and Rebel Siberian troops largely halts amidst intense diplomatic pressure. Representatives from Moscow and Krasnoyarsk are invited to a summit in Vienna

2027, June - With negotiations ongoing, Russia accepts the Japanese offer to purchase Sakhalin, at the revised price of $400 billion, angering both Siberia and China

2027, June - Seeking to improve its position, Chinese forces launch a sudden offensive across the Amur River, meeting only sporadic resistance. Moving inland (so as to avoid the US and Japanese garrisons along the coast) within a week the Chinese have reoccupied the bulk of 'Outer Manchuria' which was ceded to Russia by the 1858 Treaty of Aigun and 1860 Treaty of Peaking, two of the 'unequal treaties' which China seeks to reverse.

Despite threats of nuclear retaliation by Krasnoyarsk, these fail to materialize. China's gamble pays off, gaining it half a million square kilometers of territory. Behind the scenes, Beijing promises hundreds of billions in favorable investments to the new Republic. The Krasnoyarsk government realizes it has little chance of thriving without a foreign sponsor. It eventually accepts its role as essentially a giant client state of the Chinese. Chinese immigration increases markedly in the coming years

2027, August - Following the two year-long civil war, in which some two million people have died, the 'Treaty of Vienna' sees the new Republic of Siberia recognized, though with only about 80% of its intended territory amid the Japanese and Chinese land grabs and the resistance of Russian Loyalist forces still holding Novosibirsk and other cities further west. The remaining territory of the Moscow government, reformed as the 'Russian Union', is also outlined, recognizing the grabs made by Ukraine, Finland and Poland as well as Moldova's unification with Romania. Map here - https://imgur.com/a/Iu3eu

2027, Aftermath - US/Japanese forces soon withdraw from the Pacific Region, most of which is now in Chinese hands, and recognize the latter's control while Japan begins incorporating Sakhalin. NATO forces in the Caucasus gradually withdraw, handing full control of the region back to Russia from 2030 once all stolen nuclear material has been accounted for

There are tasks that any humans (even stupid ones) can do easily, like opening door knobs, unplugging a power cord, turning off a light switch, fetching things (like, ""Get some water from the refrigerator!""), or recognising that a person is experiencing a heart attack or lying down unconsciously. Almost any humans can easily use an automatic defibrillator after a few minutes of training.

If robots which can do such things become available at relatively affordable price (more or less the price of a car now), it could save thousands of lives (old people who live alone and need defibrillation) or make people's life better (people who have disabilities or just are lazy).

This year, ""smart"" assistants like Google Home and Amazon Echo have gained popularity. But they cannot move. Probably the next big thing is a moving assistant... like a robot that can do things I have described above. Will such robots ever be available within 30 years?",10,12

Some of humans' friends, like dogs and cats, will survive, although how to take them to the space will be a problem. Perhaps, like Scraps in the movie Corpse Bride with animated skeletons, dog bones could be somehow animated and follow their masters to the promised land.

Economic growth means more growth, and the nature and the natives will be victims. That is the historical imperative and can't be compromised.

I think that it is futile to try to conserve species. Singularity will make coexisting with the nature moot, since AI does NOT need nature to exist.

I am not worried about global warming, etc as well. Again, Singularity means mankind , or whatever comes after it, is freed from the restrictions imposed by the environment.

The last wood in the Amazons will be cut, the last rare animal will be hunted, and zoos, because today's people will have no time for the rare animals, will close and their rare animals sold to Chinese investors looking for rare meats.

One consolation is that cockroaches and other pests also won't make it in a world without nature.

Entering Singularity is no trivial thing. It is like , well, abandoning all moral and physical values, and nature will be one of its victims. We could create virtual and better nature where the predators have been blotted out, and something which we could destroy in a a nanosecond if we don't like it anymore.

And if the day does come when they are able to make decisions themselves based on their conscience, they still have to be influenced by humans in the beginning either directly or by observation/analyzation of events (similar to the process of kids developing their own conscience).

Here is what Disney currently owns (incl. partial ownership)

&gt;Vice Media,
&gt;Pixar,
&gt;Fox,
&gt;Lucasfilm,
&gt;Marvel,
&gt;ABC,
&gt;ESPN,
&gt;Lifetime,
&gt;History Channel,
&gt;Maker Studios,
&gt;HULU.

Now the franchises:

&gt;The Simpsons,
&gt;Family Guy,
&gt;MCU,
&gt;Star Wars,
&gt;X-Men,
&gt;Aliens,
&gt;Avatar.

There's obviously more. But the post would become too long. 

Disney in 2017 have a market share of 21% of Hollywood's box office. With the Fox merger, their 2017 share totals 33%. 

I'm just throwing this out there because I'm currently writing a sci-fi film that depicts a relatively neutral portrayal of megacorporations. 

What are the possibilities of a Disney state or Disney-run city with their own laws/government in years to come? 

Imagine Disney World branches out into an actual recognised jurisdiction.

Jobs such as telemarketing, loan officer(ing?), cashiering and other repetitive jobs are at the top list for being replaced by automation and other jobs are soon to follow. But that's not all, during the Industrial revolution where many workers became redundant, people could simply attest to the fact that, sure machines were cheaper and powerful than people but they weren't as smart, however, that isn't the case anymore. Modern day self-learning programs have shown themselves to be both more creative and intelligent than their human equivalents. 

Though I can't exactly remember the name, there was one self-learning program taught itself piano music in the style of Bach and when it played in-front of an audience (though not revealing himself), the audience members would openly commend the pianist for his authentic interpretation of Bach. It was not until the programmer himself revealed that it was just a program that people were taken aback, sure that the program was a real and intelligent pianist. The purpose of this story is prove to you that modern day technology allows for AIs to imitate humans even better than themselves, that things such as creativity and intelligence and even personality is something that can be conformed down into a series of algorithms that an AI interprets and carries out. What this means then is that AI has a one track path to replace the role of people, almost completely, whether it be jobs up till know or the future. The only jobs I could imagine remaining would be coders (which by nature aren't that many) and mediators between technology and user so that technology (until otherwise) doesn't deprive the user of a social connection.

And so that leaves the elephant in the room. What happens when a world of billions find themselves to be without a job and therefore redundant, as well as broke. Well no one quite knows for sure and people can only speculate but for certain the global market economy will be hit hard by this and it would need to adapt somehow, for how can people buy goods without any money?

Well first and foremost, the costs of most goods and services will become significantly cheaper due to the increased efficiency provided by intelligent AI and other factors such as cheaper renewable energy. As a result the overall living costs decrease by a significant margin but of course people still wouldn't have any money. This is where I believe global or at the very least national basic income comes into play. This would sustain people and the government could also introduce additional schemes for the benefit of the individual's benefit. As funny and comedic as it may seem, things like playing video games or socialising might actually become one of these schemes, since in a world where our primary role as an individual has been replaced what else is there to do? But that's just my opinion and I'm more than open to any criticism you may have.",5,6

I think that the demand of the people will not be able to see our jobs and social services be in the hands of AI but all of major decisions, and will be a part of the governmental role in the future. Decisions won't be in the hands of corrupt or greedy politicians, they will be obsolete.
How will our taxes be distributed, major decisions like health care, infrastructure, social service, police, fire department, army, schools, and all that is under the governments hat. Think about all the funding that goes into elections, and the diplomatic system. Think about all the funding that goes into lobbying... no people to be on the government payroll. No person to receive a dollar to be a diplomat, congressman/woman, politician, or even president. AI will make and take all decisions. What is needed, what can be cut, and what is in demand. This is the future. I will elect AI in the future. AI is the future.

Soon the isles of Puerto Rico and Cuba were taken, making the European presence in ""New World"" permanent. It took about 10 years to make it self-sufficient.

Jamestown in Virginia, which I visited some time ago, was established in 1607 and was declared permanent in 1616. 9 years from founding to self sufficiency.

And, that was the time before computers, simulations and instant communication when it took 6-8 weeks for a ship from England to reach North America.

A potential settlement area will be analyzed, simulated and modeled long before the actual settlement, and with today's computing power it won't take too long to finish the process.

Once a viable settlement can be built, it's the end for earth-bound critters, including cockroaches, poison ivy or humans who lack the capacity to be useful in the New Civilization.

I think that as the examples above showed, it will take about 10 years to finish up a settlement in a new place, so as soon as we finish up the process of getting there we will make it.

If every effort is used  to establish a settlement in the space, i think we can ge there in 5 years, so by 2022 we would have a permanent space presence. It won't be good news for whatever inhabitants in that place, but hey, that's the way it is.",41,0
