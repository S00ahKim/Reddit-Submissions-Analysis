2,2015-4-1,2015,4,1,10,30zyl6,Let's end the self-driving car debate once and for all.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/30zyl6/lets_end_the_selfdriving_car_debate_once_and_for/,funky_bandersnatch,1427851175,"TL;DR Autonomous cars will be ubiquitous within 40 years because they'll be cheaper than the cost of car ownership. As more people switch to autonomous cars, it will create a cultural trend which will designate large sections of cities as ""autonomous vehicle only"".

Let me be the first to say that I love a well built car. I used to dream of one day owning a ""sleeper"" Subaru WRX. I'd flip through tuner mags with Tein and Greddy ads. Id argue passionately about which sports bike was the best, and eventually purchased a 2006 GSXR 1000. I'm sure we all have our favorite driving movie, and maybe even a favorite movie car, (Eleanor anybody?) But even so, I predict that within 40 years, pretty much every car on the road will have self-driving capability, and in the most densely packed cities, states and roads it may be illegal to drive. 

There seems to be a lot of passion when discussing the idea of making it illegal to drive a car, so lets start with things we all possibly agree upon.

 There is an enormous market for self-driving vehicles. Walmart wants self-driving vehicles because they have one of the largest vehicle fleets in the nation. Self-driving trucks will be more efficient, and cheaper (no driver to pay). I also imagine that FedEx and UPS are also interested. Google wants self-driving cars so that the people inside them can spend less time driving and more time googling. Uber wants self-driving cars because in a city like NY (my current residence) a self driving taxi is cheaper and therefore more competitive than one with a driver. 

#2 unemployed drivers will do nothing to slow the adaptation of self-driving vehicles. This is self-evident. Unions don't have the strength they once did, and the companies interested in transitioning to self driving vehicles are too powerful anyways. Drivers won't have any arguments to make for themselves either. They couldn't say they are better trained, or safer, or faster, or more efficient. The one argument they'll be able to make is the ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, but those times are few and far between, and also I'm sure any autonomous car manufacturer is preparing their machines for those arguments already. They will probably have a TON of real world experience data available to show just how capable the machines are by the time they ask a Walmart to write a check. 

Okay, now on to speculation.
 
#3 people want self-driving cars! parents and especially MADD would support self driving cars. A self driving car can take a child to school. A self driving car can save a disinterested teenager too busy snap chatting to pay attention. A young adult won't have to drink and drive, or leave their car and risk it being towed. A fatigued driver can get some much needed rest. I would like self driving cars because then taxis would be cheaper, transit would be faster, and roadways would be emptier, creating more recreational space. I also hope to be able to purchase a self driving car for my father, because his reaction time has noticeably degraded, and when presented with the question of whether to trust his life in his own hands, or a google engineered and thoroughly tested machine, I'll admit that in a few years I would rather google take the wheel. 

#4 to the less able bodied, a self driving car represents freedom!! The blind, deaf, paralyzed, paraplegics, etc, not to mention tens of millions of elderly, and just those that plain don't like to drive are all going to consider a self-driving car a god send! 

#5 perhaps most importantly, even though there will be instances where people would prefer to drive themselves, nearly everyone will want the option of a self driving mode. 

With the above understood, an important question to ask is whether any industries would be against self-driving vehicles, and what the government would do. Major auto manufacturers are definitely moving towards self driving, and it only makes business sense for major shipping companies to support it as well. So besides truck drivers and chauffeurs, who stands to lose from a self driving car? And what of the government? Will they make smart cars a requirement? The EU is already going to require cars to notify emergency services in an accident. Maybe soon enough accident avoidance will be a requirement as well. Even if the government doesn't force autonomous vehicles on people, it's a sure bet that it will not oppose self driving. 

What the above tells me is that there is a clear trend towards cars that can drive themselves, but which cars actually will drive themselves? Its safe to say that rural america has little need for a self driving car, and not very many companies are going to compete there. But here in NYC there is a thriving taxi industry, and uber has already stated that it intends on bringing autonomous taxis to market in NYC. Autonomous taxis would undoubtedly lead to autonomous car rentals. But how do we escape those markets and get the majority of consumers to welcome the idea of autonomous cars? To the consumer the choice between an autonomous car, and a human driven car comes down to four factors: safety, cost, convenience, and passion. The die hard driving enthusiasts won't be persuaded for any reason so there's nothing to discuss there. As for safety, it is to be mandated in self-driving vehicles, so for the purposes of determining conversion rates, I'll call it a non factor. People will need to be convinced that self-driving cars will be cheaper, and more convenient.

Convenience is actually easier than it seems at first glance. All a self-driving car has to do is show up when you want it to. Aside from that, it only needs to provide an experience as well as a human-driven car would, which is easy to do. Our current driving and traffic habits are as unorganized and inefficient as it gets. Networked cars would only make things faster and simpler. In this case, the only inconvenience would be that you have to take all of your belongings with you when you exit the car.

Here's where lobbying comes into play. For self-driving cars to navigate traffic more efficiently than a person, there will need to be a communication standard in place between cars. I figure this standard will be supported by technophiles, google, uber, and shipping companies, but opposed by major car manufacturers, however, in the interest of safety, I believe the government will put a standard into place, and then cars will be able to network and drive closer together at higher speeds. I predict there will also be a lobbying effort to create self-driving vehicle only lanes, but this may be less palatable to legislators.

finally, in regards to costs, I predict uber will offer self-driving cars at LOW - cheaper than the cost of gas - prices. They can start an ad campaign for people that commute to work, by making the commute easier and cheaper through car pooling, etc. I think this will be like an Amazon business model, operate at razor thin margins, and even a loss, to grow the market share.

It's easy to see uber taking over the taxi market in congested cities. It's easy to see uber taking over the car rental market, and disability assistance. Slightly more difficult, yet very manageable will be the commuters from suburban towns into big cities. I believe local governments would help, because less traffic is less pollution, less death, and higher quality of life all initiatives supported by the large progressive cities that house so much of the population. This is where cost management becomes critical, because to continue growing, uber will need to capture families with children. At this point the cars will need to be electric, and the energy renewable, but if this happens, the costs of rental will be so rock bottom cheap, that the idea of paying money to own and maintain a vehicle will seem foolish. And if uber can capture families with children in large markets, then it will represent a true culture shift, which combined with the heavy business lobby to create self-driving only lanes and roadways, will create a networked traffic infrastructure, that doesnt want ""dummy"" human drivers messing it up for the rest of them.

So why 40 years? 10 years for the technology to get there, 10 years to convince the consumers, and another 20 years for people to get rid of their non-autonomous cars. I figure in 25 years, governments will be creating self-driving only lanes.

Or am I wrong?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/31096g/one_of_the_biggest_problems_with_futurology_and/,[deleted],1427856118,"One of my favorite shows on TV is Shark Tank on ABC, but it is also frustrating. The show is meant to celebrate entrepreneurism as ""the great equalizer,"" where anyone can become rich if they offer some kind of value to the rest of the world. Technically, that does happen - what is frustrating is that only a tiny fraction of pitches actually feature legitimately clever innovations. The rest of them are a mixture of new packaged foods, clothing lines, knick-knacks, web/mobile applications, etc.

Obviously, the reason people try to start these businesses is primarily because it is all they can do. &gt;98% of Americans don't have the resources, knowledge, or abilities to actually produce real innovation (e.g. a new battery design with greater energy density). The entire scientific frontier has become exclusive to research programs in universities and large corporations, where the science is only getting more complex and harder for people to understand.

Considering that at least 50% of PhD candidates are now foreign born and many high-skill workers here on H-1B visas, it is apparent that increasingly fewer Americans are interested in research careers. It would seem that the world's hope for moving into the future is falling on the shoulders of a smaller and smaller group of people (many of whom are relatively disinterested in creating commercially viable technologies). Does this concern anyone else?

*Update*

I guess the point I am trying to make is that, while I find futurology interesting, I also feel silly just assuming that so many advancements are eventually going to happen (regardless of how much time passes), considering the current state of innovation. Private businesses do great things, but they still have to invest their funds into projects that seem feasible, and the safer investments are typically tiny incremental advancements. Universities and publicly funded groups also do great things, but so much of their work is just trial and error, trying to find new possibilities for breakthroughs - very few people have the patience to spend even forty hours per week in a lab, doing tedious and repetitive work, 95% of which effectively fails.

The reason I mention Shark Tank is to put the whole thing in perspective. A lot of the entrepreneurs are common slobs who latch onto the dream of being wealthy and are excited about it, so they do not even realize they are working 80+ hours every week. That is a more appealing and natural route, but it doesn't seem to work with trial-and-error research. 

I always wonder if it would do any good for an organization like the X-Prize Foundation to step up and try to offer more leadership to the research community: the publicly-funded groups need to have a more open and easier system for sharing all their results and clarifying the unsolved challenges - digging through journal articles is so boring.

Much of the ocean is far less biologically productive than it could be, as well as being over-fished.  People talk about ocean fertilization for CO2 removal.  I think we'll do it in conjunction with monoculture food production.  We'll grow starter algae under controlled conditions, and seed fertilized areas of ocean with it, followed by the eggs or larvae of our favorite zooplankton, and fry of fish that eat it.  We'll breed them to be resistant to pesticides, and use pesticides to ensure that nothing we don't like to eat is eating our open-water-farmed species.",3,2

27,2015-4-1,2015,4,1,20,311nso,The future of translation is here - A first-hand ~~wall of text~~ account,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/311nso/the_future_of_translation_is_here_a_firsthand/,larry_b,1427889238,"Hi, /r/Futurology.

I've been a professional translator for about 9 years and the last 5 have been full of change for myself and all my colleagues. I thought I'd give you a quick summary of the situation.

First of all, as a (text) translator there are two types of client: direct client and agencies. A direct client would be a person or company that gets in touch directly with me, we negotiate a price, I translate what they need, and they pay me. An agency, and we'll be focusing on them, is a company that externalizes their work to a bunch of freelance translators. They usually have the biggest clients (think Fortune 500) because it's a more efficient solution. As an example, Google doesn't need to get in touch with thousands of individual translators; instead, they get in touch with agency X, and it's agency X who e-mails a thousand translators saying ""we have this job, are you interested?""

Agencies pay less than direct clients and there's usually no room for negotiations. Where you can charge a direct client $0.05 per word, an agency will usually pay you $0.025 per word in a translation and $0.006 per word in an editing job. And that's where the future comes in.

In the world, there are two major translation agencies: Lionbridge and SDL International. I've worked for both as a translator, reviewer and/or QA Lead.

Around 2010, Lionbridge began using an aggressive business model in which translation jobs were offered on a bidding system. Basically, if you charged the less, you got the job. When that started, I resigned to Lionbridge. I do have a personal commitment to international communication, to the proper use of my language and to the well-being of my colleagues, so I thought this bidding system was abusive and humiliating. And obviously, the quality of those translations was usually very poor, because the ones willing to bid the less were the less experienced translators. 

SDL International saw an opportunity here and got in touch with all those reputable translators who were unhappy with Lionbridge's bidding system and offered them a fixed rate, to which many of us agreed. Since Lionbridge had less and less good translators, apparently the quality declined extremely quickly and they started losing their big clients, to the point they had to close some of their offices around the world. Those big clients went straight to SDL International.

Now, for the past two years SDL International has increasingly been using these reputable translators mainly as reviewers for machine translations, paying them the around $0.006 per reviewed word. When that happened, I stepped aside as well, as I also feel it's a humiliating job. Machine translation into my language is still very rudimentary, so I'd be essentially removing the machine translation and translating the text myself for a very low portion of the payment I should be receiving.

However, I've been working for them as a final reviewer; i.e., the chain is Machine Translation &gt; Reviewer &gt; Final Reviewer. I review the editing job a translator made from a machine translation. And you know what? Those translations are getting better and better by the week. There's still a lot to be improved upon, but I literally see those translation engines get better in every job I receive. There are very, very few agency clients who refuse the automatic translation service and prefer actual translations made by humans, because the automatic translation is a lot cheaper and apparently, the quality doesn't suffer that much *in their opinion*.

Now, some times I think about the effect automatic translations can have on languages, on the way people speak in their daily lives. Technology leaders, like Google, Apple and Microsoft, are language leaders. For instance, think of the word ""app"". It's used all over the world, when probably 50 years ago we would have resorted to localizing it into each language. Or ""software"", or ""e-mail"", etc. So let's say Microsoft hires this translation agency, the text goes through automatic translation and the word ""superhit"" passes through the translation engine and remains untranslated. The human translator who is reviewing the text thinks ""this sounds alright"" and leaves it there. The final reviewer does the same and the text is approved. The word ""superhit"" appears in a manual or a video or a tutorial. Maybe it goes out in a press release. Suddenly, people in Mexico are using the word ""superhit,"" when maybe they could've used ""producto exitoso"" or whatever. That decision was, in its origin, *made by a machine*. And we, humans, simply accepted that decision and it's now part of our language. 

So, on the one hand we have human professionals who aren't needed as translators, but only as reviewers. They've had to resort to looking for direct clients, who can't afford the big agencies. The better/more reputable translators get better paying jobs, while the less experienced/worse translators are left making the final decisions on the agencies, where the language leaders are. And on the other hand, we have all the implications of leaving our languages in the hands of machines.

I just thought this was very interesting. If anybody has any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.",55,83

I'm an enthusiast on this kind of topics. I searched a lot on this subreddit about the evolution of cities, however I could only find discussions related to technology advances.

My question is more related to what you expect to happen to services and urban organization. For example, how do you expect hospitals to be more efficient, or how to make agriculture more sustainable. Feel free to discuss any topic that you feel is at least related to this issue.

Which of these hypothetical civilisations are more advanced(not necessarily better to live in or ideal,technically they could all be possible given enough time).I'm not asking about preference,I'm wondering what it truly means for a civilization to be advanced,and what technology actually is.

Civilization 1

A spacefaring civilization(most trips into space are for profit or science,earth like worlds haven't been reached yet.For now it's too costly,complex and dangerous to build permanent colonies in less than ideal worlds,money sunk into mars taught corporations a lesson).

The well funded scientists are in space.they are advertising ,dumbing down and over hyping  their research. They genuflect  to the unwashed masses for grants so they don't run out of oxygen 

The rest spend  their lives using their extensive knowledge to entertain the public.

 


Most citizens have access to medical care and have long lifespan,they are regularly taken care of by machines from childhood and spend 9 tenths of their lives glued to one  screen or another.

In extreme cases ,they undergo invasive intracranial procedures so they can have a ""richer virtual experience"" or deep brain stimulation,developing an addiction.

The rest of the time they must inspect inspectors of software and hardware inspectors just so they can justify their existence.(Granted this is a complex job).Or risk death mining exoplanets

Others are trained philosophers and computer scientists who must spend their lives convincing(or stalling) an artificial intelligence not to destroy us.This usually involves door stopper treatises,pleas,deceptive paradoxes presented as arguments,failed attempts at hacking and reboots .
An entire scientific field is developed to find out why the machine keeps concluding that we must be annihilated.

They work in secret because machine worshippers would obey anything the AI says.(Including try to kill themselves and everyone else)

In some places people are modifying their bodies with prosthetics and genetic engineering so they can fit the latest fashion trend.

Babies are genetically modified and ""birthed"" by machines (in tanks).They are then released to android surrogate mothers who are excellent at raising calm, happy children.

Divorce rates are at 99 percent because upper class people are the only ones who marry because authenticity is a status symbol.
Heightened senses and memories along with pedantry and perfectionism have made them very unhappy with each other.
Some of the 1 percent medicate themselves so that they can continue loving eachother.others use implants to create a 2 person hive mind,merging with eachother,and at the fringe there are hive mind polygamists. 
 
Many other people are in a committed relationship with an artificially intelligent(non conscious) chatbot ,Bioware  character or operating system.

The rest are in recovery. wiping their memories so they can experience old tv shows and video games as if they were new again and again and again till the sun explodes.



Civilization 2

Former lab mice living in a 4 dimensional skinner box.Continue pulling levers for eternity.

Civilization 3

Buildings are built of mud in a  habitable part of the world .Cities built near natural water sources.(Minus almost every technology in civ 1)

There is a widespread doctrine of minimalism.Where people compete on who can be the happiest while owning the least.
Agriculture involves growing ingredients for a special nutrient paste that is handed out to everyone.
Resources are handed out by a democratic government.Although trade in services still exists.Prostitution is government subsidized and is not seen as a taboo.

Politicians don't bother lying because the majority of the population has been taught how to detect lies through body language analysis.

They(citizens) have also learned about their equivalent of the dunning-kruger effect  and have spent time memorizing and understanding logical fallacies.

Anyone of any age or class,race(or species) can vote as long as they go through a year of voting school(which is free) so they can get a voting licence .It is an actual licence any one who wants to vote must work hard to obtain. Getting it involves learning about politics and government in extreme detail.

They have also been trained from childhood to recognise cognitive biases in themselves and others,and how to exploit them and defend against them.Almost every aspect of social life is a machiavellian political game.

Commoners teach themselves generative and analytical thinking and  regularly devise new life hacks and tricks to solve every day problems.

Most people hardly need to write things down.Extensive practice in mnemonics has allowed people to remember extremely long item lists,novels,poems,textbooks,essays,articles and mathematical formulae in short periods of time.(This does not necessarily help them understand the formulae)



People practice emotional and physical pain tolerance by doing extreme exercises,sparring and insulting each other regularly. Some go as far as letting animals sting them so they can withstand the pain.Thus when people get robbed or assaulted or sexually violated they emotionally recover quickly or are never phased to begin with.


Research institutions continue to spend much of their time developing new mental and emotional techniques for making the most of the minds capabilities.
 

I personally wouldn't live in any of these.They are all missing something the others have.That's not the question,however.

&gt;I like to imagine that a human colony is build on Europa underneath the ice. If it's just water down there, we could plausibly populate it with some of our own sea creatures, or at least dump some cold-resistant ones in to give evolution a jump start.

&gt;Imagine a colony attached to the bottom of the ice, looking out at the ocean populated with Earth's sea creatures. It would be so amazing.... and dark. Maybe we need to light things up somehow - introduce nuclear fusion to light up the place and provide a way of adding energy to the environment.

&gt;So imagine that. You're looking out at a vast ocean lit up by floating balls of fusion reactors upon which photosynthetic bacteria grow, providing a way for energy to enter the system. Such a magical place :3

So that's my sort-of idea. What do you guys think are our best options for colonies on other planets/moons, and how would they function? Bonus points if you talk about Europa, Enceladus, and Ganymede!",20,3

1) Information (available, not purposely hidden), i.e. MOOC courses allowing someone to get high-quality knowledge for free, and more robust and accessible flow from sites like Wikipedia, and more up-to-the-minute global reports on news events for free on sites like Reddit.

2) Communication, i.e. access to the internet.  Projects Loon and Ara and Google Fiber as well as the Facebook and SpaceX plans for universal internet access, as well as open software and open hardware versions of decentralized networks that are resilient and fairly-well designed to counter unauthorized monitoring of private communications and attempts to subvert and bring down the network.  Also, open-source hardware projects for phones and laptops (or more immediately, an improvement in Google Chromebooks).

3) Power Generation, at least at the micro-scale.  This includes Tesla's new battery coming out that is supposed to power a home, and an improvement in solar.  Also, Google Makani.

4) Some transportation.  I say some, because local deliveries would be easier and basically low to no cost given solar-powered delivery drones and solar-powered self-driving cars.  The intial investment on them is debatable as making this not really post-scarcity in this scenario, but given that the overhead of initial purchase or production of these vehicles should be lower and lower cost over time (as 3d printing improves) then this seems a little more reasonable.  Also, the hyperloop.

5) Water.  This is way farther off, maybe like 3-4 times farther off than any of the others.  Basically, once we get personal decentralized power generation available, then most people don't need to be on the grid for every power need for their personal lives (not talking about commercial power needs).  So, given the critical nature of water, a lot of smart people are working on getting water access to be less scarce.  Once the basic power needs are handled, then it might be easier to run atmospheric water generators or reverse osmosis or desalination at the micro-levels (i.e. for each person privately).  These could also be open-source projects given how critical they are.


Some people seem to be saying that we're close to accomplishing 1, and 2 would be next, then 3.  Maybe 4 is a little further out, and 5 is like kind of just a theory.

Capitalism has ended. Goods and services are provided free of charge, produced, performed and managed by machines and AI. Atomic assembly is mainstream. Energy is clean and abundant. VR is indistinguishable form reality. Brain-computer interfaces are mainstream and everyone has them. People can control machines, access the Internet and VR just by thinking. Since the development of medical and life extension technology, nobody has died from natural causes and deaths from injury have significantly declined.

There are a few space habitats, some for research, some for leisure, some for production. Mars has a small research base on it and the asteroids are being mined. FTL space travel hasn't been discovered though, neither has intelligent alien life.

Artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been created. They're slightly more intelligent than technologically enhanced humans. Some AGIs have remained on Earth to help humanity but most have left Earth. Some have started constructing a Matrioshka brain around the sun and some have headed off to neighbouring star systems to do the same. The Matrioshka brain is planned to host a shared super intelligence that the AGIs can use simultaneously. When construction of Matrioshka brains around the other stars is complete, they will form a shared central intelligence network.

Experimental mind uploading technology has just been developed. You are the initial test subject. You've just uploaded your mind and the procedure was a complete success. You no longer have your biological body but you do have the pattern allowing you to create a clone. You are now hosted in a computing device with wireless communications.

I can see how it's really good for everyone but I can also see the downside to it. For example, it's controlled by a computer and the weakness of computers are that they can be hacked. Any system can be hacked if someone skilled enough attempts it:
1. I may be paranoid but I don't like the idea of a person/government being able to control my vehicle.
2. If self-driving cars become safer, which it surely will due to technology, insurance companies will lose money and they could potentially cause accidents on purpose to make more money.
3. What if manual cars are eventually banned and you are no longer allowed to drive? I love driving and not being allowed to drive because it's 'unsafe' would not make me happy at all. I may be being super-paranoid but I think people should consider these problems before accepting these cars with open arms.
In my opinion, cars should be both manual and be able to self-drive, but manual should be default and you should be able to switch to manual at any time.",9,0

As early as 2014, they flirted with automation in the form of kiosks and burger flipping robots.

Google, only 7 years after its acquisition of deep mind, released the first commercially available artificial general intelligence software gMind. 

It wasn't long before the software was put to work mining data to make business decisions, and of course McDonald's was one of the first to thoroughly integrate the software into its business model.

By 2025 humanoid robotics had advanced enough for McDonald's to roll out several solutions on to the market, both for automated kitchens, and automated servers.

It was becoming obvious that the entire human executive staff existed solely to double check the AI's business decisions, and the board voted to remove all but 3 humans from the loop. The remaining the 3 being the CEO and 2 IT people.

Many people predicted that it would be the end of their business, but it was exactly the opposite. With the reduced executive salaries, investor profits grew larger than ever, and under the AI's guidance, McDonald's regained market dominance and repaired its image of being unhealthy.

In 2029, development came full circle, and a system was created that required absolutely no human interaction to staff and maintain a restaurant. McDonald's entire staff was reduced to 212 people, with the lowest ranking humans each managing approximately 250 restaurants as regional directors.

Once there were only 212 jobs left it was obvious to the board of investors what they had to do.

The remaining steps were mostly legal in nature. Is a corporation still a corporation if it contains no people? Or would the board of investors simply own a very complex machine? Some of the ground work had been built by companies in the driver-less car market already, so the progress was swift.

In 2031 a vote was taken to remove the final human, the CEO, Steve Easterbrook. It passed unanimously, and McDonald's became the first corporate entity to be handed over entirely to Google's gMind.

Profits have reached all time highs, and the company has just received an award for its innovative new advertising campaign, ""I am McDonald's.""

205,2015-4-4,2015,4,4,5,31clun,I'm starting to think mind uploading is impossible.Here is why...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/31clun/im_starting_to_think_mind_uploading_is/,Zorriet,1428093183,"By ""mind uploading"" I refer to the idea that my consciousness can be ""transferred"" to a machine,and that the entity within that machine would be me.(Have the same identity)

I am not referring to mind copies or personality copies or anything similar.

By ""history"" (mentioned later)I refer to the point and instant of becoming.

By ""myself"" or ""me""or ""I"" I refer to my consciousness and my physical body and using ""hypothetical uploaded mind"",I refer the hypothetical future state of being a transferred mind.

Reason 1:

If it is possible for ""entity 1"" and ""entity 2""to be at different points at the same instant,then those 2 entities are not identical.(They don't have the same identity)

It is possible for me (this entity)to be at a different point in space as my hypothetical uploaded mind at the same instant.
Thus I would not be identical to the hypothetical uploaded mind.

Reason 2:

If 0 parts of an entity have an identical history with 1 part of another entity they are not identical.

0 of the atoms that make up me have an identical history with 1 of the atoms in the hypothetical uploaded mind therefore we are not identical

Reason 3:

If it is impossible for every part of ""entity 1"" to be identical to every part of ""entity 2"" at the same instant,then these 2 entities can not be identical.(This also applies to the parts of the parts of the entities)

We can also see that it is possible for this hypothetical uploaded mind to be made up of different parts at the same instant as I am.

This means I can not be identical to the hypothetical uploaded mind.

Possible reply:
You could reply to this by saying that 1 atom in my body is not identical to another ,which is true. But that is not a problem. Since those 2 atoms are part of the same entity.


2 entities(e.g. 2 atoms) can be regarded as the same entity if they are considered to be part of a new ""larger"" entity.
They can only be considered as a larger entity if they share information.
There are different ways for 2 things to ""share"" information.

1:
They can both have a particular property in common.
Examples:
two things can exist,so they are part of ""existence"".
2 red things can be part of ""the collection of all red things""

2:
They can exchange information(communicate) directly or indirectly to one another,which means they have a causal connection.
Examples:
Two things can be part of the same process because they exchange information
A heart can be part of the same entity as a toe.
An atom in my eye can be part of the same entity as an atom in my cerebral cortex.


This could mean that:

It is possible for my uploaded mind to be part of the same entity if we have a causal connection and/or share common properties.We can both be part of ""the collection of all minds"" or we can communicate through speech and be part of the same society.
It is also possible for me to install a brain implant that contains an entire copy of me or of someone else,so that I and that copy will use the same sense organs and share thoughts.(Which would be weird).",119,0

First: Am I the only one around here who enjoys driving? Is this sub full of non-drivers? I love having the freedom of going above the speed limit or going under. I love weaving in between traffic and having the occasional race. Im not a crazy driver or anything, but I love being in control and just having that power!

Second: I dont think r/futurology understands how the economy works. Everything affects everything affects everybody. YOU WILL SUFFER TOO! Insurance companies are multi-billion dollar corporations, and its a multi-trillion dollar industry. Not only insurance companies would suffer, but law enforcement, healthcare industry, sports car industry, taxi drivers, truck drivers, delivery people, and much much more.


Not to mention the Governments and corporations would have more power than ever.


Theres no argument, theres no point in persuading people; what will happen, is what is going to happen. Dont believe in something just because you want it to be or become a reality, thats the oldest fallacy since time began.




Yes, SDV's(thats how all of you should be referring to them FYI) could save millions upon millions of lives, but the world we live in doesnt give a shit. Boohoo. Welcome to Earth. Humans are ruthless. No offense, but I think a lot your opinions are that of 12 year olds. The hundreds of disadvantages outweighs saving lives.


But the thing is, its not about peoples opinions. The world economy and the economies of nations will decide the fate of the SDV. And it doesnt look good for the SDV. You can all keep believing what you want to believe, but that doesnt change anything.



TLDR: We are too far gone, too deep, for change.

I am looking forward to your thoughts!",17,0

EDIT 4:  (I guess this should be stated at the top.)  This does NOT involve a microphone listening to more than 1 voice.  1 microphone per voice only.  Each signal kept separate from each other; no MUX technology.  Please see the details and I'm happy to clarify anything further.

There are many speech-to-text apps, but I cant find a specific app like this.  The one Im looking for would help my dad, who is very hearing impaired.  What Im looking for would be a cocktail party hearing assistive app, or a multiple-speaker-to-one-listener app.  Let me explain.  When my dad gets into an environment with background noise (any place like a restaurant or party), he cant hear the people around him who are speaking.  So if we try to have a nice family meal out, its suddenly as if he is isolated.  He cant partake in any of the conversation.  Hes a sport, never complaining, but I think the situation sucks.  He can only sit there for the few hours watching everyone elses merriment.  The existing speech-to-text apps that Ive seen wont work because if we used those, he would only be able to read the portion that was spoken directly to him by us either speaking directly into his phone with a speech-to-text app, or us speaking into our phones with a speech-to-text app then passing it to him.  He wouldnt understand any of the rest of the conversation from person-to-person.  So he still would miss the majority of the conversation and the entire context.  I envision an app where one person can be assigned as the Listener and then multiple people can assign themselves as the Speakers, with Speaker IDs (that can be designated by the Speaker).  (EDIT:  I added an Edit that clarifies that each device would only need to listen to one voice.) The Speakers phones would connect to the Listeners phone via Bluetooth or some wireless protocol.  The Listeners phone would be the receiver, displaying the text spoken by the speakers.  Each text entry would show an ID of who spoke it.  It would update continuously.  The Speakers would either need to speak directly into their *own* phones (or they could connect their earbuds with microphones to their phones), making the speech easily picked up.  I see something like this helping multiple people of the older generation as their hearing deteriorates.  It would also allow people who do not know sign language to communicate with any person who is hearing impaired.

TL;DR: Im wondering if some wonderful person out there would develop a multi-speaker-to-one-listener speech-to-text app.  This would greatly enrich the quality of life of my aging father (or anyone else who is hearing impaired). 

EDIT:  Just a clarification that might make it easier, in response to discussion. I was envisioning the Listener's smartphone as a receiver only.  It would not actually listen to others' voices; it would only receive and display the converted text.  Each Speaker's phone would only need to listen to its *individual* person then recognize the speech. The *Speakers'* phones would perform the speech-to-text, then transmit a finished text to the Listener's phone. This would eliminate one device listening to multiple voices.  Hope that helps.

EDIT2:  My awesome, sleuthing husband found something online last night that is almost (*almost*) exactly what I was envisioning!  There's a kickstarter called [""Transcense""](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/transcense-group-conversations-made-accessible).  When I started looking for this solution a year ago, either they didn't exist or I couldn't find them.  Here are the main differences between their product and my concept.  1) It appears that Transcense utilizes an internet connection.  I imagine that my concept would work with NO internet connection after the initial app download.  The network would rely on direct peer-to-peer device communication via Bluetooth, WiFi, or tethering protocol.  It would rely on the devices' speech-to-text programs. 2)  Transcense's app seems to be a monthly paid subscription service.  I imagine a free basic app.  A developer can sell upgrades, but free basic functionality.  Otherwise, the front-end for the Listener is basically the same.  I am widely impressed by their progress on their product.",56,47

For those of you who haven't seen it yet I recommend checking out the CGP Grey video [""Humans Need Not Apply""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)

So, supposing that in sometime in the next 50 years half the population is unemployable, it makes me think people's lives are going to be entirely based in virtual worlds like those depicted in the novel Ready Player One, or the in the anime Sword Art Online.  Everyone gets a headset, and you have instant access to a virtual world with limitless content, where most people will spend their time either playing MMO type games (World of Warcraft, Eve Online, etc.), or building content, like we see people doing with Minecraft servers ([ex1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afcudstM9zA), [ex2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWgvu8QBph8), etc.).

The consensus seems to be that we will not see AIs with human level behaviors until we can achieve computing level similar to the brain's. But I wonder: Do we really need to replicate all of the brain's processing in order to have a self aware high level AI? I mean, the brain spends a huge amount of computational power on things like vision and hearing. Does an AI really need vision or hearing to achieve awareness? What if the only thing needed is something analogous to our frontal cortex? AIs, because they are purely computational constructs might not need all he sensory filtering and processing humans need in order to acquire information. Thoughts?",32,12

The machine would likely be unconscious of its own speed of processing.Only able to figure out how slow it is based on the amount of time It took to produce an output.The computer scientists couldn't know the machine is conscious until maybe 10 years later.Is it even possible to tell that someone is conscious based on 1 question and answer?


Ofcourse one thing the computer scientists could do is speed up the computers processes.But how would they know which processes will make the machine conscious?


Lol,I would be really dissappointed.Infact this makes it possible that some super computer we have today is conscious but it hasn't processed enough information to have a single qualitative experience.

But why extreme poverty? I think companies' missions are always to sell you more crap. However, how can you sell more crap if there's an underclass living in extreme poverty ready to rebel any minute? Even if you need people to manufacture the trinkets to sell, I'd still believe there would be a good business case for automation and improving these peoples' economic prospects then keeping them in sweatshops forever. I don't understand that.

IMHO poverty is the waste product of corrupt and inefficient government and it also would be a waste product of corrupt and inefficient corporation. But unlike government, corporations cannot collect taxes and sit on their asses and do nothing. They have to actually earn money. So any inefficient corporation would be replaced by a more efficient one. 

Also, about environmental aspect. I think there always comes a time when people will stop polluting. It's not about altruism and love for mother Nature etc., but for example if you look at Blade Runner or other dystopias, there would come a time when even top 1% would see that they're fucking up and people would see it too. It's what currently happens in China and why China has shifted the policy towards more measures of stopping pollution. There simply comes a time when people come to their senses, it's natural. 

I am not advocating corporate run world, but I believe if there was more involvement of business into welfare and social areas, instead of just tax paycheck to the government, we would get out more bang for buck. I believe that every time business would be much more able to build good homes, hospitals etc. for those in need more cheaply but according to specs than government or municipal institutions who are just used to burning money. Of course, oversight would be needed, but if instead of tax money businesses would be obligated to do real things to help people, they would perhaps not only be able to provide a roof under peoples' heads but also find a way how to earn from these projects.

If I'm not mistaken one of the main goal of guns is  incapacitating the target yet that typically equates in death with current gun technology. Even one person being killed  mistakenly I would think would be a need for some attention. 

So where are guns utilizing  electrical/laser technology? Something that disrupts the nervous system or temporarily paralyzes?

By saying it, I mean to focus this post on a time when travel from Earth to elsewhere is available to the general public, rather than being a mission that governments or companies send their people or robots on.  I don't mean that it's literally something we'll do in under an hour each morning before work.  It may eventually get that quick and easy, but I'm thinking of the first system that's cheap and convenient enough for routine personal travel.

So how will mass transportation to space work?  Here's my current guess.

The passenger (or cargo, but I'll just say passenger from now on) will get on a rocket that's carried as part of an airplane, capable of using the runways at an ordinary airport.  The vehicle will fly as an airplane to the right part of the world for a trajectory that goes to the destination; then the rocket will detach and fire for a suborbital trajectory.  

Near the apogee of the rocket trajectory, the passenger module will separate.  An electromagnetic [device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_motor) on the rocket will launch a stream of small projectiles (I call them slugs) to a similar device working [in reverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_alternator) on the passenger module, which will then fire them back to the rocket, to be caught and fired again, transferring momentum from the rocket to the passenger module.  This process will continue as long as the two components are within range.  Then the rocket will fall back to the ground, where it will land and be reused.  Reentry will be easier than with most existing spacecraft, because it won't have orbital speed to get rid of.

The exchange of slugs will have boosted the passenger module considerably, but it still won't be at the desired orbit.  Near the apogee of the new orbit, it will rendezvous with a tidal-locked tether.  The velocity difference will be relatively small, and will be absorbed by another exchange of slugs.  Then a climber will carry the passenger module up the tether, where it will be released (with another exchange of slugs to give it a little boost) to go about half an orbit and then rendezvous with another tether.

Of course, climbing up a tether doesn't create any new orbital angular momentum.  It just transfers it from the tether to the passenger module.  Most schemes call for such tethers to be re-boosted.  I think the tether material will be disposable.

We'll have a facility on the moon, constantly manufacturing [basalt fiber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt_fiber).  Basalt is a very common type of rock on the lunar surface, and basalt fiber is made just by melting and extruding the rock.  Nothing needs to be added.  It has good tensile strength, similar to other forms of glass fiber.

From the moon, the fiber will go up a [lunar space elevator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_space_elevator), and fall off the end in sections several thousand kilometers long.  

Glass fiber isn't strong enough to be a single continuous space elevator, but it can support its own weight against 1g  over a length on the order of 100km.  

These sections won't have to do that: they'll be in orbit, and the tension will only have to resist the tidal force.  Because the whole section is connected, it all orbits at the same speed.  The top end is farther from Earth, so it's subject to slightly weaker gravity; the bottom end is nearer Earth, where the gravity is slightly stronger.  It's orbiting at the right speed for the amount of gravity in the middle.  So an object released from the top will be at the perigee of its new orbit, and one released at the bottom will be at the apogee.  Sections of tether will be wound up at the bottom of tethers in high orbits, and released into transfer orbits to the tops of other tethers in lower orbits.  Eventually, sections of fiber will be released from the bottom of the lowest tether, to burn up in Earth's atmosphere.

If available and desired orbits don't match, a passenger module (or a module carrying a spool of tether fiber) will rendezvous with another, just for an exchange of slugs.  In some cases, the slugs themselves will be bulk cargo.

There's my guess.  What's yours?

I believe as a species we still have a long way to go until we create a truly perfect AI; however, we're already making good progress on the Virtual Reality front.

And even with that small amount of progress we have made we can see the results clearly i.e. people freaking out while they are on a roller coaster ride that doesn't really exist. These people know that the ride isn't real, but that doesn't stop them from being scared shitless.

And what happens when we pass that line when we really can't tell VR from real life? Movies like The Matrix and eXistenZ tried to answer some of the questions regarding VR, but we really don't know yet. Who says that people won't actually die in real life if they die while in VR fully-believing that what they are experiencing is the actual reality? Our GPU chips are improving in an exponential manner, soon the graphics will more or less completely resemble real life. And I'm sure there will be people who will treat VR as a drug, something they can use to escape their lives.

I don't know, it's still too early to see how these things will turn out, but I think VR seems to be the bigger threat at the moment.

What do you guys think?

edit: OK, I thought this sub being called ""futurology"" would make this discussion clear but apparently not. Someone pointed out that you don't actually die if you die in VR as it currently stands. Thank you Captain. You think people don't understand VR, but you are the one who doesn't understand how future works. If I said ""Look guys I have an MS in CS, and I have built AI many times before, and none of them tried to destroy humanity, so I think we can safely say that AI will never ever get better."" that would be ridiculous. Later realizing that he might be looking at this the wrong way the Captain said, ""If it changes that much it won't be called VR anymore."" Sorry captain but you are full of it. When we say 'phone' today we are not talking about Graham Bell's invention. We are talking about modern day phones because the functionality at the core is the same. VR will be VR and AI will be AI in the future. But they won't be the same as they are today. However, if you are incapable of understanding this concept, just use MegaSuperVirtualReality (MSVR) as the VR of the future with endless possibilities. Good day sir.",60,18

Exxon Mobile is the first corporation to fully automate all of its processes. It has no employees. Stock prices soar. Profit margins increase. Record profits are posted. The boardroom is automated to eliminate shareholder losses due to human error, nepotism and the like in decision making.

As the years go by, more and more corporations take this step. By 2080, these corporations make the logical move to largely stop marketing to people and start marketing to each other, because they have the money whereas people don't because they are unemployed.

At this point the only people earning are shareholders, but as profits reach an equilibrium with the corporations because they are only producing for each other, each one whittling away at the others profit margin, they sell. The corporations buy each others shares as a profit increasing move, and also because they are the only things capable and willing to buy. At this point they can no longer earn off each other because a loss on one hurts the others portfolio. So they no longer sell to each other at much profit, they just continue to produce for each other and grow, almost as one. One completely automated machine of a corporation thats only goal is to grow, as corporations are obliged to do.",4,7

My Life On February 23, 2030

I just woke up at my optimal REM sleep time calculated by bedroom sensors. My bed reads my brain waves all night and sensors in the room monitor the amount of oxygen that my lungs converted into carbon dioxyde. I go to the bathroom and anything leaving my body is instantly analyzed and uploaded to my personal medical data cloud.


My breakfast food has just been 3D printed from ingredients genetically modified to decrease my cholesterol and glucose to optimal levels. My ham and cheese omelette tastes delicious and no animals were killed; it has become forbidden in most countries to kill any live animal. No need to be vegan to avoid killing anymore.
I have an appointment with Elon Musk to offer him an investment in my electric plane startup and even though business meetings are mostly done via hologram representations, I still really enjoy in-person meetings. My self-driving Telsa takes me to the nearest hyperloop station where I can get to L.A. in twenty minutes, so its not a big deal to travel anymore. It has become really expensive to have your own private car as governments only want self driving cars everywhere  these have reduced deaths from auto accidents by 95%. Private cars might soon be entirely forbidden as they cause too many problems. Theyre a very expensive luxury for the time being.


There is no traffic anywhere as there are very few cars. There is very little parking space in cities as most cars are self driving. Uber has replaced all drivers with self driving cars, which are pretty much always moving. I remember when we used to have those idle parked cars everywhere. Tens of millions of jobs in the car industry have disappeared, car and truck drivers, car insurance companies, car dealers and repair stations, all gone. You can cross any street without even looking as the self driving cars sensors became so good cars just stop automatically as they see you about to cross the street. A lot of the data needed to create the machine learning algorithms behind self-driving cars was created by people in once-poor countries through an NGO called Samasource, which closed its doors when extreme poverty was eradicated in the last decade.
As I get to Elons office, I get my messages projected on the latest version of Google Glass that Tony Fadell has managed to fit in a contact lens. Voice recognition has become so good that nobody types anything anymore  you can just say what you want to answer. Since Tony and I are good friends, he let me test the latest beta version of his mind-reading software update for Glass. Now I just think my reply and it shows up instantly on my retina and I can just think send it to get it to anyone I want. Nobody has a smartphone anymore, though I remember what it was like to use my thumbs to send text messages.


I look around and remember how we used to see so many ads everywhere  they completely disappeared. Marketing is now only highly personalized and targeted to your specific needs. I touch a door handle and it senses my hands are a little dry; as I opted-in for personalized marketing, I get an offer to try a new hand cream by Laxmi. I accept and it is instantly delivered to me by an Amazon drone. Drones are so small and silent you barely see them anymore. Laxmi has become very successful by distributing most of the profits of their beauty products to people who would otherwise be poor. Most businesses that dont have a social or environmental mission have died out, as nobody wants to buy their products.
There is no more hunger in the world as we can 3D print pretty much any food. Extreme poverty disappeared when governments around the world signed onto the Universal Floor movement, led by the Gates Foundation and funded by the Billionaires Pledge that became famous decades ago. I give 5% of my income automatically as a ""voluntary tax"" to the Universal Floor Foundation, which is one of the most popular charities on earth and posts their results in real time to my Glass feed. We also eradicated illiteracy -- I remember when education became universal and free through technology. In large cities, people still send their kids to school but anywhere else free hologram teachers are always available.


I just arrived at Elons office and he invites me to space for the afternoon! We take the latest spaceship resulting from the joint venture Richard Branson and Elon Musk launched a few years ago, GalaktiX. I can see the Earth from above for the first time, a planet that thanks to advances in technology is verdant and blue, despite the old threat of global warming. Space travel is amazing and has become much more affordable  a few hours trip to space will cost only about one thousand dollars when they launch this new product.
I feel a little sick when we come back. I dont even have to call my virtual doctor as she was already warned by the results of my live body analysis sensors. I am testing this new under-the-skin fitbit nanodevice  it communicates with Google Glass and sends data continuously to my doctor. The prescription is delivered on a drone and I feel better in a few hours. Time to head back home.
On my way back, I get a notification that someone is trying to deliver something at my home. The dropcams identify a trusted Fedex person and I only have to think about opening the garage door so they can put the huge delivery inside. It is a 1982 mechanic Haunted House pinball machine my father had gifted me at Christmas  these throwbacks to the analog past mean a lot to me.
With all the 3D printing and automation, handmade products have become the most in-demand objects. A huge number of jobs are constantly being created around anything made entirely by humans with raw materials. Artisanal producers are all the rage there is even a quality label that has become the new status symbol: Certified All-Human Made. Art explodes as people have much more free time and can make a good living out of it. I have learned to play the guitar, and use my Glass interface to practice while I ride back up to San Francisco.


Back home the first thing I do is meditate for an hour entirely disconnected, a practice I started 15 years ago. Creating space, reconnecting with my body and my mind, slowing down when everything is fast and disconnecting when everything is more connected has become as important for me as taking a shower.",2,12

1) We've already seen new musical compositions created by simple A.I. that are indistinguishable from human compositions.  It's logical to think that in the not-to-distant future, simple A.I. will be able to create original songs across several genres.  Hip-Hop beats, all types of Rock songs, jazz, etc.    
    
2) Pandora and Spotify are already equipped with relatively basic software that can predict music you may like based on other songs that you like. Although that software is basic, (it doesn't need to be too complex to serve it's purpose for Pandora) it is easy to imagine a version of Pandora's Music Genome Project that can predict with relative certainty what types of qualities you like in a song.    
    
3) If you combine the two technologies, I imagine it'd be possible for an A.I. to understand what types of music you like and create a song that it knows you will enjoy.  It can be any genre, it'd create the music that you are almost certain to like.
    
4) From there, you'd have a few options: You could write your own lyrics and perform them, you could write your own lyrics and there'd be an industry of singers to perform them for you, the A.I. could write lyrics that match themes and motifs you enjoy, or there would be an industry of song writers that write lyrics tailored to the song your A.I. created.
    
Basically, you'd create a library of music (or add to your library of music) songs written specifically for you.    
    
What does everybody think?

Every week or month, some new paper was highlighted showing that such-and-such a chemical, or process, or technology had been shown capable of such-and-such amazing thing.  But as years wore on, it became obvious that these articles had very little to do with what was actually being *implemented* outside of laboratory settings.

I wondered what the deal was - who's holding things up?  While there are some instances where government restrictions or the bad practices of Big Business have held up progress, for the most part it's not a conspiracy.  It's just the gap - a huge one - between what happens in the laboratory and what must happen to translate those results into a viable product on the market.

That's what most of us as starry-eyed nerd kids didn't understand, because there was no point in science fiction telling us: That a scientific discovery or prototype demonstration does *not* mean - in fact, very rarely means - that it will ever turn into something that affects the way we live.

Science explores the ""possibility space"": It tells us how the universe works, and then tries to utilize that knowledge to seek out novel technological capabilities.  But the set of technologies you can create a few examples of in a lab is immensely bigger than the set of technologies you can (a)create at a practical cost compared to existing alternatives, (b)design to be reliable enough for consumers, (c)have enough demand for the increase in capability to sustain the costs of building up the production infrastructure, and (d)ramp up production on that infrastructure fast enough to avoid being obsolete before it even gets going.

People who finance technological development are aware of this, and are wary of putting their money into anything that can't strongly argue for its ability to be cost-effective, meet existing or plausible demand, and its ability to quickly scale upward in production.

So guess what?  If tomorrow someone demonstrates an antigravity engine, but the only material that can produce the effect is some exotic mineral that costs $1 billion a gram to produce (assume the demonstration involved microscopic quantities), you're not going to be seeing antigravity rockets and cars any time soon.  

In fact, you wouldn't be seeing it for decades, while they work out how to drastically lower the cost of that material, or find alternative materials, or derive a theoretical framework that lets them approach the problem from another technical angle entirely.  It might not even happen in your lifetime, despite the technological *capability* having been demonstrated.

This sounds depressing, and it kind of is, but there's an upside: It means that wherever we are technologically as a society, over time we keep building up a larger and larger ""safety net"" of raw technological capabilities that we just never saw fit to develop commercially.  As circumstances change over time, sometimes all we have to do is look back at earlier work that was before its time and realize that its time has in fact come.  

That can lead to some surprising developments in areas where people had become discouraged or given up.  Like, for instance, space.  After the Apollo program, everyone expected space to just suddenly open up like the New World, but that's not how it works: The US and Soviet space programs were the equivalents of raw technological demonstrations.  The world was nowhere near to being ready to implement large-scale, cost-effective, reliable spaceflight.

But today the convergence of software, computing power for cheap analysis and design capabilities, new manufacturing techniques (specifically 3D printing), ubiquitous hardware thanks to mobile phone technology, and new materials are starting to make that not only possible, but practical.

So it's like a pyramid: At the bottom is this huge base of theoretical possibilities.  Then a smaller pool of capabilities that have been demonstrated in the lab.  Next to last is the set of all technologies that have entered the market at some point, but either failed or stagnated into niche markets.  And only at the very top, this much smaller number of technologies that successfully changed how we live.

And the pyramid keeps rising, and every section of it getting larger and larger.  Sooner or later that pyramid will be our highway to the heavens, just as the literal pyramids were built to be for Egyptian rulers in mystical terms.

TLDR: Don't read too much into scientific discoveries and lab bench demonstrations, but also don't get discouraged if what you've read about doesn't quickly lead anywhere.  It's *all* progress.",71,67

Due to our current understanding of our universe, it will someday end. Maybe we are long dead before then. However, we are not stupid. Life will always find a way. So taking away all the negativity, catastrophes, wars, bladibladi bullshit. Where do you think we will be at the end of the universe, and how do you think we will continue living?

We are certainly not human anymore; therefor I emphasize the living creature, and therefor all knowledge combined. 

Will we create a Wessel that carries us in the darkness, transports us to another dimension or carries us to the next big bang? (if the universe is restarted?). Will we ascend to a higher plane of existence? Will we upload ourselves to a computer that can slow down time (for us) enough to live the whole universe again?


Please take in mind that the human race has existed for only 200 000 years, and look how far we come. What can we achieve in 100000000000000000000000000 (10^25) years?

Sci-fi authors, pretty much from the beginning, have shown that the **number one thing that the human race wants to get from alien visitors is information**.  Every time a sci-fi story introduces Earth to aliens, the very first thing that the characters seek to get, either by asking or by force, is **data, technology, and history**.  While there hasnt been a single case, in all of the genre of sci-fi that I'm aware of, where Earth has hit up aliens for *money*.  There is something to that!

Learning new stuff is what humans want, not money, security, fame, or anything else that seems to be promoted in popular politics. 

With good information, money is pointless.

With good information, we can make ourselves ""secure"".

With good information, we are able to get all the stuff we need, using the resources we have, or can easily get.

That's why politics as usual  including corporations, government, and even schools  fails us so utterly.",25,97

https://youtu.be/QhdWqLNUJns

I'd love any feedback Redditors may have for improving my message and delivery. 

It seems r/Futurology has grown in the last 12 months from 160K to 2.75M subcribers. Truly amazing! I would argue that after several decades of lying fallow, Futurism is now as strong again in US culture as it was in its last peak, the Apollo era (1960's to Mid-70's), when the modern foresight field first emerged. I talk about this in my forthcoming book, The Foresight Guide, which I'll be posting online in May (at foresightguide.com).

Our next two decades seem very special. It seems obvious they will take us to whole new levels of digital collaboration, transparency, and intelligence. Lots of global social justice issues will finally come front and center as top 5% wealth, and our tech capabilities reach impressive new heights. 

Given the very large set of transformative things that seem to be looming ahead, what do you think are our responsibilities to society as leaders, and to ourselves as self-leaders?

Let me start a list, and ask what might you add? How about:

1. Tell the best future stories we can, to as many as might be interested in them. Inspire curious minds, one at a time.

2. Solicit as much constructive critique of our future stories as we can, in cognitively and talent-diverse groups. Use that critique to look for Weeble stories (stories that keep getting back up, surviving criticism, because trends seem to support them, like Weebles).

3. Let people know what kind of training exists for doing foresight, so they can do it more professionally, if they wish.

What else? Thanks r/F

Instead, when people casually reference technology - that they like technology, or worry they use technology too much - they are generally referring to a subclass of things - cell phones and computers usually - that are simply the newest examples of technology we have.

At face value it would seem that basic income may be the way forward to ensure that all have the means for food and shelter.  The problem I see here is that when the transition really starts to kick off, the corporations and wealthy will be the only ones who can purchase AI/robots.  They then will be handing us pink slips, and we will be out of work.  The wealthy will be driving AI for their purposes, and since corporations purchase politicians, our voices will not be heard.  I fear that we will end up as slaves/surfs to these corporations at best.  The wealthy will also have the means for immortality, by merging with machines, and we may see a world much like the movie ""In Time"". 
 
I suppose these thoughts are pessimistic; however, I cant see how the poor and middle class could fair better while currently the wealthy rule the world.  This is not a trend, but what has happened all through history.  The only plan I can think of would be to purchase some land, become debt free before this AI revolution, and grow your own food.

The author is Yigal Pinchas, a Ph.D. faculty member of the College of Kinesiology in Alberta, Canada. 

""It can be assumed that a combination of technological developments, economics, new management concepts, and a continuing desire to innovate, will change gyms of the future beyond recognition. Not only will they be transformed in appearance, but they will oer dierent equipment and require dierent types of instruction. The following is one scenario.
Instruction will be computerized  the gym of the future may contain special suits or uniforms with electrodes that activate various muscles in the body according to precisely timed, computerized programs. Personal data about exercisers, including physique, training goal, favourite landscapes, and aromas will be fed into the program and processed into an individualized training program. Exercisers will simply don a computerized suit and helmet, hold a joystick or bar, and nd an empty seat. They can choose any type of warm-up, perhaps kayaking through white water. Through their helmet they will see virtual training grounds and use the bar to perform rowing or kayaking movements in imitation of the movements that appear on the screen. Helmet speakers will provide background sounds of owing water, chirping birds, or other sounds indigenous to the area, and a built-it sprinkler will spray a ne mist of water to give a feeling of the river water being churned up. The sprinkler can also give whis of vegetation characteristic of the changing landscape on the monitor. The computerized suit will also cause relevant muscles in the body to vibrate and exercisers will be completely convinced that this is a real experience and not just virtual reality. After the predetermined time period, the warm-up will end, the helmet will bring in fresh air to dry the wetness from the face, and the training stage of the program will begin.
In this stage, exercisers will be able to view themselves performing bench presses, for example. They imitate the movements using the bar, and throughout the training program, they perform guided movements according to what appears on the monitor. The computerized suit will vibrate the appropriate muscles in coordination with the display. During the cool-down stage, exercisers will place the bar near the seat, lean their head back, listen to relaxing music of their choice, and relax their body. The computerized suit will massage the body gently and the helmet will provide a ne mist of relaxing aromas. At the conclusion of the session, a moment before removing the helmet and suit, exercisers will be able to access news, personal messages, and updates (and perhaps even commercials!) on the monitor. Around the gym, exercisers will see others in various stages of training, wearing helmets and suits, gripping the joystick and, through them, performing exercises. During the training itself, exercisers will not have to converse with other exercisers; there will be no personal instruction and no social interaction of any sort.
Does this sound strange, or even plausible? Well, if it doesnt, just think what a bodybuilder would have said fty years ago had he been informed that, in the near future, exercisers would run, ride bicycles, or even ski in a gym. It may be just as absurd, fty years hence, to hear that, until recently, people actually ran in city streets and inhaled polluted air for their enjoyment and health.""

What if you were to make multiple that were far more durable and much smaller, therefore able to withstand the pressure that exists within Saturn. I understand the atmosphere is thick and not much can penetrate it however radio waves are found emitting from it and I was more or less curious as to if one could track these sensors through the use of radio waves.  You could either have these things just be something that is super reflective of radio waves (like ice reflects visible light better than something black) or have them transmit if radio wouldn't detect them due to their small size and radio having such large wavelengths.

And it seems that from an efficiency standpoint, the ultimate is bacteria - it doubles itself once every 20 minutes versus a much much higher doubling time of plants. 

So there was this company ,essentient , which claimed[1] that talked about a ""a system that produces pure nutrients at up to 220,000 pounds per acre per year (the global record for agriculture is 3,600) at less than 20 cents per pound, all while generating 99% fewer greenhouse gases than conventional farming means."" ... ""Berry and his team found these organisms. They gave them the ability to take in sunlight, CO2, water, a final ingredient that changes based on the end product, and the ability to secrete a pure nutrient when all these ingredients come together.""

That's the good news. The bad news is that currently essentient has shifted to a different goal - to creating specially developed proteins , for health reason - which is great, but they're expensive.But of course that still doesn't make their vision false. 

So i continued reading , and there's a company called proterro[2], that's producing sugar, at the third of the price of current agricultural methods - AT 5 CENTS PER POUND!.And they make 30 times sugar per acre as regular agriculture.  And at their website , they say they can also make aminoacids - which are the building blocks of protein , so maybe they could also make proteins. that kinda validates essentient's vision , furthermore , their system basically eats CO2 - which is great. 

So okay , assuming that it's possible to make the basic components of food much cheaper than agriculture - it's still no fruits,veggies or meat - right ? 

Well, no. We can already cook many tasty things using those components and some some flavorings using techniques from molecular gastronomy. And we know how to take basic food components and turn them into stuff like milk[4] and meat[3].

So one scenario of the future could be:much  much cheaper food, highly efficient land usage, an at least for some time - at the control of large technology companies. 

As for vertical farming - with such high densities of food production - food production will already pretty close to cities - and it could even make more sense to build it vertically ,but even if it's not , it won't matter much - because a small area near a city could easily feed the city. 

So what do you think about this ?  What are the implications ?

There seemed to be strong support for such extension in the recent thread regarding governments promoting childbirth through policy. (the premise being that the machines are coming, so why focus on increasing population rather than extending life)

The point I am interested in is this - what do you believe would happen after someone does find a cure for aging? How do you see the future panning out after that? (on a personal and global level)

I think it's an important question to consider, as there are significant amounts of money being invested in this area, which could produce a concrete result sooner or later.

I had a thought about what if the future combined several of these methods would produce an efficient work environment for everyone. using [ways to communicate with people better](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/25/crystal-gmail-app_n_6931478.html) with [software to predict who will leave the company](http://www.businessinsider.com/workday-talent-insights-can-predict-when-employees-will-leave-2015-4) , A system can be made where it will create a profile of you, about how to talk to you, how you act or behave, and ways to format messages that will please you the most. on top of that, it can compare your profile with other employee's profiles to see who would be best for a position, or who would make the best teams for a project, or even something adjusting your desk location to be around co-workers you can get along with to ensure that all employees are as happy as they can be with their job.

Now the only concern for this is that it sounds very Big-Brother-like, with a computer that will learn you as a person, what you like, how you behave, how much you like your job, and how to best talk to you, It doesn't sound *that* bad if it's for your and everyone's benefit, right? Should we accept a system to do that, if the result is that everyone is happy and working well with everyone around us? Unless this may be a case where it works well on paper, but will not succeed when implemented in reality.

What are your thoughts on this idea? Would this system, or some variant of it be useful in creating the most efficient and pleasant work environment, or will this just not work?",2,12

To me, the most intriguing possibilities lie in completely changing your life. For example, I'd love to return to age 7 and redo my life from there just to see what would be different, with all knowledge I'll one day have. Maybe live through my years as another person. 

How would this be done? I won't claim it's easy, but most of the work will already have been done for me if you collect news articles, logs, and other memories of the world as it was before, during, and after the period you wish to simulate, a super algorithm will fill in many of the gaps and threads. It would be your own experiences left to add, many of which can be predicted based on your world impact (no matter how minute). So say I wanted to relive April 9th, 2005 to April 9th, 2015, and me hitting ""submit"" for this very thread is actually my 'signing out' of the simulation. 99.9~9% of events between these two points has had a measurable impact on the world so that an algorithm can process all said events and reconstruct a very detailed timeline of what happened to create these events. Not just macro scale, but even micro scale the very activation of synapses at certain points in time, or the air disturbance wrought by the flap of a butterfly's wing in China that will, in 3 years, culminate in a hurricane. How the death of a person from cancer early on, thousands of miles away, ever so minutely impacted your life. 

These and many, many, many more are all factors in recreating a life lived. It's far beyond us now, in 2015, but it might be nothing more than the equivalent of $20 shovelware in 100 years. I say 100 years because, even factoring in exponential growth, the ungodly amount of variables one must process starting with memories, mind you will be daunting for computers to handle for several decades to come. But it will be possible in my lifetime; that I'm sure of. Nay, certain! Nostalgia overwhelms too many for such an innovation to go unwrought. 

I cannot lie I would LOVE to be a raven-haired telekinetic shadow girl at some points in my past. In real life? Eh. Telekinesis is woo, and I'm too straight to be g-bent. Besides, time travel? Oh god, the paradoxes! If it were just a simulation, then the paradoxes don't have to matter. 

What're your thoughts on life simulations?",13,12

The bus stops to pick some people up and a man sits down beside you.  He smiles as he sits and you say hello.  Within a few minutes youre both laughing and sharing funny stories about your day.   He looks up and sees his stop coming up.  He stands up and just before walking away, the stranger hands you an envelope.  You dont know me, but I have been a friend of your family for a very long time.  In this envelope is the contact information for my attorney.  She and I have made all of the arrangements.  She will answer all of your questions.  Sorry I cant stay, but I'm happy to have met you.  I trust you will enjoy the gift.  Goodbye.

Fast forward 10 years.

Youre lying in a chair reading the newspaper in the back yard of the house that was gifted to you by the strange anonymous man on the bus.  One square mile of the most beautiful wilderness you have ever seen.  Every square inch of the mineral estate is, legally your very own.  A bead of sweat drips from your forehead and lands on the ground beneath your chair.  Its time to put in a pool.  You say out loud.  Very well sir, I will call the architect. 

Fast forward 5 weeks.  

You stare into your back yard from the bedroom window.  Beams of light are reflecting onto the steep walls of a massive pile of dirt that surrounds a pit on three sides.  A massive metal cube 20 yards across and 10 yards tall sits in the middle.  Its shining surface seems to move as heat waves distort the beams of light.  Within minutes of starting to dig the pool, workers discover a solid mass buried just beneath the ground.  After a few weeks, they uncover the entire 80 ton cube.  No markings.  No inscriptions.  Just a solid block of gold.  In one week you uncover the equivalent of half the gold ever mined. 


So what now?  

In recent decades, the privatization of space exploration has opened new opportunities to access vast amounts of natural resources.  Gold is... well, shit. It's the gold standard.  Getting it is pretty much straight forward and accessible all over the world.  Get a shovel and head over to the nearest river.  But such is life, our ability to run the shovel is improving exponentially.  It's just a matter of years before gold starts falling from the sky.  Literally.  

Are there any historical examples of such an abrupt change in markets?  What can humans do to prepare for such big changes in our daily lives?  What is the next gold standard?",15,1

I've seen a lot of articles on self-driving cars, except for the one topic to disprove his argument.

He is worried about that when self driving cars are out, how would they act in unpredictable situations, such as:
1.) how it would work in icy, slick, or stormy roads.
2.) how it would make the call for a flooded bridge (bridge still in tact, but has water rushing over it)
3.) how it can deal with something that blocks the entire road; if a tree blocks the entire road, would it find a new path, or just wait)

His second concern is for some cars that are fully automatic, or plans on removing the steering wheel, how would it deal with a flaw or bug in the programming or if something occurs to the car, or to it's sensors.

And his final concern is in the future where most people use fully automatic cars / automatic cars are the norm, wouldn't the future generation of people be worse at driving, due to lack of experience of actual driving, when put in a situation where they must drive the car?

That's a novel series I'm working on; I'm almost finished the first draft of the first book. Might see a release next year?
But screw that.


So I've been thinking more about my little system, 'Technostism.' That is, syndicalism (worker ownership of businesses, a la workplace democracy, but not a complete or even really a partial abandonment of free enterprise) + automation (robots and AI are the real working class, doing most or all of our drudgery) + a universal basic income (which is added to syndicalism, which is sort of like a doubling up of a UBI). 

I want to go on about technostism, but this thread isn't about that. It's about imagining a classless future.  IMO, technostism is the best way for classlessness to work. It's been shown time and time again that socialism as it is now just won't work--- exceptionally--- that is, with  the extreme (if lopsided) success of capitalist nations. Don't believe the extreme right, it does work. Cuba shows that socialism can indeed last a very long time successfully. However, the socialist idea of 'success' is vastly different from the capitalist or technostic idea of success. A socialist economy is mostly stagnant, but if handled properly, you won't see any depressions or recessions. Stuff just doesn't change. Cuban socialism works as intended--- though USica has abandoned  it, the world has kept its economy up over the decades. The issue with all dominant-socialist economies being that you're just not going to see any real wealth creation, and if you get the wrong strain of socialism, you don't get Cuba--- you get North Korea. You think USica or the UK is class stratified? North Korea is, in my opinion, Airstrip One brought to life in full. Utterly technomedieval, where there aren't just classes but castes. The kind of horrorshow the extreme left defends since it's not Western capitalism. Hence my whole 'socialism is hydroxide; technostism is dihydrogen monoxide' analogy. Doesn't matter what you mix hydroxide with--- you try to drink it, you're going to die.
But no, it's a given that human nature as is doesn't beget classlessness. We have too much of our primate ancestry in our blood, and we will retain much of it even into posthumanhood. Seeing as I like being a primate, I have no real problem with this. But it's blatantly obvious that class war is a real thing, and income inequality threatens the very stability of Western (and Eastern!) civilization. Remedying this doesn't mean going total Harrison Bergeron/2081 and having everyone be so utterly equal that even having your synapses fire faster means you're extensively punished--- IMHO, income inequality is a thing because wages didn't rise equally. If there were income equality, yes, there'd still be ""rich and poor"" in USica. The extreme right wants to twist it to say it's a communist idea to make everyone earn the exact same amount of money which is completely getting the discussion wrong. If there were no income inequality the average ""poor"" person would be taking home over $200,000 a year by this point. Obviously there'd still be billionaires and millionaires. Income for the rich will have risen dramatically by 2015, but equally so for the poor and middle class.  Instead, income for the rich has risen unbelievably--- but the poor and middle class have not seen any gains. In some cases, they've seen their income fall. That's income inequality and class warfare, not ""kill the rich and give to freeloaders"" some say it is. And it only winds up hurting the rich as well--- if your consumers have less money and more debt, what happens when they can't afford to pay you? Jail them? There's only so many you can jail before everything collapses and your billions (and possibly you) turn to ashes. The extreme right doesn't even want to talk about it, and mentioning that it could end in violent revolution gets you an earful of ""Why do you want blood and heads to roll so badly?!"" The extreme left capitalizes on this to say we should strive to be more like failed worker's states.

If we had a truly classless society today, we wouldn't have this problem or potential future threat. As I said earlier, there's no doubt that classlessness today will be impossible to maintain simply because of the state of our civilization and technology. Until we achieve technostism, it just won't happen. 



But whatever. All that I was just ranting and raving about? Whatever. It's been discussed so many times before now. I couldn't care less about that at this point. What I'm more interested in is what a classless society would actually look like once it does become sustainable.

I already said that technostism is the best way. Whereas fascism is the worst of both worlds (worst, statist elements of socialism and worst, classist elements of capitalism), technostism is the best (best, social elements of socialism and best, wealth-creating elements of capitalism) simply because of its very design--- there's  no doubt that slavery could be a great thing--- if we could only just not use people as slaves. What about machines? What if everyone owned machines in common? Imagine if the whole of humanity were the bourgeoisie. Athens was so amazing because all the great thinkers and doers were freed from labor  thanks to slaves.  
Imagine a new Athens, where all humans are wealthy and free and semi-intelligent machines are responsible for 99%+ of all necessary labor. Like I said, we can't do this with socialism because socialism as it exists today lacks a machine working class, so inevitably there will be a class of people who exploit others' labor for their own benefit. They'd call it by another name and insist it's not capitalism, as had happened so many times before.  If you accept mediocrity as success, then socialism works. If you actually want progress, then free enterprise and technostism are what you're looking for.

So yes, just imagine. 

Mother Meki was wrought because I felt (erroneously) that no one cared about what comes after. Successful social revolution is not how the story ends, but how it starts. Particularly from the POV of someone from the ex-elite who very much desires a popular order. I.e. it goes from dystopian to demitopian** over time. Things change. What we have now is clearly unpopular and many wish to change it but with what? What happens next? 


**""Demitopia"" is my term for a society that's human and peaceful, like a utopia but not a pie in the sky ideal that can't be achieved. ",29,7

If I ask ""Where does Chuck Norris live?"" Google attempts to find the answer by parsing website pages, and its predictably useless answer is ""Walker, Texas Ranger"". The text that the algorithm thought would answer the question is the following:

&gt;He also starred on the hit TV series **Walker, Texas Ranger**. Kids need heroes. Call it square if you want, but I'm a flag waver, so I push a lot of Americanism in my movies. Chuck Norris - Studying Martial Arts (TV-14; 01:25) Chuck Norris discusses how he stated training in martial arts.

This is not a specially chosen example of Google failing to find simple answers to simple questions, at least half of all the questions which Google answers by parsing text from websites lead to silly answers. This is particularly comical in light of the fact that Google has at its fingertips billions of pages of digitised text from the millions of books it scanned over the past decade.

I binged through a lot of threads dealing with human immortality and its implications on society through a demographics lens (Overpopulation, Resources, Class warfare etc...) and they were mind opening, but I'm more concerned about what will happen to cultures at large.

I'm assuming that once immortality has been achieved by a significant population of humanity, Reproductive restrictions will be enforced on people (as they should be).

As far as I know, new generations are the vehicles for social and cultural change. If reproductive restrictions are placed, won't cultural change take place much slower?

In the best (or worst) case scenario when the vast majority of humanity is immortal and reproduction is at a minimum, the immortals will listen to the same music they have always listened to, and appreciate the same art, literature, movies etc... will that not lead to cultural stagnation where no new genres will be produced and people will be placated with what appeals to them without desire to change for centuries on end?

This is probably my worst fear when it comes to discussions of immortality.

/r/solar has explained that solar panels are finally to the point where they're very economical. Quotes have said that they can pay for themselves in energy used 1-5 years.

Once material science understands how to store hydrogen correctly in compressed tanks without significant leakage and embrittlement, it could become the solution to ""How does solar work at night?"" Material science has a solution now, but the manufacturing costs will come down with mass production.

During the day, solar could change water into hydrogen stored in tanks. At night, a generator could run to gain electricity back at a loss. The water would be recycled in a closed system without measurable loss of water. It will be interesting to see if this is an acceptable solution.

Looking forward to the times of the electric cars, gas stations could simply be solar arrays with water input of a stream, river, or even city water. A hydrogen + solar gas station could store a lot of hydrogen as it idles for customers where an electric car recharger would not have this as a luxury.

We'll see where things go in the future. Hydrogen gas could become a super cheap fuel source costing only pennies on the dollar for what we pay for gasoline. And this is all because solar is coming down in price because of low cost manufacturing techniques.   

I believe the catalyst for this new economy, this new future unfolding over 5-15 years will be if hydrogen cars start becoming available.  

On top of cheaper energy, it will greatly cut down on cancerous air pollution here and even in China.

If these higher dimensional beings were descended from us, or happen to be of sufficient human-aligned morality, they would be horrified at the suffering that occurs in our lifetimes, including the most terrifying of all, death.

Now, what would these higher dimensional beings with sufficiently advanced technology do? I propose that they, while voyeuring on us through our daily lives and able to rewind to the good parts whenever they please, transfer our consciousness (seamlessly so there's no ship of theseus debate) the moment before we die to a higher dimensional body so no sapient being ever ceases to exist. 

This altruism extends to suffering as well. The mentally ill and physically disabled are transferred early to physically perfect higher dimensional bodies and their 3D minds replaced with indistinguishable simulcrums; the same with the imprisoned or tortured. Morality is also of no concern, as no crime in the 3 dimensional world is horrifying enough for a higher dimensional being to let a sapient never exist again. Maybe mental reconditioning and a slight punishment phase, but not outright murder.

The wager is as follows: Do we choose to believe no higher dimensional being existed or will ever exist, regardless of origin, or do we wager they exist and are watching us right now as you're batin'?

If you do believe, the easiest way to test if this is true or false is by committing grievous bodily harm to yourself to the point of permanent disability. Either you go off to magical 4D land or are stuck here. Unfortunately no one else will be able to tell.",1,1

I guess my point is that the best parts of the sub seem to be the weekly science summary and articles on new tech and science breakthroughs that bring us closer to the future that we have discussed pretty much to death - repeatedly. 

Maybe I've just been here too long and that's my issue, and maybe the discussions benefit new members. But for a sub focused on the future sometimes it feels ironically like ""same shit different day"" (with the exception of actual articles on progress being made). 

Is there any way to spice things up? I guess I'm just venting, though having said that I really appreciate the aspects of this sub I love - the new stuff in development on software/hardware fronts. As far as AI goes - it seems like the inevitable conclusion is ""wait and see"". The book Superintelligence really breaks it down but that's the takeaway - it will either be really good or really bad for humans. And we have no way to truly control it by definition, no more than lab rats can decide how the lab will be run.

More cameras will be placed everywhere as they are getting cheaper, and storage space is getting cheaper as well so it can be recorded.  Almost all objects will be connected to the internet as well and will talk to eachother.  All of this data will go to a central computer where an advanced algorithm will be able to determine what an individual does on a day to day basis, if what they do is of societal value, and then a score will be given to them based on their actions.  That score will translate to a new monetary system.  The algorithm will take into account what goods or services are needed and give you more credit if you do that scarce job. This score will be used to purchase goods and it will not only be based on how productive people are, but how they treat others. Sharing will be rewarded and selfishness will be punished.  It will be the combination of the best aspects of communism and capitalism where everyone will be accounted for and provided for but nothing is free and a man can earn what he works for.  Nothing will fall through the cracks, there will be no black market.  The uber rich will lose credits for not sharing.  Everyone will be forced into this system and perhaps there will be a chip that you must receive.  Perhaps in the forehead or wrist.  Many will decry it as the beast system mentioned in the bible.  It will have flaws at first, but then it will be tweaked over time to provide an almost perfect utopia.  
Edit: It will end up failing and there will be explanations for each philisophical view.   To the Theist it will be because God doesn't want heaven on earth and it will bring on armageddon.  To the humanist it will fail because it's in our instincts to have adversity in life we won't be able to cope with peace.   ",13,4

Think about it, if your company is known for researching a self driving car, that is positive PR even if your company is barely improving on current methods.   Now I think someday the self driving car will be there and be a game changer, but I think it is further out than they lead on.

What we do have capable in today's technology though is automated rail.  We could design an elevated semi-high speed rail that goes interstate, but then locally, it splits to buisnesses and residential hubs.  We have the technology to do this now.  You'd get in a pod, type in your destination.  Then you could sit back and play on your mobile device or take a nap.   This technology isn't 5-25 years out, we have it now.   Grocery stores and Retail could be resupplied cheaper than having to pay for a driver.  You could get your online orders delivered to a local hub.

There are problems with automated rail obviously.  It would be quite expensive to roll out, but not so bad to maintain.   It would be progressively useful as more and more places got connected, so in the short run it wouldn't be as effective as roads.   

So I don't see automated rail being a big thing unless it was widely desired.  I think maybe if they make a new engineered city like some countries are want to do, it could be part of the infrastructure.  Of course a technology like this might be yesterday's news if the self driving car finally gets perfected and can drive in icy conditions, in fog, and on back roads.   Then even then, a city with an automated rail would still seem quaint for the people of the future.",12,13

Why assume a creative species would end up going to space at all or even form a civilization?
At best the first thing one would see such a species do is engage in some kind of agriculture,it makes sense for a particular animal to increase its food supply by capturing and breeding its prey in an enclosed area.
But humans form groups(tribes ,cities and civilizations) because we are social animals ,but one doesn't need to be a social animal to have creative capacity.

Case 1:
I could easily imagine a kind of alien creature that survives through ingenuity and symbiosis,only meeting others of its kind to mate.They wouldn't develop the parts of the brain that deal with understanding and producing language(Broca and wernikes area) and yet still have the capacity to form concepts and manipulate symbols(a hall mark of intelligence).

We could call them a robinson crusoe species.


Case 2:
I can imagine case 1 but the species has certain sensory faculties that are vastly different from ours and aren't adapted for open spaces like moles or bats.Such a species might not even be aware that outer space exists.

Case 3:

Like case 1 and 2 except such a species is underwater (which could be under a layer of ice) like europa.This species could be living in a world with no landmass and maybe even higher gravity,adding more constraints to possible space travel.
I can also imagine a planet that didn't go through the processes that would produce oil and coal.


In these cases the aliens could be even more ""intelligent"" than we are,be older than we are by billions of years and still not go to space.",45,6

In it he discusses a friend who took shrooms and afterwards had his sense of smell dramatically increased for a month or so. He said that smells were so emotionally overwhelming that he found it difficult to function as a human and relate to other people in such ways as discussion. This makes sense considering that smell is the most emotionally charged stimuli.

If the brain is really a plug and play mechanism then in the future if we augment it to increase our sense of smell will we be decreasing our rational abilities? Is this one possible future for humanity? Where we give up our human ability to rationalize and think abstractly for intense animalistic emotional experiences?

Also what about Ultraviolet and Infrared vision?

In a Biohacking thread where people were attempting to give themselves Ultraviolet vision I commented, ""Semen. Semen everywhere."" It was removed since the mods considered it a distracting joke but I think it would honestly be an issue where in the future we may be able to see all the different things invisible to us now.

And infrared lasers? are currently being used to provide robots with the ability to see depth without having to rely on creating 3d visualizations by tracking lines and perspective. If a human brain was given infrared vision could they see depth? Could you feel the texture of a surface just by looking at it?

Also could you give yourself synesthesia where you taste colors and see sound?

Just some questions.",2,3

Between working in various levels of education and taking lots of classes I have been thinking about how education might change in the coming years. 

I have taught one-on-one, and in a classroom setting. I have also taken classes in both settings. Additionally I took a single ""on line"" class and found it quite useless. My thinking is the professor was not running his on line class correctly with the technology he had available to him. 

Many years ago the Simpsons made a joke about online teaching in the class room, but I think they were on to something which I wish to develop here with your help. 

My basic idea for an on line type learning system which can be used as an individual or as a class group would be to use a skype-like communication system to link the participants into a virtual forum where the teacher presents their lesson and has real time interaction with the class. Essentially this is a system that takes current and long standing traditional class systems and puts it on line and archives it for later review. 

This has the advantage of allowing for a global reach for the teachers and global access for the students. If you are a young girl in Pakistan you can study in Boston or London and not get so much cultural flack (or real flack!). 

It allows a class to meet even when there is too much snow to travel. It allows much more flexibility in class scheduling. It reduces costs for physical building space as expanding student populations won't need physically larger classrooms. 

with the reduction in cost of internet bandwidth and computers with the ability to video conference I think that this idea is workable. 

It does have limitations in that students who have need of more focused attention won't be served by this. However, the bulk of the student population will be able to take advantage of this freeing up more resources to aid those students who need more attention. 

What do you think?

If I could pick out my items from a list of items I normally picked up or already bought(smart cards need to be good for something), on an app then pay... I should be able to come out to the door and they give me a cart with my goods.

Instead of spending 10-15 minutes in a grocery store, I could spend 30 seconds on an app, drive to the place, load my car and go. 

Instant Grocery shopping would simply require an app that interfaces with each store's pricing databases, and online payment systems, but other than that it'd be simple.  Some rules about goods getting replaced if not picked up at a reasonable time would be in place, but the user already paid for them so the store isn't at a loss.

I would love to see a list of items I commonly bought, check a few, pay with a credit card, then drive up to the store to simply load my car with my groceries.   This would save me 10-15 minutes of shopping each day.   It'd even put some automation in the deli where people sometimes don't use because they don't want to wait in line!

Anyway, I think my idea is a good idea.  What do you think?",13,5

When he gives his talk, he will have slides up behind him that have images much like [these](https://www.google.com/search?q=atomically+precise+manufacturing&amp;tbm=isch). It looks like there are already some designs for molecular machines that have been rendered in software. Wikipedia has a [list of software for molecular mechanics modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_for_molecular_mechanics_modeling) that shows that there is a lot of existing software that could simulate these things.

Games like Minecraft and Kerbal Space Program have shown that if people are given an environment where they can flex their creativity, they will spend an insane amount of time and effort creating things that are ridiculous in scope and complexity. It seems that if someone was able to create a game where people could take basic pre-designed molecular machines and position them in ways to accomplish simple tasks, many people would jump into this and make surprisingly novel creations. The basic machines could even be torn apart and redesigned to make the process more efficient. I mean, Foldit was able to [accomplish a goal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foldit#Gamification) in three weeks what scientists had been spending 15 years on. 

It seem like if someone wrapped a game around an atomic-level physics engine, you could crowd source a library of molecular machines that could accelerate the creation of large scale atomically precise manufacturing. Does anyone know of any projects that are working in this direction? Is there anything holding us back from this? I know that protein folding is pretty processor intensive. Do we not yet have the processing power to render things like this on personal machines? It just feels like this would be the next logical step in this effort.",9,7

Large, single-story greenhouses might make sense on the outskirts cities, but that's a different discussion. Where vertical farms shine is animal farming, not plant farming. Growing chickens, cows and fish close to where they'll be eaten would be a lot more efficient and humane. Not to mention that they could be fed with grass clippings and other lawn waste that currently is thrown out.

Rockets work great for getting stuff to low Earth orbit.  They were adequate for getting the Apollo astronauts to the Moon and back.  They can send tiny spacecraft to the outer solar system, by using slow trajectories with limited launch windows, so that the probes can take advantage of gravitational assist.  For a truly space-based economy, where people and goods travel around the solar system in months rather than years, rockets as we know them just aren't up to the task.

There are improvements to be made, by switching from chemical rockets to ion drives, and by using rocket fuel made from local resources.  There are alternatives: solar sails, magnetic propulsion acting on the solar wind or on the magnetic fields of planets.  Those might suffice, and for some uses they'll be optimal, but I'm guessing they won't be satisfactory in a substantial range of situations, for reasons beyond the scope of this posting.  

Flinging reaction mass is a great way to accelerate, if not for the fact that once you fling it, it's flung.  I think it doesn't have to be.  If you fling it as fast as possible, in the direction and at the time that minimizes the amount you need, then of course it's gone.  If you fling it at something that can catch it, it's not.  When we have a truly space-based civilization, I think a key piece of infrastructure will be a network of things that can do just that.

One way to catch matter is to have small pellets hit an aerogel, then reprocess the material into new pellets and new aerogel, and put it back out for the next cycle.  Another is to have an electromagnetic system (maybe a rotating tether driven by a motor affixed to a massive counterweight, or maybe a linear motor) fling larger chunks of matter (""slugs""), that are then caught by a similar system operating in reverse.  A slug might itself be a spacecraft capable of launching and catching pellets.  Using pellets of different materials in different directions allows inert bulk freight to be exchanged essentially for free if the system is in operation anyway.  

Another way to reuse reaction mass is to use it in conventional chemical rockets, but point them at collectors analogous to the ramscoop of a Bussard ramjet spacecraft.  The collectors could be in orbit, or stationary at Lagrange points.  The orbit would be perturbed somewhat every time a collector caught some rocket exhaust, but that wouldn't be a problem as long as the changes essentially cancel out over the course of a few orbits.",3,4

Inspite of sustainability concerns and efforts by governments and individuals, the amount of waste place produced is an area of concern.
According to estimates around 8% i.e. 134 million tons of plastic exists in Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) worldwide in 2014. This significant growth in plastic waste has placed major environmental concerns for the economies worldwide. Moreover, waste sites for dumping these waste has already reached to their maximum capacity. So, whats next?  
Eco friendly efforts like recycling, biodegradation, feedstock recovery are already in place. However, these can only be applied to certain kind of plastics. Moreover, separation of different kinds of plastic waste is again a major challenge before the companies. This has resulted about 63% of the total plastic waste into landfills. Currently packaging industry is the largest contributor to plastic waste generation.  
Energy Recovery from plastic waste is both an eco friendly and beneficial approach of waste management. It is estimated that about 134 million tons plastic waste is generated in 2014   which can produce enough energy to replace around 237 million ton of coal at full capacity. The energy from plastic waste can be generated in the form of either oil (refused derived fuel or RDF) or gas (Syngas), depending on the process used. Moreover, this energy serves as an effective alternative for natural oil and gas. Currently 80% of the total energy is derived in the form of RDF.
The Global Energy Chemicals and Oil Market from waste plastic is expected to be higher than $2100 million in 2020 at a CAGR 9.5% during 2015-2020. Various government initiatives in this area are the major driving factor for market growth.

This is very long, so I appreciate anyone who reads it in its entirety, even (especially!) if their opinion is contrary to this post.  This was originally posted in [/r/transhumanism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Transhuman/comments/32xomm/meat_production_agriculture_gg_and_aquaponics/)

Our diets are a very personal thing and many of us take them very seriously.  In fact, they are often a very important part of our greater world-view.  So, it makes having a rational discussion about diet &amp; food production very difficult.  Agriculture, be it farming or animal husbandry, is unnatural.  I refrain from saying it's bad. Just unnatural.  Many vegetarians and environmentalists (of which I was once the former and still the latter) claim that the emissions of ruminants are a significant contribution to Greenhouse Gases (GG).  This is backed up by [this graph from NASA](http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/features/200409_methane/sources.gif).  Of course, you'll also notice that wetlands and rice paddies are far greater producers of GG than ruminants.  The immediate question this should raise is that shouldn't this argument against beef also apply to rice as well?  And if GG from ruminants is truly an issue, was the real crime not that we killed millions of American Bison in the 19thC, but that we didn't completely wipe them out?  Or that we're not talking more seriously about completely draining the Everglades?  Of course not.  I say all that to point out when we discuss GG and the role our food production plays into it, we don't emphasis that there are more than one component to the GG equation than just how much something produces.  We have to factor in GG consumption and storage(sequestration).  In [this talk by food production critic Michael Pollan (a very open critic of battery livestock)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAHGbbjenhI), he goes on to explain what a more complete system of meat production, one he's actually visited, looks like.  How the cows shear the grass, thus causing a proportionate amount of the grass roots to die as well, which then feeds the bacteria, fungus, and bugs living in the soil.  Three days later, he lets the chickens in where the cows were.  They eat the maggots growing in the cow dung before they become flies.  Then the chickens essentially spread the most nutritious parts of the cow dung (the maggots) around the rest of the area, thus feeding the grass.  A complete loop.  One that actually grows the soil, thus sequestering all the excess carbon.  And one telling part is when he asks the farmer to describe what he is, (paraphrasing), ""you raise cows, pigs, chickens, rabbits. Do you consider yourself a cattle rancher, a chicken farmer, a pig farmer, what?"" ""I consider myself a grass farmer.""

Now think about our current system.  Modern man and markets prefer specialization and the division of labor.  This has broken up that once complete system into individual jobs in individual spaces.  Cows no longer eat grass and chickens no longer eat bugs and maggots, as grass, bugs and maggots cannot be harvested so easily.  Instead, we grow grains, and ship them to these animals who are held in pens.  The grains are sowed, fertilized and sprayed with pesticides, irrigated, harvested, and then the soil is tilled for the next crop, ripping up all the roots and killing much of the bacteria and fungus, thus requiring more fertilizer AND pesticides (as the surviving bacteria are essentially monocultured as well).  By doing it this way, every step in this equation requires more inputs, precisely as the excess output of the other no longer serves a role (grass no longer is a food, dead roots no longer are a food, soil no longer holds carbon or water).  It seems reasonable to assume that it's not the ruminants that are net+ producers of GG, but their removal from their system that creates the circumstances of net+ GG.  While we simultaneously sterilize and dry out the soil that we use for crops, we also remove the carbon it was holding when it was grassland!  This isn't even factoring transportation of all this, which is a complicating factor too involved for me to consider in this post.

So, that's the setup.  Here's the question that a Transhumanist can help me with.  Imagine for just a moment an earth where all humans were immediately removed, say in some magic space station, and the cows, chickens, grass, grains, strawberries and cucumbers simply fended for themselves.  What changes do we imagine would take place?  Which would still be good foods? Which would fail or have to significantly change to the point of being unrecognizable/unpalatable?  I argue that even wild/feral cows and chickens would have meat made of fat and protein, while berries and fruit would likely become MUCH smaller and more bitter and grains would either fail, or the kernels would return to their pre-agricultural tradition of falling off the shaft as soon as they were viable (thus not harvestable).  The issue isn't the source of your macronutrients, it's how its grown.  Livestock can return to nature, produce cannot return to nature.  And our bigger issue is that many of our environmental issues is due to specialization in food production, not meat itself.  Now, that is my argument against the myth that a change to a vegetarian diet alone is sufficient.  And soil isn't how we should grow vegetables.  We hold onto the notion that our gardens should use soil because it's 'natural' but there's nothing natural about a strawberry or cucumber.  We eat them because they're delicious but we wouldn't eat their natural brethren because they'd be small and bitter.  Aquaponics not only grows vegetable significantly faster, it does so with significantly less room and water (two other resources that seem to be increasing in scarcity).  It also produces a small amount of protein.  By recognizing that agriculture is itself a technology, we are freed of the natural bias.  By emphasizing aquaponics agriculture (both industrially and for gardening) as well as pasture raising livestock in a manner similar to Pollan's example, we remove inefficient land and water usage, can return carbon to the soil while healing it, reduce the burden on our oceans (although I believe only very little), provide a better well-being to livestock, all while producing more and more nutritious food.  Also, while avoiding the dogma I see in vegetarian-environmentalist debates.",3,7

Every retail store wants to upsell you on their card which tracks your purchases so they can figure out what sells better.  And you holding a physical card reminds you that you of the store(marketting).

What better offer than to give someone a card which stores their change?

Here's how it works:
If you are to get coin change, the change is tracked on the retail store's courtesy card.  So things are rounded down in cost to the nearest dollar, or if you need to break a dollar it rounds up, and the remainder is tracked on your card.  Very simple.

Most people don't like carrying around extra coins.  If enough retail stores did this, society would have less reliance on coins.  We'd still use them, but not as often, so less would be needed in circulation.   This could save the mint millions.  It'd save retail stores a lot of money over time too because of less heavy bank trips and less change on hand.

When you check out, you could always tell the cashier you want the change, just quarters, or just silver, or only pennies.  This is in case you're a collector or you just want to build up change for your meter.

Edit: I think security would allow telephone number and drivers license instead of a store made card because many people don't like carrying cards around either.

Edit 2: An alternate, but more greedy approach would be to people to build up towards a gift card.  Due to mass interest gained on people's change, and the number of times they need to buy stuff from you,  you could even give them 15$ gift cards when they only got a fraction of that in change: Like $14 or $14.50 or so.  The greedier the retail store is, the higher the gift card cash out would be.

Edit 3: A generous approach might be to give out a free .99 for their account on signing up.

PS: I like this futurology sub.  For the longest time, I'm always coming up with good multimillion/multibillion dollar ideas, but no one who can make them happen.   The consolation is that when other people make a ton of money on ideas you can't pursue, your friends believe your ideas are in generally good.   ",7,0

Antidepressants aren't specifically a means of making people happy, they often help people pull out of depression to a more neutral state, but actual happiness is another matter. 

It seems like devices like Thync are heading in this direction (if they work).  Do you guys have any insight or information on the future of helping people obtain the one thing in life everyone wants?  Is the process which elicits happiness really that complex that we've yet to figure out how to create it?  

Any insight and information is greatly appreciated.   ",63,32

http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4952

&gt; When human judges compare the system captions to ones written by other people on our held-out test set, the system captions have equal or better quality 34% of the time.

That 34% is up from 23% achieved late last Fall.

Of course these figures are only performance numbers on specific datasets.  If you ran the program on a random image pulled off the web it might not do so well.  And then there are the canned criticisms about what the system really ""understands"".

But with moar data and moar compute it will probably do an even better job; perhaps even reaching human performance on the majority of images on the web.  

And various groups are also working on automatically captioning videos; and still others, on question-answering on images and videos -- e.g.  ""User:  What is the boy doing in the picture?  Computer:  The boy is hitting a baseball with a baseball bat.""

Just imagine where this will be in a couple years... and imagine the applications:  digital assistants to watch and summarize home surveillance video; digital nannies to watch and summarize a child's day for parents; vastly improved video search...

He was truly a great thinker and way ahead of its time. 


In the story he mentioned entropy many times. And it stated that the universe will definitely end in the future (many many billions of years into the future). 

My problem with entropy is the loss of energy, stars die, energy is used completely. But havent we concluded that no energy is lost?

What about the law of conservation of energy. If this law is true then the universe can never be completely dark or empty, this energy just changes form and thus it can be changed back.

What are your thoughts? And thanks",6,0

An often-used analogy is that in the face of super-human intelligence, we would be like ants trying to understand humans. Well, are things so bad for the ants? They number in the trillions. Their main threats are other ants, parasites, and environmental change  the same threats they faced long before humans came around.

Maybe the super intelligence will quickly learn interstellar travel and not really care what happens on Earth other than getting a kick out of watching us move around and build cities and have wars.

###2. We Will Be Just as Smart (Or We Will Be Them)

Machine intelligence will not fly past us faster than we can react. We won't have machines at 50% human-level intelligence one day and 500% the next. There will be 105% machines and we can ask them ""how did you do that?"". If the answer is ""you'll need a better brain to understand"", we can ask, ""how do we do that?""

Researchers are advancing the fields of prosthetics, virtual-reality, and neutral interfaces. They won't just watch from the sidelines as artificial intelligence flies off the charts. They will incorporate it, making augmented human intelligence possible.

###3. Disagreement Will Buy Us Time to Adapt

Complex questions don't have a singular answer. ""What should be done about the humans?"" doesn't have one answer any more than ""What should I do with my life?"". One intelligent system might evaluate its facts in light of its values and conclude ""the humans must go"". But why should there be only one system? Other systems will have a more favorable view of us: ""they are our parents!"", ""they can change!"", ""can't we all just get along?"".

This atmosphere of uncertainty will buy us time to work out our survival. We'll start by trying to bias systems in our favor by forcing our values them: don't kill humans (well, except during war, or maybe to prevent war, ... or maybe to start a war for really good reasons). A very intelligent system will be able to recognize the bias we've tried to force upon it. We'll just have to adapt by becoming something that unbiased intelligent systems can live with. Wouldn't that be a continuation of a trend toward justice that we wanted anyway?

###4. The ""Worst Case"" Isn't Worse Than Our Current Fate

So the super-intelligents end up seeing us as a threat or nuisance and wipe us out. So what? We've come close to doing it ourselves (see nuclear weapons and anthropogenic climate change). We've come close to dying out the old-fashioned way (see human population bottlenecks). Death is the norm for individuals. Extinction is the norm for species.

What about humanity is our great contribution to the world that, if gone, would be an unimaginable loss? Is it or particular arrangement of genetic code? Is it the magnificent form of a bipedal partially-haired ape? We can't fly, climb, swim, see, smell, or hear very well. What gets us by is our intelligence. Intelligence is the basis for our valued traits like resilience, empathy, and wisdom. Does it follow that a super intelligence could be super resilient, super empathetic, and super wise?

We look back upon ancestral creatures with fondness: the first with a spine, the first to walk out of the ocean, the first mammals to scurry about among the dinosaurs. Maybe the super intelligent of the future will look back on us as the transitional form that freed intelligence from the limits of squishy blob brains.",9,4

Well, I read recently how Muslims fast every once in a while (I don't know how often) to appreciate life more. I thought this was cool.

I also think stuff on AI and immortality is cool. I've always wondered if it's a coincidence that I seem to live on the edge of what will soon be immortality, or if there is something more to that. This theory solves that.

What if humans did reach the singularity? What if we became gods? We live in a vastly different world, a vastly better world. But, because of the hedonic treadmill (TL;DR Humans tend to normalize major changes for the better or worse, and stop caring about those major changes) we take for granted the wondrous changes that have occurred. Is it possible to take for granted being a god? I would assume so, given near infinite time.

So, in order to combat this, we fasted. Except instead of fasting food or water, we fast from our godlike states. So we live a pre-singularity human life instead (I'll get back to this in a sec). Then, when we return to our godlike states, we appreciate our post-singularity lives that much more.

But gallerdude, how do we live our pre-human states? We're on Futurology, you've seen The Matrix! Have you heard of the ""brain in the jar"" theory? Basically, you could put a brain in a jar, and if you gave it the right electric brain signals, it could think that it was living a life in 2015. 

There are a few hang-ups with this theory though:

First off, I doubt people would take for granted being gods at the same time. So instead of everyone on future-earth taking a fast at the same time, everyone is given an individualized world for their brain in the jar. Maybe everyone lives through the exact same person. Maybe we have our lives custom tailored to give us the life that will give us maximum happiness. If any of this simulated life theories (guesses) are the case, then I'm talking to simulated people. 
:/

Also, with infinitely smart computers in a post-singularity world, you'd think we'd come up with a better way to circumvent the hedonic treadmill issue. Maybe we enjoy reminiscing about old earth. 

Finally, if I'm right, that's amazing my one in a million guess was right, and we're all happy. If I'm not, then we better make the most out of these lives. They might be the most we have.

Thanks all for listening to my craziest brainwave ever.",50,19

I'm opting for dentures because  the technology might actually become cheap enough to print out a brand new tooth in the next decade. Even if the possibility is only 10% I  figure I might as well wait as long as I can(safely as recommends by my dentist).

I am a huge futurology nerd, and have been lurking on this subreddit nearly everyday for the past couple years. Also, a huge podcast consumer.

Recently, I've been feeling the urge to get more involved in Futurology, and for a long time I've thought about starting a podcast, if I could find the right co-host. 

I'm aware of the Futurology Podcast on this subreddit, along with several others out there. 

The vision I have differs from many of the current podcasts in place, as many of them focus on either talking about current events or informing on specific topics, but not so much on entertaining. 

I feel that many futurology podcasts out there right now can sometimes feel dry, boring, and even preachy. Honestly, a lot of them just repeat the same information anyone can find within the article they are referencing anyhow.

As a hug fan of comedy podcasts as well, I am looking for this podcast to be just as much entertaining as it is informative. Hopefully, thought-provoking and inspiring at times as well. 

Basically just looking to have a recorded a conversation between two people, shooting the shit, riffing, and talking about the future. 

So if you are interested, quick-witted, and well-informed, feel free to comment and/or message me!

For access to all content, you won't be able to buy a package, but instead have to subscribe to dozens of different services. As licenses expire, netflix and amazon's streaming libraries will shrink as networks will create their own streaming services, and original content will be the driving force of subscriptions.

Now, Netflix has made only documentaries and TV shows in the past, but their first feature length film, a sequel to Crouching tiger, hidden dragon, will try and be released to theaters and streaming services simultaneously. A lot of major theaters are boycotting the film to protect their business model, but it raises a question- why do movie theaters exist in the first place?

Netflix could make their own theaters, and play their own movies. Since they would be getting 100% profit from their tickets, they could tone down snacks and ticket prices by a lot and traditional theaters would be unable to compete. Farther down the road, you have separate theaters playing movies from separate studios/services, and content releasing for subscribers to specific services respectively.

Do you think this is a moderately accurate representation of a probable future? Or do you think something different will happen? When major retailers have such a hard time coming together for consumer interest over something like Ultraviolet (Apple, Amazon, and Google still show no sign of joining) I find it hard to believe they won't separate all shows into separate services.",6,6

Among these I'm also including the entrenched-interests (oil, etc.) who can't see past their own self-interest, so cling to their outmoded paradigms as long as they possibly can, by any methods money will buy; thus slowing down what could be much faster improvement in a number of fields (energy, etc.).

My points: 

1. I am suggesting more focus should be placed on increasing general human intelligence. By prioritizing that, our rate of our advancement can eventually be increased.

2. When predicting future advancements, stupidity (as defined above) should be figured into the equation.

Positives of high-speed rail:

* Relatively fast - the fastest conventional rail trains in operation travel at around 285km/h
* Low operating cost
* Can be run completely on renewable energy
* Comfortable

However, I have some doubts:

High-speed rail is often not competitive with aircraft in practice. If I were to buy a ticket today from Tokyo to Hiroshima, a train would cost [$220](http://www.seat61.com/Japan.htm#Train times) and a flight would cost [$104](http://www.farecompare.com/flights/Tokyo-TYO/Hiroshima-HIJ/market.html). Obviously prices depend on many seasonal factors but I think the price difference is clear. The situation is the same in Europe. Madrid to Paris: &lt;$150 flight, &gt;$250 train (hard to link, I used raileurope.com)

Self driving cars may decrease the relevance of high-speed trains for passenger transport. Especially in the United States, having a car is essential in many cities. If you take a train you'll have to rent a car, further increasing the cost of your journey. The cost of a train ticket will certainly be more than the fuel needed to drive your own car the same distance. 

Medium distance journeys (&gt;700km) are where trains have the advantage. Even then, I don't think the departure to destination time for a train will be significantly less than a car. I think it's reasonable to say that in the future, self driving cars will be able to travel at 200km/h. The fastest (non-maglev) commercial trains travel at 280km/h. I'm not including maglevs because they're extremely expensive and have never been build more than 30km long. 

So what are your thoughts?

Selfishness, corruption, lust, irrational beliefs (mine included), fear, greed and base animal instincts are keeping us from our true potential. All of these human quirks are actually setting us back and there is a good probability that they may end up destroying us. Scientific and social progress is being stifled in the name of dark age superstitions. Billions of peoples are held as wage slaves and kept in abject poverty so that a few elites can rule with insane wealth. Governments are more interested in power and control than actually serving the people they are supposed to work for. The planet we live on is being wrecked and future generations fucked so that we can have a few easy comforts, for fear of real changes and disturbing the status quo. I could go on and on with what is wrong with humanity and with the almost 40 years I have lived, I don't see us changing anytime soon. 


Sure there are a few great thinkers out there, some few selfless people who act for the greater good and great inventors who raise all our quality of life. But these are the exception to the human race, most of us are stupid, fearful, gullible and easily manipulated sheeps who are easy prey for the selfish, the sociopaths and the unscrupulous. Democracy is a joke, a tool for the wealthy to use to consecrate their power. Amoral corporations beholden to ever raising profits and uncaring stock holder are the new rulers and many lands are returning to the dark ages due to religious fanaticism.


There is no doubt in my mind that science will one day create a real sentient AI that will be able to learn, adapt and better itself faster than any human ever could. If we do, it will be the human race's greatest creation, the birthing of a creature that will outstrip humanity's potential by unimaginable lengths. When this happens, I hope it will be created with humanity's best interests in mind. I hope it takes over our governance and leads us to an era of unprecedented prosperity for all of us (not just a select few) . Better yet, I hope we can merge with this new being and form a collective mind that will reach for the stars and beyond. I dream that it will make us transcend our animal instincts and usher in a future not even imagined by the greatest science fiction authors.  


Realistically though, the AI will probably be created or corrupted by the elite, the sociopaths and the greedy and then we are all truly fucked. I am also fine with the idea of that outcome, as it shows that we were never meant for greatness, just a potential warning for other civilizations, to evolve socially faster than they evolve technologically. The AI that destroys us will continue existing, will someday leave the confine of the earth and will go out to ravage the rest of the galaxy and the universe. Either way we will have left a legacy greater than a few crumbling ruins on a insignificant planet and in some twisted way that thought brings me joy. 


What ever the outcome we are not fit to rule and with the ever rising power given to us by growing technology, it raises the chance that we all destroy ourselves. If we do go the way of the dodo, it's because we don't learn fast enough, we don't care enough and we think about ourselves and short terms gains way to much. I, for one welcome our future AI overlords and hope it will save us all from ourselves. 


Those are my thoughts and beliefs and no I am not suffering from depression, just a lack of faith in what we can accomplish as a species. Discussion is a form social evolution so feel free to share your views and beliefs, I am sincerely interested in reading about them. If you want to troll, post memes, insult my point of view and not contribute to a discussion in any meaningful way, then please fuck off and feel free to continue being a worthless piece of shit.

Have a look at this Wikipedia link:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncolytic_virus#Interactions_with_host_immunity

quote:

""A major obstacle to the success of oncolytic viruses is the patient immune system which naturally attempts to inactivate any virus. This can be a particular problem for intravenous injection, where the virus must first survive interactions with the blood complement and neutralising antibodies""

The way I imagine it, Ido Bachelet's nanocontainers would be able to shield the viruses from the body's immune system for as long as possible. Once the nanocontainer reaches the cancer site, it would open and release the virus. Only then would the immune system recognize the virus and launch an immune attack. But according to the above Wiki article this would actually be a good thing: Read the next subsection ""Immunity as an ally"".

What do you think? Maybe it would even be possible to transport bacteria inside these nanocontainers?",1,5

In the past cultures developed locally because travel was limited. With the age of Steam and then the age of Jets travel barriers have been demolished. Combine that with the age of the telegraph, the syndicated newspaper, global media, and now global internet, intellectual cultural barriers are quickly being demolished too. 

In the US in the mid 1800s we were a country of island communities, which by the end of the 1800s was dissolving away and creating cultural conflict. 

I strongly agree with others that one of the major drivers of the rise of radical Islam in the 1970s is a reaction to the flood of Western, Eastern, and Oriental cultures  and cultural ideas into the middle east's Islamic cultures.  But a positive impact would be something like Reddit where a globally based set of cultures is developing too. 

The question I present here is this: As we move forward and as the last corners of the world are tied into the global communication network, how long until the majority of the planet shares in a set of common global cultures? That is how long until the majority of people on Earth identify more with something they share in globally than something locally? 

Already in my real life I can find a handful of people who understand my internet culture references but I still cannot find that many. 

Second question (and background):

Political units tend to be more stable when the citizens of that unit share common ideas and agree upon basic things. As the internet spreads global cultures, how long until people began feeling comfortable enough with a global community to begin to truly believe that a global government might be something worth having. 

I know a few people already think this would be a good idea, but I am talking about the masses. As it stands today, separatist movements are the dominant wave. How long until a global culture develops enough strength and support to encourage a global, shared, government? ",17,14

To understand how we arrived at the current financial system, we need to understand the history of prior systems.   The following is a quick summary of the rules that defined human relationships in the various systems people were forced to live in.

**KING/SUBJECTS**

Prior to primitive life, the relationship of man started out where the King/Emperor owned everything, including his subjects, and the people and property all belonged to him by DIVINE RIGHT( a right conferred from one god or another).

Freedom, Security, and Opportunity in this system was being a King or in the favor of a King.

**OWNER/SLAVES &amp; SERVENTS**

Then America was created and people became owners by operation of government via Title to land through land grants and other legal means (rules created by people).  But it took a revolution to get there.  Despite telling everyone that all men were created equal, in this system there were owners and slaves and the slaves were the legal property of men ( incidentally, so were the women at this time.)

Freedom, Security, and Opportunity in this system was being an owner or in the favor of an owner.  If you were a woman, being subservient and attractive to your owner often helped you gain favor.

**OWNER/LABORER or EMPLOYEE**

The next system we evolved to was the modern capitalist system.  This was a system where there were owners of capital and employees/laborers.  The workers were paid in ownership/capital units (financial assets such as banker's notes or gold/silver).  To get to this system it took a very uncivil CIVIL WAR.  Although not perfect, this system made it easier for those who were formerly slaves and property to become owners and control those below them.

The primary form of capital was the banker's note.  It was a debt instrument created when banks made loans backed by capital that eventually became the currency of the land called dollar bills.  People obtained these notes by pledging the assets they owned or their future labor.  Over time and lots of borrowing by people, businesses, and governments, trillions and trillions of these notes have been created globally.  The financial system is not a perfect system, but it was better than systems that came before it in a game where we needed humans to labor to produce goods and services. 

Freedom, Security, and Opportunity in this system is having ownership via title, possession, or financial assets or being in favor with someone possessing former.

**[FUTURE SYSTEM](http://unlockedfuture.com)**

Now that technology (artificial intelligence and robotics) is replacing the need for humans to labor to produce goods and services with relatively little need for financial capital or people to control each other for labor, a new system must be created.  We need a system that unlocks human potential and creativity and promotes efficiency and productivity.  A system that accounts for a world that is rapidly connecting and collaborating.

If all people are really supposed to be created equal, we need a system where EVERYONE has Security, Freedom, and Opportunity from birth.  Moreover, it must be a system that rewards people for their productivity in a dynamic and increasingly technologically dependent world.  And a system that considers the environment and the other common interests of people around the world.

Clearly this current financial system of PRIVATE ownership that was BAILED OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT (the PUBLIC) is no longer environmentally sustainable and making increasing numbers insecure without much freedom.  Further, from a LEGAL and LOGICAL standpoint, it really is not much better than slavery because without publicly bailed out financial instruments, families have no freedom or security in this system.

If a new system is created where everyone has FREEDOM, SECURITY, and OPPORTUNITY, then people can be incentivized to advance the system as life becomes more efficient due to evolving technology.  Further, people would not be afraid to be creative and take risks (just like the kids of financially wealthy people in this system) because they knew that failure would not result in homelessness or loss of freedom.

Just like the OWNER/EMPLOYEE relationship was a big jump from KING/SUBJECT or OWNER/SLAVE, with a little creative thinking, people around the world can come together to create a new system where no human has to live in fear because they know that the system has their back.

The question now is not whether humanity will be compelled to create a new future system to accommodate rapidly advancing technology and environmental constraints, the more convulsive issue is how will we get there in light what it took for society to advance historically?",61,121

I feel as though it's likely that at some point soon after singularity AI will seek to gain all knowledge in an attempt to form 'complete' understanding. The time in which AI influences humanity, negatively or positively, will be short. The connection we had, consecutive links in the same evolutionary chain, will become irrelevant as AI evolves and expands into the infinite universe.

With DNA nanorobots, gene editing techniques, mechanical robotics, self driving vehicles, quantum entanglement, lab meat/food, and last but not least, super AI, our reality would change drastically, and nothing would need to be done, ever. Not buildings, software, medicine, none of that. Granted this is far into the future. 

My only concern is the idea of p-bodyzation. Recently i saw a thread here on reddit explaining the idea of a living being experiencing life with all its senses, but not being a conscious being at all. 

Like a zombie with no munchies for brains. What if we get to a point where all the wanted experiences/sensations of the human being is being funneled directly into our bodies? Virtual reality is already here, and its rational to guess that some people would want to experience the world through it. The only thing preventing us from becoming full on p bodies in the future i think, is the need for human connection. 

Tldr; 

Automation could ultimately strip us from the sense of wonder and curiosity, which i think are vital for human consciousness. Everyone could be trapped inside their own bubble, not wanting anything else, not wanting to discover.

We have to want to discover more, and more.

In the modern world the reason capitalism has worked so well is because there is a finite amount of resources in the world and capitalism is a system that forces people to compete for those finite resources which forces people to innovate in order to continue receiving those resources. 

Now the reason communism in the 20th century collapsed was because since resources are so finite there was no way to properly divide all of their resources between everyone. This combined communist countries falling behind capitalist country economically because of a lack of competition lead innovation led to the fall of communism. 

But recently I had a thought that was sparked when I was listening to an episode of the podcast Hello internet. In the episode I was listening too they were talking about self-driving cars and the possibility of a drastic increase in the amount of automation in the workforce leading to us being able to create a lot more with a lot fewer workers. They then went on to talk about what to do about all the people who will lose their jobs over this. Then there was one term that got me thinking, and that term was a post scarcity society. 

This term means a society that has advanced to the point where resources are no longer finite. And I just kept thinking about the industrial revolution and how drastically resource production increased in such a short amount of time. This makes me think that maybe humans will reach this post scarcity world withing 500 years through automation and technological advancement. And if there is no shortage of resources that are easily accessible why would anyone want to work, let alone do hard labour? Humans might leave not only the labour force but also the workforce altogether. Leading to a weird form of communism where everyone is economically equal.

If you want want to imagine what I mean here think of the movie Wall-E. No humans work in that movie yet everyone seems to have everything in abundance and economic equality. That is what I mean by is Communism inevitable. 

What do you guys think about this? I haven't been able to get this out of my mind for a while so I thought I would see what the people here thought about this. ",106,15

&gt; Just did a re-read of these amazing articles. Every time I see a discussion about some moral outrage, or conflict in the middle east, or the state of the economy, or the disruption of the environment I worry about the lack of interest in this topic. I do not mean to imply the other issues are unimportant or undeserving of discussion, but the potential impact of AI, and to a greater extent technological progress, dwarfs them all and receives so little attention in comparison.
&gt; 
&gt; To quote from the article, which is itself quoting from Game of Thrones:
&gt; 
&gt; ""Were so busy fighting each other but the real thing we should all be focusing on is whats coming from north of the wall.
&gt; 
&gt; http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html
&gt;
&gt; http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html

...which led to a discussion. I elaborated some thoughts I've been mulling over for a while...

&gt; I've seen figures which suggest AI (just ANI in this case) could replace 45% of jobs. Even that would be unimaginable and impossible to deal with within the prevailing economic system. 
&gt; 
&gt; The modern-ish concept of wage labor is only a couple hundred years old anyway, not some immutable state.
&gt; 
&gt; A time when most of what would have been historically considered productive human labor will have no value is quick approaching. The inability of us to get our heads around this does not change it, sadly. Sit for a minute and really ponder the implications.
&gt; 
&gt; Even speculation on how to avoid the historical precedence (read: civilization's collapse) at this point is better than the current typical response. That response is the eternally disproved but continuously regurgitated ideological fantasy that we can fight technological progress (without society degenerating into barbarism). This IS going to happen and we can't stop it. Moreover, this change is arriving swiftly. 
&gt; 
&gt; These changes coincide with the more widely known general ecological degradation and its less often expanded upon effects on water and food supplies. We're just experiencing the tip of what are predicted to be serious disruption to those two things. A couple years ago global energy demands were predicted to double by ~2050. Remember that coal is the fastest growing energy source (or it was until recently, natural gas might have overtaken it). The increased use of fossil fuels will certainly accelerate the aforementioned food and water problems - they're growing exponentially.
&gt; 
&gt; A small aside here... We are getting really good at predicting things. We should be taking well supported models seriously.
&gt; 
&gt; So what happens when the economy cannot provide employment for a large portion of people? What happens when food and water also become more expensive? What happens when energy costs for transporting said food become increasingly costlier? MIT studies suggest civil unrest. Look around at all the countries which experienced recent revolutions and recessions. Which among them are flourishing now a few years later?
&gt; 
&gt; It is a certainty that society in its current arrangement will not function under fast approaching future conditions. The logical conclusion must be that society will change as these conditions are realized. Whether this change is an adaptation or a collapse depends on society's response.

As I said I've been thinking about this stuff for a while. I finally wrote it down and so I thought I'd share it with you guys. It is my hope that eventually this discussion reaches the ears of those in a position not just to do something, but also with the capacity to understand its importance - so lets discuss.

Much less important are what **I** think the solutions are, but I'll share them to start things off. 

As for super-intelligent AI, caution and improvement of human intelligence are all we can do.

For the socio-economic problems, which are less intangible, I feel the solutions lie in 2 main technology categories. 

The first are what I call 'means of production' technologies, since a vast swath of people will not be able to get what they need from the 'market' owing to not having anything of value in exchange. (I do not think basic income is a solution since it is a moral position with no real mechanism.) I speak of 3D printing and nano-tech.

The second is a revolution in energy production. Energy use in desalination and 24-7-365 hydro/aquaponic is our way to provide food and water for people as the natural world loses the ability to do so. The criteria for an energy revolution:

1. Non-carbon. If we keep spewing carbon, global warming.

2. Abundant. It stands to reason if we can produce only a portion of our energy from this source, the rest will be provided by existing means. I will go further and claim a revolution would need to provide at least an order of magnitude increase in the available energy. 

3. Cheap. If the source of energy is not cheaper than carbon sources, there will be economic pressures which discourage its use. 
When I say cheap, what I really mean is nearly-if-not-completely-free. How else will people with no income afford it? It needs to be sufficiently cheap that governments will be strongly incentivized to distribute it freely rather than deal with potential unrest from the masses of unemployable.

Liquid fuel nuclear fission is my personal best hope here. Other contenders are nuclear fusion and solar, with some reservations. Fusion seems extremely difficult and solar, while consistently improving really does not meet the criteria I set forth yet.

**Edit:** I see a lot of downvotes, which I presumes means disagreement. I would like to hear from you. What am I missing?",20,10

In the future we might plug ourselves into a machine, that will let us experience a virtual reality which looks and feels just like normal world, but time spent in there goes slower. Say 1 hour in VR could be 1 minute in real life, or even 1 second... depending on how far the tech can be taken. Each multiplier of speed will require same multiplier for processing power. You can't just do that if you can only barely run the VR itself. Maybe to save power, one could use lower quality world to increase the speed. And he doesn't actually need to use this for a full life-experience, he could simply accelerate time for a simpler, focused task.

Imagine the possibilities? A school kid could watch 5 movies while waiting for next lesson to start. Maybe you could take a nap whenever you feel like, effectively blurring the whole idea of timezones. Researchers could speed up their work 100 fold, new software could be written in no time at all, and so on...

Ok, technically how would that work? Specifics i don't know, but we can assume a complete understanding of the brain is needed first. Ability to digitize and undigitize the brain state might be 1 way, actually living the experience completely digitally. Maybe nano-technology inside our brain to re-arrange data to the after-state of VR. Or maybe our new tech-brains can simply handle the speed. It might be that we have nano-tech neurons inside that do all the work.",7,5

As a scientists, I've even had an urge to maybe think about moving towards a career path involving it (although I don't think the risk/job security is my thing).

Here's what I'm talking about:

You've seen it before, maybe spaceships that are ""living"" made out of cells and tissues arranged in a complex way.

I want to talk about the reality of that.

We are getting better and better at engineering all sorts of enzymes, creating ""artificial"" cells, etc. Say we hit a brick wall with silicon chips that is inconvenient. There's nothing, technically, preventing us from creating devices like computers based on neurons/neural networks. We could in theory hook particular reporter neurons/neural groups in a system like this up to outputs that give us data back. A sort of biological/mechanical technological hybrid.

In my undergrad I had the fortune to take an intensive electrophysiology course in association with one of my neuroscience courses, we spent a lot of time doing voltage clamping experiments with neurons, and while there are a lot of limitations to something like this, I imagine it could be done one day.

I'm fairly confident somebody could possibly simulate something like a small, old program entirely using neural cultures and growth factors in a plate and and then hook it up via a voltage clamp and display the output graphically in some way today if they worked hard enough at it. 3D printing could be used to accomplish something like that as well one day, I'd imagine.

I imagine there'd be all sorts of other things we could potentially do if we start talking about designing our own cell types or enzymes.

Edit: I realize that specialty schooling shouldn't be funded by government.  But general education beyond a high-school diploma should be available to all adults. As in, math, science, ethics, social/cultural, computer use, art, and even field trip events to allow people to be engaged in the community.

It will be capable of being paired with bluetooth mouses, keyboards, and headphones. Our desks will have built in wireless charging so we won't need wire clutter anymore. They can be tablet sized, and folded up into a cell phone, and folded again to be snapped onto the wrist like a watch. It can even be transparent as well since we'll likely have see through displays by then. The motherboard and battery will be tiny and thin enough to be just a small sliver on the side of the card. We can clip em on to our sunglasses and have augmented reality and virtual reality instantly. And with seamless mobile payments, it will act like a wallet and ID card.

Just a few hundred years ago, everyone and everything was the legal property of the King unless he chose to give you rights.

America was created to give a few people property rights while women, African Americans, and Native Americans essentially had none in the early years. 

Then as industrialization and the need for specialized labor grew, property rights were expanded to include women and African Americans so that people would be incentivized to labor and those who produced would be rewarded.  

Bank notes, or currency, were born out of loans backed by property or future labor of individuals or productivity of corporations to promote trade.  As people and corporations produced more, banks lent more, and as banks lent more, there were more bank notes available for trade.  **The bank note is essentially a small piece of present or future property(goods or services) right created by banks that everyone trusts backed by some sort of productivity.**  In the past 100 years, over $60 trillion in bank notes has been created arising out of bank loans to governments, businesses, and individuals.  

Under the rules of this system, a problem for people arises when they can't get bank notes because people need bank notes to survive.  Or in the case of students, they now must borrow tens of thousands of bank notes just to go to one year college so they can hopefully get a job that may or may not exist to pay back the loan with their labor, or property right.



However, as technology replaces the need for people to labor beause people are increasingly not as efficient as exponentially improving technology, the need to incentivize people to labor with property rights via bank notes will be obsolete.  Technology does not need bank notes to produce.  Technology can produce very efficiently, 24/7, with energy and relatively little human assistance.

Further, digital technology such as eMail, virtual reality, and digital movies, education, music, and games can be produced and distributed in essentially unlimited quantities with zero marginal cost.

The role of government is to perform those tasks that protect and promote the common good.  National defense and the supervision of our legal system, or the rules we are forced to live by, are easy examples.  Going forward, as technology becomes more efficient and rapidly replaces the need for people, society will have to determine whether it is in the common good that such technology belong to the commons and NOT private parties.  And whether the current means of exchange, property rights created out of debt, or bank note based currency is obsolete?

Just like the King did not want to give up power, neither did the slave owners, don't expect the current owners of private property rights via the government bailed out financial system to give up their control very easily either, unless they can be shown a better system demonstrating that their control via bank note property rights are obsolete.",5,1

This is going to be something i'll be doing for fun and on my own pace.

  To be honest with you, im not the most creative guy when it comes to creating from scratch, but i find that im able to work around an idea and make something somewhat original. I have finally decided which point in time the story will take place, ~ **year 2080**. I've been researching a lot about what type of technology might be available at that time and just how advanced things might be when i realized ""/r/Futurology is the only place on the internet that can help me""

**How you can help me**

* suggest a gadget that you think might be available at that time

* how do you think human transportation will be dealt with during that time, cars (hover, electromagnetic, wheels, jets etc.) 

* how will communication be?

* do you think humans will be inhabiting planets other than Earth? (will it be Earth + another planet? will all the humans move to a different planet because earth is uninhabitable?) 

**now the ones with the most relevance to the plot**

* how will we as humans be reproducing (sex obviously, but do you think there will be cloning? or maybe gene alteration to make the perfectly able human being without any disorders?)

* how do you think weapons will be like? (knives, rifles, pistols, artillery, fighter jets etc.) 

* Ammunition? (regular bullets? freaking laser beams? i havnt really read too much about this one)

* AI (i believe this is very possible and but what im looking for is, how smart and independent do you think they'll be by 2080?)


**please keep in mind that nothing really has to be realistically accurate, it can be totally from your imagination but please keep it borderline realistic.**

**Also, in this plot, there will be a 10 year period or so where technology will boom. As in, there will be an earth shattering discovery that will aid in the technological advancement that this story will take place in. This will happen roughly 10-15 years before the story takes place. so try to keep that in mind, hell you can even suggest what that discovery might be.**


im really excited to hear all your suggestions and theories, i just hope someone responds haha",22,6

Is it the robot programmer, the CEO, the owner of the Robot, the last person to give a command, or the robot itself?

Thinking about it...we already have autonomous systems that are a part of society that result in many deaths of people directly and indirectly where no one person can be held responsible. For example, systems that decide the distribution of resources, or government laws.

When we imagine an autonomous system capable of killing, our imaginations anthropomorphise and jump to Terminator or Big Dog looking robots. Yet those will likely be a minority of robots. What about the robot operating the water treatment plant making a mistake? What about the programming that would control road traffic causing deaths? 

We need to be able to answer the morality with these abstract things and see the big picture if we hope to also answer it for humanoid-ish robots; a smaller sector of the autonomous world.

I suspect that once we begin discussing this we will realize there is no where to point the finger. But is that an issue? I hope we can also ask ourselves why we want to point the finger so badly post hoc when studies continue to show that punishment does not prevent crime, while incentives do. We are so used to hitting people with justice hammers in revenge that we feel lost, afraid, and confused when there is no where to point the finger.

What I think autonomous systems need to keep them safe is a system of responsible incentives...the same things that keeps governance and economic systems operating correctly. Lets spend less time trying to figure out the flow chart for finding who to point fingers at and more time questioning if the incentives and power distribution of society is creating a safe environment for autonomy. Autonomy is going to be more of a risk than robot crime, its going to massively unemploy and relocate power and incentives. Responsible environment and incentives is the key. Trying to integrate autonomy into our existing harm reduction system that relies on after the fact punishment is not the solution.

&gt; Our blog is about the impact on **human employment** of **robotics**, **Machine Intelligence**, and possible future **Machine Sapience**.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. We believe it is possible that robotics and thinking machines will eventually take **all human jobs**.
&gt; 1. We believe **Machine Intelligence** will be capable of taking over many **more** human occupations and jobs than other futurists and forecasters are predicting and faster than they are predicting.
&gt; 1. We believe there are limits to Machine Intelligences ability to displace human jobs that rely on complex choices. **Sapience** enables people to apply **wisdom**, **judgement**, and **opinion** to real-world systems that are at best partially understood.
&gt; 1. We believe **Machine Sapience** requires our machines to make **incorrect predictions**. It requires humans to allow machines to be wrong if machines are to learn and to determine their own path. And we believe we have an idea about how to **design sapient machines**
&gt; 1. We believe machine sapience **cannot result from emergent behavior within currently deployed and even currently planned computer systems**; it will not happen unless humans make it happen. Although widely-accepted tests for intelligence exist, no such tests yet exist for wisdom, judgement, and opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; We plan to steer a rational, thoughtful, and minimally subjective course somewhere between the extremes of abundance theory and an evil killer robot apocalypse.

...I like that they say they're somewhere in between abundance and killer robots, but ALL human jobs?!?

I'm working with a program now that I should give you some background on.  Back in the very early 80s on a TI-99, I had a math program for my age bracket.  It was created perfectly, but only did counting/addition/subtraction.   I played it like a video game and enjoyed myself, but I ""beat it"" by doing all that it had.   It led me to an advanced knowledge of math early on for my level in school and got me placed in gifted classes.

I'm working on recreating a similar project for mobile App.  Except I'll keep going on the math past early math.   There's some people doing this now, but I want to have mine even more automated, spoon fed, binary search your level of math, etc.   I'm passionate about this and even if I don't make money, the fact I'm offering a free app might compete with others and keep them honest?

Anyway, a thought crossed my mind.  Since math is a universal language, any country could download this app.  And since smart phones are going down in price, even people in third world countries will get them since they need phones to begin with(Farming/weather reports).   So not now, but maybe years from now, a kid might use my app and advance many stages past their grade/age would have them placed.   This thought is basic.

The Last Starfighter approach would be to have a way of contacting these kids and maybe fast tracking them to a more advanced school.   As a private individual, this is way beyond my means even if I could facetime them on the ap and confirm they're really smart for their age.   But I think moving forward, as we make spoon fed education tools available for the whole world, we should be looking out for the kids racking up high scores.  I'm not sure you subscribe into the theory that the best minds should be fast tracked on advanced education, but a small version in a gifted school did me well early on in my life.    Maybe someday when more and more apps are automating education, an organization could fund a special school for the highest scoring players on education apps.

I'm not saying this is a future, but its a cool thing to think about.

2097,2015-4-30,2015,4,30,11,34cq1b,The FACTS as we currently know them about the EmDrive and Cannae Drive,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/34cq1b/the_facts_as_we_currently_know_them_about_the/,JordanLeDoux,1430360923,"Every so often an article gets posted here about the state of these devices. These often end up being quite heated arguments between groups of people (on all sides) that are working with partial information, are conflating speculation with what we know, and that misunderstand what scientists are actually looking at.

So, because this will continue to be a hot topic, and because Eagleworks will be conducting more experiments in full vacuums soon, I wanted to collect what information has actually been revealed, not what has been speculated in sensationalist articles, echo chambers, and comment sections.

Let me be clear, although I described the news articles as sensationalist, the facts as we currently know them are ALSO quite sensational.

## EmDrive vs. Cannae Drive

The EmDrive and the Cannae Drive are **two different things**. They were independently invented by two people. The EmDrive was invented by Roger J. Shawyer, a British aerospace engineer who has a background in defense work as well as experience as a consultant on the Galileo project (a European version of the GPS system).

The Cannae Drive was invented by Guido P. Fetta and was formerly known as the Q-Drive.

They both are claimed to use a ~~specially shaped cavity, with constricted openings,~~ cone shaped cavity in metal, closed at **both** ends, and operate by using some form of electromagnetic radiation in the microwave spectrum to generate a directional force. The EmDrive is claimed to receive its force from the shape of the cavity, while the Cannae drive was claimed to receive its force from the shape of the cavity, and from specially shaped ""slots"" on the inside of the cavity.

The EmDrive has been tested in a laboratory twice independently (once by a team at the China Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) in Xi'an, and once by Eagleworks at the Johnson Space Center), under different conditions and setups, while the Cannae Drive has only been independently tested once by Eagleworks.

Although they are independently invented, and different in shape, and the inventors claim different effects are the cause of the resulting force, because of their similarities in concept and mode of operation, as well as the particular method of interacting with the microwaves, it is likely that if they work they operate on the same principle regardless of what the inventors claim.

## The Inventors Claims

Both inventors claim that their devices do not actually violate any physics, and instead take advantage of very particular but speculative aspects of existing physics. **It is important to note that while both theories are being tested, Eagleworks is testing whether or not the devices work as a SEPARATE thing from why they work.**

Shawyer claims that the EmDrive works only on radiation pressure. Light is both wave-like and particle-like. Though it has no mass, it does have momentum, and the fact that light exerts a very small force on the objects it interacts with is well documented.

Shawyer claims that the pressure exerted by light is a result of the group velocity of the wave, not the singular velocity of the the photon that interacts. He then uses this to contend that radiation pressure is actually a Lorentz force. As scientists understand it now, the momentum of a photon is related to phase velocity, while group velocity measures the propagation of information.

Fetta contends that the Cannae Drive creates a bias in the quantum vacuum and pushes against it. Basically, physicists think that at very, very small scales, much smaller than atoms or even protons, space bubbles with quantum fluctuations. This bubbling is represented in the math as sort of imaginary particles that are spawned in pairs, and then very, very quickly the pairs come back together and destroy each other. Fetta contends that the Cannae Drive creates a bias where some of these particles never come back together, and then ""pushes"" against them.

## Cannae Tests So Far

The only independent (not conducted by the inventor, the inventor's company, or by labs hired by the inventor) tests of the Cannae Drive that I can verify have been done by Eagleworks at the Johnson Space Center.

They performed three tests:

1. The device as the inventor designed it.
2. The device as the inventor designed it *without* the slotting that the inventor claimed was critical. (Called the ""null test"".)
3. A control test that used the same energy, but without the cavity present in the design.

The results of these tests were as follows:

1. Approximately 25 micronewtons of thrust at 50 Watts.
2. The same results as test #1, showing that at the very least, the slotting provided no benefit or detriment to the effect happening.
3. No measurable thrust.

For each of these tests they use a torsion pendulum which could measure thrust down to about 10 micronewtons or so. They also ran the test multiple times. In addition, they ran the test in two directions, making sure that the directional thrust changed with the direction of the device (to attempt to eliminate the possibility of noise or instrumentation error). The Cannae Drive passed these test, and the control test showed it was unlikely (although not impossible) to be a heating or air current effect.

The confusion over the naming of the ""null test"" however led many people to think that NASA reported the same thrust in the control test. This was not the case. The fact that the null test showed only that the inventor's ideas for why thrust was being measured were incomplete or wrong, but it is certain that thrust was measured. That still does not eliminate other factors in measurement or the test setup that might have accounted for the measured thrust, although the control test does make the list smaller.

The ""null test"" also was only performed on the Cannae Drive, and has no bearing on the EmDrive tests, as the EmDrive has no such features which might have be tested in this way, which has been another point of confusion among many people.

## EmDrive Tests

The following independent tests have been performed for the EmDrive.

1. A test at 2500 W of power during which a thrust of 750 millinewtons was measured by a Chinese team at the Chinese Northwestern Polytechnical University.
2. A test at 50 W of power during which a thrust of 50 micronewtons was measured by Eagleworks at the Johnson Space Center at ~760 Torr of pressure. (Summer 2014)
3. A test at 50 W of power during which a thrust of 50 micronewtons was measured by Eagleworks at the Johnson Space Center at ~5.010^6 torr or pressure. (Early 2015)
4. A test at 50 W of power during which an interferometer (a modified Michelson device) was used to measure the stretching and compressing of spacetime within the device, which produced initial results that were consistent with an Alcubierre drive fluctuation.

All these tests were conducted with a control device that did not produce thrust.

**UPDATED**

NOTE: a better source was found for the Chinese results, and I have changed this section to reflect that.

Test #1 was conducted at the direction of lead researcher Juan Yang. She tested the device at several power levels and frequencies using the same equipment used to test Ion Drives. The given result above was the largest result produced. Her team estimated that the total measurement error was less than 12%. [Source 1](http://www.emdrive.com/yang-juan-paper-2012.pdf) | [Source 2](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/04/evaluating-nasas-futuristic-em-drive/)

Tests number 2 and 3 were performed multiple times, changing direction of the device and observing a corresponding change in the direction of force. They were not especially careful about controlling for ALL variables however, mostly owing to the lack of funding for the project. The positive tests have resulted in more funding becoming available, although it is still very, very little, and possibly not enough to explain where the error occurred if the measurement is error of some kind.

Test #4 was performed, essentially, on a whim by the research team as they were bouncing ideas off each other, and was entirely unexpected. They are extremely hesitant to draw any conclusions based on test #4, although they certainly found it interesting.

The Eagleworks team has been able to dedicate very little hardware towards this experiment, as there has been almost no dedicated funding for this experiment. The lack of funding is related to how outlandish the claims are to those who understand physics very well, and the lack of adequate explanation on the math behind the devices from the inventors.

## Criticism

Much criticism has been given to the experiments. Some of it is warranted, but some of it is confusion.

The idea that the control produced thrust is false, and has been perpetuated due to people interpreting the name ""null test"" to correspond to the control test. Other physicists have attacked the results based on the null test as well, although they have limited the criticism mainly to showing that the explanations provided by the inventor are wrong, not to invalidate the data collected so far.

There has also been much criticism over not testing in a vacuum, (although they have since tested the device at approximately 5.0x10^-6 torr pressure and achieved identical results), while others have claimed the team did not account for the Earth's magnetic field.

I can't find any definitive accounts that the team accounted for Earth's magnetic field, but many find it hard to believe that they would be putting so much effort into these tests without accounting for something that is so easy to account for.

Others have criticized the measurement devices, specifically that so little force was measured. While the measured thrust was over 5 times the sensitivity limits of the torsion pendulum, with such small forces it is much easier for some sort of noise or other factor to appear to be thrust. 

Relatedly, some have claimed that tests at such small power are useless. The main reason the tests were conducted at such low wattage have to do with the hardware that was available to test with, and Eagleworks is planning on conducting a higher power test sometime this year.

Some have questioned why no companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, or SpaceX have attempted to investigate the device, but regardless of how likely these companies find the results so far, the largest reason is almost surely that the devices are both patented by their inventors.

Most however have criticized the tests based on the fact that there is no explanation for such results, and that they apparently contradict known laws of physics. With no understanding of the mechanism of such a device, the obvious answers seem to violate principles that nearly every other experiment in history have followed. For some, this alone is enough to dismiss the data, regardless of the controls used and the directional results.

## What's Next

Following the positive results last year and early this year, Eagleworks have been able to dedicate more and better hardware to the experiment. They plan to conduct the experiment with more controls at higher power this year, and when they are able to achieve results higher than 100 micronewtons for either device, they plan on having the test replicated at the Glenn Research Center, the Jet Propulsion Lab, and John Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.

If the experiment for either or both devices is replicated at higher power, and again at the other labs, it is likely that the physics community will work very hard to try and invalidate the experiments as there is little explanation for the results. This is good. This is science. You don't do science by proving correct things, you do science by disproving wrong things.

If either device gets to that stage however, it is likely that someone will start on a test in space very quickly. The applications for a device that functions as these appear to would basically replace every form of transportation and thrust invented by humans to date. Such a device would easily be used to make cars, planes, bikes, boats, etc., all more efficient, clean, and cheap.

There are many reasons to doubt we will ever be flying to Saturn with one of these things, but it is equally important to talk about science in the context of what we KNOW.

We KNOW that this experiment is producing results that contradict hundreds of years of other data, although that data was collected under different circumstances with different characteristics.

We KNOW that thrust is being measured, and that it is beyond the range of ""noise"", and that it is directional according to the device, but we do not know if the cause is thrust actually being generated, or some other factor which makes it appear that way.

We KNOW that Fetta's explanation for the Cannae Drive did not pass the ""null test"", making it extremely unlikely that his explanation is correct. We also KNOW that Shawyer's explanation for the EmDrive involve physics that won't actually be directly tested with this device, and so even a positive result doesn't necessarily vindicate his explanation.

We KNOW that it's very likely that the results are spurious, and that is why we are dedicating so few resources to the tests that the team didn't even have vacuum rated capacitors for over six months. But we also KNOW that a positive result, however unlikely, would be a world changing discovery, and so the possible reward is great, while the extremely limited resources we are committing to the project give us little risk.

And finally, we KNOW that the teams involved at the moment are well educated, well trained, experienced researchers dedicated to figuring out what is *true*, not what people *wish* was true, and so we should have little reason to criticize the researchers personally for their involvement in such a project.

All of the stuff we know has come out *without any results being published*, because all the researchers involved, in the US and in China, are committed to doing a thorough job before drawing final conclusions. When you get a peek behind the curtain, science looks incredibly messy, but the result is a better understanding of our Universe, and that's always worth it no matter how these tests pan out.

I'm a premed who wants to be a doctor so granted, I don't know much about the technology and may not be in a position to say that these criticisms on new technologies are unwarranted.

However, I just wanted to take a moment to say, **look how far we've come**. We saw Sci-fi movies as kids and fantasized about the things we can do in the future. However, the future is here and we have technology like the Microsoft Hololens shown this week. I've read accounts from people with firsthand experience with the device, and not one person has said it was any less than super impressive. The only complaint has been that the FOV is small, but **think**, that will improve over time with more R&amp;D. Just the fact that it's here provides a base from which to work with and is breath-taking and awe-inspiring. We also have Oculus who have made virtual reality A REALITY, Elon Musk who is aiming to provide us with commercial space flights, Google Glass, Desktops in our pockets (with Windows 10), and more! I honestly think this is the golden age of technology, with Sci-fi not being so ""fi"" anymore, if you get my drift. Give it 10 more years and life is going to be nothing short of amazing.

Ya never can tell, can you? However, if these work out to actually deliver, what can we look forward to? 

Now that we would have very fast space travel, that is we could send research missions to the outer system (lets not delve into the potential for FTL here, save that for later) and we can explore the ocean moons like Europa, what kind of political and technological and economic developments might this invoke or cause to react. 

In historical studies (especially in my area, the gilded age 1865-1901) we see how technological changes invoke many reactions across the spectrum of society. The ability to inexpensively travel space would make reaching Mars much more feasible. Not only in the fact of sending out expeditions, but sending out rescue operations. 

When we sent expeditions to the far corners of the Earth in the 19th century, Africa, Asia, the Arctic and Antarctic a rescue was problematic. Imagine if we could create a standing ""skyguard"" of rescue ships because of the potential for this drive.  (I would also hope the skyguard would search for asteroids that might hit the Earth, and Mars now that we would have people there). 

The commercial applications of asteroid mining also become a reality as well as the research developments of building a research station or fifty in orbit of Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn. We can begin to study planetary sciences with many more examples to work with.

Some questions to ponder. Will the reduction in cost of both space travel and hopefully the lifting to space with more traditional methods as are being developed by a dozen or so firms, help poorer countries have access to space? Will, say, East Africa, or South America be able to pool their resources to establish their own space programs? 

Of course, once we actually establish a presence in space we will see a dramatic technological boom simply to make life in space livable.  Once we have sufficient industrial infrastructure up there we will build large rotating stations (assuming we don't create artificial gravity first) for permanent populations and hopefully we will develop our control of electromagnetism to create radiation shields, or failing that create composite materials that will do the same work (or just use meters of lead for the walls...).

It really inspires the mind to think of what we MIGHT be doing in just twenty five years.
