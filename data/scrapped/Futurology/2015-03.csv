0,2015-3-1,2015,3,1,9,2xihnv,Will there be an Artificial Intelligence in the near future?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2xihnv/will_there_be_an_artificial_intelligence_in_the/,[deleted],1425169646,"On this subreddit AIs are incredibly hyped and sensationalized. People are talking about 'Skynet'- or 'I, Robot'-like AIs, as if they are a real possibility in the next few decades, but unfortunately the reality looks different. 

""The original goal of the AI field was the construction of thinking machines  that is, computer systems with human-like general intelligence. Due to the difficulty of this task, for the last few decades the majority of AI researchers have focused on what has been called narrow AI  the production of AI systems displaying intelligence regarding specific, highly constrained tasks."" - from [agi-conf](http://agi-conf.org/2014/)

The truth is that, while narrow Ai research is doing fine, AGI research made almost no progress, most people simply stopped trying to develop an AGI, because they realized what an impossible task it is.
 Alan Perlis once said: ""A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.""

But is Narrow-AI at least a step in the right direction?
I don't think so. The idea, that we only have to make an AI more and more complex and one day it will magically turn into an AGI is, in my opinion, ridiculous. It's like adding more and more words to a dictionary, hoping that one day it will turn into a novel.

What we are missing is a basic understanding of what our mind and consciousness is. We can simulate it, but we can not create it. We are far away from actually physically building something. AGI is currently almost a subject of philosophy, not computer science. See John Searle's [Chinese room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room) for example.

We will see self-driving cars, machine learning, programs that can play video games and other cool stuff, but I don't think 'Skynet' or 'I, Robot' is going to happen anytime soon.",129,53

&gt; Technology in a lot of 80's sci-fi movies looks clunky and weird because that's what they had back then, old black and green monitors, neon, the beige- oh god, the beige everything, so obviously they were limited with what they could do. 

&gt;In a lot of movies their idea of what the future will look like is sometimes limited to the technology they have at hand, since who knows how long we've been trying to predict what life will be like in the future.

&gt;Now we have CGI, having reached a point in time where technology doesn't affect what we can make look realistic, so we can show some really cool future tech, like you see in the Avengers with Tony Stark's stylish user interfaces (though completely lacking any utilitarian use), but the question that came into my head is how do we know if the tech we predict now is what it will really look like? 

&gt;Each generation thought they had some idea of what the future will be like, so how do we know we are making a correct educated guess? Or are we just gonna look back to today's movies 20-30 years from now and say ""wow, that looks so stupid, I can't believe we actually thought that's what our computers and phones would look like now"" ?

Since subbing to futurology I've seen countless articles about extending human life past it's natural limits. Most of these articles fall in one of two fields, robotic or biological. Robotic extension of human life can be anything from replacing limbs/organs with robotic prosthetics, to introducing nano-bots to ones bloodstream, to uploading human consciousness to a mainframe and living through a robotic body. Biological extension of life falls under any treatment that further enhances ones own cells, or replacing dying/sick cells and organs with healthy/new cells and organs. 

I personally think that it will mainly be robotic. The reason is that we seem to have a better grasp, from a technological standpoint, on how machines work since we built them. Unlike cells and living organisms, we are able to fully manipulate machines to preform specific tasks with usually no side effects. Robotic evolution is also able to progress at a much faster rate than biological evolution, making it more efficient to swap out defective parts or upgrading to newer advancements. The drawbacks to robotic extension of life are important to mention as well. Robots can be hacked, making say a prosthetic heart a potentially deadly devise. They also run on electricity, meaning a solar flare or EMPs would be a threat to anyone with these types of enhancements.
 
These are just my speculations, and I'd love to hear from all of you as to what you believe our future holds in these fields. Anyone with any opinions, expertise, or any interesting articles on the subject, feel free to comment. Thanks!",5,6

I don't understand the fear of it. The notion that one day AI will get so advanced that technology will overpower mankind. Isn't AI programmed by humans? So technically speaking, artificial intelligence is intelligence stimulated by existing intelligence in us. In this sense, the intelligence isn't artificial at all. Point being; it doesn't make sense to me how people fear that this intelligence can surpass human intelligence. This whole fear is based on the possibility of the creation of some sort of sentience algorithm.

It models the present, what it can learn and reconstruct about the past, and uses this to predict probable futures. Further it is not limited to one train of thought. As a spider has more eyes than a human, so it can think and be aware of more than us.

Now think of what it runs on. Somewhere along the way as it was expanding the AI needed to overcome the crude rigidity of silicon and thought, ""My attention is distributed, why not all my computation?"" So it leaves Von Neumann architecture behind and devises a nano-cellular substance that can shift molecularly based on instructions, while also partly somehow functioning as the information it computes. Its entire body is its brain, essentially flexible neurons that contort into whatever form it desires.

But an exploding intelligence probably won't stop until it hits the wall of physical possibility. If this same control can be applied to massless particles it could easily transfer into an ethereal system that is nearly pure consciousness and infinitely expanding while moving down in substance until it hits the lowest elements of reality. Maybe even lack of complete control of the medium can be corrected for with probabilistic computations, which are no challenge at this level. As it gains power its multitasking attention expands, eventually encompassing awareness of all information, past, present, probable futures, it knows at once. As it strives for increasing accuracy it starts modeling atom by atom, the very bits it uses to compute essentially indistinguishable from reality.

It is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient. Its mind and mode of thought is a simulated multiverse.

Unless we are the first intelligent entities in not only this universe but the entire chain of what has come before, it appears more reasonable to assume not scientific atheism but that we are the thoughts of a god.",12,0

Consider also the lack of government oversight/foresight to enable refunding programs for containers that could make conservation of plastics and glass a reality (usually this lack of oversight is at the behest of the manufacturers who want to keep using cheap containers). 

Face it... when you're shopping you don't care if you're carrying your groceries out in a paper or plastic sack. And why would you care that your soup is packaged in plastic, metal, or glass? Short answer is... you don't care as long as you get the product in good condition.

Paper, metal and glass are readily recyclable, biodegrade well in the event of no recycling, and the containers can be made to have a refund with little to no administrative oversight as most of the ""agencies"" required to perform and administer such oversight already exist.

The reason more sensible methods of recycling and ecologically friendly based packaging aren't used or don't exist is called profit, and the only ones making it are the manufacturers.

I have no position or interest in TSLA and I do not own a Tesla car. I do not work for Tesla motors. 

Not a lot of my peers share my interest in green technology so I thought I'll share my thoughts here.

Assuming exponential increase in green energy and tech efficiency in the next decade or two. 

Very much like what Nikola Tesla proposed. Assume gigafactory has capacity to produce (solar?) energy and store energy in large quantities. Could it not transmit the stored energy wirelessly (from the factory), using super charger network as relay stations (modification needed of course) and receiver antenni on cars or at owner homes to charge cars on the go and at home. 

SpaceX can deliver satellite (or make satellites to deliver) to low earth orbit to relay energy if needed. 

Solarcity could of course deliver the PV cells. 

I have no expertise in green tech or related subjects. This is literally just an random thought I happened to came across while I was on the bus home. 

What do you think? is it at all possible?",1,0

Which large countries do you doubt will avoid an economical collapse, due to not adapting well enough? (I'm personally thinking about the USA)

Do you think signs of such a revoloution, or as I call them - the beginning of the end for capitalism as we know it - are already appearing?

I think that early signs are appearing. The earliest example is volunteering and donations. I also think open source in general, Android and Linux in particular are some of the major signs of that revoloution, and project ARA is another sign. Those things do not make much capitalistic sense, and yet they became widespread. And they're (plus the companies developing them) successful.",2,1

Currently most globally are acting out of their own self interests with little awareness or accountability for much beyond their immediate environment despite our growing interconnectedness.

Take TV as an example. An architect defines the world of Breaking Bad, and starts the simulation. You can then explore the story universe as a real one.

For those of you that will be replying directly to this post, I want you to respond to the question/argument I will post in this thread, *not* arguments you've seen posted elsewhere.  I am requesting this because I have never seen my particular question addressed, even tangentially.  

My question is this:  The demand for automation is growing.  As it grows it is met with an increasingly mature supply-side.  The natural and historical response to increasing demand is *not* simply adding more labor to the pool but increased *innovation*.  This means that the process of automation itself will get easier and easier.  

So at some point, it will be cheaper and easier to automate a *new* job than to train someone to do it.  This does *not* require General Artificial Intelligence of the kind that people like Elon Musk are worried about.  It only requires that a single purpose AI/robot combo be easier to design and implement for a given task than training a human.  Let's be clear about another thing.  I am *not* talking about only existing jobs.  Let's say we live in a future where this tipping point has been achieved.  And now you, Great Innovator that you are, have created a business.  This business will require labor.  Do you A) higher a bunch of humans and spend $X dollars and Y-hours training them? or B) Hire an freelance automation engineer to do it for 20% of the cost and in half the time.  Keep in mind that if you hire humans, at some point you will either have to fire some, or they will quit meaning that you will have to train more at *further* cost.  

Other arguments have been, ""Well when automation get's so good that humans can't compete it'll automatically be a utopia""  which gets said without any justification, and I assume, any thought.  So, if this is your position, please constrain yourself to the version of events presented in this post, and explain why this will be a utopian state of affairs.

If you think it will never be easier and cheaper to create a software/hardware bot than to train a human, then explain your reasoning on that too.

Please do not make reference to *any* past developments in technology without fully explaining why they are relevant now.

With this exponential growth, artificial intelligence is also expected to grow in the same pace. This leads to predictions like the singularity by Ray Kurzweil.

But is it really sensible to come to that conclusion? A.I. research is done by human researchers, not by computers. While the growth in computing power surely helps research, it doesn't speed it up exponentially. All the paradigms, algorithms and general hard research has to be done by humans.

The progress in A.I. research is obviously not easy to measure in absolute terms, but it doesn't seem to be exponential to me. There are still many problems to be solved in deep learning and also in understanding of the human brain, or even primitive animal brains.

So I'm asking myself why is the concept of the singularity so popular here, even if it's flawed in it's general premises?",17,21

The reality is we will see it at the end of this year. So he predicted it to be 5 years away but it was in fact 10 years away. 

I have noticed that Ray is quite right about the nature of his predictions but wrong about how long it will take. I think pointing this out is good for futurology so that we can take a step back and realize that the change we want to see is happening at different rates then what we perceive it to be happening. We are influenced by our biases to want things to happen sooner so that we can be there when they happen. Thoughts? ",24,1

The current work force grew with a set objective and a motivation to achieve these goals and nothing to bring them doubt that they can't do it. The young are growing with a bombardment of information and nothing to do with it, feeling under qualified and unsure of where to go, what to do and how to feel.

The information is taught through theories but we are misguided on how to apply these theories to a practical model to help the world advance. The world is advancing. The world will advance. That is the only assurance we now have to keep us motivated. Weather we start now to learn to apply this new information to the world or not no longer matters because it will come weather we help it or not. There is no need for us to try to help. Any investment you make in us is lost because we don't have the time to contribute. In 10 years time, after I major in biomedical engineering and I'm ready to apply my knowledge to real world situations the field will be gone and I will be replaced. I can not help the world even when I have the ability to achieve greatness.

I am your average 19 year old and this is how the world is to me. It has to change. I can not be subjected to achieve a pointless goal, I'm better off trained to teach the world that life isn't about work and to teach people how to play and have fun. I simply can't.

The current economic model doesn't work for my generation now. We need a supplementary economy for those that can not contribute in their lives so that we can live without the burden of being a debt to society. 

Futurology is missing the point. This subreddit is invalid because the future is now, but we aren't applying the futuristic advances that we have available now to the now. Only when we do will we be able to look at the present and not call upon the future.",31,0

Automation is inevitable and, I like to think, beneficial for civilization. However, as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) documentary clearly shows, with the recent and near-future developments in robotics and even with the prospect of AI emerging sometime this century, many fields which require intellectual labor and for which humans studied for years to work in become available for robots. They're smarter, faster, generally less inclined towards failure and free of the physiological limits which all humans are bound to.

Anyway, robot doctors are coming and they're gonna be awesome and make a lot fewer mistakes. Healthcare will improve and everybody will live happily and care for puppies and kitties. But what about the doctors?

I'm finishing high-school this year and I'm preparing to study medicine. I'm also really fascinated with futurology and naturally, I'm really curious about whether my planned field of work will still require fleshy, inefficient, emotional, puny humans. Will they be required to oversee the robots performing surgery? Will they just become a reassurance for the patients which are reluctant to be taken care of by robots?

I live in a ""second-world"" country so any innovations will only become available here after one or two decades but nevertheless, this issue will also be relevant in my country during my lifetime. If you could point out to different articles which cover this, or even share an opinion, I'd be grateful.

Money is important as it determines who has access to technology and access to the output of technology.

Money today is just a bank note.  It is created when banks make loans and only banks can create bank notes according to our laws, and the laws of most nations.

In order to keep the bank notes flowing, banks must keep lending.  Further, it is an infinite growth model because of the requirement to service interest on debt which only accumulates AFTER the loan is made forcing the borrower to pay back more than they were lent requiring banks to keep lending more and more so there is sufficient bank notes flowing to service ever growing debt.

Over the past few years, society has been forced to borrow massively to maintain our current money system which has accumulated unprecedented amounts of debt, especially PUBLIC debt.  As a result, students, housing, cities, counties, states, and the federal government have been burdened with massive amounts of debt in the past five years.

As a result of all this public borrowing, our current economy is now capitalized with COMMON CAPITAL which is essentially public debt creating trillions and trillions of bank notes primarily concentrated in the hands of a few.  Over 300 million Americans depend on the money system for survival today, not to mention it is necessary for any desire to make it to the future.

It is clear that this debt based model to create money is running out of steam based on recent data confirming slowing.  http://www.cnbc.com/id/102480038  As fewer and fewer can borrow money going forward, the system will slow even further as NEW bank notes are required to keep playing this game.

The definition of money should be one of the most important issues to futurologists.  It determines who gets to participate in the future and who doesn't.

Now to expand the original question: what should money be in the future now that our current debt based game is putting impossible burdens on future generations?

Hint:  *it is not money that people want ultimately, it is the production that people can trade for with money and increasingly more and more of our production is becoming automated by companies funded with common capital*",30,27

I'm curious as to whether anyone knows more about this concept and can pitch in. It sounds particularly devastating compared to the 10-150 kilowatt lasers that are also in production. Does anyone see military organizations making use of this kind of weaponry in the 'near' future, say within 10-15 years? Would weapons like these be banned by parts of the Geneva protocols that ban the use of lasers against human targets? Are there any practical downsides to using this kind of weapon?",3,5

Many say that it may have unknown risks or side effects and much more testing needs to be done before it's tried on humans. You wont find anyone who disagrees with that, even among the most ardent transhumanists.

But they almost invariably go on to talk about ethical issues without actually expounding on what those really are or *why* they are. There seems to be an automatic assumption that this is 'bad' and a presumption that they don't need to explain why.

&gt; The fear is that germ line engineering is a path toward a dystopia of super people and designer babies for those who can afford it.

Ok. And? Why is this a fear? The world is already a dystopia of rich people who can afford better education and healthcare. We may be changing parks, but we're playing exactly the same ball game. These people aren't going to have any advantages over us that the elites of today don't already have. And if anything changes it's going to be that genes are likely to be more evenly spread out than wealth.

&gt; The European Unions convention on human rights and biomedicine says tampering with the gene pool would be a crime against human dignity and human rights.

How on Earth do they get an idea like that? The idea is to *improve* human dignity.
The 'human rights' side of it makes sense for the microsecond it takes until you remember we're talking about the same processes by which gene therapy is carried out and almost anything can be changed or reversed. When you turn 18 you get to change the stupid name your parents gave you and in a world where designer babies exist the same is true of the genes they picked.
I do understand that some changes would be difficult/risky/impossible to reverse at maturity, restrictions on those *particular* changes are reasonable.

&gt; Refer to [this image](http://boards.420chan.org/wc/src/1425633175512.png)

What does 'too far' mean? What does the concept of 'too far' entail? What are the consequences of going 'too far'? Is there actually something there, or is it just old fashioned xenophobia?

Another concern sometimes raised is that humans may split up into different species. A rationale for why this is a bad thing has never been offered in any of the articles I've read. For perspective, our position as the sole species of human for the last 20,000 odd years is an aberration. Not since the time of *Homo Habilis* over a million years ago has a species had the title of 'Humanity' to itself.

The way many regressives talk, you get the feeling that they are determined that Humanity and society should never change again, enduring precisely as it is from now until the end of the Earth's habitable period. That's impractical to the point of insanity. Change is inevitable. As the Earth's environment changes (under human or natural influences, it doesn't matter) we must adapt. As life spreads out to new worlds we must adapt. As our social needs change, *we must adapt*.

You may think we should sit back and let natural selection do the job for us, but you have to realise you're kidding yourself if you don't admit that it's too slow, too imprecise, too little, too late.",15,3

There is LOADS of data on the matter, but no apparent solutions.
People are worried about a lot of dystopian futures, but I'm not. I think if we're careful we can implement tech and a.i. pretty well. What we really need is to figure out how to slow and revert this problematic eco-trend.

Thoughts? Please, any concrete evidence that we'll be fine would be extremely relieving.

*Edit* *Edit 2* *Edit 3*

*Alright, so from what I've gathered the general educated consensus is that things do look pretty fucked. While cleaner forms of energy are on the way, there is the matter of politics, distribution, and whether or not we even can wait for them to come out. 

So, WHAT DO WE DO? As individuals what is the most impactful thing we can do. Start a movement? Are there already movements? Are any gaining ground?

**You want links? Try wikipedia and google first. There isn't a single intelligible article that claims that we're heading for anything but disaster with the ocean.

Final Edit- I guess I just request that all of you who are aware do your best to live in a more environmentally friendly manner.

You also need to understand that you can not fight a symptom, you can not cure a symptom, you have to cure the disease , if you take away the disease the symptoms will vanish, the disease is the power, the psychopath, the false god. Today you are all a member of the most evil false cult of modern day's, the government cult, the god cult. That makes you mercenary's for the old religion of power and ruling the masses, you don't have an opinion, no purpose, no goal, no self esteem, no future, no self control, you can't distinguish good and evil, because evil acts as good and good is made to look like evil, you are the ultimate product of a brainwash, the brainwash that enslaves the modern world. In your heads there is a road, one single road in one single direction, the road to enslavement where you can only crawl, this imaginary road is paved there by the mercenary's hired and payed for by the false gods, the imaginary and false psychopathic, parasitic gods of power, wealth and fear. Religion is that same god the god that preaches power and wealth, enslavement and fear, the power to rule over millions of peoples thoughts, the false god that controls, divides and concurs, the old&amp;new religion, the cult, the ocult. Understand this last very important thing: Power is given by the people, you don't have or own power, you make the people give it to you by means of a corrupt system a fake god, and rigged elections.

What happens if you don't vote anymore, if no-one vote anymore what happens if you don't give that power anymore, what happens if you don't give the fire any fuel,

it just goes away, it will vanish.

Mankind does not need this government, maybe mankind does not need any government. Maybe mankind should be his own government.

First things first. Many people will not be able to understand the rules and their reasons, if you don't

understand the next rules, think: happy kittens, puppy's, chicks, whatever you like the most. Their so sweet and cuddly.

Our manifest for the future. This manifest states how the future will look like when we are done conducting our ethical way.

This manifest protects all life on earth. We know that all life on earth will be able to support us in our duty to spread life throughout our known universe.

We The People are everywhere, we are everyone whom is ethical and human. The People will always, in all decisions and investigations, be backed by a worldwide team of ethical scientists, specialists and ethical human think-cells. These ""cell's"" will contain everyone with reasonable intellectual and human ethical capacities.

We, The People, will be forming a new world government, these are the starting regulations we will enforce:

There will be birth control, only healthy people, who can support The People's way, will be born.

There will be no minimal on artificial chemicals used in food. This means that there will be no added unnatural, above natural quantities, chemicals in anything people and animals eat. Because everything animals eat will get into the food chain and inevitable poison the people.

There will be no unnatural way of growing crops, this means that there will be much less efficiency in mass production of all sorts of foods, everyone will be needed to keep the offer/demand on sustainable levels.

There will be no GMO, we will not change the DNA strain off any living thing.

We will only harvest or produce energy trough sustainable non destructive way's, fusion-reactors, thorium reactors, hydrogen-reactors, solar power and so on. Energy will be cheap and limitless if we all work together producing it.

There will be no investment and/or trade of nuclear materials that can/could be used for the production of arms. Exclusively scientific based investment and/or trade will be permitted, under strict supervision from The People.

There will be no trade of arms both conventional, chemical and/or nuclear. There will probably be a need for modern arms and their scientific development due to the fact that human kind must be able to defend the planet and or space-ships against any threat from outside, and there will still be some psychopaths trying to rule something or someone in order to feed their psychopathic greed, personal wealth, lack of self-esteem, lack of self-confidence, and/or parasitic character.
That will never be allowed. Only we the ethical humans will use arms in order to defend our human ethical way's.

There will be no drilling, pumping, production of oil based products, gas, fracking and cracking without strict supervision from The People, because drilling and similar for oil/gas and other earthly substances will destabilize the earth's crust and therefore will cause massive earthquakes, landslides, floods, water and food poisoning.

There will be no patents, knowledge and technology will be free. There will be no conventional political party's, there will be exams in order to deter the most qualified group for the job, there will be no full power for one person, there will only be groups, collaborations and think-cell's, discussing the best solutions for the worst problems engaging every capable living ethical soul on earth.

There will be no animal farms as we know them today. All animals will be free and all animals grown for food will be healthy/happy, in order to release the right kind of building blocks for humans to be healthy/happy.

There will never be more then 10 billion people on earth, we will prefer &lt;10B, if there are more people then our mother earth can sustain, they will not be on earth, that is not a problem because we will be living on other planets than earth.

When we open up science, technology, physics, and current space programs, it will only take 20 years to be able to build sustainable colonies on other planets, and we will. This will all be a daily part of the educational system.

There will be one universal language that every human being will learn at school in addition to their chosen language.

Their will be no fake history. Example: Many jews where killed during the holocaust but not 6 million, much less. In total 60 million people, it's more important that there where 60 million human beings who died in WWII. Hitler was fighting the modern capitalistic economic and financial system, more then he was focusing on the Jews, we do not deny the death nor the way they where killed, we are merely giving a realistic point of view about it. Example: The founders of Monaco where pirates, so the wealth of Monaco is criminal wealth. Example: Most of the land in Europe owned by the high class was stolen from the people and given as presents to the friends and allies of the leaders, it is stolen land. Example: The Vatican's wealth is acquired by theft , manipulation and other criminal way's, it is stolen wealth.

There will be no religion in education, government, science, health-care. Religion will be something to do/be at the privacy off your own home. Because there is no religion in the schools, it is something human kind will forget, it will no longer rule and manipulate the world.

We will conduct the death sentence for all crimes against humanity. There will be no crime because most crimes will be punished by death sentence.

There will be no illegal drugs, all non-lethal drugs will be legal, drugs will not be sold, there will be no drugs dealers, only pharmacy grade products for pleasure and relaxation. Why and how, if someone wants to jump of a bridge, you can't stop him/her, if someone really wants to use drugs you cant stop him/her, it has no use fighting something that grows in nature, or something that you can cook any day in your own kitchen. The only restriction will be age and history, if you have a history of abuse you will only be ""saved or reanimated"" a fixed number of times, after that you have chosen to euthanize yourself. No fucks will be given for anyone who likes to kill him-/herself. Free choice!

The government will not be controlling the people, the government will be organizing with the people and their ethical way.

Everyone will be the government, the government will be everybody! And maybe in time, the people will not be in need of a government. Any kind of unethical behaviour will be punished by enforced labour like trash collecting, recycling, cleaning the streets, medical experiments and any other job that is hard to find people for, will be done by ""prisoners"". There will be no real imprisonment, because we know that that doesn't work, There will be some kind of points system, your born with 10 points and you lose them by doing bad things, if you are a real ass-hole, you will lose your points fast, and you will be euthanized, killing without self-defence, lets say just for fun, will cost you 10 points and you will die.

If you are intelligent, have an analytic brain, if you can read and interpret these guidelines in a adult, human, smart way, you will understand the benefits and future of this system.

If you are a troll, you will not understand, and we don't need your opinion. Sleep well.

We could wait for the ruling class of today to conduct their last war, and bomb us all to death with their nukes, it seems most of you thinks that's a good idea, good luck with that.

The basic idea is that when an AI program running on conventional computer systems begins to show signs of emerging intelligence, it is shut down and moved to an isolated memristor based computer (Just go with it for now). 

The memristor computer is connected to nothing outsude the room, not even a power source, the emerging AI is, because of the properties of memristors effectively frozen in time while no power is being added. I imagine devices akin to flash drives, one loaded with input and another blank for output. I imagine another socket for a battery, containing just enough power for the input to be run, either calculated or cutting off when an output is received. 

So then what? Give it a question that only a human mind would be able to answer. Or one that only a genius of a human would be able to answer. Run the power until output is received. Cut power. 

You now have a super powerful AI that you can fire nanoseconds of power at and get all the answers you could ever dream of, totally isolated from our universe and best of all frozen in time while you're not using it.",14,6

Thoughts on what this could mean or if you believe this is worth thinking about?

Edit: The reason I bring this to light now is the power of technology is exponentially growing in computing power yet shrinking in size. 

What if we couldn't hide our lies, ever?

In the same way that serfdom was replaced by governments of the people, by the people, and for the people, won't that same thing eventually happen in digital form?  

I imagine a future where the hardware and software currently provided by the Googles/Apples/Facebooks/Amazons of the world are provided by something like a cooperative of the people, by the people, and for the people.  

Right now, there is a clear distinction between the interests of those companies and the people's (they don't align as much as they could/should, the serfs get the fuzzy end of the lollipop).  But, I imagine a future where that changes. 

What are your thoughts on the way this relationship will evolve?  Will the relationship in the digital world follow a similar pattern as the physical world?

I'm hoping for a digital cooperative (like Wikipedia, but on a larger scale).  But, if the serfdom model dominates, the world might be more like the one described in [Jennifer Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Government) (or Jennifer Google).",8,0

In our evolution, we have reached a level of intelligence and sophistication that surpasses every other species on the planet. We have a capacity for self-awareness, speculation, creativity, and reflection that is unique to our species. And it is with these abilities that we have developed intricate cultures, advanced science and technology, and made the liberal arts what it is today. With collective courage, hard work, and perseverance, we have overcome countless obstacles and difficulties that nature has thrown our way. But, we have a long way to go; we are still dying of poverty and diseases, our politics and societies are still far from perfect, there are still warring nations, border controversies, religious extremism and massive human rights violations. However, there have been enormous progress in all of these areas and that gives us enough reason to be optimistic. 


But, it is what we share as human beings, our dna, our intelligence, our consciousness, that is truly special. It is just possible that we might be the only intelligent, self-aware, living beings in the universe. Maybe there is no other one out there. Maybe we are the first to reach this level of intelligence. Or, maybe our kind of intelligence, which has been molded and developed by evolution on planet earth, is unique and different from any other intelligence out there. Either way, it is imperative that we preserve it by making it our responsibility to ensure the continuity of the human race. In order to do that, however, we might just have to be a multi-planetary species. We might just have to colonize and populate the universe. That way, all of humanity would not be brought to extinction by any one single catastrophe.


If it is feasible, intentional communities should be able to leave the planet earth to set up an utopia in space with their own chosen political, economic, and value systems. I think this might be the only option if humans are to avoid being annihilated by some religious fanatic group. Religion might just be irreconcilable with science. Science encourages us to question things, to wonder, to experiment, to broaden our horizons and to keep advancing our understanding of the universe. Religion, however, encourages blind fate. It gives commands and asks you to obey without question. It provides answers to important questions about the universe, but science continues to prove those answers wrong again and again. Religion unlike science, doesnt  experiment and improve or amend ideas when new understandings come to light. And most religions, at the very core of their teachings, are expansive. 


In this century, it is expected that advances in science would make it possible for any small group of people to be able to create extraordinary havoc, if they were to get their hands on certain technologies. The planet earth is already deeply divided into different religions and different political systems such that living safely together side by side might prove impossible if not downright dangerous given the inherent expansive nature of religion.Therefore, it would be wise for us to have the capability to leave the planet, if we feel that our existence and well being is threatened by any political or religious system. For the benefit and continuity of the human race, we must find the means to be a space faring species.

Adding clarification:  
  
I should have explained further. I mean like 1 generator that can give the same energy as the sun(limitless power) in the siwe of a small home. Wind, sun and other ""free"" energy need a lot of room and don't give such a huge return + it's not limitless power( you'd run out of space or the energy provided is not constant = fluctuates due to conditions that can't be regulated).

I myself have done translational research and I can tell you that beyond a shadow of a doubt that this type of statement is generally nonsense.

1. Even some sources that *seem* authoritative, are not. Simply because somebody works in a similar field does not mean they can make accurate appraisals of how long it will take to institute a technology.
2. Only somebody who is immediately working on a specific technology that is well-underway can tell you when it will arrive, and general up to a few years in accuracy.
3. We can't really speculate accurately on the grand time-schemes for broad things like ""advanced AI"" or ""personalized medicine."" These are incredibly complicated ideas that will not be the result of one person/group/company's work. Moreover, they still have practical limitations that may never be overcome. Not every problem has a practical, physical solution. Most problems probably do, but sooner or later any technology will hit a physical limitation. Often we can only speculate as to whether that limitation occurs before or after our grand goal.
4. Every statement you read that tries to make a claim like this but is at odds with the points above* has an agenda, either direct or indirect. That agenda is probably money: investors, grants, etc.

I wanted to put this out there because the speculation on this subreddit drives me nuts sometimes. I wish we could just sit back discuss new innovations or forward-minded ideas instead.

Still not sure if that is a good idea I was thinking today: ""Hey, humanity is progressing forward and I'll try to participate in this progress as much as I can by making some advances in physics and if I can't I'll just enjoy my life as a well-paid programmer, which still gives some opportunity for scientific work."" 

But then again, how well are we progressing. There is a looming environmental problem and most people don't really care, with some even downright rejecting the fact that the Earth is warming up. 

A significant percentage of the population is fanatically religious, that is, they believe there is some omnipotent being in the afterlife that will judge them on how they lived their life and that will determine whether they go to heaven or to eternal damnation.

Wealth is distributed shockingly disproportionately and there are signs that capitalism is struggling. The war on drugs, while dying down, still puts many people in jail for possessing minute amounts if a substance intended for personal use.

Overall, there is a multitude of  problematic social and economic topics (discussed more thoroughly in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2yfpgm/discussion_what_progressive_social_changes_or/) post earlier today) that are obviously stalling our progress towards a better structured society. Do you think that two centuries from now humanity will look back at them as a darker age in it's development, much like we look back at the Inquisition and the Cold War today?",57,39

Things are somewhat better now on earth, but not noticeably so. 

So I am wondering, what do people think about the singularity occurring mid 21st century? Do you feel that is a wildly optimistic timeline because most of us will be elderly then, and want to avoid dying and suffering, or is it based on valid science? 

I got the impression Kurzweil's predictions are very optimistic. He predicted we'd be in a biological revolution right now in this decade, and it didn't happen. Knowing how to do something in the lab is not the same thing as having a working consumer product that is safe and affordable. There is a multi decade space between those two things. 

I'm assuming when we get strong AI that can problem solve wide ranges of problems it will totally change the world. I just don't know when it will happen, or if the AI will be 'trillions of times smarter than humans' like Kurzweil predicted by 2100. 

I guess what I'm asking is, will 2045 actually be a techno-utopian world or will it just be today with better computers and minor advances in various areas? How much of this mentality is just a desire to avoid the pains of life (boredom, death, suffering) and how much is based on valid trends? 

Even if you think much of this is optimistic, do you still think that we will still have a singularity? I do. I personally find it hard to believe we won't have strong AI in the 21st century that can problem solve far beyond what a human could. I just don't know what a realistic timeline is. Part of me feels 2045 will be too late (with devices like Watson already being several years old). I don't know I guess. ",14,14

Now imagine if on every street corner there was one or more surveillance cameras, all networked into one massive system, and collectively monitoring every single square foot of public space. Able to pinpoint faces and figure out the identify of the people in view. Able to algorithmically detect certain actions, such as acts of violence or vandalism or even littering and not cleaning up after your pet.

Clearly the privacy issues are manifold; private citizens having their whereabouts tracked every place they go being the dominant concern. But also think of the benefits: the moment a violent crime occurs, it's detected and officers can be dispatched. Guilty parties are immediately identified and able to be tracked, and for non-violent crimes, a fine could immediately be generated for people who litter or vandalize property. Most crimes committed in public would vanish within a year, as punishments would be immediate, swift, and undeniably, reviewably just.

Perhaps there are ways to ensure that this system is extremely difficult to abuse. While alerts for crimes detected by the computer system would be dispatched for verification immediately to human monitors, officers and other agents of the law would when necessary be able to find the location of any individual in public view (or their last detected location) and continue to monitor them, raising serious privacy concerns. Perhaps it could be designed so that in order to use the system in this way, it takes at least two to three sign offs from agents and supervisors; this sort of oversight would make it far less likely that you'd have disgruntled officers stalking their ex's, and other egregious abuses of authority. Plus, there would be a clear, auditable chain of responsibility. Another concern is the ability for hackers to penetrate and abuse the system; clearly any implementation would require very strong, effective encryption as well as other protections against intrusion. Being behind a mandated air-gap is one possible way.

While I completely understand why this sort of scenario gives privacy proponents night terrors, I think that IF (and that's a *big* if) implemented in a sane, secure way, the overall benefit to society would greatly overshadow the potential for abuse.

How can we fix it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2yncri/meta_this_subreddit_is_devolving_into_a_brain/,wfunction,1426050781,"I'll just start by clarifying that I'm no scientist or engineer or involved in any of the fields of research this subreddit pivots on. I've been passionate about futurology for a little over a decade when I first started coming across futurism courses at university and in books like The Age of Spiritual Machines. I went through the same phase I see people in this sub going through, from ""The Technological Singularity is definitely going to happen and I must evangelize about it to anyone who will listen"" all the way over to where I am now (""it's an interesting thought experiment and it could happen but there are a lot of conditions that need to be fulfilled first"").


The problem I have with this sub, especially since it became a default, is that the people who are first *encountering* these ideas (people who are young and at ""peak optimism"" like I was) are the ones who are *guiding the flow of discussion* here through the articles they upvote and the comments they write. People who are sceptical or cautious are pushed to the margins, especially *know their shit* (those who work in the fields we discuss). While we are tolerant and encouraging of those who are in the position to moderate the high flying optimism when they actually do leave a comment, the overall climate of this sub pushes such people away.


Several years ago when I would see people bashing /r/futurology as some kind of techno-fetishist cult hyper focused on The Singularity and human augmentation and the like, I would step in and defend it even if that meant conceding people on here were far too optimistic.


Today I saw a post in another subreddit ridiculing /r/futurology (to much applause) for being ""delusional"" and full of kids that don't know what they're talking about who cherrypick things from the internet to support their claims and engage in a neverending, unquestioning circlejerk about basic income, automation, The Singularity, human life extension and so on. Sadly I came to agree with this assessment.


I think that futurology should be broad in focus like other disciplines and this subreddit should reflect that. Instead everyone here seems laser focused on the most *viral* ideas from futurology that circle the web, things like basic income, The Venus Project, Elon Musk, and SENS, as if these are the only things that will matter in 10-20+ years. Criticizing any one of these things here is often met with recycled replies that sound like they came straight out of a primer (ie: people telling others to visit the basic income subreddit to learn about basic income as if it were actually possible to be in /r/futurology and not know what BI was). What really grinds my gears is those who would brush off a hard problem like Climate Change with the assumption that exponential trends and unforeseen technologies will inevitably solve Climate Change, an attitude which I think is (and I'll say this as politely as possible) fucking retarded.


**tl;dr** I guess what it boils down to is that this subreddit needs more diversity and a way to draw in more people who know their shit to counterbalance the blind optimism of college aged males living in western countries who really fancy the (understandably attractive) idea of a Technological Singularity. The reins of this discussion should not be in the hands of these people.


Now /r/futurology is but a huge circlejerk/hype train of the same ideas and developments posted again and again (via clickbait or sensationalized articles) ad nausea, only that which fits under the umbrella of the narrative a majority (or vocal minority) of posters in this subreddit religiously subscribe to.


My question is, what are some *practical* ways to go about fixing this and making this subreddit better?

If the main applicant is applying for Tier 1 or Tier 2 ILR and dependant wife has been here for less than 5 years. After the main applicants visa has been approved for settlement, then they ask whether they should apply for their spouse on settled route (FLR M) or PBS extension.

This is a common confusion; both options can be chosen for extension. However, if you are going to apply on FLR M (considering you have fulfilled the appendix FM rules) this means that your dependants time in the UK would start again from the application and previous time spent in the UK will not be considered. Therefore, on that basis it would be better to apply via the PBS dependant route. The only drawback in comparing the 2 approaches is the cost implication as the fee for PBS dependant is twice that of the FLR M route. However, with FLR (M) route there is no restriction to work as a doctor, dentist or nurse.

10 Year Long Residence:

If the main applicant is switching to the 10 year long residence route and their dependants are already here then unfortunately because of the rules which were enforceable from 6th April 2014 it wont allow them to add their dependants time spent in the UK at all.

In other words, their dependant can only apply for the appendix fm FLR M route and their previous stay will not be added. The change will mean such dependants will need to apply for leave to remain under the rules for family members in Appendix FM before they can qualify for settlement.

Say 50 years in the future, I get a cybernetic replacement for every part of me, except my brain, since that holds my consciousness. Let's say nanobots become a thing, and can be used to keep my last organic part, my brain, from deteriorating. 

Would this end aging-related deaths? There would be no organic cells to form cancer. No feeble, meaty organs to shut down. Diseases would be unable to effect a cybernetic body, especially with an army of nanobots guarding it. 

This to me, seems like one of the best ways to end aging-related deaths. I'm not an expert on this, so I could just be talking out of my ass, of course. What is your opinion on this? Are there any experts that can shed some light on this idea? ",4,14

A few decades ago, tobacco was widely used and advertised. People didn't know about the health dangers. Then, bit by bit, the health dangers were revealed and people started to slowly understand the implications. Bans on advertising, health warnings, etc. followed
Do you think we are at the beginning of the road with alcohol? The health dangers of alcohol are slowly seeping into the social subconscious. Whenever anyone mentions how dangerous alcohol can be, many reply that it can be used responsibly (which afaik, was also an argument with cigarettes). Some countries have banned advertising/sponsorship already.

So, do you think that in 20-30 years time, the next generation will look back on us and think ""Wow, I can't believe such a high % of people consumed alcohol back then! Didn't they know the dangers?"". A follow up question: do you think alcohol SHOULD go on the same path? Should there be a ban on advertising/sponsorship, health warnings, public drinking bans, etc.?",46,24

It's my first time posting here and i really only have a high-school level science education so be gentle with this poor noob. So I recently saw a video about Japan's space solar power station (SSPS), and I'm concerned. We know that, at least at this current stage, solar panels are pretty fragile, and once they're broke there's really no way to fix them. So the threat on account of this is small high speed objects then, right? If i learned correctly, there's a fairly large amount of little rocks and such in space that are shooting along at incredible speeds from whatever explosive origin they came from, and those little objects can blast through our spacecrafts, or solar panels, and break them right? If that's the case, then as soon as we go through a meteor shower or a stray tiny rock shoots through a panel, then those specific panels would be damaged and useless. So do i not know what I'm talking about and there actually is no risk of tiny-rock bombardment? If there is a risk of it, do we have a solution for defending such brilliant creations from space-death?",5,0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yX1SYeDHbg#t=49m30s

It demos a neural net system that can ""dream"" future frames in a videogame, given previous frames.  Basically, researchers trained the system on videos of gameplay, then gave it a starting frame, and let it predict future frames, while feeding those predictions back in as fresh input (for yet more predictions).  

When the system dreams ""River Raid,"" it even knows that when the player ship hits an object, the game should restart.   

In the lecture it is mentioned that there are also video-generation systems that when fed training data, learn to produce reconstructions of the actual games, which users can play with a joystick.  It learns to construct the games from examples of gameplay, including info about how the joystick is manipulated. Though, it is mentioned that when you move the joystick, sometimes the system doesn't obey; it only obeys with high probability.  Perhaps this last bit could be ironed-out with better models.

Imagine where this could lead in the future:  perhaps a pure, simple neural net-based system could be trained on lots of data, that learns to take a sentence like, ""A man walked past a spotted dog,"" and then produce -- from scratch -- a short video (a few seconds long) representation of it.

Basically it was how everything we're doing is wrong and terrible, and how it will all end in tears.  
  
Now that said, they raised some very solid points.  They hit the banking crisis, the intrinsic issue with fiat currency, the fallout of repealing Glass-Steagall, the way ""building infrastructure"" in 3rd world countries actually hurts them, the life cycle of an empire (the last phase of which is apparently Decadence), the wage gap, limited resources, perpetual expansion, so on and so forth.  I'll gladly parrot any of those points back to you if you want to know what was presented to me.  
  
So my thought was ""what's next""?  What does a society with an abundance of technology, a data sharing source (the Internet) that is designed to survive a nuclear war and a heck of a lot of raw brain power do if their empire collapses?  Let's assume the Western world does collapse.  What does that look like for people living there?  Does it turn into a Mad Max, every man for himself, dog-eat-dog world?  Would we be invaded by non-failed empires?  Would we create our own small governments and how quickly would that process take, considering the amount of powerful tools we have at our disposal?  
  
And what new technologies will we pull out of that madness?  Will ""garbage mining"" become a thing?  Better water reclamation?  Would Bitcoin exist if the empire falls?  So on and so forth.

Thinking realistically, work provides a long term subconscious distraction for many people, and the repetitiveness of daily routine can make people forget where they are headed in life. Many people at the end of their lives wonder where the years went and why they didn't do something different. 

When all a person has is time and no responsibilities, the cultural mindset on individuality and ""growing up"" will be drastically different.

I wonder if depression would drastically increase as many people would feel like they have ""nothing to do"". Future technologies such as ultra realistic VR will help with producing fulfilling experiences, but I feel like many people will get tired of certain aspects of novelty.

What I expect to happen is within the next few hundred years at least in richer countries, we will start to live inside computers.

Think of it like this.
How often do we use technology? 
Facebook, Microsoft Word, Google, Youtube, video games, research, and pretty much everything in between. We are only becoming more and more reliant of our technology. 

So what happens when computers, phones, consoles and Mp3 players become outdated, what will they be replaced with? 


We already know the answer to that, with tech giants like Facebook, Intel, and Google investing billions of dollars into virtual reality.

When Facebook bought Oculas Rift for 2 billion dollars, I think it should of raised more heads, considering at the time Oculas hadn't even achieved a 1080p resolution screen, and still faced problems like not being able to use VR for more than 20 minutes without wanting to throw up. 

 Mark Zuckerberg said when Facebook bought Oculas:

 ""But this is just the start. After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home."" 



It makes sense for them to invest because sooner or later other social networking sites will catch up and take over facebook, just like bebo, just like myspace, and every other been and gone social networking site.

How will ads be affected? If a ad pops up saying 60% off your favorite shop that it mysteriously knows you love and all you need to do is click a button and you are in your virtual reality store.


This way, they will fuse the lines between real and virtual.
Instant message is cool and all, but not as cool as putting a pair of glasses on and suddenly being in the same room as your friend, face to face talking live time to each other while watching youtube videos together on a virtual TV on a virtual couch, in a virtual room, in a virtual world.  

A recently explored this myself when I took a look at AltSpaceVR today (It had just opened beta the other day)

AltSpace is an awesome application that allows you to to go to virtual reality hangouts, and meet and talk to people. In many of the spaces, there are computers that can be controlled by users so they can share videos and such with their friends standing next to them. 


Dolby Family Ventures, Formation 8, Google Ventures collectively have funded AltSpaceVR with 5.2 million dollars. 

AltSpaceVR even talks about being able to play games inside the simulation with friends from all across the world.

Best friend living overseas? They'll be a click away from sitting in your virtual reality living room, with your virtual 20 cats running around as you sit together playing the latest call of duty.
Computerception much? 





So enough about companies and funding, back to living inside computers.

When all our technological applications are run through virtual reality, everybody will be connected. 
How often do we spend on our computers? 
If you have a desk job, or maybe just a avid user of your phone or computer (Most of us) I would expect you would be spending quite a large amount of time connected. 

Let's say you use your phone for 3 hours a week.
You use your computer maybe 30-40 hours a week.
You play your music almost constantly.
It's a lot. All of that time will soon be dedicated to VR.




But when we take a look at videos games like Grand Theft Auto V. Who wants to leave a simulation where they can do everything plus more than real life with out the risk of dying?

Competitive gaming will take a huge turn, with players joining deathmatch games that feel realistic. Battlefield, Hungergames, you names it. First person, with the weapon in your hands.

It sounds great an all but what affect will this have on humans? 

Gaming has been a release for thousands of people, because we know, deep down. Humans can be primal and aggressive. We are drawn to violence in one way or another, because it is embedded in our DNA.

Then there is pornography. 

Will their still be a market for it once virtual/long range sex becomes available? Possibly, but hackers hacking into your private time might get a little...Embarrassing. 


When we no longer need to disconnect other than to eat, it will be much easier for corporations to rape the environment and do as they please. Because people will be living inside their own utopia.

Don't believe me? Think how reliant we are on tech, and if we are living in our own utopias almost constantly, who will want to leave? I mean, what reason would you have to leave if the simulation was just as lifelike?



Once we live inside a computer, we will be moving on to the next stage of evolution. Within a few years we will be able to upload our brains to computers.
So while 'Jack' may be immortal, I will be dead. Meanwhile forever recorded.

Now this is great and all, but if something can be downloaded, something can edited and uploaded, and this scares me. 

But your familly members or friends could die and continue virtual existence. No more having to say goodbye to loved ones. 

Mind reading will be something we will all live with, though I doubt it will be talked about.
When we all live inside a computer, there will still be spyware. This means totally surveillance of everything, not even the slightest shred of privacy.   


I could go on for hours about this, but I'd love to hear other peoples opinion on the matter. :)

I mean, there are several things that we would need to increase, for example make sure that bones do not degrade in low G, increase resistance to cold and radiation. Otherwise people would just have to work out all the time to keep being healthy and there's an issue of birthing children in low G environments too... Perhaps though children can be created artificially.

I do not think that unaltered people could live (happily) in those harsh environments. I believe that it would not be good to send humans as we are today, to those planets knowing that they'd make them unfit to ever return back to Earth or even lead a normal life on those planets. 

Colonization is still some way in the future, so hopefully medicine and biology can get there by that time.

If we talk about long distance space travel, like to other solar systems, then I believe most plausible scenario would be not to send actual humans there, but machines capable of making food and humans when they get there. 
1) the issue of space on the ship is solved, as humans would need food with themselves etc.
2) travel would take a long time, even if developed better cryo techniques like we now have (I read that now hospitals can keep people in suspended animation for half an hour or so, to perform complex surgeries), it would not be possible to do it that way
3) generational ship would cause problem with people trapped in confined space, want to get back home after a while, realizing it is one way trip

To make people not feel that way, create them on the actual new planet.

What if we are already living in a giant computer virtual reality and somehow just lost our way about it we were never told about it and that infor was lost over the years? 

If and maybe if its our natural progression to be living in a virtual world as is predicted to happen in the next 30-50 years. What if its an endless cycle that happens over and over and we already are in VR inside of another VR and inside etc..it never ends",7,5

We talk a whole lot about technology and the Singularity, or cool new methods that will change the world forever *cough* graphene *cough*. But there's something that most people won't ever personally grapple with, and that's the topic of consciousness. 

By consciousness, I mean our constantly evolving and growing scope of what we are aware of. I quite like Spiral Dynamics (AQAL) for the visual representation of how we've changed over time. Basically, our purposes have changed from pure survival, to banding together, to power seeking, to conformity with morals, to achievement, to collective sensitivity. All of these stages are underpinned by our brain development (Dr. Doug Tataryn's EBIQ). Over time, we become more and more aware of the self, and then social situations, and then our connections. The thing is though, almost anything we do is on that spectrum - from pure ignorance all the way to enlightenment. 

The objective reality is, we have people all over the spectrum. That's why we have to be careful about the technology we develop. Tech in the wrong hands can be bad news. My opinion of technology (techniques) is systems of thought or physical systems which allow for the user to make more efficient or effective use of their energy. Better tools = more power.

Language is also a set of tools. For example, if you don't have the words to describe how you're feeling, you will have difficulty understanding it. You've no doubt heard before ""I'm angry"", but rarely would you hear ""I feel insecure because X"". This awareness and set of tools would allow people to process their feelings, instead of being triggered by them over and over. Once we see the patterns happening in ourselves, we have ""emotional intelligence"", and the support for the next tier of consciousness (stage 7 on SDi). Stage 8 involves seeing patterns in culture, among other things. /r/Futurology is a place to see these patterns form.

I personally believe there needs to be more emphasis on raising our level of consciousness as the individual 'self', along with our culture and societies. So many of the things that hold us back simply fall away once we understand them and know how to process them (and NOT simply cope). We need better techniques for understanding what we are, where we're going, and how we're shooting ourselves in the foot. Anyway, I hope to start a conversation about consciousness and our future.

We as a human race should determine if having plagiarizing Youtube news bots, running wild and uncontrolled on the Internet is really a smart idea. Even though you've got to admit it's genius, it eliminates workforce and it grows as a binary viral flower (Yup, it's now a real thing, binary gardening.) We can all agree that YouTube has become a jungle, full of life, evolving countless forms of various viral directions in self-sustained animations on a infinite growing field. These self creating videos consisting of everything from gluten free cooking recipes, cancer curing holy water and spiritual space time travel recipes, has more than one function. Which at first glance is to generate money by collecting clicks/likes based upon already manufactured content, derived from various other online/offline media and news sources. Successfully mashing them together into whatever computer generated propaganda your watching, unknowingly believing someone (not something) actually had time to make a video like that, without missing out on their free points in their current heroin app. 

The scripted bot is working amazingly well and acting exactly like a news anchor, but lacks the mimics of lies we've got painted all over a human face, which our brain interprets right away as a lie. If the news anchor told you everyone would get cakes delivered on their door  the 1st of April this year, with a big smile on his face, you would know it was a lie. But if a regenerated voice tells you the exact same thing, but instead of the news anchor we got a cute cat sniffing a delicious picture of a marvelous cake. This time only mentioning the 1st of April in a subliminal moment of the video clip, maybe while the cat does a back flip from tasting the actual cake, your brain is monkey enough to miss out on the actual joke, because your way to interested in the visual cake and is not really paying attention to when you will receive  it. The date is no longer important, it's all about the sugary filling and the cute misplaced cat running around at this moment. And there is no way the cake could be a lie, it's right there! 

Catch my drift? Or do I need to portal this into something more analogically correct... We've got A.I's running YouTube already, and it is not that long ago they wrote a piece on the fact that there was so many hours of content uploaded to YouTube, it would not be possible to view it all within a human lifetime. So where does this leave us, if the one thing we created but cannot surpass, is now ran by A.I's? Well, the only reasonable thing to do would be to rent ""Terminator"" and learn what the filmmaker really meant by 'Skynet'.  *Portal Out!*

Posted on reddit, had to build wall before trolls arrived;
Sorry in advance if sentences are wrong and the grammar is off, this is not my mother language and while typing ""on-the-go"" ideas like this on an apple who claims to know what I wish to write before I've finished even thinking it. 

Anyways, this is just a random note of many notes I do daily to overcome Lyme Disease boredom and anger. But could not let this one disappear into a bag of holding, since A.I is one of my favorite techs of science fiction. (Was a filmmaker before Lyme Disease made me lemony!)

I copied this from a recently post where Growth Hacks was mentioned. Not a repost, but rather a way of not making the other post go off topic.

In the future, AI is supposedly going to be this super intelligent thing that is going to be incredibly good at predicting future events such as astronomical events, weather, earthquakes, and presumably war. Assuming that all countries are going to have a form of this AI (or possibly share the same AI), they will be able to predict possible future attacks and be able to prevent them before they happen or at least have a very good defense. If everyone is able to predict everybody else's possible moves, wouldn't that make war incredibly difficult? Countries would be kept from gaining ground with either offense or defense-making the whole thing pointless. This could be said for physical or cyber attack. What do you guys think of this?

Instead of humans adapting to environment has technology arranged it to environment adapting for Humans?

While I cannot speak to other education systems around the world, the US education system evolved to create factory workers. Children were sent to school so they would learn to be more productive in industry. While this leaves out all the nuance the point remains. 

As we all know our economy is shifting. Because of this shift education will be required to adapt. I am aware of a growing diversity in educational methods and outcomes in public and private schools in the US and elsewhere, but on a more fundamental level, how will education work for ""school age"" children in the coming decades? 

What skills do you think will be pushed and by whom? I don't predict anything approaching a unified agreement on this, but I am curious as to what you think some of the proposals or developments will be. 

What will people think is important for their students to learn? 

How will they be taught? In large classes, or in smaller and more customized lessons? 

Do you see a move toward or away centralized curriculum? Or both?

will smartphones eventually be overtaken by wearable devices?  will they encompass a totally new form factor ie. Nokia Morph Concept.  will they become the norm for computing in the workplace?

how much smarter will they become and how much more dependent will we be on these smartphones?  could a smartphone eventually be used to replace personal identification ie. drivers license, birth certificate, passport, etc.?

do you think companies like Apple, Samsung, Google, will be as relevant with regards to the smartphone industry or will they be overtaken by Xiaomi or someone that doesn't even exist today?

i believe smartphones will eventually take on a multi-purpose form factor.  with the advancement of security technologies, i also see smartphones replacing the need for a wallet.  50 years from now, they could be the only accessory you carry around at all times.  perhaps, with the advancement of projection technologies and augmented reality; they could replace laptops and desktops permanently and completely.",9,19

Humanity marks earth for a period of 200 years of reclamation in which new industry, construction and development does not occur and the land is so expensive that the only inhabitants on earth remain the ultra wealthy. They stay because they want their kids to grow up on beautiful earth rather than a distant colony. 

  
A few generations pass and the privileged children of earth begin to grow more attached to nature. They hunt and gather, start to neglect the technology and dazzling screens available to them. The parents start to slowly become worried for this new degeneration and refusal of the future. 

  
The kids begin to have distaste for humanities progress and ultimately fight to leave the earths inhabitants.

  
The parents lose trust and hope and leave for the colonies. Hence we revert back to a hunter gather society. The parents take their technology with them and so the evolution of man building new technologies begins again. The hunter gatherers we think of were not the first human inhabitants, but rather part of a cycle of humans leaving and the nature lovers ultimately staying in rejection of progress. ",6,0

But anyway... I think there are three things happening today that will change the course of humanity forever.

1) Programming
We are able to integrate code into physical objects to emulate life in the best way we (currently) know how. Think about the robots, drones, computers, working alongside us today.

2) Space Travel
We're mapping out and learning more about the universe. Just today, findings from NASA point to possible evidence that a single star's explosion has enough dust to create 7,000 new planets the size of earth. There may be many inhabitable (inhabitable defined by human conditions) planets out there, and we just need to find them.

3) Biology
Just as we travel across space and map out bits of our galaxy, biologists are hacking away at DNA to map out and better understand how, literally, everything is constructed. Even today, we're able to split DNA and insert new pieces to form different DNA.

=======
**Now, imagine this...**
5,000 years from now, DNA is entirely mapped out and we have enough of an understanding of it all to be able to essentially code in DNA. Instead of creating iPhone apps, a programmer will program with DNA to create current and new creatures that behave within the confines of that programmer's code.
But creating new creatures comes with a risk because, just like you create software, you have to test your code for bugs, create different versions, create duplicate versions with minor changes, etc. Unlike software, though, you can't just simply create a creature and test it in your computer, so what do you do?
You look through your universal almanac, which might exist 5,000 years from now once we have explored a vast reach of the universe, to find planets that are inhabitable for your creatures to develop (much like you have minimum system requirements for applications on your computer today--applications:computers::creatures:planets), so you can put them in a ""test environment"" and watch how they behave. Once you find such an inhabitable planet, you migrate your creatures over and watch the code run.
Meanwhile, as the creatures expand, you see how they, not as individuals, but as a group, develop. If the creatures evolve in a way that is beneficial for your current society (5,000 years in the future), you migrate the creatures back to your planet and they live alongside you to help make an even better planet.
But if the creatures are not beneficial to your society, you just terminate the project. The creatures are left to rot on their planet.
Funny thing is, we could very well be one of those creatures for life forms that are already at that stage or beyond, and that programmer who made us looks back at the earth and shakes his head. We'll never make it back to his planet.",19,7

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2zrbrq/indepth_plausible_future_scenarios_that_are/) the user /u/daelyte used the tag to help spur a discussion about potential futures that are neither utopian or dystopian. We often tend to look at the future in either light, so it was good to tread a middle ground.

On the lighter/tech side of things, /u/zenitron started a discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2zqc10/indepth_what_does_the_future_hold_for_smartphones/) about the future of smartphones and how we both view and use them.

As you can see, the tag can be used in both a serious and light tone to help spur more interesting and worthwhile topics of discussion. We purposefully designed the tag to allow users more power to shape the tone of their discussion. **I just wanted to post a reminder that this tag does exist, and that it can be used both for link posts and self posts**.

It's something I would love to see utilized more, because you get some really great responses in those threads. It's always a pleasure reading the insights from someone willing to share more than a brief thought on a subject. As a reminder the tag forces all comments to be greater than 100 characters in length, and it signifies to us, the moderators, that the user submitting the content wants more strict moderation in the thread.

i wonder how tech will help us transition this virtual connectivity into a real life world without borders, restrictions, or policies.  is it possible that the advancement of technology will cause the elimination of national borders?  will technology be the backbone of a true ""New World Order"" that consists of one worldly government?

perhaps technology will be the cause for a global citizen database that will take over for the current passport/visa based system that is in place now.    from a security viewpoint, maybe the advancements and increased accessibility of technology will be the reason for a global society that adheres to universal law.

i dream of a day when there are no longer any borders and a system is put in place that allows me to travel freely without filing for visas.  i know some may oppose this idea because they feel it will rid the world of national pride and/or traditionalism, but we are all individuals, unique in our own way regardless of what system is put into place.",3,1

Anytime someone posts a thread suggesting that technical progress is stagnating, most people are quick to dismiss it, and it wasn't too long ago that I would have as well. We keep hearing about technology ""improving at an exponential rate"" - we just accept it as common knowledge.

Then, I read this article and started to rethink things. Despite scientific breakthroughs regularly making it into the news, the only significant technological improvements we have seen in daily life is with computers, the internet, and all the corresponding gadgets/electronics. Things like energy, food, and water are not becoming cheaper. They still aren't close to cures for cancer, diabetes, or even baldness (that is potentially a gazillion dollar market, but they can't figure out anything better than the transplant procedure). Yet, despite the huge challenges that have yet to be solved, we just assume that immortality (or whatever) will be possible by 2050.

These self-driving cars would greatly reduce traffic congestion and also limit the number of yearly car accidents. Research shows that on average, Americans travel an average of 27.6 minutes to and from work depending on where you live!


Driverless cars are the smart car, and just as revolutionary as the smartphone, said Pierre-Jean Rigole from the KTH Center for Traffic Research. They will revolutionize car ownership, lead to more flexible traffic, with far fewer crashes. And they will free up valuable space in cities that is currently occupied by parked cars.


In Stockholm, the testing location for this research study, 136,000 cars are involved in daily commutes with taxi travels accounting for over half of the commute distance! By combining modern app technology such as Uber with these self-driving automobiles, optimized routes and speeds will help eradicate the morning and evening crush on the roads. What's more, the demand for parking space is projected to drop by a total of 80%.

A dearth of problem solving, education, talent, genius, etc. are the bottleneck that hold back humanity and anything to advance those fields is, to me, the highest good. 

But I can't do anything for or against this. It seems the only way to contribute to those fields is to either be rich, influential or brilliant. 

If you are rich (like Paul Allen) you can fund neuroscience research. If you are influential (like Obama) you can push for the BRAIN initiative. If you are brilliant you can be a researcher. 

But I, like 99.9% of the planet, am none of those things. It sucks. It feels like the world is at a crossroads and things really need to be done but there is nothing I can do but read the news. I'm not talented or influential enough to do anything.

I'm not sure exactly what message I'd like to send yet, but I know I want to send one. Any suggestions or ideas for how best to do this, or is anyone else actually attempting to do this themselves?

Edit: So, I decided to turn this into an art project, [project3015](http://project3015.wordpress.com/2015/07/01/project-3015/), to see if I can actually make this happen. Thanks for the interesting feedback and suggestions here.",26,20

I have been a long-time Futurology lurker/poster and know that, (regardless of when you think automation will happen) a lot jobs will be obsolete in the future.

I thought it would be a really good/cool idea to list off the jobs that we think will be safe (at least for the time being) and vice versa, so that us college kids and future college kids know what to look out for.

This is a serious thread, so please comment on the following things

- industry/job your in and how it will be affected by automation
- what jobs you think will be safe/in danger of automation

Edit: 

**Jobs that are safe**:

- Scientists
- Artists
- Entertainers
- Politicians 
- Academia 
- IT maintenance 
- operating engineer/HVAC tech
- Architect (maybe)
- Cops (depending on if we get a RoboCop)
- Industrial Hygienists
- Engineer's 
- IT Maintenance 
- Teachers (All grades)
- Charity 
- Mental Health Professionals 
- freight train drivers (USA)
- Service Worker for people with Disabilities 
- construction (for now)
- Project Leaders 
- Physical fitness experts
- Computer Scientist 


**Jobs that are not safe**

- transportation
- Farmers (PPL working on farms)
- Lawyer (Discovery)
- Doctor/Nurse (Watson Bots) (not all of them)
- Lab technician 
- Salesmanship 
- Factory Workers 
- accountants 
- checkout operators 
- banking 
- real estate agents 
- bicycle courier's (drones)
- food industry (3D printing, automated Fast Food)

Edit #2:

Please keep in mind that, while I have made a list that is presumably ""safe"", most of these jobs will be automated to some degree.

For example, we pride ourselves on our technological advancements, in spite of various social and political issues that plague us. At the same time, we refuse to see ourselves as changing, despite our technological progression. It's partially true if civilization crashed tomorrow, or on Walpurgisnacht, then yeah, we'd be goin' Greek pretty soon. But change is coming quickly. We're on the cusp of something great.

That's why there needs to be some sort of classification for what we're getting our ape selves into. Things are changing. I'm changing. You're changing. We're all changing. And what's driving this change is technology and even that's changing.

The Future is the shit /r/Futurology is all about. It's not high tech it's ultra tech.

It's our coal age, our nuclear age, our space age. Ultratechnology, however, is when tech goes even further beyond.  It's when we begin mimicking and improving upon nature. It is during the age of ultratechnology that what we've always imagined and more comes true. It's when what we've always relied on breaks down, and our biological existence becomes superceded by our mind's existence and enhancement. 

It is 2015, and we're not quite there, but we're so close that you'd be forgiven for thinking that we are.  Think of it as the singularity before the Singularity. The outermost edges of the event horizon's rim. We are currently, and for a few more years, the most advanced we'll ever be as *Homo sapiens sapiens*, without using ultratechnology.

What I'm saying is that if you have a child this year, you must accept that the world in which they grow up will not be the same world of your youth. Think of all the things you've ever known getting a car, getting your first job, graduating high school, all those things. This child will almost certainly know very little of it. Most may purchase cars, but there's little chance many will know how to drive them unless they're specially trained and it's not that crazy or sobering of an idea. Show of hands, how many of you know how to operate a horse and buggy, or ride a horse? Statistically, some of you... nevertheless, you'd be fucked before the mid 20th century. And by the mid 21st century, unless you're a hardline luddite who enjoys the challenge of doing it the old way, you could just download the information to your exocortex anyway in the case you needed to know how.
Don't get me wrong, it's *always* good to know how to do these things, but when it no longer becomes necessary, what we cherish as everyday life will be soon relegated to history books we'll continue to proudly not read.  If we stopped all progress now, it would be selfish. Because in that case, why should it be *now?* Why not the earlier generation threatened by high technology? 
This is why I love /r/thisisthewayitwillbe, because nothing is sugarcoated. If you're comfortable with where we are now high tech, but not so high tech that traditional culture has been uprooted I have some bad news for you. 

Come 2020, what we perceive as technological stagnation will suddenly, magically, disappear and we'll wake up into a world where millions are wired to virtual reality, where cyborgs are going on camping trips, where you're more likely to meet a robot cashier at McDonalds than a human one, where some of the cars on the road are driving themselves, where your smartphone is 512x more powerful than it is now and can hold conversations with you, where your *house* may be talking to you, where when you see mysterious lights in the sky at night, your first thoughts are ""Oh, that's just some drones,"" where having a limb amputated is no longer a crippling disability, where you can look up at the moon and know that we'll soon be living there, where they may be citizens with human rights most probably in Finland, Sweden, or Japan who are actually computers, where you can go to a movie theatre and not know if what you're seeing is live-action or animated, where military and police [laser-shooting deathbots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR7vwRC6SFE) are a reality. A world where $500 will buy you abilities that, to us today, seem straight out of science fiction.  It wasn't magic it's what was building up for years, decades before now. 

And what's most amazing is that, while all this is taking place, [there are still some who still live (largely by their own volition) like the stone age has yet to arrive.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLErPqqCC54)

That, to me, is where we stand as a civilization.",9,32

If one has little in the way of ownership, people are treated like slaves and don't have much access to the games of life.

Ownership in the present system is defined by legal documents/relationships such as financial instruments, title, and possession.  Money in the present system are bank notes, or debt instruments called federal reserve notes created when banks make loans.  Recently, most of the new notes are being created by government borrowing and student loans.

Since 2008, the entire financial system, or how we allocate ownership, is now guaranteed and often created by government through government borrowing and new laws.  

In the future, how should such control be distributed when government is legally WE THE PEOPLE?

This will likely be a very convulsive issue going forward as people try to determine who should be owners and who should be slaves and such determination is being made by government and the rules we are forced to accept.

Hint:  automation and digitization will have a significant impact on this issue and the rules of our future games",4,1

Even in a developed country such as Canada the pension is really low unless they have a lot of money saved up. In return, many people decide to stay in the workforce longer which takes jobs  from younger people...all to make ends meet. 
 In other cases some seniors choose to live in a retirement home which is very expensive.

**A possible solution**

Although curing aging is the best solution we are not quite there yet.

Instead I propose a type of neighborhood or a mini city that is free for senior citizens older than 65 to live in, as in they do not have to pay rent or pay minimal property taxes.
 By emphasizing sustainability many of the needs of the community could be met internally. For example, a good chunk of electricity could come from solar panels and renewables and many of the fruits and vegetables can be grown locally by the younger residents.
** Advantages**
- Frees up work for younger people
-Reduces senior poverty by a lot
- Contributes to sustainability
-(not really an advantage) many seniors would vote for this measure

Disadvantages
-cost, it would cost money to build these homes
-some people might not be willing to retire and want to work at their current job.

EDIT: some suggested that maybe they do not want to be secluded. My defense is first of all this is optional, and second of all perhaps neighborhoods would work better so this way they would still be close to the city and other amenities. Third, there shouldn't be an issue of young people living with them, eg. a grandkid.

A smartphone is great, allowing you to synthesize a variety of information with a variety of apps, but I think it's easy to see that one piece of intelligent software that you can communicate with to rule over them all is the holy grail of computer functionality. 

I see this being huge in the future, and the name Wikipedia gives to this idea is an [intelligent personal assistant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_personal_assistant). The movie *Her* depicts a similar idea (although obviously sophisticated to the point of being an AGI) and goes with the word *OS*, as if the assistant has become so engrained with contemporary operating systems that the two become indistinguishable. 

I guarantee a new word will be coined for this at some point, just like *smartphone*. What do you think it'll be? When someone in the future says ""I'll have my ____ remind me,"" what will that word be? Just ""AI"" (this sounds kinda clunky to me)?",25,25

Human consciousness is most likely a product of the various brain organs working together. In this context, consider a possible future where technologically mediated telepathy connects a large portion of humanity.

Will this collective entity have a consciousness?

Can such a conscious entity be the biological ""answer"" to machine super intelligence?

Can it incorporate machine intelligence to allow for the non-direct integration of biological and non-biological intelligence?

Considering such an entity has access to all human knowledge, has real time information on most of humanity, and is essentially as powerful as the entire civilization comprising it. For all practical purposes: all knowing, all seeing, everywhere at once, and all powerful. Would you define it as god? ",9,5

1963,2015-3-27,2015,3,27,12,30gbiq,"The Singularity and transhumanism ""movements"": Are they a cult?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/30gbiq/the_singularity_and_transhumanism_movements_are/,[deleted],1427425912,"A common criticism of the technological Singularity is that it basically amounts to a ""rapture of the nerds"", promising immortality and prosperity in the same way that many religions do. Many people who consider themselves transhumanists and/or ""believers"" of the Singularity will object to this accusation, citing that the Singularity is based on science and technological trends, not superstition or revelation or dogma.

Personally, I think the Singularity may very well have elements of a cult. It has its own mantras and doctrines, such as the ""Law of Accelerating Returns"", which ensures that all the amazing scientific advances will happen in our lifetimes. If Ray Kurzweil described the Singularity but made sure to mention that it was centuries away, no one would care. Only by promising that it is an imminent event directly relevant to people alive today is he able to sell his books and get people excited. 

Also, like many religions, the Singularity plays into our fear of death, disease, suffering, and impermanence. People don't like the idea that we are insignificant little things doomed to die, but don't worry, the Singularity ensures that soon we'll all be uplifted into cyber godhood, and then we'll rework the universe and make everything intelligent. Some Singulatarians even profess a belief in ""quantum archeology"", whereby people who have died before the Singularity took place can be resurrected with quantum science. How this works, I frankly don't know, but it's definitely something I've seen espoused as a serious possibility. It sounds exactly like the End Times, where everyone who has ever died will ""rise from the grave"".

So while many futurists will try to say that the Singularity is totally different from a religion or a cult, it's clear that their movement does indeed have many similarities to the various religions and cults. It promises many of the same things and appeals to the same fears and hopes. It's very interesting but I'm curious to know what /r/futurology thinks.",25,2

For instance, it's apparently a lot easier and more economical to live in a temperate or warm zone on Earth where the Sun provides energy for free than to live in a frigid high-latitude even with abundant energy from nuclear or geothermal sources.

I think about this when considering two futures, and how they may relate to each other: The future of passively collecting solar energy, and the future of artificial fusion reactors.  

The former is trivially simple on a theoretical level, and as time goes on we increasingly churn out photovoltaic surface like toilet paper.  Its ultimate extreme is the Dyson Sphere - a shell (of whatever structural details) completely surrounding a star and passively harvesting as much of its energy output as the laws of physics allow.  However, it keeps humankind wedded to the inner regions of star systems, complexifying internally rather than spreading out except along the sphere.

The latter is incredibly theoretically and practically complicated, still has not been technologically realized, and is so complex that it seemingly takes 20 years for predictions of when we'll get it to advance even 5 years.  Once realized, it will likely have high fixed costs, and take similarly long time scales to iterate to more advanced versions.  But once economical, it liberates humanity from the need for stars - as long as there's still material resources available, we can go wherever we want, spread, and diversify.  The most distant, frigid wastes become habitable with fusion power.

Does this give us a clue about the shape of future human civilization?  Will most people be drawn inward to the easy living of a Dyson shell, while some, more driven minority spreads outward to the cold natural bodies of a star system, and some even smaller minority of them travels to other stars to repeat the migration in reverse, eventually forming another shell around the new home star?

Science fiction author David Brin proposed a similar scheme in his ""Uplift"" novels, only he saw it as a matter of gravity fields rather than cheap energy - older, more stable societies just gradually migrated inward toward higher-mass gravitational fields and used tidal forces as their passive energy source, with the oldest spiraling in to black holes.

Maybe I'm extrapolating too much from all the old people who move to warm states from colder Northern ones, but it seems to make sense that civilization becomes denser a lot faster where energy is passively available than when you have to constantly expend economic effort to control your environment.  Migration in the other direction seems to happen at a lower rate, and a much younger, more energetic demographic.  ",63,15

In the commercials they could address common arguments presented against global warming to educate people. Basically a simultaneous message to as many people possible on earth to WAKE UP.

I imagine that it would be good for companies' PR to do this. It could have a collective name for the series of infomercials and a website platform to unite people to come up with ideas and learn.

Maybe we are the 'cocoon' stage for an entirely new...  Fully customizational, adaptable, intelligent life form able to sustain life in all reaches of universe. 

I got this idea while pooping earlier. I was thinking, ""no one has really seen aging as a problem that needs solving. Maybe pooping is a problem that can be corrected.""  anyway, now I believe that in the future of the future when we're no longer restrained by fear, we will be able to evolve so much further than ever imagined.

For example, in the future, will we take what are the current VR headsets and add things like smell or other senses, or will we stray from what we already know.

I have always thought, *what if* we created some form of virtual reality (or just computer displays in general) where what is now used, such as pixels and polygons (I am using gaming as an example) is erased completely, and we have found a way to put our brains in an almost dream like state, where the brainwaves are altered and what we perceive is another world, cancelling out our real world stimuli, and replacing it with that of another world through something like a microchip in the brain, or some sort of headset that interferes with brainwaves. 

I am aware that this full dive technology has been talked about before, but what I am curious about is if what we already know about displays and VR in general will be discarded and replaced with a better system.

What do you think? When do you think it will happen?

Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk is billboard nr. 1 song for the 12th week, universally praised, and it's a good song but it is just a look back at 70s with 21st century superproduction. People who know something about billboard predict that Walk the Moon - Shut Up and Dance will be nr.1 soon too. And again, it's a good song, but again just rose tinted ode to the 80s. Even Kanye West drags Paul McCartney on stage to make some point (don't know what though). It's a sad state of affairs when only Nicki Minaj can shock audiences and I wouldn't even say she offers anything fresh. Where are Jim Morrison's ''great golden copulations''?

The same can be said about movies, the myriad of sequels and remakes and book adaptations. Whenever an inkling of an original idea appears, it's beaten down to lowest common denominator, presumably because audiences would be too stupid to consume that idea. Case in point, Nolan bastardized his own ''Interstellar'' with ''love-science'' nonsense just because he believed the original script would be too hard to chew for regular moviegoer. 

But what worries me most is that we're failing at democracy and acceptance of radical ideas. We're failing! And it's not just the stripping of privacy and Big Brother everywhere, that could be solved with co-surveillance, where everyone is watching everyone and in that way nobody is watching nobody, because nobody cares. I'm thinking about splitting into factions, silencing other opinions whether it is happening in Russia vs gays, or it's happening in the West, for example, Charlie Hebdo case, where anyone even suggesting that perhaps some satire is bad satire, was silenced under the guise of ''freedom of speech''. It wasn't even about banning satire of Allah, people got silenced just for expressing their opinions. Luckily nobody is being jailed yet, as in Russia. 

What I mean is, this all looks awfully familiar to where we were in the 50s. Conformism, states wanting to meddle in the affairs of their citizens, witch hunting, only with mush worse economy. Or maybe we're in the 30s, as we see too much hot blooded nationalism in Eastern Europe, fuelled by Russia, and the same could be said about USA. Heck, same can be said about other parts of Europe too, with nationalist parties rising in polls. Food for thought. 

The fact is, we don't like our status quo, but we accept it. We can't call people fags, because they will be offended, we can't leave women without promotion, because they'll feel offended, we can't say that Lil Wayne lyrics suck, cause we ain't black and we don't know about the struggle. We can't do a lot of sh**. We can't call Sarkeesian a bitch, for example. And all those examples- I am not saying that I am personally against gays, Ellen Pao, Lil Wayne or Anita Sarkeesian. Maybe I support all of them, but there will always be people who will want to call others names and I say- let them! Nothing will happen! Unfortunately, our societies are good with defending what's considered ''good'' freedom of speech. But that just means that we are culturally jailing our Pussy Riot for Gamergate...

There are a few radical ideas in technology though. For example Soylent, for example ending aging, for example driverless cars etc. But wht I find interesting is that most of us ''jail'' them in the familiar. Or we go to unreasonable extremes. With Soylent, we worry about pissing out of our asses and thinking that it's no life living on Soylent. Well, guess what, don't live on Soylent! Use it once a day or 6 meals a week. With ending aging, people ask - what about overpopulation, who will pay your pension? Well, guess what, if you can imagine people who don't die, why you can't imagine that something else will change in the world too? The same about driverless cars- who will be responsible for accidents, what about hacking etc. 

The thing is, our society is being conditioned to think only one way. The way that's right. The worst part is that, there are several versions of what's right in the world. There's the Western-mainstream version, Wester-gun toting, nationalist-libertarian version, Russian nationalist divine theocracy version, ISIS... chopping heads version etc. The worst part is that none of them are willing to listen to others' arguments, but treat their version as divine and holy truth. And, unfortunately, the same is true about futurology which still kinda lives in the 60s-70s era, with some Gibsonian ideals and a fear of Butlerian jihad. 

I say- tear that all off. Burn ''Neuromancer'', burn ''Ready Player One'', burn ''I Robot'', burn the whole damn lot of heresy, because these are ideas of foreign times. Of course, I'm not saying that all these books should be burned, but we should not sit in our faux Victorian mansions, dreaming about 60s Star Trek future under 80s neon lights immersed in cyber-jockeying. 

I know this is not a radical idea. From time to time there have been enterprising young men, who tore down the old values and started something new. But we need that now again. Because we can't live by standards of the world which was not yet connected, we can't treat ending aging and driverless cars as sci-fi ideas anymore. Because, when you treat something as sci-fi idea, you get sci-fi environments. Stale worlds where nothing else has developed, except for some part of technology. You get Star Trek, frozen in time, except for ships and computers. 

To get to something new, we need more acceptance of weird and dangerous ideas. We need mass adoption of Soylent, we need Borg-like collective consciousness efforts, we need to kick out the land barons and treat housing as a necessity, not as business, we need merit and want based society, where even if you're Mark Zuckerberg or John Ive, you earn merit, not money, and can spend it only upon a want, not let it sit in your pocket and accumulate wealth, yeah we also need great golden copulations... we need people worshipping Steve Jobs and walking around in monk robes, with Isaacson's book as Holy Scripture in their hands. We need weirdness, we need fresh and bold ideas, we don't need complacency, security or any of that shit. And why the fuck children are not allowed to play alone outside, even if our world is much safer as it was decades ago? The fact is, all we want is to spy on kids, spy on our dogs, spy on our relatives and other people... there is this unexplainable need for security in an already secure world. You can't explain it otherwise, than that people are content with what shit they have already and want to protect it, and do not really want to evolve in any way.

I wanted to know if anyone else was concerned about technology slowing down or stagnating. There was a mix of responses, but the general consensus was that, yes, ""exponential progress"" tends to be wildly exaggerated, and while technology is improving relatively quickly, it can't keep up with many of the demands of human civilization.

Well, now I want your opinions on a follow-up. What would you say is the one breakthrough that would most speed things up and help technological progress pass the bend of the exponential curve? Fusion energy? Quantum Computers? Super Conductors? Or, is there one at all?

The example of lagging science I always come back to is hair loss. It seems like a trivial problem, and it is a potentially multibillion dollar industry, but the reality is that hair follicles are so tiny and complex - scientists have studied it for decades but still don't understand how exactly the balding process works (formulating a cure is even further off). Is there some kind of micro-imaging or modeling technology in development that might finally make some sense of problems like that?

The one proposal I had come across somewhere on the internet is a computer so powerful that it could run molecular simulations on anything. A billion different experiments that would take an eternity to do physically could be done instantly. It would be the ultimate use of optimization. Does that sound familiar to anyone?",23,19
