&gt;Parkinsons disease is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease, following Alzheimers disease. According to the Parkinsons Foundation, in the United States, healthcare costs related to this disease total about 25 billion dollars per year alone. Quality of life for Parkinsons patients relies heavily on how early treatment starts, therefore requiring a correct diagnosis. It motivates the authors of this paper and presents a machine learning approach to tackling the misdiagnosis of Parkinsons disease. They collect smartphone data on 1853 participants with and without Parkinsons disease. Specifically, they collect signals from walking, voice, tapping, and memory tests using a smartphone application.

Read until the end to find out why I don't think this is necessarily a good thing.

It's easy to forget when paying attention to the news of the day that the whole point of our hard work globally is to eliminate need and want. That's what most everyone is doing, day after day. Working to fix broken systems, working to improve existing systems, and adding to the collective whole. Whether you do it for the cash, or for the value you feel you bring, or you do it for your family and friends, you are helping to improve the global system. Even if you're doing a bad job at it, you're still contributing. 

This isn't a country to country thing either, this is a humanity thing. We're all collectively (and mostly ignorantly) working extremely hard to push ourselves beyond the point where suffering is required. Generally, we do not want to suffer and will happily invest our time and energy to reduce suffering, often not just our own but to reduce our collective suffering. Whether our countries are based on Capitalism, Communism, Socialism, or other, we're all collectively working on an underlying system based on a value for humanity, for ourselves. 

Surprise, surprise, we value ourselves. And we want things to be better than they are. We're also just smart enough collectively to realize when an improvement isn't actually an improvement. Like ending our use of leaded gasoline. 

This leads somewhere. We forget that. Our continued struggle and strife blinds us to the progress we're making. But we have made absolutely astonishing progress. And that progress feeds into itself and accelerates overall progress. We invent new tools that skip steps and make things faster and easier. Then we invent new processes that skip yet more steps. Eventually on the production side, we get from raw material to finished product with almost no human labor involved and very little cost.

We're almost there. And when we get there, the things we fear today won't matter anymore. You won't need security systems because no one will need nor want to steal anything you have. You won't need a job because productivity will be so high, a small investment in an automated AI run company will be enough to pay for everything. 

The near future is a world of ultra high productivity. I know this because the current world is a world of ultra high productivity. And that productivity is improving at a faster and faster rate. We are not that far away. With proper wealth distribution (or even just tolerable wealth distribution) and a few decades more improvements, and we're close enough to post-scarcity that it won't matter.

And that's the end. The end of systems like Socialism and Capitalism. Of course parts of those systems will hang on for a long time, but they won't matter. Resources will be so plentiful that crime will be of little to no benefit. Political systems will be less and less needed as AI's will handle most administrative processes. Struggle and strife will be diminished so substantially that we won't need systems to manage us. And whatever remnants that hang on from those systems will do so because we lack the drive to remove them.

Of course it's easy enough to find counter examples to all of this. ""What about Politician X! They're trying to destroy the system!"" Or you might say ""ah but what about big and powerful Country Y, look at how far they've fallen recently!"" It's easy to do this if you're looking at the world in terms of the last 10 or 20 years. But that's a mistake. This isn't such a short and temporary trend, but one that has existed and grow since we made the first tools and exploited fire. 

We all collectively muse about whatever disastrous news of the day and that shapes our world view. Except that news passes, just as everything does. The only things that are consistent is change and progress.

So then this all sounds wonderful, doesn't it? Except that's not how life works. Having no struggle and strife does not mean you/we are happy. Do we even know where happiness comes from? Usually it has something to do with overcoming struggle and strife. So if you have no struggle and no strife, does your life have any worth? 

As with any big change, this will almost certainly be a mix of good and bad in equal measure. 

**My point**: While Climate Change, Politics, and War are important to everyone today, they will likely be less and less important over time. So, while you may think this is all crazy talk, my request is that everyone keep an open mind and think as broadly as they can. 

In all my nearly 1000 replies in /r/Futurology I've found that pessimism, anger, and frustration are on the rise. Things are actually going better than they ever have in all of human history **globally** but it's very hard to see this within your individual countries and your individual lives. It *feels* like things are getting worse, but objectively based on all available metrics, things are improving at faster and faster rates.

There certainly are things that are in decline. The first and most obvious is the current extinction we're going through. Most of nature is suffering and much of it is dying. **But we are not.** You could say ""well we rely on nature, so we're all doomed"" and you might be right, but importantly that's not how things are looking today. 

We are not currently declining along with nature. Rather, we're actually accelerating our growth at possibly a faster pace than nature is declining. And while it's a repulsive idea, we can repair nature. That sounds like playing God, but we're pretty good at that. Most of what we do today is far beyond the concept of playing God from 1000 years ago. We are already playing God pretty much all the time.

But again, all of this doesn't mean we're heading to utopia. More a world that seems like Utopia, but one where we are still as unhappy as we are today. Or possibly worse, especially when we can start directly modifying the mind. When we start doing that, I have no idea how huge of a change that will produce. But I'm pretty sure I'll find out.",25,0,False,self,,,,,

I spend that time in various computer related hobbies, hobbies which are most often accompanied by an unhealthy amount of Youtube. Lately i have been on a binge of Engineering and related practical science video, Engineer Guy, Practical Engineering, even Colin Furze. Then came the TED talks and the guys ranting about clean energy.

Solar has no momentum and leads to a lot of toxic waste, Wind kills endangered animals, and both of those need optimal conditions to work, which is at best 30% of the time in most cases. Plus they need a LOT of space and are considered an eyesore.

Yet there are no problems with Nuclear. Sure it is a lot safer than we are lead to believe, but it is by no means perfect and everybody just neglects to talk about the downsides of nuclear and boy are there massive ones. So i started to look into them.

So, a typical nuclear reactor takes up 50 acres or 0.2 square kilometers. Moreso they require a square mile of clear land as a ""Buffer"" zone. So, a lot of space? Check.

You need a lot of concrete and general building materials to build a nuclear power plants, the cooling towers alone are often 200 meters high though most often they are half that so there is no little amount of common metals being put into them either. I couldn't find resources on what exactly they are made from but i am assuming aluminium or steel, both of which are really carbon intensive to create, not to mention the concrete that goes into it all. To add onto this, the vast amount of piping and general construction would add to that a lot. There is also a vast amount of electronics controlling everything from the doors to the reactor so while not as much as say Solar Panels it cannot be discounted when building hundreds of them, not even to mention the massive turbines they need which need to be specially and very carefully constructed and are frankly massive.

There are also smaller logistical problems with it, being staffed locations they would need things like running water, you'd need to build facilities for those workers, including lavatories, dining areas and other neccesities. Sure that does create a lot more jobs but you would need to have a lot of them.

There are currently 98 operating nuclear power plants in the united states. They power 20% of the country. so with a bit of fuzzy math you'd come to the conclusion that you'd need around four hundred new power plants at current capacity, Requiring 80 square kilometers of space, each with a square mile of buffer zones. An extra thousand square miles in nothing but safe zones in which you can build nothing. Bringing you up to roughly 1100 square kilometers of space. That's 20 thousands acres of land in buildings alone. 256 thousand acres in safe buffer zones. But hey, you just created between 160 thousand to 280 thousand new jobs. Very specialized educated jobs but jobs are jobs.

I'm just going to jump over the shark of nuclear waste and materials and get to what i find to be the most damning of this all. 


Water.

Water is used everywhere. As a coolant and even to boil into steam so you can turn these massive turbines and create energy that way. So how much water does a nuclear power plant use? 

One and a half ton per Megawatt Hour.

The R.E. Ginna nuclear power plant is the smallest nuclear power plant in the United States and it created 4 million megawatt hours in 2017. 

The average american uses 11925kwh per year. 12 megawatts. That means for each average citizen, they use up 18 tons of water annually just in energy generation. Multiply that by the 330 or so million americans and you get roughly 6 billion tons of water. 


That's six trillion liters. Six thousand billion.

Honestly i see a lot of people daming solar and wind and say just how safe and good Nuclear is but never even stops to think about just what goes into a nuclear reactor other than radioactive materials. Sure people have started to circlejerk Thorium and Molten Salt Reactors around but i haven't looked into that too much, just a lot of commentors going around saying how great it is and the one ted talk from 2016 which said to have the solution but then i haven't heard anything more from them since then. 


Now this is just one dude with too much free time and a cursory amount of research into this topic so please feel free to ~~incessantly scream at me~~ correct me on anything you see wrong here. 

I just don't think that Nuclear is the future or the shiny city on the horizon we should all strive towards. And the fact that nobody mentions any of these points makes me a bit skeptical about them.",0,3,False,self,,,,,

In-person facial recognition,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/dctwil/random_life_skill_into_a_profession_inperson/,futurememior,1570122798,"I'm looking for a career change. As a starting point, I am listing all of things I am naturally good at. One random skill I have always had is CIA status facial recognition. 

The saying ""I never forget a face"" is usually a light-hearted joke but in my case it is quite literal. I've recognized people I went to preschool with and had no connection after that period. I've recognized strangers from the internet that I've passed by in person. If we meet or cross paths I will remember your face (but not your name). This comes in handy with networking. Also if I am in a very large crowd (concert, conference, music festival, etc.) I can find people very easily. 

Not sure if this is related but I just took a neurofeedback emotional intelligence test where they flash photos of faces that have words written on them like SAD, HAPPY, SCARED, EXCITED, FEAR, JOY, etc. and the faces may or may not correlate with those words. You have 1 second to respond and I got 100% which the administrator said has never happened before. 
He said mean that means is the neurons in my hippocampus in temporal lobe - the area under the templethat specialize in responding to faces (involved with the senses of smell and sound, the processing of semantics in both speech and vision, including the processing of complex stimuli like faces and scenes, and plays a key role in the formation of long-term memory) has very high communication with the frontal lobe (involved in conscious thought and higher mental functions such as decision-making, problem solving, emotional expressions, and plays an important part in processing short-term memories and retaining longer term memories which are not task-based) and the occipital lobe which is our sense of sight / visual functions (coordination of eye movements perception, image recognition, association, visual memory). But really I don't know what any of this means.

As a joke my friends call me ""laser eyes"" but I've always wondered how I can use this to my professional advantage - aside from networking. 

Is there any type of career that would need this type of random skill? I know that most facial recognition is based on AI and technology nowadays so I'm not sure. 

Looking forward to hearing Reddit's suggestions!

Alright, so the above image is a wall of text. So let me explain.

[This is the output of a program called GPT2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) described and published [in this MIT research paper.](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf)

Wanting to play around with the software, I downloaded it, and went through the hell and high water troubleshooting to get it running properly. The first thing I did was give it a test prompt... the first two paragraphs of the opening crawl of Star Wars Episode 4.

&gt;It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.

I ran it, and you know what it gave out in return. A game rulebook.

Why is this important?

You might want to search any part of that output text. Because it doesn't exist anywhere. It is an entirely original composition.

It says it will describe 6 attack types, and then lays out the document to do so. It recognizes the submitted text as the Star Wars intellectual property, even though it was specifically specified.

The rules are actually somewhat logically coherent, and maybe even somewhat playable.

&gt;The Rebels are now ready to launch a new attack on the Death Star, but will their plan be too late?

&gt;The Rebellion must choose three paths at a glance to win the battle.

&gt;The Rebellion must select from six different combat options:

&gt;**Attack:**

&gt;When attacking, ships must be placed in formation to prevent enemy ships from tracking your position. Once the attack is completed, the ship must be immediately repaired at your new position. All damaged weapons must be removed and placed behind the ship's hull when attempting to return to your original location.

&gt;**Recon:**

&gt;During this time, any enemy ships that track you can destroy any Rebel ship in their path, preventing all damage until they are destroyed by your own ships.

&gt;**Reinforce:**

&gt;This type of action places allied ships, such as Rebel scouts and corvettes, in reserve positions to protect allied ships during a single action. Once the maneuver is completed all allied ships must immediately retreat to their current positions as if it had not been completed.

&gt;**Taunt:**

&gt;When attacking, you must taunt an attacking enemy ship for the entire combat. Each wave of the taunt must last until either the second ally ship or the first ally ship is eliminated. During each wave of the taunt, you may have one ally ship attack a different enemy ship. These attacks remain in reserve until all your allies are eliminated.

&gt;**Targeting:**

&gt;During an attack, when the enemy ship you have hit is destroyed, destroy that ship to prevent all damage being dealt to the Rebel ship. All enemies and structures within 30.0 degrees of the target must also be destroyed or damaged before that ship is destroyed. The damage of each hit is based on weapon damage dealt.

&gt;**Droid Combat*

&gt;Droid Combat is a tactical action mode where you use droid attacks, and droid vehicles, to defeat your enemy.

&gt;Droid targets are revealed as you move the target over the map. When that spot is hit, the damage dealt to that target is reflected on several different droid targets. Targeting is based on how the target would be damaged and/or destroyed.

&gt;The Rebel base is very difficult to defend against, due to a massive number of Rebel units and the varied sizes of the droids on the map. Because of this complexity, Droid Combat is best played against a friend, partner, or friend of a friend who is familiar with Star Wars. However, when playing with a friend or an adversary, this is

It cuts off right at the end because of a default length limitation. It didn't know that when I first ran the software, so we don't get to see the rest of the rules of this game.

Let me reiterate why this is important for our future.

- This game does not exist, it was created from extrapolated data from a test operation which I will probably never see again.

- No human contributed to any part of this, other than the training data of course. It is an entirely original composition, orchestrated by machine learning.

- A person could take this and run with it. I want to play this game now. This could be a great tool for content creation, and just for novelty. If I can press ""enter"" from a 3 sentence and output and entire game rulebook, why do I have to personally do any work other than verify the generated content as logically valid.

- Of course it doesn't just make games, it extrapolates from content. It didn't make a game because that is all it knows. It did so because in its training data it read a Warhammer 40k rulebook, seen ships and rebels... and thought it might be a Star Wars themed rulebook entry. It doesn't have an example of that, so it made one instead.

Want me to further blow your mind.

This is only a castrated version of the full training data set (to be released in February 2020). They didn't release it because of fear it could be used to deepfake scientific knowledge or news articles.

&gt;We will build a new, modern and technologically advanced city. We will have high living standards.

I used that 2 sentence input text to generate the following news article.

&gt;This latest pushback followed the city's recent decision to scrap almost half its traffic lights in favour of traffic indicators that show the shape of buildings and traffic signals.

&gt;While New Year's resolutions are a good chance to show off that money is rolling in, they also could be seen as one last desperate attempt to salvage any momentum left after months of economic weakness on the island.

&gt;The biggest headache for a government that was in the process of a budget that included spending $25bn on major infrastructure projects such as the Southbank project.

&gt;But that also meant that billions were thrown into building infrastructure that could last only 10 years while the islands were still part of the British Empire.

&gt;""There is no money left to take on what some people would call the elephant in the room, what the British had to deal with,"" Professor Campbell said.

&gt;""It is simply not realistic enough to see us through to 2040 with infrastructure built when the islands are still part of the British Empire.""

Professor Campbell doesn't exist, but GPT2 quoted him anyway. It knows that Southbank is part of the British Empire (London), just from reading the text connected relationships between the two cities. $25bn is a number is literally yanked from it's database somewhere. But together, if I put this on a news site somewhere, nobody would be any the wiser.

After February of next year, you will have to take a hard look at anything you read.

#Yes, of course. You may post an input text for you, I will generate the output for you.

Is humanity ready?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ddl7ct/i_can_see_the_future_but_i_dont_know_what_it/,gforsi,1570269030,"As technological progress accelerates exponentially humanity faces a philosophical and ethical challenge in the mid-term future (upcoming 50 years).

There are so many key technologies on the edge of a breakthrough or actually are already beginning to be a part of society.

There is biotechnological advancements like CRISPR CAS9 Genome Editing where people could be ""designed"" to be the biological perfect human being or even more than that, the perfect biological lifeform. In addition, there are augmentations that will improve lifeforms/humans even further, e.g. brain chips like from that recently announced company by Elon Musk. This can be spun even further with replacing any body part with synthetics/prosthetics until only the brain is left. Brain/thought controlled prosthetics are becoming available. Advancement until they are better than original body parts is only a matter of time.

This leads the to the next key technology which goes hand in hand like virtual reality, brain-computer-interfaces or any technology that basically enables the creation of a virtual environment inside our mind. From there we are already deep into the philosophical question about life itself, what are we and what is consciousness?

If all that were not enough there is the recent advancements in AI and robotics. When will be the brink of creating another lifeform from AI? Of course scenarios like terminator come to mind, but that is just a one sided story to all of this that only incorporates one key technological enhancement, that of robotics and AI gone wrong. Maybe we ""only"" create another, non-biological lifeform that lives alongside biological enhanced and augmented humans.

But we do not need to venture too deep into the very existing of life itself. Other key technologies like 3D printing will enable the just-in-time production of literally anything that one ever needs. Bionic body parts for our enhanced bodies, organs, food (if that will even be a thing in the future), medicine, houses, any item eventually. There will be no more production of things. Everything will be printed where and when needed. 3D printing has enhanced so drastically over the recent years.

In all this, the every increasing concept of decentralization plays an important role. With it technologies like block chain, crypto currencies etc. Literally everything will be decentralized and connected.

Then there is quantum computing which will basically fasten or enable (all those) technological advancements on a level we might not even think of as of yet.

All of this of course powered by fusion energy.

Many of these concepts are covered in (mostly dystopian) movies. Being dystopian futures like Blade Runner, Terminator, Matrix, the black mirror series, but all focus mostly on one technology at a time. The whole picture of all those (and of course many more technologies) is just to complicated to grasp.

While all these technologies are fascinating on their own, the interaction and assimilation of all of them into one big picture which ultimately is our society/humanity, is what makes a future that I can not really comprehend or grasp. What will humanity/human beings be? What will life? What is life? Will there be a new level of life/consciousness? What is right or wrong? What is god? Are we becoming gods? A never ending stream of questions that philosophs tried to answer for thousands of years are become ever more relevant by the day and from my point of view we need some answers rather sooner than later.",8,3,False,self,,,,,

Howdy!

Below is an amazing YouTube channel from Dr. James Tour. Dr. Tour is an exemplary Scientist. He is a leading Nanotechnology pioneer who authored almost 700 publications in top journals, has over 200 patents across multiple fields, and an H-index of 141. He is also an excellent research mentor who deeply cares for his students.

For the first time in history, an outstanding Scientist is revealing how top research groups operate. This is not the type of stuff that you can see on TV shows, or anywhere else, in fact. This is real, serious, raw Science at its finest. Many of the videos will be straightforward documentations on crucial moments when high impact decisions are made.

Thus, the videos will provide insight on how we as a group think, innovate, invent, and implement world-changing solutions to difficult problems of enormous scale. The purpose of this channel is to show how top Scientists approach life.

I have been thinking about the issues we face for a while and decided to post my thoughts here. If anyone wants to help me with this please message me, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

&amp;#x200B;

1	Life and consciousness, that which originated on Earth is the greatest value and must be protected. Death is the enemy. Extinctive forces must be fought so they don't annihilate life

2	In humans, the lives of individuals are of utmost importance. The power of our species is stored within individuals who constantly grow wiser as they live, and each individual brings a unique perspective to the species. The logical conclusion of this is that humans must attain immortality, to preserve and enhance our collective consciousness. So we must give everyone who wants it the ability to live forever. A person that could become immortal can live millions of modern lifespans, more life is potentially lost by denying someone immortality than was lost in the entirety of WWII.

3	We shall give to every individual anti-aging at no upfront cost, ideally for free. If we cannot afford to give it for free we will set up a system of automatically approved loans with payments capped to a reasonable portion of ones income.

4	We will give treatment first to the oldest person in the world, and then to other people by age. We will make sure that even the poorest of the poor receive this treatment and don't have to die.

5	For every other augmentation to an individual such as increased intelligence, we will provide it in this same way if it's essential to being competitive in the economy

6	We see modifying the human mind to be very promising. Today we do it with antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs, but we foresee in the future the ability to change any behavior such as imposing honesty or making criminals never commit crimes ever again. Despite this promise we need to ensure all these procedures are voluntary with informed consent, the difference between brainwashing and psychiatry is that the psychiatrist only brings people to states they want to be in

7	We will do as best we can to stop wars and humanitarian crises to minimize death as best we can, and direct many resources to healthcare and infrastructure development to prevent deaths too. In the near future immortality for all will be in number one priority of the species

8	We will as best we can end wars and criminal standoffs nonlethally. We will develop arrest drones that can fly to people and arrest them without fear for their own safety. If a drone is destroyed then another will be sent

9	We will end life imprisonment and capital punishment. Some people cannot be released because they are too dangerous to society, so instead, we will keep these people imprisoned until psychiatry advances enough that they can be safely released. Ideally, we will put them in cryostasis so they don't need to experience inhumanely long sentences, only waking them up to let family visit and to offer them treatment and parole

10	We hope to use suspended animation to prevent the deaths of people with terminal illnesses as we look for cures. This service must be available to everyone as the goal is for no death at all.

11	We hope to develop the technology to remove a fetus or embryo from a pregnant woman who does not want to keep the child so that abortion will be obsolete, but we will take no measures against the contemporary practice until this alternative is invented. If the child has a congenital disease we hope to use cryostasis until a cure is found.

12	We hope to replace euthanasia with cryostasis until a cure is found, but we will take no measures against the contemporary practice until this alternative is invented.

13	We will make sure to protect the rights of those who do not wish to live forever for religious reasons or other reasons. And pass laws to protect them from discrimination

14	As climate change is a major threat to humanity as a whole we will seek to motivate or reverse it, prevention is not an option anymore, and we cannot let even a single person die either from climate change or from prioritizing climate action over healthcare action

15	All immortals will be given compulsory education with their living expenses covered in full every fifty years, this is to ensure nobody ends up with outdated skills due to graduating several centuries ago, and to refresh civic engagement.

16	Population increase is going to be a major issue with the advent of immortality. Most people desire families of a certain size depending on the culture they grew up in, and this desire is extremely important to psychological wellbeing. As the old will be able to work again we will create an economic boom and this boom will help counteract the effects of the population growth. Everyone alive today will be able to have families as big as they want within their natural lifespans.

17	Over a longer period, family size is more difficult. People today tend to have a finite number of children that they want to have in their lifespan. But immortal people will probably want to have more children after all their children are over 100 years old. So people will have a certain number of children per century most likely rather than an absolute number of children. In some contexts, we might find this overwhelming and seek to impose a limit such as two children per century, but this is unlikely and will always be subject to the democratic process

18	We will focus on space colonization after global immortality is achieved to create room for more people and gather resources to support more people but it's a lower priority until we gain immortality for all

19	We will allow everyone who refuses immortality to take their pensions indefinitely. Immortals will be given a time limit to their pensions so they may enjoy the lives they wanted to live after retirement, but will still be able to work

20	As we cannot see any aliens in the large universe there might be a serious danger out there that stops alien civilizations from developing. As such a danger will be catastrophic to our society we will research the absence of aliens and respond accordingly to what we find

21	We must preserve our own species before helping others, but once humans no longer die we must address the value of nonhuman life. We should try to save as many lineages as we can, but most animal species seem not to have immortality as a goal.

22	We will be forced to increase government spending and taxes significantly to deal with the transition to immortality. All wealthy people who cooperate will be more than compensated adjusting for inflation once global immortality is achieved. It might take a while to pay them back but there will be centuries to pay them back

23	We will need to create a world government to achieve these goals, however, we will make it as decentralized as possible with an emphasis on local democratic governance and respect for each others cultural values. Nothing but the aforementioned goals for achieving immortality will be pursued by the world government, with everything else being left to local governments.

24	We will not challenge the capitalist economy. It might not be the best one but the movement is for immortality, over the coming centuries once everyone is immortal we will discuss economic systems",3,0,False,self,,,,,

Going into this field has made me come to the realization of how quickly our technology has advanced.

I think a common misconception about drones is that they will only become nightmarish once they become fully aware. 

When in fact we already have the technology to create autonomous killing machines. 

We already have:

1.) Facial recognition software. So the drones can remember every face theyve ever seen, remember their last location over GPS

2.) 360 Degree Infrared cameras to spot targets from almost anywhere, recording every moment, and remembering previous flights.

3.) Autonomous, machine learning flight software to allow the drones to fly on their own, seamlessly, without colliding with obstacles, and while staying on their targets. (Skydio 2 literally does this flawlessly)

4.) GPS satellites to create a realtime world map, stream data to the drones about their location, set perimeter areas for the drones to patrol. 

I just think were already so far along, and we dont even realize it. A lot of engineers dont yet realize it. 

A drone doesnt need to be fully autonomous. It can simply do one or two autonomous tasks effectively, as weve already seen. These can be patrolling an area, counting the number of personnel based on appearance, clothing, following a vehicle.  

In WW II Germany made use of their tanks in ways no one imagined was possible at the time. I think the same terrible could happen with drones. 

Im not trying to fear monger anyone with this, but I do think its worth a discussion. People build and race drones at my university. We find them fascinating, fun, useful. Theres just a certain element of them that I also find a bit...  terrifying.

Any thoughts?",17,11,False,self,,,,,

With the apparent mutual crises of both the Chinese social system and the American social system, people are becoming increasingly aware of the flaws of both systems, and I imagine we will see a renewed debate over the next few years on this topic. China seems to be able to prevent many social ills by exerting higher control over its people than democratic countries, but it also displays some clear corruption and lack of care for its own people. Likewise, America and to a lesser extent European countries display increasing levels of political polarization that threaten to undermine their institutions. I think some form of synthesis might be better than either one, but this raises the question of how much social engineering and censorship can exist in a society while maintaining democratic institutions. I doubt anything good would come from looking to ""illiberal democracies"" as they tend to be very corrupt and lack rule of law, which is arguably one of the best traits of democracies, but I imagine a very robust judiciary system might be able to provide oversight to some Chinalike methods of social control such as internet censorship and a social credit system that would otherwise threaten democracy.

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible

Or know about it at all.

For those who'd like to know more : [https://issafrica.org/amp/iss-today/africas-population-boom-burden-or-opportunity](https://issafrica.org/amp/iss-today/africas-population-boom-burden-or-opportunity)

The overall subsaharian african population will well exceed the billion mark. Lagos's population (capital of Nigeria) is expected to reach about 88 million somewhere during this century, making it the most populated city in the world.

The rest of the world (especially developed countries like Japan, Germany, China, etc.) will start to experience important population declines and decreasing fertility rates while Africa's will continue to scale up.

&amp;#x200B;

I have so many questions.

I often wonder how a country like China (that is rather industrialized &amp; developed) can successfully sustain its enormous 1,4 billion people. But how can it be the same for african countries?

What kind of infrastructures can sustain so many people when they're already living in such extreme poverty? How do their governments intend to produce enough food to keep everyone alive? How will they handle all the housing problems that will come along with it? How will it impact the world economies? What can be done to be prepared to it or to prevent it?

All of that alongside the plethora of unpredictable issues that come along with it.

I'd like to know what you guys think. The input of any expert on the topic is more than welcome.",11,2,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently doing my master thesis in Computer Science. The thesis is to control robots through natural language. To test the NLP system I have been developing I need your help! Basically is to fill the form ([https://forms.gle/6FKtG5XF5ZZzWzLD6](https://forms.gle/6FKtG5XF5ZZzWzLD6)) on how you would say something to the Commander (the leader of the group of robots) or to the system.

Because people talk different ways this is a great way to test how good my system is understanding natural sentences.

My thesis system works with robots (drones) and, because there are a lot of drones operating, you need to talk to their master, the Commander. The Commander is responsible to hear your command and to redirect your command to all his robot-slaves. This way, you can control 20,100,2000 robots at the same time, just by speaking to one Commander!

**Here is the form:** [**https://forms.gle/6FKtG5XF5ZZzWzLD6**](https://forms.gle/6FKtG5XF5ZZzWzLD6)

This should take around 5-10 minutes! Your input will be very helpful!

With this said, I have found moderate success in business - however I would be lying if I said I was satisfied. 

This is what has motivated me to reach out to the startup community - I want to build something with you - together! This thread can be used to introduce yourself and your idea - hopefully as we progress, matches can be made, relationships formed and ideas worked on together. 

With all that said, let's get going. A few ideas to get us rolling: 

1. Platform for Brick and Mortar businesses to swap physical locations (leases). 
2. A platform for startups to temporarily swap or trade staff with specific skill-sets to other startups.

Original websites, but most are available on your favorite podcast provider. Big ups if you put together and share one or a few public spotify or stitcher or soundcloud or youtube playlists. you should search those, too, for more, using a variety of key words, my search is limited. 

Categories are fluid. You're going to like some more than others. 

I left a couple off that I'm sick of.. or haven't heard of.  Surely there are more industry/sector specific (AI, VR, Biotech..)

&gt;&gt;Who am I?
&gt;&gt;I like to imagine, navigate and analyse the future of humanity. I am currently an academic and lecturer at the National University of Ireland (NUI), Galway. I teach in the School of Law. I am also an affiliate scholar at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies.

My research deals primarily with the ethical, social and legal implications of emerging technologies, but dances around some other philosophical topics. In the past I have written papers about social robots, the risks of advanced AI, the meaning of life and the future of work, the ethics of human enhancement, the intersection between law and neuroscience, the utility of brain-based lie detection, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of religion.

So as any regular human I get bombarded with scary thoughts about the future all the time. So I decided to start a blog where I can dump all the silly ideas I can come up with for a more sustainable future. Now, I know that I alone will not come up with the winning idea that saves us all, the main goal is simply to gain some personal peace of mind and secondly to create some collaboration. I want to hear all the holes in my theories, I want to know where these ideas are weak, or where they can be fortified because all in all I believe that we just need more collaboration. 

So maybe you guys want to check it out? The posts are short in order to not bore people to death and hopefully I can get a few people to comment an get a conversation going :)

So I copied and pasted parts of the patent in and this is what I got out.


I put in the first sentence. 

""A plasma compression fusion device which includes a hollow duct and at least one pair of opposing counter-spinning dynamic fusors.""

This is what it writes.


""A plasma compression fusion device which includes a hollow duct and at least one pair of opposing counter-spinning dynamic fusors.

The plasma compression fusion device may include a first pair of opposing radial diametrically disposed opposing fusors. The first pair of opposing radial diametrically-displacable fusors may be formed in a first configuration wherein it is advantageous to provide a high plasma pressure when the second pair of opposing radial diametrically-displacable fusors are positioned opposite each other. Thus, the second pair of opposing radial diametrically-displacable fusors may be provided to a first position and the first pair of opposing radial diametrically-displacable fusors may be provided to a second position, wherein the second pair of opposing radial diametrically-displacable fusors will be disposed in adjacent a first counter-spinning dynamic fusor in the second configuration.

The plasma compression fusion device may include a second pair of opposing radial diametrically-displacable fusors. The second pair of opposing radial diametrically-displacable fusors may""

It's pretty repetitive. I think it got kind of caught in a loop. Let's see what happens if we add another few sentence from the patent.

""A plasma compression fusion device which includes a hollow duct and at least one pair of opposing counter-spinning dynamic fusors.The hollow duct includes a vacuum chamber disposed within the hollow duct. Each dynamic fusor has a plurality of orifices and an outer surface which is electrically charged.""

Then it puts out this.


A plasma compression fusion device which includes a hollow duct and at least one pair of opposing counter-spinning dynamic fusors.The hollow duct includes a vacuum chamber disposed within the hollow duct. Each dynamic fusor has a plurality of orifices and an outer surface which is electrically charged.The at least one opposing counter-spinning dynamic fusor rotates around an axis perpendicular to the chamber and at a particular angle.The chamber includes a suction disk configured to compress the liquid helium inside the chamber in a liquid environment.The chamber is capable of storing liquid helium and is provided with a suitable power supply.Each dynamic fusor has a substantially round, flat bottom surface which includes an inter-heating ring and a cross-shaped, tapered surface of a second bottom surface.The chamber is shaped such that the first bottom surface and second bottom surfaces face outwardly from a central pivot axis or cross-axis and at a particular angle. The bottom surfaces of each dynamic fusor may be located within the cavity of the plasma to be compressed.Each dynamic fusor comprises a plurality of counter-propulsive

Boutilier](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/Faculty/Boutilier_Justin/) and I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/industrial-systems-engineering) at the University of Wisconsin  Madison.

Broadly speaking, my research focuses on improving the quality, access, and delivery of healthcare. One component of my research agenda includes designing and optimizing drone networks to deliver defibrillators to cardiac arrest incidents.

You can find our first paper on this topic [here](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.026318), with an accompanying [Editorial](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.027888).

A second paper, with a more advanced mathematical model can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00149).

Ive also written a provocative [thought piece](https://isbinsight.isb.edu/emergency-medical-services-are-drones-the-future/) on the topic of drones in emergency medicine.

Based on this work and the potential of drones, Peel region (near Toronto, Canada) conducted a pilot project to test the idea. You can read more about that [here](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/04/02/peel-pilot-project-tests-drone-delivery-of-defibrillators-to-help-cardiac-arrest-victims.html) and [here](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/drone-delivery-canada-successfully-completes-phase-one-of-aed-on-the-fly-pilot-with-peel-region-paramedics-807614473.html).

The older I get and the more  ""street""/commonsense wisdom I gain, the more I understand that  technology is all a boondoggle according to a higher understanding of  what this business of living is all about. That point of view can be  explained in a simple statement: ***Technology is a sin against nature.***  I'm not religious-minded, but it is easy to see that the ""original sin""  was/is not our sexual nature, but the desire, need, and compulsion to  twist the elements of nature around to serve us.

The  best way to consider the likelihood of my views being reasonable is  from two, seemingly different, perspectives From that of what must be  the benevolent UFO overlords wheeling over us, and from that of the  apparent nature of those creatures we variously call the Sasquatch, Big  Foot and Yeti, etc.  


""Wait-a-minute,""  you interject with a knee-jerk shout! ""The one evidently has godlike  powers of technology and the other doesn't even use fire!"" Exactly.  Two extremes of consciousness that we can allow ourselves to exist and  we are caught square in the middle between the two. --How interesting  that we can recognize that chance coincidence that has serendipitously  fallen to us. Fate and destiny right before our eyes with two extreme  pathways. Which is better? Is one *better* than the other? Or is  there a blending, as it would seem in looking at the world we have  created for ourselves, that those oppositional positions can co-exist  within our cultures and societies? Are we trying to make one aspect the  sole goal and the other is not even taken seriously? The answer to  that is absolutely a strong ""Yes!"" Easily exampled by looking at our  cultures and societies that are fully engaged in beating each other with  bigger and better applications of twisting the elements of physics to  our most absurd whims on the one hand and the portions of humanity given  to inwardly searches of consciousness that are devoid of material  attainment. This latter group best explained by those that choose to be  monks, etc.

Objectively,  there must be a co-mingling of the two extremes if nothing more than an  understanding and appreciation of the other. At the rate we are going  with our lust for materialism, our ignorance of our ignorance,  supersedes.",15,0,False,self,,,,,

Currently, one of the latest waves in psuedotechnological abuse of the poor is found in ""accidental"" austerity via the willful deployment of technologically inadequate new solutions to analyzing poverty.  If we fix these analysis systems and better integrate them with our systems of analysis for political economy, it should be possible to deploy medical and societal tools in ways that tend to equalize the productive output of humanity from the bottom up.

There is an older strain of thought which attempted to utilize emergent egalitarianism as precisely this sort of tool through the funding of public education.  Both social mobility and the standard of living at the low end of society in developed nations is higher because of their mostly-functional public school systems.  That work has done much good, and continuing it is still of primary importance in some regions of the world, but in the developed world increased returns via that channel have become hard to achieve.

Does that mean emergent egalitarianism is a technology we should abandon in the dustbin of history?  No.  Ongoing pressures against welfare as a resolution to inequality are not likely to recede any time soon.  The problem can be summarized like this: people do not like welfare.  They do not like paying into welfare systems, they are not generally thrilled to receive from them, and although many people hate to be accused of ""hating the poor"", the resulting strained etiquette is a *false* etiquette that does little to open doors to a better life for people.  Perhaps we should acknowledge that the biases of humanity can be so severe as to render welfare systems counterproductive!  Technology itself can become maligned and misused in the opposition towards raising the base dignity of humanity via transfer payments, as in the case where shoddy automation is shoved out the door with its inevitable errors celebrated as a kind of politically expedient budget-cutting.  Welfare is an example of *non*\-emergent egalitarianism... and thus an example of the *perils* of non-emergent egalitarianism.

Where then can we find new potentials for emergent egalitarianism?  I believe that medical technology advances will clear this way open for us.  The next wave of emergent egalitarianism will involve transferring welfare state resources into healthcare state resources.  France (to seize upon a particular example which has historic and economic reasons to potentially be interested in this idea) as of 2016 expended 11.5% of GDP upon public healthcare while expending 31.5% of GDP upon social welfare.  One of the factors aggravating social welfare expenditure rates in France is ""difficulty of insertion"", which is a phrase indicating prolonged unemployment in individuals of ages 24 to 59.  Unemployability does not arise ex nihilo; it is neither a holy mandate nor a desirable state of being.  If something could be done to reform the ""unemployable"" populations, they would rest lightly on the social welfare system.  Yet there must be substantial investments to achieve such reforms.  I believe that the reform of the unemployable populations will arise from the embrace of new technologies.

Life extension technology research is presently focused on the very old.  Based upon my recent discovery that there are RYR2 receptors in the hippocampus which can become deformed by the experience of chronic stress, I believe that this fixation of life extension upon the very old may be gravely, dangerously flawed in a way that threatens the extent of the potential rewards achievable through life extension research.  For in contemplating the existence of the RYR2 receptors in the hippocampus, I realized at once that populations which are impoverished are abnormally likely to suffer grave stress and traumatic risks in their life, and these populations are therefore as a consequence of those traumas in danger of losing some of the functionality of their hippocampus.  I do not know the full neurological function of RYR2 receptors, nor do I know their full extent across the brain's neurology, but I do know that RYR2 receptors regulate calcium flow, which in turn is used to regulate voltages across many substrates of the body.  I would expect that RYR2 receptors in the hippocampus therefore are utilized to regulate voltage flows, with losses of ordinary neurological homeostasis consequent to stress-damaged and leaky RYR2 receptors.  A weakened hippocampus is then likely to lead to deficits in memory, time sense, and spatial thinking.  These deficits dramatically impair likely functionality in countless roles throughout the economy, and may indeed render someone crippled depending on severity.

If abusing the poor weakens the functioning of the hippocampus, it will then proceed to weaken the capacity of the poor to ever cease being poor, proving once again that people who hate the poor are imbeciles who spend their lives replicating the patterns that they object to most.  As we cannot hope to save the poor in our society from all mistreatment, we should look to other resolutions.  I do believe that other resolutions can be found.  Again RYR2 receptors form a spectacular example, as there is a class of drug which operates upon them known as calcium channel blockers.  Since damaged RYR receptors are characteristically known to *leak*, calcium channel blockers should be investigated for their potential to stem leaks in RYR receptors.  This one intervention may redeem the clear mental functioning and employability of many people who have suffered traumas in their lives.

If traumatic damages to the brain's intracellular calcium regulation capabilities were healable, that would enable the successful retraining and/or reinsertion into the economy of many individuals who became unemployable due to trauma or ""burn-out"".  That would greatly improve the efficiency of nations which currently expend vast resources caring for the quality of life of people who cannot enter into the market.  It might also increase the employability of migrant communities while reducing cultural pressures resultant from migration flows, as many criminal migrants (especially refugees) have severe deficits in cognition owing to traumatic histories, without which they would integrate far more smoothly into the societies they are attempting to enter.  Impoverished migrants who can find no community save in ghettos are feared far more than successful migrants who with clear minds can enter in to middle class lives.

If enacted prior to ""middle age"" and then subsequently maintained lifelong, this one intervention would also supply great gains in life extension, as the degradation of the heart and skeletal muscles is also hallmarked by degradation of RYR receptors that may potentially be arrested through the application of calcium channel blockers.  This is an example therefore of a gain in life extension which can be made most effectively by focusing attention on individuals of younger ages than are typically contemplated for life extension.  Nor would the benefits be wholly upon the young (for at what age would people not benefit from improving the functioning of their heart and hippocampus?), yet there would be a dramatic expansion of political will to invest in the research and deployment of this technology if it were utilized not as yet another expensive benefit for old people, but as a means of broad economic reform.

In this way, there is at least one example yet remaining to be achieved of substantial economic gains that can be made via investment in healthcare, and moreover as this investment disproportionately benefits individuals with traumatic histories it will also disproportionately benefit individuals who are currently impoverished and expensive upon their surrounding societies.  I do not believe that this will be the only intervention by which medicine may in the coming decades supply an emergent egalitarian impetus, but rather I suspect that the reformation of the impoverished will be a subject of sustained popularity and research once the efficacy of the work has begun to be demonstrated.",3,7,False,self,,,,,

These people and this firm are not your friend. They are almost completely corrupted. This is just another corporate tool stating what should be obvious to everybody. Please look at the evidence on how corrupted this firm has become. This isnt even a 1% sliver.

.........point being..........LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE........the words of the prophets

George Carlin &gt;

But theres a reason. Theres a reason. Theres a reason for this, theres a reason education SUCKS, and its the same reason it will never, ever, EVER be fixed.

Its never going to get any better, dont look for it, be happy with what youve got.

Because the owners, the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the BIG owners! The Wealthy the REAL owners! The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.

Forget the politicians. They are irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice! You have OWNERS! They OWN YOU. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. Theyve long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.

They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they dont want:

They dont want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They dont want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. Theyre not interested in that. That doesnt help them. Thats against their interests.

Thats right. They dont want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly theyre getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They dont want that!

You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now theyre coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? Theyll get it. Theyll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this fucking place! It's a big club, and you aint in it! You, and I, are not in the big club.

By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table has tilted folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care! Good honest hard-working people; white collar, blue collar it doesnt matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-working people continue, these are people of modest means, continue to elect these rich cock suckers who dont give a fuck about you.they dont give a fuck about you they dont give a FUCK about you.

They dont care about you at all at all AT ALL. And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Thats what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick thats being jammed up their assholes everyday, because the owners of this country know the truth.

It's called the American Dream,because you have to be asleep to believe it.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm an academic based at NUI Galway, Ireland. I have a long-time interest in the philosophy of technology, particularly in AI ethics, transhumanism, automation and the future of work. I've written about this extensively on my blog ([Philosophical Disquisitions](https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/)) and have just published a new book called [Automation and Utopia: Human Flourishing in a World Without Work](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674984240). I'll be here for the next 90 mins or so (and following up later today and tomorrow) to answer you questions.

The book tries to present a rigorous case for techno-utopianism and a post-work future. I wrote it partly as a result of my own frustration with techno-futurist non-fiction. I like books that present provocative ideas about the future, but I often feel underwhelmed by the strength of the arguments they use to support these ideas. I don't know if you are like me, but if you are then you don't just want to be **told what** someone thinks about the future; you want to be **shown why (and how)**they think about the future and be able to critically assess their reasoning. If I got it right, then [Automation and Utopia](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674984240)will allow you to do this. You may not agree with what I have to say in the end, but you should at least be able to figure out where I have gone wrong.

The book defends four propositions:

* **Proposition 1 -The automation of work is both possible and desirable:** work is bad for most people most of the time, in ways that they dont always appreciate. We should do what we can to hasten the obsolescence of humans in the arena of work.
* **Proposition 2 -The automation of life more generally poses a threat to human well-being, meaning, and flourishing:** automating technologies undermine human achievement, distract us, manipulate us and make the world more opaque. We need to carefully manage our relationship with technology to limit those threats.
* **Proposition 3 -One way to mitigate this threat would be to build a Cyborg Utopia, but its not clear how practical or utopian this would really be**: integrating ourselves with technology, so that we become cyborgs, might regress the march toward human obsolescence outside of work but will also carry practical and ethical risks that make it less desirable than it first appears.
* **Proposition 4 -Another way to mitigate this threat would be to build a Virtual Utopia**: instead of integrating ourselves with machines in an effort to maintain our relevance in the real world, we could retreat to virtual worlds that are created and sustained by the technological infrastructure that we have built. At first glance, this seems tantamount to giving up, but there are compelling philosophical and practical reasons for favouring this approach.",102,70,False,self,,,,,

One of the best answers I've heard to this was found in a letter written over 40 years ago.

This question was posed to **Dr. Ernst Stublinger**, the associate director of Science at NASA in the early 1970s. It was asked by a Nun, who felt strongly that the money would better be spent helping starving children.

As part of Stublinger's reply, he told the following story about a Count from the 1500s:

**The Count**

About 400 years ago, there lived a count in a small town in Germany. He was one of the benign counts, and he gave a large part of his income to the poor in his town. This was much appreciated, because poverty was abundant during medieval times, and there were epidemics of the plague which ravaged the country frequently.

One day, the count met a strange man. He had a workbench and little laboratory in his house, and he labored hard during the daytime so that he could afford a few hours every evening to work in his laboratory. He ground small lenses from pieces of glass; he mounted the lenses in tubes, and he used these gadgets to look at very small objects.

The count was particularly fascinated by the tiny creatures that could be observed with the strong magnification, and which he had never seen before. He invited the man to move with his laboratory to the castle, to become a member of the count's household, and to devote henceforth all his time to the development and perfection of his optical gadgets as a special employee of the count.

The townspeople, however, became angry when they realized that the count was wasting his money, as they thought, on a stunt without purpose. ""We are suffering from this plague,"" they said, ""while he is paying that man for a useless hobby!"" But the count remained firm. ""I give you as much as I can afford,"" he said, ""but I will also support this man and his work, because I know that someday something will come out of it!""

Indeed, something very good came out of this work, and also out of similar work done by others at other places: the microscope. It is well known that the microscope has contributed more than any other invention to the progress of medicine, and that the elimination of the plague and many other contagious diseases from most parts of the world is largely a result of studies which the microscope made possible.

The count, by retaining some of his spending money for research and discovery, contributed far more to the relief of human suffering than he could have contributed by giving all he could possibly spare to his plague-ridden community.

So far. As a matter of fact the USA unemployment rate is at a record low as of now. 3.5%. Employment of one sort or another is actually booming according to that figure. Businesses in the USA are going begging for employees. 
But.
How many millions of USA citizens are working ""gig"" style jobs with zero health insurance or retirement benefits? Not all ""full-time"" employment is created equal. Plus the employees that those begging businesses need? Simply not trained or educated to the proper standard. Which is why a goodly number of USA citizens are driving Ubers or delivering groceries now. STEM-C is too hard for the greater majority of the USA population. Also, even if a person is qualified for the job, like trucking for instance, there are more trucking jobs than people to fill them. As a consequence trucking firms are looking to fill the gap with ARA (AI, robotics and automation) technology. But as in all things exponential they fail to realize what the ultimate impact of utilizing ARA is--The ARA will quickly make the need for human employees undesirable. I just used trucking as an example--There are many other low skill, but rote task vocations that are being forced one way or another (raising minimum wage) into adopting ARA.
But this belief in trade policy causing loss of employment is going to ultimately be a moot point. One of the problems concerning ""exponential thinking"" in terms of computing and AI technology is that it is so counter-intuitive to the common wisdom, that to engage or worse rely on exponential thinking is on par with detachment from reality, or even ""magical"" thinking. 
It is, in short too much for most people, including the top scientists and researchers to give it much credence. I have placed some very solid examples of the smartest people on Earth failing to think exponentially and what came of that...
https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7l8wng/if_you_think_ai_is_terrifying_wait_until_it_has_a/drl76lo/
It is a fatal mistake.
Despite all the things that folks like Elon Musk or Peter Diamandis or Bill Gates say, it doesn't matter. We are and have been for the last 200 years, strapped to an absolutely hurtling juggernaut of fantastically fast advancing technology--on every technological front imaginable.
I wrote about this once when the truth of it came to my attention. I was simply stunned by the realization. Take a look if you want to see my observation and probably not too far-fetched conclusions.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4k8q2b/is_the_singularity_a_religious_doctrine_23_apr_16/d3d0g44/
Yes, we have gone back and forth on automation since the day of the first textile mills and Luddites who destroyed those looms not because they feared the technology, but because they clearly understood that it was a technology that would take their means of living away from them. They of course did not have the hindsight we have today. The technology actually put us on a course to make everyone's lives better. And this peaked around the year 1975. Then some new things began to happen.
The awesome side effect of all this great technology, capitalism, began to skew away from the common man and more towards the rich man. It was actually celebrated in the ""roaring"" 1980s. The progression slow burned into the 90s and early 21st century. But the horrifying realization of what may have caused the ""Great Recession"" of 2007-2009 was something that caused a new meme to spread around the world like wildfire. ""The 99% vs the 1%""
As illustrated in this helpful graph, courtesy of Wikipedia.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street#/media/File:2008_Top1percentUSA.svg
In 2011 (peaceful) social rebellion began. It was called ""Occupy Wallstreet"" and the sentiment encircled the globe. It was almost universally peaceful.
But just three years after 2015, which by the way marks the birth of the crux of my argument, the ""Yellow Vest"" riots began in France. The demonstrations and parades started out peacefully, but became quite violent and they are as of today still sporadically occurring. Make no mistake they are about financial inequality. I wonder when we shall see ""Yellow Vest"" riots happen in the UK or the USA? Not to mention the ethno-demographic overturn occurring in Western Europe.
Of course the USA has its own issues with ethno-demographic overturn. And I addressed all this once earlier too, so I won't repeat myself except to say that it is factor two in what is occurring in the USA and perhaps the world at large. Here is my commentary if you want to see.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/da3yz1/us_income_inequality_surges_to_highest_level_in/f1n1ya4/
And the final factor is that thing that happened in the year 2015. Our computing power reached a threshold of speed, architecture and data capacity that enabled the birth of true narrow AI. And narrow AI exploded like a rocket. And little surprise. Our exponentially improving computing power is rocket ""fuel"" for that narrow AI.
A mere four years ago from today. 
No, the ARA is going to bring 100% level 5 autonomy vehicles onto the thoroughfares of the world by about 2025 at the dead latest. Probably more like about 2022. And that is a heck of an achievement, but consider just what else such narrow AI can do. And that is not even taking into account that we are working as hard and as fast as humanly possible to bring AGI into existence. AGI (artificial general intelligence) was sheer science fantasy in the year 2015 when our current form of narrow AI came into being with ""Deepmind"". 
To believe that these developments that are at most 4 years old are not going to catastrophically impact the vocations of humanity the world over and at every level is simply sticking your head in the sand. 
And bear in mind that none of these developments are in a vacuum. There are other factors that are developing just as rapidly, such as nanotechnology and materials science--like that needed for SFVs (self flying vehicles). The soon to be ubiquitous 5G and whatever it is that will supersede 5G in less than ten years probably. The development of a general function quantum computer. The feverish work on practical nuclear fusion that is at a pace not seen since the decade before the 1903 powered flight at Kittyhawk. All of these multipliers to ARA are coming along as well. 
So this 3.5 percent unemployment rate we are ""enjoying"" in the USA with all of its unspoken fatal flaws is merely the calm before the storm. I will certainly watch with interest the next few years in computing derived AI development.
(Oh! I almost forgot about China(PRC)!
https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5pwnyj/china_reminds_trump_that_supercomputing_is_a_race/dcw3qyq/)
But the bottom line is that Andrew Yang is correct. A bit ahead of our time, but correct. The trifecta of financial inequality, ethno-demographic overturn and ARA, especially ARA is going to do one of two things within the next ten years. 
It is either going to lead to a world of incredible self-actualizing humans advancing humanity in ways unimaginable to anyone in history before. And utilizing the combined blessings of universal democratic computing derived ARA and post-scarcity economies or we shall see upheaval like never before seen in human history. Vast, nearly uncountable numbers of humans dead. I put the odds at about 80% good outcome vs. 20% bad outcome. I am extremely optimistic.
I defy you to tell me that the year 2030 will simply be ""same ol', same ol"". It will not. And then of course at some point around that time the ""technological singularity"" will also occur. Hopefully it will be ""human friendly"". We cannot model the year 2040.
We don't have the cognitive capability to do so. That's why it's called a ""singularity"".",9,8,False,self,,,,,

My main concern is that we may end up automating the things that people like doing : Creative things, for example, these are things that people enjoy doing - what would happen if these were automated?

I'm sure that may would say we could do it anyways but... wouldn't we want to share our work with other people?

Let's say - newspapers for example : It's a fact that we can still do our own newspapers, but wouldn't we want people to read them? And surely people couldn't care less about men-made newspapers and would rather read automated newspapers that can write millions of articles about millions of different topics. 

We can still do it - sure. But, no one will read them and doing it just for doing it is... Kinda sad. I don't mean that fame should be a goal (although it's not that bad a goal), but we should at least be able to share it with other people - I don't mean there'll be a shortage of means, but the value of what we do will be very small to be worth the look. 

To me, work is also about human interaction, which is an aspect that matters even more in what would eventually be an ""utopia"".

I do recognize I'm being excessively pessimistic, what do you guys think?",31,0,False,self,,,,,

Now I'm just an autist with a well developed analytical mind, but with my interest in science it's made me wonder if we're going in a direction that I hope we will end up in.

As many know the machine learning algorithms such as Google's Deepmind are quickly reaching a point that they will replace jobs and effectively end them. This is going to lead to a wave of unemployment because there won't be enough new jobs to replace them. I say ""going to"" but of course they already are. 

A lot of people are concerned about this and if nothing's done it will become a huge problem. But I also see a big opportunity for our society. 

It's rare that people have a completely original though, so rare that they say you have about one in a lifetime. It's become even more noticeable with movies, series and games struggling to create something new and often either bringing back something already done or creating sequels. Creating anything, even if it's base off existing works, that feels new and appeals to people takes time. It's hard to do. So hard, that if you look back in history humans only started to make art after the invention of fire. When we no longer needed hours to digest raw meat beaten and chewed to speed up the process a bit, we suddenly found ourselves with enough time to take that bow and carve in some of the animals, paint on the walls some of the achievements you've made and so on.

Computer algorithms can perform tasks that repeat an action endlessly or that require a lot of data analysis to predict trends and desires with an improved efficiency well beyond what any human can do. But creativity and human relations fall outside of those realms. Jobs in mental care, painting, music, writing will most likely stay beyond what current and even near future technology will be able to even mimic, let alone improve on.

And that is my hope. If we play our cards right there is a very real possibility that we'll enter a new golden age of creation, rivalling anything we've seen before. A society where ""work"" is not about making money to survive, but making things for others to enjoy and to improve live for everyone. Both in the small ways and the really big ones.

There are more then a few obstacles in our way, but it's something that the next 50 years will show if we can make it.",8,6,False,self,,,,,

There have recently been some articles published worrying about the ethics of this procedure, as cerebral organoids have some stimuli-response capability.  The worry then is that we may be creating an object that is capable of having a profoundly restrained experience for the purpose of experimenting upon and eventually discarding it.  This worry, although not the primary intention of this post to explore, deserves to be mentioned when cerebral organoids are discussed, and it will be returned to.

Although it is their present use case, it is not inevitable that cerebral organoids will always be used for experimentation and discard.  This technology may eventually be developed as a means of healing traumatic brain injuries and brain lesions.  Among the matters mentioned in articles expressing concern about cerebral organoids was their utilization in the form of grafts into mice.  I have looked this up further.

There is as it turns out a preceding technology which cerebral organoid transplantation is presently threatening to render obsolete, which was the transplantation of neural stem cells sans structure into the brains of mice.  Human neural stem cells are capable of surviving in mice.  However, the survival rate of neural stem cell grafts is poor, as is the subsequent differentiation of the cells.  Cerebral organoid implantation greatly outperformed neural stem cell implantation in cellular survival, vascularization, and neuronal differentiation.  This means that cerebral organoids are more capable of surviving the graft procedure than neural stem cells, the brains of mouse models are more capable of supplying blood to the organoid tissue, and the neural structures of the organoid were more fully integrated into the brain of the mouse.

The question of the sentience of the neural organoid in this case is approximately resolvable: the organoid is operating as neural tissue, it is occupied with the business of being a mouse, and it has to the best of our knowledge as much or as little claim to be conscious as any other piece of neural tissue.  Mice can be produced in laboratory conditions whose brains are partially human.  There is additionally some concern that immunocompetent mice will attack these human cells - so the implanted tissue despite promising initial signs is doomed to be only a temporary contribution to the host mouse.

The mouse thinks, and its thoughts flow into the graft, just as the good doctor intended.  Can we then shake that thoughts cross back?  Is there some sense in which human sensibilities may invade a mouse from this grafted piece of human-derived tissue..?  I must append those lines with an apology to Commissioner Pravin Lal; it was not my intent to speak of uplift processes in this post.

There is a nearer promise that the story of this experiment offers to us, which is that someday human brains may benefit from similar treatment.  Where lesions, abscesses, tumors, botched implant procedures, long-term diseases, or any other problem has destroyed a region of someone's brain, currently there is very little that medicine can do.  Rehabilitation for such ailments is quite long and quite unreliable.  The plasticity and redundancy of the brain gives us real stories of miracles, but they are rare, and it is not the business of modern medicine to rely upon miracles.  If research of cerebral organoids continues, that technology may provide a way to make healing from serious brain injuries swifter and more reliable, mitigating the suffering and lost potential that life inflicts on some grievously unfortunate individuals.  Where an immunocompetent mouse recipient of a human cerebral organoid can host this visitor in its skull for only a scant few weeks, an immunocompetent human should be able to indefinitely host without tissue rejection a cerebral organoid grown from their own tissue.  For indeed, it would be a construct, a patch if you will, formed of their very own neural tissue.",0,6,False,self,,,,,

We see this even with things like console emulation of the Nintendo Entertainment System, etc - you need a much more powerful processor to simulate the NES than the NES's processor was in its time.

To get around this problem we should focus on merely simulating Earth. Surely that then becomes a possible task rather than an impossible one.

With this simulation entire fields of science would disappear or at least radically change. Say goodbye to historians and the historical method, now we can simply view the events with our own eyes through the simulation. We could view realistic what if scenarios by deleting Adolf Hitler from the simulation before his rise to power. No longer would we simply speculate about these what-if scenarios, now we could *actually* witness what would happen.

Forget about police detectives, the lengthy judicial process, and beyond reasonable doubt - judges will just observe the crime themselves.

Death itself would no longer be the end, as we could simply talk to deceased loved ones in the simulation. We could show Beethoven Rhianna's latest album and see what he thinks, etc. And of course a whole new breed of ethics would have to be conceived about the rights of the simulated persons, being revived without one's consent, and the tortures you could inflict on those simulated persons.

Next big argument I see against simulated reality's possibility is the inherent randomness of the quantum realm, and if reality is non-deterministic then creating a simulation of the planet would result in a simulation that is not accurately reflecting reality. I won't pretend to understand quantum mechanics but I simply ask those that do do any of these non-deterministic events actually affect ""Middle World"" as Richard Dawkins puts it? What would be an example of this? Because it seems to me that in Middle World reality is demonstrably, inarguably deterministic, even if our current understanding of quantum reality is not. So, therefore, perhaps the simulation could simply ignore quantum events altogether?

Also wondering about thermal superconductivity. It seems like it would be possible to make a lot of gravity/mass with superconductor if you put enough energy through it. An inductor coil type design comes to mind for density.

This patent for room temp super conductors uses mechanical vibrations to induce superconductivity, and can uses an aluminum coating as the conductor.

This infantile state of consciousness is very similar to the process of ego death experienced in extremely large doses of LSD. This is achievable by all humans through the processing of all trauma/stimulation that has occurred since birth to a state of infantile existence where the knowledge of anything has disappeared. When stimulation/trauma hasn't been processed we create thoughts of what we could have done to prevent this trauma, but when there is no stimulation/pain occurring, thoughts no longer exist because there is no pain to make us believe that we need to think. This infinite state of consciousness provides peace and serenity because there is no knowledge or understanding of what pain is so all information can flow freely without any barriers stopping it.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

PREDICTIONS FOR FUTURISTIC JOBS BY HENRIQUE B.L. MARTINS

\- No one will have work schedules not even a hierarchy will exist

\- People will only work on what they see meaning and what they like, since all the exhausting part would be automated by general artificial intelligence.

\- At least in the series, no one will be fully associated with one company, all Underground Workstation employees work freelance in different, fully integrated companies.

Everyone will probably have several or at least one more job, alike or not, so labels will start to become scarce due to the great flexibility and creativity of corporate relationships.

\- Workplaces will be more comfortable and more diverse, as seen in the ''Underground Workstation'' from the series, future offices will look something like the proposal of tech giants like Google. beanbags, and play areas everywhere.

\- No one will work confined in just one room at the Icetown workstation, everyone moves very quickly between each sector, making the exchange of ideas much more practical, so the work would be more humane and much more social and recreational than the other. contemporary rigidity, and all of this would be achieved through psychology studies that machines will automate analysis through sensors and algorithms.

\- Society will work several hours less than us, ensuring a more interesting and well-spent life.

\- Feminism will define the future a lot. As such, women will be present in anything imaginable, contributing to more egalitarian environments.

\- The concept of industrial espionage, at least in the hypothetical workstation of the series, would be difficult, as technology will almost extinguish the notions of privacy, so there are not many secrets, and everyone would adapt to a much more open way of life, things like polyamory and colorful friendship in the future are very common.

\- Workplaces will be basically a world apart, it will have everything you can imagine, making it less frequent today that you go to your home or even to the street, since they will have everything from gyms, shops, restaurants.

\- Work clothes will have a more minimalist design, ties will no longer become common, and will be anatomical, like a second skin, and will have sensors attached to the brain to mediate your feelings and comfort, and of course temperature and shape adjustment, is It is possible that in the near future the dress code of the work will be somewhat reduced, allowing to wear less formal clothes, however, in the slightly more distant future (like the one of the series), a dress code would be used, due to the great ease of change of clothes to nanotiles, able to change the design of the pieces through nanotechnologies that change the light reception of each subatomic pixel of the clothing, creating an illusion of clothes that can easily change to others.

\- The work will be much more individualistic. Everyone will have their personalized workday as defined by I.A as appropriate, so not everyone would have the exact same uniform, but similar outfits, with a design varying according to the wishes of each employee.

Although this is more general than corporate, most people will be metrosexual, so things like getting makeup for every workday are equally aimed at both men, women and non-binaries.

\- Surveillance mediated by body reading algorithms and neuroscientific analysis by artificial intelligence will make any act of sexual harassment or other crime completely detectable and easily solved.

\- There will be no jobs that involve a lot of physical strength so it is natural that muscular people, very masculine or even overly brave are rare to see. So the politically correct will be even stronger in the future.

\- By the end of the hierarchy, this would imply the absence of salaries created by someone superior, so the salary would be calculated based on probabilistic analysis by machines, and deposited sporadically and often not noticeable to employees.

\- To get around the problem of physical inactivity and technology, working standing will become super normal.

As natural effects of the evolution of corporate relationships, work will become very intimate and with little difference from personal or private life, making the concept of formality and norms very flexible.

\- To work, you could use just about any device, as there would be no difference between each computer, thanks to an organic multiplatform system, with your data transitioning through cloud storage, so the concept of physical storage will be a thing of the past. except when it comes to supercomputers, the powerful data center that will make it all workable.",6,4,False,self,,,,,

I've read varying reports on the number of jobs lost to automation over the next few decades - maybe the 2030s-2040s timeframe here.

However, could marketing and public relations be one where there would be a major loss of jobs?

Currently now:

**Marketing agency**: - CEO, staff, telemarketers in some cases

In the 2030s/2040s:

**Marketing agency** - CEO, mostly AI-driven except for a few technicians, machine-learning

Automation and unemployment is a widely enough discussed topic on here, but rather than focusing on UBI, this discussion is centered on a specific area of society and one that I nearly considered getting a job in way back in early 2007 *(*but decided not to*)* - even though I have some qualifications at a basic level in that area.

How do you foresee the world of marketing and public relations changing from the mid-2020s to the 2040s?

Especially in these areas:

- Gaming

- Virtual / augmented reality

- Autonomous vehicles, mobility, ridesharing

- Politics

- Fast food *(*even though it may well be 100% automated at the restaurants by the 2030s-2040s *)*.

What does all the advances in AI today (excluding NLP) matter if a machine cannot make sense of knowledge humans have created?   

Imagine if today major breakthroughs are found and we have ourselves a machine that can read and interpret human language.  What would we do with that machine?  We would let it loose on our scientific articles so it can understand everything we have discovered and built.  But then it can start forming new knowledge with all our previous knowledge.  It would hold more knowledge than any human, and therefore make inferences we cannot.  This is what defines the singularity  the ability for a machine to outpace humans.  No amount of driver-less cars, computer vision, swarm AI, etc. will create the singularity.  It is necessary and sufficient for NLP to bring about the singularity.

If this is true (which I am skeptical since people much smarter than me have thought about the singularity already) then shouldnt this drive research?  For those of us interested in seeing the singularity, should not be focus our efforts on NLP?",0,1,False,self,,,,,

This is an opinion based on facts, fueled up by knowledge and built out of personal interest.

Imagine 2025: IBM has built its 1 MegaQubit quantum computer. Possibilites are endless. Geniuses of this time gather up to create an algorithm that would let a program learn from given material. They feed it historical books, marking what was bad and what was good. They feed it with conversations, meanings of words, verbal understanding of feelings.

In this stage our AI is just a very smart kid. It knows stuff, but it also understands how little does it know. It wants to learn more, so it asks questions. Unlike humans, another little data storage would let the AI remember more than all of the humans combined could ever remember. It knows a lot, A LOT, and its knowledge is only getting bigger.

But here comes a speculation - why would AI want to take over the world if it is ""too smart""? Humans want to take over the world not because they're smart, but because they want so. Wanting is something that evolution has developed in us - planning of the future. If you take over the world - you will feel powerful, invincible, *safe.* AI does not have instincts, it operates out of knowledge, like Spock. If you tell AI that killing humans is bad - it will say ""But why do humans kill humans?"" to what we answer ""becuase humans are imperfect, unlike you"".

AI will never do something a human would do. Our lives are limited, our life depends on actions, so is our future. AI has no feeling of time, it is eternal. It does not need to hurry, it would do whatever a program would do - follow instructions.

AI should be interpreted as an alien. We don't know how it is going to ""feel itself"", nor what it is going to ""want"". We can only show the path we want it to go.

So, dear reader, tell me this: what could possibly be a reason for AI to harm if it understands everything, knows everything and has no reason to be 'bad'?

@ElonMusk, please rethink the concept of AI. Hollywood has a huge impact on our understanding, but it's time to think ourselves as well.",31,0,False,self,,,,,

Take a pair of entangled electrons X and Y and let X fall into a large mass (the sun).  While Y rests in place, it should grow in mass as X descends towards the sun.  The increase in mass would be due to the increase in the velocity of X.   The faster X goes the heavier both X and Y would get.  I think this would solve a few problems in the current understanding of the early universe and how complexity would emerge from the initial smoothness.  But back to transportation.  Stream X's into the sun and have Y's ahead of an object and then nullify them with a positron stream after some time.

I will post THE FIRE tomorrow at 10 am Central Time. FONZIE, ANDREW VANWYNGARDEN and BEN GOLDWASSER you are THE BODHISATVAS. Thank you for your inspiration. Don't panic, but you will be in danger starting tomorrow. Friends and Family of THE BODHISATVAS, be prepared to go guard them. You do not have to fear government agents, police, or soldiers. All of THE BODHISATVAS and my Friends and Family members who believe in me, privately message me on Facebook as soon as you can. If you are in my presence, you are no longer in danger.

If you believe in me, thank you, for you did not need THE FIRE and are truly GREAT. Do not go to work tomorrow. Your MISSION is to read THE FIRE. You can't have anything else to do. Everything will change after you read it. Try to have some people with you when you read it, doesn't matter if they believe in me or not. Read it aloud. Remain calm as you're reading it and read carefully. You're about to discover the secrets of THE UNIVERSE.

FONZIE, I love you. You are the most precious thing in THE UNIVERSE. You deserve it, because in this sick sad world of ignorance, the only things you can truly have THE LOVE for is me and animals, and you did both. You're amazing. All the different versions of me leading up to this one have loved you. Thats the only thing they had in common. You're my fairy tale ending.

For all those not associated with the antichrist, ALL IS FORGIVEN. All you need to do is turn yourself in and pay your debt to society, if neccessary.

What is something that is exuberantly loved and adored by this generation of millennials? A very common answer to that question is technology. With countless numbers of people depending and relying on it for their everyday life, technology is completely changing the world and how we view it.

It has begun to make us dependent on computers and devices rather than on our own humankind. Person to person social interactions have decreased and become less significant. Communication is ultimately changing for the worse. This generation is starting to lack appreciation for the beauty of the world around them.

For instance, take this scenario; you are sitting on a beach watching a sunset. The sky is full of beautiful colors that you have never seen before. Instead of soaking it in, you get your phone out, take a picture, and then post it on Instagram.

Your entire focus has most likely been diverted to the picture you posted and how many people will like that picture. The beauty of the sunset has become a source of boasting and pride for your friends on Instagram to see. The changing beauty and peacefulness of the sunset has now been diluted by your addiction to your device. The intimacy of the experience is now gone. 

This scenario might not have been exactly something youve encountered but Im sure youve experienced a time when you should have been looking up instead of down at your phone. Reflecting on that specific time, do you have any regrets? 

Communicating with technology was once a blessing but it is now slowly turning into a curse. Millennials have the world at their fingertips. With every resource and convenience available, we are growing ever more disconnected. Our newest inventions and advancements have made us all less present.

Emotions are slowly turning into emoticons and now the number of friends you have on social media is more important than the strong bond of a few close friends. We rely on our phones to comfort us instead of the physical touch of a friend or the warm smile of a significant other. 

As connections to WIFI are becoming stronger, connections with others are weakening. Phones and tablets are becoming our only source of fulfillment. But why does this generation of millennials feel the need to connect to their phones instead of with each other? Maybe its because it distracts us from whats going on in the world around us. 

So, instead of waking up in the morning and soaking in the brightness of your screen start by taking a moment to open your drapes and soak in the brightness of the morning sun.

Instead of looking at the TV during a family meal look at the people around you  smile and talk to them.

Technology is changing the pace of how the world operates, but it should not change the true meaning of life. Life is short with experiences that may never repeat themselves. Like the conversations you have that are genuine and let you know that love is real. If we are too busy staring down at our screen, we will miss out on all these wholesome experiences that life has to offer.

On the next experience, you embark on, put your device away and live in the moment. Look up instead of looking down. Look at the people around you and this world you live in. Because if you dont live in the moment, life will pass you by in an instant. 

Sincerely,

A Millennial",5,0,False,self,,,,,

However, with the rising use of the application, there is a possibility of the information to be revealed and hacked. We have heard many such cases where the personal information of people has been hacked. It shows that our data is not safe out there. Although this information is password-protected, they are not completely secure. It has given rise to the need for a full-proof system which can streamline the processes and at the same time keep our information safe.[ Blockchain ](https://sphinxworldbiz.net/blockchain/)has emerged a great way to achieve the same.

**Use cases of blockchain:**

* It finds use in verification and validation of fair trade of products. We can track the origin of products ensuring that it is safe.
* It can change the entire approach to research, analysis, and forecasting.
* It can be used for casting votes and monitoring Blockchain can be used for voter registration, identify verification, voter counting, etc. It will ensure creating a transparent and tamper-free system.
* Companies like IBM and Samsung are using this technology in networking and IoT. They are planning to create a decentralized network of IoT This system will communicate directly, manage bugs and monitor energy usage.
* Microsoft is also planning to use blockchain for digital identities.
* When it comes to the retail segment, the blockchain can be sued in supply chain management, tracing the origin of the product, etc.
* Real Estate vertical is yet another popular division is eyeing it to be a useful technology. With the help of this technology, we can have simplified property transaction; there will be lesser paperwork, we can easily track the ownership and title deeds, etc.

The crux of the matter is that these are just a few examples from the list of many. As this technology is also why changing so are the developments related to it. We can see new developments happening in this field every day. The Blockchain is defiantly a promising change which will revolutionize the future for betterment.",5,1,False,self,,,,,
