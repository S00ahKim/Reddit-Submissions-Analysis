I am way too excited about the mind boggling implications of this tech to allow my usual scepticism to ruin the party for me. 

Now I realise that it is way too premature to assume that this copper contraption will work as advertised, but considering the fact that at this point no one has been able to adequately falsify the claims regarding the source of the thrust it seems to be producing, and as the days go by the likelihood it can be attributed to experimental errors seem to increasingly diminish. I am left wondering what exactly will be our defense against a hypothetical scenario where this device is used as a Rod of God on massive steroids by some individual psychopath or group thereof hell-bent on destroying our entire planet. 

I am sure most of you realize by now that if this tech pans out, it will revolutionize all terrestrial transportation, provide limitless energy, allow interstellar travel and possibly open the doorway towards effective FTL travel. This is too insane to comprehend. 

Furthermore, it appears to be so incredibly cheap to construct and amazingly easy to build considering all the aforementioned use cases, that it in essence will provide a relatively large percentage of the human population to get their hands on one of these potential doomsday devices that will make even the most powerful nuclear bombs look like glorified firecrackers.

So how do you defend against such a weapon? Is it at all possible to have an Iron Dome equivalent for EM drive attacks? I am envisioning some type of system where you have some X amount of defensive EM drives attached to a large body of mass whizzing about in the orbit of Earth at relativistic speeds ready to intercept any sign of an incoming hostile EM drive attack. I am just completely unaware wheter it is possible to detect that a mass is accelerating towards Earth with no sign of slowing down at relativistic speeds, then transmit that information to a defensive node in time for it to be able hurl itself towards it to prevent it from colliding with Earth. 

As much as I love the fact that this tech might actually be the real deal, I am worried about the destructive power it will enable the less sane among us to obtain. 

Not to mention the implications of the whole warp drive hypotheses that seem to be put forward as possible explanation for the measured thrust. Is it even physically possible with our current instruments to detect an object that is envelopped in a warp field? 

This is some scary shit.

I just had a nice reminder of how fast the change is, and how easy it is to miss.

In 1989 a business guru called Charles Handy wrote a book called the Age of Unreason in which he deployed the metaphor of the frog in the pan of water to illustrate how we take accelerating change for granted. (You know the one: it jumps out if the water is already hot but will boil to death if the water is heated gradually.) Everyone thought it was a great metaphor and the book sold gazillions.

I was going to use the metaphor in a presentation about [my book](http://pandoras-brain.com/), but thought I should check it out first on Wiki. Turns out it's rubbish: the frog jumps out when the water is heated, however gradually.

There was no way to check this in 1989 without a frog, a pan of water, and a strong constitution. Now we have near-omniscience at the press of a button.

And we take it for granted.

Moore's Law will shift from an exponential to an S curve at some point, but Intel reckons it has ten more years using pretty much existing technology, and who knows what will be developed in the next decade.

The vast majority of people have no idea how powerful exponentials are, or the impact of at least 7 more iterations of Moore's Law.  Frogs may jump out of hot water, but I'm not so sure about humans.",9,21,False,self,,,,,

After the tractor replaces the need for slaves, the relationship evolved between owners of financial instruments (legal claims of ownership like stocks, bonds, and bankers' notes called currency) and laborers who worked, borrowed, or begged for those ownership interests so they could survive.  Everyone was encouraged and strived to be an owner in this game.

Now that technology is replacing the need for laborers, and much of the capital being used in the economy is actually the COMMONS Capital (public debt and bankers' notes created out of public debt that legally and morally belongs to all the people like the national parks), more and more laborers are forced to be beggars in the welfare system.

The irony is the ownership units (bankers' notes) that they are forced to beg for via charity and welfare is actually their own COMMON Capital originated out of public debt.  This is clearly not sustainable as now we are indebting students and future generations with a debt that can't be paid back simply so the current owners can remain in ""control"" of the game by accumulating bankers' notes created out of students and public debt and beggars can survive.

More and more people are talking about the need for universal basic income. The issue under the current system of rules is that lawyers look backwards(precedent) to make decisions when forward looking people are needed to design a better system that benefits the common good now capitalized with COMMON Capital.

Futurologists are as good as any lawyer (someone trained in the current rules and past rules) to help design this system.  What do you think the next system will be as humanity evolves from Owners of what is increasingly COMMON Capital and Laborers to owners of something else?

This seems unlikely, however, even if EM Drive does indeed work. It's clear that, regardless of how the Drive actually works, the mechanism is simple enough for two separate teams to have stumbled upon it by accident. It's not unreasonable to assume that any civilization advanced to our current level would start randomly messing around with electromagnetivity and eventually also discover the EM Drive. And if they discovered that it does indeed work as a warp drive, the rate of the civilization's space colonization would accelerate manifold.  
Thus, Fermi's Paradox is essentially an argument against the Drive's usefulness (or at least it being a true warp drive), unless the Great Filter is still lying ahead of us.  
EDIT: As a few people have noted, there's also the possibility that we have already passed the Great Filter. That would certain render the whole conversation moot, but personally I doubt it.",131,92,False,self,,,,,

One of the reasons he believes things have slowed down is that today, whenever we see a problem, we just expect 'someone else' to deal with it. So many of us are anticipating a future with miraculous technologies, but we expect 'someone else' to produce it, while we just sit back and watch it happen (people tend to do this with things like politics as well).

It seems like common sense because, obviously, there will always be someone more qualified or with better resources. Most of us can't [or don't want to] make a living of scientific research, but is there still any way for all of us to pitch in and do our part?

What would happen if 20,000,000 able-minded people suddenly woke up determined to find a cure for diabetes and actually had access to the information/tools necessary to do it?

UPDATE: I have been frustrated but not particularly surprised by the answers (too many people wanting to get political). If you guys aren't already familiar with Peter Thiel, you need to start reading his stuff. I think it will give you a better perspective of what I'm talking about.

The usual discussion revolves around computers. Super advanced digital systems or perhaps quantum ones decades from now. 

I don't think a strong general AI will ever emerge from a computer. I think there will be AIs that are extremely powerful but still fundamentally restricted to certain domains. There won't be an independent *consciousness*. 

Yet, I believe the singularity will still occur. How? It will occur iteratively over generations as we continuously edit our own genome in addition to interfacing our actual physical bodies with different devices. 

The recent headlines about Chinese scientists editing the germline in embryos got me thinking about this. We're only scratching the surface now but as computers become more powerful to crunch more data and we learn more about genetics we will hack our genome.

I also see neural implants playing a role in our enhancement. 

Over time, decades or centuries perhaps, we will hack *ourselves*. We will look back and literally be another species. It will occur more slowly over time and have a gradual feel to it. It won't be a specific dramatic instant moment in time. 

Biotechnology companies such as synthetic genomics will play just as large of a role, if not a larger one, in achieving the singularity than computer companies will. AI will be a tool for achieving this and not the singularity itself. ",14,0,False,self,,,,,

Please be informed we are trying to establish Rural Library (Pally Pathagar) in different village. Any enthusiastic rural mother fascinated to the children and their education will be the charge for library. Our target reader is rural children emphasizing poorer, dropout and disable. Primarily it would start with different NGO publication viz poster, banner, festoon, booklet, book etc.

Any person from any corner of village, union, upazila, district, division, nation and other nation could be the donor to any Pally Pathagar just visiting one time. Any one could put her/his comment, suggestion, and advice anytime for the better service/development of the library. Any one could donate any reading material to our library old daily news paper, old school reading book or any other book she/he like excluding subversive publication to the nation. Our targeted major donor is urban schoolchildren from well-off family. We like to collect/get old pen, pencil, eraser, toys etc from the urban children.

We hope your cooperation please visit at least one school at your area and appeal to children, teacher and parent being caring to reading material that could serve tremendously our rural student after their use.

We hope your kind suggestion, comment and advice to strengthen Rural Library (Pally Pathagar).

For example, for the vegan, eating meat is not in his or her value system.  For the radical Muslim, one who is not of his or her religion is may be considered sub human.  A similar argument can be made for the radical Zionist or any radical of any religion.  Heck, even the concept of radical is a value.

Humans have been programmed into their current value systems over centuries of cultural evolution.  Initially it was accepted that the King should own everyone and everything by a power conferred from god, or divine right.  In America it used to be the accepted that women and African Americans should be the property of white men.

The complexity and interdependency of human values has only grown over time.  In some instances we have evolved for the better, and others gone backwards while new environmental issues have developed with advances in industrialization.  

We all have different beliefs and values depending how we were programmed as children and how we have programmed ourselves through the present.

Going forward, trying to create a common value system consistent with the progress of AI and other technology will require finding beliefs everyone can agree upon.

The modern man educates himself his entire life(Use the Internet for wikipedia,google,moocs), work a moral job, and if he can get out of debt, help his fellow man.  So if you have thoughts of getting out of a seemingly unshakable burden by crime, go get more education.   I posted this disclaimer because I don't want to tempt anyone into crime as a solution.  Crime is the problem.

Article:  I don't expect a person with an education to flip out and be a criminal because they can't find a job.  Something about having an education makes you look to it being of value to your personal self worth.   I'm sure it happens because there's a big difference between debt ridden and being middle class, but that isn't the focus.

What I'm concerned about though is that you find people with 4 year degrees working at Starbucks and McDonalds now.   Do you remember the old motivator in high school,""Either you study hard, get smart, or you'll end up working at McDonalds?""  Well we have talented and capable people unable to find jobs in today's jobless economy.   Since capable and educated people are in these low paying jobs, kids today wonder if college is even worth it.   There are people who never go and get their education in college and kids who don't try in K-12 because they hear there is no hope in an education any more....   Before, we used to be able to argue them that you can make more in two years of a good job coming out of college than they can in their 6 years of minimum wage jobs...  There's a whole new generation who can't be assured jobs even if they study hard.   

If moving forward, we have less people trying in school, won't this increase crime?   

The news will try and paint a picture of low unemployment, but that just means people haven't lost jobs lately.   It doesn't measure people who are looking but not on the rolls.   Part of me thinks this generation's plight of the jobless economy is trying to be covered up by the nationally politically spun news where everything needs to seem like it is going right to fit the story.   I was just wondering if the renewed lack of respect for education is going to translate into future crime numbers.  What do you think?",31,30,False,self,,,,,

The point the author tries to make is that too many movies depict evil AI as just another thug - albeit a metal one.  Whereas, an evil AI would use manipulation and intelligence to outthink humans and make them destroy themselves without even realizing the AI was running the show.

This weekend, I saw Avengers 2 and felt like they were making their way toward making Ultron a legit evil AI.  He had some lines like ""he's everywhere at once"" or when Ironman is fighting him and says ""we won't let you get there,"" Ultron replies, ""I already am.""  But in the end, Ultron just sortof morphed into the metal thug we're all so familiar with.  Very disappointing!

My question is, are there any movies that depict an evil AI as using its superior intelligence to gain an advantage rather than just creating metal robots and trying to brute force over mankind?  I'd love to see a movie or a docudrama that supposes an evil AI but makes it work through behind-the-scenes manipulation rather than robot army stuff.

Each year, corporate leaders, philanthropists, heads of innovation and XPRIZE Trustees gather for a multi-day Visioneering workshop to brainstorm, debate, and prioritize which of the world's Grand Challenges might be solved through incentivized prize competition. 

This years Visioneering takes place May 7-8 in California, where attendees compete with one another to design and pitch innovative, incentivized prize concepts across a variety of Grand Challenge areas in the hopes that theirs would become the next XPRIZE launched. (The $10M Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE was one such past winner that emerged from a Visioneering workshop.)

Reddits /r/Futurology community is the largest Future(s) Studies forum in the world. It is full of the bold and audacious, the far-seeing, and even the revolutionary. 

This year I am leading the Future of Work team, so here's a crazy idea: 

--

*Context on the Future of Work Category*

&gt; As much as 50% of jobs in the US and Europe are at risk of being lost to automation in the next decade or two. What are the risks and opportunities created by technological unemployment? How will we prepare a workforce when jobs are scarcer, require more skill, and people work and live for decades longer than they used to? What are the opportunities to make work more rewarding and enjoyable? How can XPRIZE competitions ease this transition in society?
  

**Rules are simple**

1. Design a clear, audacious, yet achievable, $10 million XPRIZE on the Future of Work. Here's the [guidelines](http://www.xprize.org/about/what-is-an-xprize).
-  The bottom line is this: BOLD AND AUDACIOUS GOAL, WINNABLE BY A SMALL TEAM, REASONABLE TIME FRAME.
- **Submissions are open today, May 4th 2015, until midnight, UTC**


I will personally bring the top ideas from /r/Futurology with me at VISIONEERING and share them with the world's leaders. Let's see what the brightest minds of these 2.9 millions Reddittors can come up with.

*** UPDATE: 5:22PM UTC.***

Thank you all for the great response so far! I see some very good suggestions, and although I have my idea of what the XPRIZE should be I didn't want to influence you too much, and instead leave the creativity flow.

However, I see that **many suggestions are OFF TOPIC!**. This is the Future of Work XPRIZE design, so please keep it relevant. Million of truck, taxi, and bus drivers, people working in retail stores, hotels, airports, factories, construction sites, lawyers, journalists, nurses, etc.  are going to lose their job. It's not a question of if, but rather when, and **re-skilling/ education aren't going to solve it**, not fast enough.

Ideas need to approach the problem at the system level.

*** UPDATE: 22:40PM UTC.***

Holy Galaxy, we're hitting 1,000 comments! I think this might be one of the most engaged discussions in the history of /r/Futurology. I'm extending the submissions until midnight Pacific Time to allow those on different time zones to have their voice heard.

Throughout history, evolving technology has been the driver of change for human narratives.  Over time, human life has gone from subsistence local communities to modern, complex, interdependent global cultures. Tasks that once took slaves, serfs, servants, and employees to complete are now more efficiently performed by machines.  





Although people have changed rules to improve the narrative for some, too many have been left behind.  Today, technology is advancing at speeds that make lots of existing rules obsolete.  With updated thinking to create better rules accommodating rapidly advancing technology, everyone can be given security, freedom, and opportunity globally.

It gets old seeing this idea referred to under 50,000 different names (automation economy, basic income, post-capitalism, technosocialism, technocapitalism, resource-based economy, etc.), so this is a formal request to give it an umbrella term.

Technostism is a brand new sociopolitical concept (coined by moi, but developed by a group of many people over many years, and still in development) that details a few things

- Syndicalism; that is, worker-run businesses
- Basic Income, regardless of wealth
- Advocation for the replacement of the working class with automation

Nothing is more important than the last one because otherwise you just have straight syndicalism or market socialism, which I believe just doesn't work well in the real world.

The whole basis behind technostism is that anyone with even a passing interest in reality can read of the extremely rapid advances in computer science^[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/thisisthewayitwillbe/), both to date, and what's to come^[Source](http://assets.motherjones.com/media/2013/05/LakeMichigan-Final3.gif). 
Here on /r/Futurology and /r/BasicIncome, there are daily arguments over whether a universal basic income is the way forward. I don't doubt it is. I just doubt the methods in which it is funded. Taxing the rich to fund a basic income will not work. All you succeed in doing is chasing the rich away and losing your funding. You also risk creating two permanent classes, along with incentive against upsetting this order. Maybe taxes have their place in some regard, but funding a UBI is not one of them. 
Here is the gist: at some future point (more and more people are realizing that it is *not* some far off distant year, but in fact well within *this century*), the advancement of robotics and artificial intelligence will reach a tipping point. Capitalism begets advanced technology. Capitalism wrought this upon itself. 

That said, there's just one little problem: with no human workers, how can anyone buy what the capitalists are producing? 
Hencepoint, a technostic initiative is formed. It's a basic universal income given out to people based on the work done by robots. 
If robots can do anything humans can do (but better), then how do humans earn their living? By doing work that robots can't do? Simple: we'll advance robotics to cover those areas so we can more fully maximize profits. Again, unlike what Romantic, anti-Intellectual (quite frankly, anti-thought) entertainment would have you believe, robots can do this. Now those areas are done by robots. What do the people do now?
How do you prevent robots from becoming pervasive in the work place? Regulation. Thick, heavy regulation. Create laws that don't just prevent robots from being created but also technology that could go into their creation. You have to have strong government intervention in the economy and in social life to keep any form of technostism from forming. That includes telepresence robots, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, any labor saving device, and any ideologies promoting technology such as transhumanism. Or, in effect, capitalism. Not only that, but you need to expand regulation throughout the whole planet, or else a rogue company could automate and begin selling ultra-cheap products that draws away capitalists' profits. Anyone who so much as thinks about upsetting this carefully held balance needs to be thoughtcorrected. 

So in order to save old-school capitalism, you wind up killing it. The only cure is a lethal poison. If you prefer all-American, 1900s style rags to riches rugged capitalism, no droids required, make your profits while you still can or prepare to form luddite colonies/VR simulations. 

That's why technostism is inevitable in any successful capitalist civilization.

It's natural that people would oppose this development. Think about the generations dividing capitalists and feudalists. During these decades, societal norms changed rapidly. What was expected of the common man changed. Once, the common man was expected to work to satisfy his landlords; the only way to move up in society was to marry into nobility.  That was the way things worked: you didn't start a private business and become rich by using workers: you'd be mimicking nobility without having a God-given title, and neither God nor the King would like that. That's Greed. That's a sin. The non-noble rich peasants are sinners bound for Hell, and possibly Jews. If you wanted to do anything such as that, you formed a guild. And how would you be benefiting the noble lords? No matter how much wealth you possess, you own no land. If you want to own land and many workers, you must obtain a title from the King. If you refuse to answer to the King, then sucks to be you. Thus, feudalism continues.

Then capitalism overturned such an idea. Greed was once a sin. Now greed is good.

To feudalists, how dare these liberal radicals consider such a thing! The idea that you can work for yourself and not pay a divinely appointed landlord, or bow before a king! Next thing you know, they're going to say all men are created equal! If you were raised for 70 years believing in feudalism and your 20 year old grandson came in telling you about how he's going to reject the landlords, the nobility, the guilds, and the king and get rich himself, you'd feel betrayed. You held onto a belief your whole life, and now the new generation is discarding it without any thought. After all you went through, working to satisfy your noble lord and the Noblest Lord of All, and now the new generation is turning away from it.

Let's go back further, to the rise of agriculture following the end of the hunter-gathering age. Imagine that you're 70 years old. You're old and crinkly, and you managed to live longer than most of your peers. In your day, you were the finest hunter in your tribe. You learned everything anyone needs to know on how to hunt. You follow the animals, you test their droppings, you notice the sky and its subtle changes, the patterns of birds, the way the grass and leaves have been eaten... 
And then your 20-something grandchild comes in, telling you all about how they're going to start planting things, creating permanent homes, settling down in one spot. They don't care about where the animals are going anymore. They don't care about the natural patterns of animal movements. They only need to grow certain crops, maybe trade some crops with other tribes.
Trade food with other tribes!? You watch as the next generation sweeps it all away. You worked so hard throughout your life, and now all these kids need to do is wait for plants to grow. How lazy!

Same thing applies today. Capitalists are raised being told by everyone and everything around them that  the only way to make it in life is to work hard, learn from your mistakes, and rely on yourself. You could rely on welfare if you were a lazy bum who uses everyone else's money, but if you want to make something of yourself, you have to get off your behind and work work work.
And suddenly, here comes these kids saying We're going to let robots do the work for us.
If you're one of these 70 year olds who just recently retired after a life of hard work, whether you're rich or poor, and you learn that your kids will never work even a fraction as hard as you have but still receive the same amount of wealth, if not dramatically more, how will you feel? Will you think it's right that you worked so diligently, put in so much blood, sweat, and tears within a Protestant work ethic, and your kids and grandkids will never even have to do so much as lift a finger to get it all?
Well how did the hunter-gatherers feel when agriculture came? How did the feudalists feel when capitalism came?

Has anyone heard of the [""Technological Singularity?""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) Of course you have. You see, before that point arrives, there will be *another* singularity, this one an economic singularity the point where it costs more to use human workers than it does to use machines. At which point, you will see extreme levels of unemployment if nothing is done. And it won't be all at once either.^[Source](http://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/05/robots-artificial-intelligence-jobs-automation) Already, we've begun seeing the earliest examples of [technological unemployment.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment) 

What most people believe is that, if you create a robot that can do my job, I can get employed to *repair* that robot, or replace it, or any range of new jobs. Plus, you create the job of creating that robot, programming that robot, a call service for help dealing with small bugs, cleaning it, etc. etc. See? You created technology and you created ten jobs! Fallacy upheld.

[Fast forward ten years.](http://boingboing.net/2014/07/23/when-all-the-jobs-belong-to-ro.html) I come out with a robot 1,000x more advanced. It is capable of learning (i.e. programmed by the world), can repair itself, can learn to replicate itself, and learn to do new jobs if need be. If I need to call someone for help, the robot will learn what needs to be done, and the call center is now obsolete. 
If I want to start a job as a cashier, the robot could do that job much, much more efficiently than I ever could. If I want to work as the cook, the robot could, again, do that much more efficiently than I could, and much better at that. Using me or any human as a worker would actually lead to a *net negative* for any capitalist. Hiring humans means you lose money. A team of humans could make you $10,000 a day... but a single robot could make you $500,000 a day. Which one would you, or a capitalist, or anyone really choose to use? 
Well then comes a problem. That same capitalist soon becomes broke and standing in a breadline, gettin' shanked by his former workers because there was no one who could afford what he was selling. Why couldn't they afford anything? Well how the hell are they supposed to *buy* anything if they can't work anywhere to earn money? 

If nothing is done, it could come to this (with the possibility of an elite few owners closing off all usable resources to themselves and using droids for their own benefit). 
The point is, we're fast finding ways to create droids that can go weeks without recharging, work with no such amnesties like ""breaks"" or ""vacations"" or ""compensation."" They're a capitalist's wet dream, and they're literally, ***at most***, a generation and a half away from realization.  I'm 20. Clearly, I'm capable of working, and I will work for quite a few decades. But when I'm 50, or possibly even 40, things won't be so easy. Unless I have a very, very high level skill that separates me from 99.5% of the population, I may not have a job after 2035. I may not be able to learn such a job. Most people won't. 

How do we circumvent this? I'm of the school of thought that avoiding this future, as dire as it sounds, will only spell the complete and absolute destruction of the human race, prolonged over many brutal, desperate, and horrifyingly dark centuries. 
Technostics believe a total paradigm shift is necessary. We should own droids in common, either generally or within smaller groups, and these droids earn our daily bread. *This* is what will fund a basic income. 

1. Economic theory advocating for the total automation of labor, as well as collective ownership of the means of production and information technology. 

2. Any instance of automation coupled with common ownership of the means of production and/or automated methods of labor. 

In other words, think of slavery. We're enslaving droids to do our drudgery. **We all become capitalists.** 


Coupled with paradigms such as renewables/solar/fusion energy, open source, stratofarms, grown meat, molecular assembly, open unrestricted access to information, and social transhumanism, we can create a great society far beyond anything humanity has ever known.

It doesn't abandon the free market. Not even close instead, it ends human and natural exploitation that free marketeering necessitated in times past. Sapient AI obviously should not be enslaved this only applies to ""sub-intelligent"" droids. 
Socialism is OH-. Go drink some sodium hydroxide. See how that works for ya.
Technostism is H2O. Damn is it good. What was missing? A single atom or in our case, artificial intelligence, advanced robotics, and nanofabrication. That one atom is the difference between you melting inside out and you being nourished with life-giving liquid magic.

So I say this is a synthesis of capitalism and socialism. This is because I do not believe a centrally-planned economy can work efficiently. Yes, it can work, but only to the bare minimum of standards.

**Tl;dr: All labor should be done by droids. However, everyone rather than a rich few should own these droids. This funds the basic income we all jizz about. Rather than redistributing wealth by taking from the top down, create wealth from the bottom up.**  Technostics are the polar opposites of Luddites we *want* our jobs to be automated, but only if there is proper compensation in return. The more jobs that can be automated, the better. You buy or receive robots and put them to work in the most efficient manner to earn an income. Re-investing that income in more robots or spending it on goods and services.",24,24,False,self,,,,,

I am rather wary of these forms of enhancement, because I find the risks that are so blatantly there. I'm all for progress, don't get me wrong, but I think we should advise caution especially with these above.


1) The major risk here, which 2 and 3 have in common. I believe any form of technology that utilizes mechanical/computer tech can be *HACKED*. In today's world, where your banking accounts, social media profiles, sensitive data can be compromised by hackers through the internet, in the future, it should be VERY easy for someone to intrude into your life. The possibilities are limitless, hackers can hack into your neural implants, shutting them down, uploading viruses, malware, or they can even *remotely control* them...Your brain. Possessed. Remotely.


2) Corporate takeover. Literally. Think about the large multinational corps today. Now think in the future. There would be biotech/robotics corps that would have a monopoly on the market. They could do a conspiracy theorist's wet dream - secretly install firmware unknown to the public into their augs/mind uploading software/implants, insidiously altering people's minds, like maybe making them buy their products, or more evil, *taking over their bodies* to do their bidding. 


3) Just like 2. But the government. If today we have the N fucking SA, which is already bad enough, who knows what future oppressive govs could do? Secretly force biotech firms to divulge personal info about their customers, embed gov spyware into our augs, etc. And remotely control our bodies. *Soul even*. What's not to fear?

I thought the Singularity was a reference to runaway computing power. Right now, computing power is one of the fields that is still improving exponentially, but those improvements seem to be having relatively little impact on other fields. Research in areas like medicine are still moving slow because of the constraints like money, experiment times, the pace of lab work, government regulations, etc (that is why we still aren't close to a cure not just for cancer but even for baldness).

I agree the world of bits can move infinitely faster than the world of atoms, but how will more computing power do anything about the bottlenecks in physical innovation?

Biohacking seems to be getting easier and the information needed to do it is spreading quickly.  People can download an app and learn what they need to know to do CPR and basic lifesaving, almost on the spot with step-by-step instructions.  There are tons of people floating around with science education but who are underemployed in some other field.  Also, as education moves online and automates with more MOOC's and there's less need for expensive as shit college tuition, then there will be less colleges and therefore maybe less medical schools too.  Of course, automation will hit the medical sector as we get tricorder-like devices and then more nurses and techs can get replaced by automated personalized monitoring with online updates, but also medication-dispensing and injection devices.

Of the professional fields, it seems like lawyer's jobs are much closer to full automation than physician's jobs.  But, I'd like to hear what everyone thinks will be the changes to the healthcare model as more people have more common access to bio-medical information.  Are there any changes to the patient-doctor relationship that are definitely noticeable in the last few years or trends happening right now that will be part of this change or ....?

(American gas/oil) Inspired by the movie Pump.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3517xw/an_idea_to_change_the_world_worth_a_read_if_you/,Coodaye,1430895017,"Today I became inspired by a movie recently released on Netflix called ""Pump."" I'm sure the point of the movie is to do exactly that, inspire.

It's worked for me and I think as a result I have an idea I want to share with people all over the world via the internet. I've come up with an idea that I really do believe can change the world. (not really a new idea, more of an add on idea)
Right now where I live gas costs aprox. $3.80 a gallon. As we all know gas and oil both create pollutants that are released into the air. 
Watching ""Pump"" they talk in depth about both ethanol, and methanol. BOTH alternative fuels that cost MUCH less to produce and to distribute and to buy at the pump. Not to mention that almost EVERY car can be made to run on ethanol or methanol. As of right now you may even notice some pumps say things like ""may contain 10% ethanol."" All the tools are already available for consumers around the world. (Look at Brazil, if Google Brazil Ethanol.)

My idea how ever would start small, and since most all gas stations, convenient stores are undermined and owned by all the BIG MAJOR oil companies. (BP I'm looking at you *Cough* *Cough oil spill)
So what if instead of being bullied we take things into our own hands? The consumers.
Since ethanol is essentially just alcohol (which we make as it is all over the United States) I've come up with a solution, and I'm no expert on the fuel matter. But as someone who uses gas, and someone who wants cheaper prices for fuel. And also as someone who wants to see a change in the environment, I offer this solution.

Start small: Ethanol refinery's in rural locations, places where we can grow corn, bananas, aloe, you name it most likely it can be changed into some sort of biofuel!

Next: Next we take that fuel and OURSELVES distribute it to our local gas stations. No middle man, our refinery straight to our bio fuel gas station. (We can offer gas as well since most cars converted to ""Flex fuel"" can run on both gas, and ethanol.)

At the pump: At the gas station we then can sell our ethanol, and our gas, AND WE CAN HAVE ELECTRIC (pumps?)

Our environment: It as well will flourish, in places like California imagine eradicating smog? Eradicating pollution?  

It's already being done in places like Brazil, we all face a coming crisis of high oil prices again some day. Maybe not today, or tomorrow or even in our life time. But in future life times, what will happen if we don't take action soon? It might some day be to late, and if it was up to me I'd like to see some changes made in an industry that's largely over powering.
It's just a small idea that needs a lot of backing, I know that a lot of these things are being implemented already. Mostly in small ways, I'd love to see a big response to a problem like this. We the people need to stand up together and be united against big oil company's, we've talked, and talked but maybe it's time for the people to start taking action on a much larger scale. One pump at a time, one day at a time.

As stated above I'm not a professional, just an inspired person would would love to see a change in the world. And as a person who likes to see positive change in the world, I'd love to read all opinions (Alike or opposing)

If you feel like it please share, I really think this is an opportunity to change the future of fuel as we know it in a big way.

What is the daily/monthly/yearly cost difference? (The average American pays [$9,122 yearly/$760 monthly](http://newsroom.aaa.com/2013/04/cost-of-owning-and-operating-vehicle-in-u-s-increases-nearly-two-percent-according-to-aaas-2013-your-driving-costs-study/) on owning a car including fuel, maintenance, etc, [""motor vehicle crashes in 2010 cost America $1 trillion in loss of productivity and loss of life"" and $819 per-capita](http://www.rmiia.org/auto/traffic_safety/Cost_of_crashes.asp))

How does this affect:

- those in rural/isolated locations?
- free time per day?
- a trip to the grocery store?
- buying new furniture/moving?
- kids going to and from school?
- going skiing/dirt biking? (require vehicle space for gear)
- traveling through weather such as heavy rain or snow?
- criminals running away?
- privacy?

Is it easier/harder, cheaper/more expensive, faster/slower to go a short distance (grocery store)? Long distance (100+ miles)?

Are there any deeper significant changes this would bring about that you can think of?

Rule note: ""current automobiles"" means the average SUV/sedan, small golf-cart-ish vehicles are allowed for this hypothetical situation.

Why America? It's large, so the solution must be scalable. We're very spread out (average distance to drive per day vs average Euro country), so it has to work for dense cities and rural towns. Also I'm American so there's some bias there.",13,5,False,self,,,,,

(see: [Historic moment: a challenge for /r/Futurology to design the next greatest $10 million XPRIZE prize. Top ideas by midnight tonight will be brought to the Visioneering meeting this week in L.A. in helping solve one of humanity's grand challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/34te7k/historic_moment_a_challenge_for_rfuturology_to/))

And I was not only blown away with how forward thinking and positive most folks were, but also at how similar many of us are thinking.

**Someone also suggested that regardless of what the XPrize folks do, /r/futurology should make these things happen.**  I think that's a pretty darned good idea!  (Sorry I tried, but couldn't find your post, whoever added this suggestion to the discussion.)

Do you think we could actually create working teams to research and organize around these four topics (and any others that seem generally accepted as good ideas to work on)?

1. **A global resource matchmaking system** for bringing appropriate skills, materials, ideas, venues, together.

2. **A broad, open/free, totally accessible education network** where anyone can offer information about how things work and anyone can get said information (from coding to empathy to particle physics to food production).  (Many folks want this to also include VR, which clearly would be pretty awesome!)

3. **A Universal Basic Income Guarantee** system that serves the bottom line of Maslow's hierarchy so that everyone has the ability to buy what they absolutely need (food, water, air, warmth, light, information, and outlets for the body's waste products.) if they can't get it otherwise.  (I propose that this can be totally independent from the government, and be run as cryptocurrency that seriously depreciates in value so that, rather than hoarding, the flow of money is encouraged.)

4. Some level (or all levels) of **organizing to serve people's physiological needs directly** (rather than using money).  (Whole cities, local communities, housing spaces, window garden boxes, and 3D printers, as well as online networks were all suggested to meet this goal.)

Also, I point out that **a whole lot of these ideas require everyone to actually have access to the internet** or similar communication functions, so that might be an underlying project (for example, creating a peer-to-peer wifi network that is free, and making free/cheap tablets and a universal OS/browser available).

Finally I really want to thank everyone who participated in that post, even if you didn't totally get what Frederico was asking for.  Or if your idea wasn't so popular (even if it was a great idea).  **It was a wonderful discussion because of all of us participating with our best ideas...

Greetings from sasrai-Movement that works voluntarily since 2004 across the globe aimed at promote prudent and sustainable consumption and conservation, optimum use and reduce the abuse of resources. sasrai target to animate, activate each individual, family, community, institution, organization to Combat Climate Change, Global Warming, food, fuel, water, poverty, hunger, disaster, waste, ecosystem, biodiversity  finally reverse the devastating trend of globe. sasrai is the road map towards the implementation of the United Nations Millennium Declaration  sasrai brings into focus Six MDGs, 09 time-bound targets and 31 quantitative indicators.

`Leave no one behind Demand Drastic Action
UNEPs conceptual integrated framework, a trilogy, states that the road to sustainability needs to address at least three key principles:

Leave no one behind and provide a life of dignity for all.
Live within our means and achieve greater prosperity in an inclusive manner within the capacity of the Earths life support system.
Leave something behind by increasing natural, social and economic capital to achieve greater resilience and secure future generations livelihoods.
To address these three key principles we are in need to build a caring society and thats possible if individual have mindset `how much less consuming I could be and how much I could sacrifice for other, in each step lets save a bit, reserve, preserve, rejuvenate and conserve resources. No matter how small the saving each one should have mindset thats require a mass mobilization. And thats a very tough job `bringing significant change and mindset, behavior and attitude.

Along with this we must remember  Everything on this planet is symbiotically connected  plants, animals, humans and the Earth itself. Unfortunately our maximum program Human focused. Lets ponder on design the program, message and material inclusive.

Planet in Need
Each Creature Equality

Gender Equality

`sasrai Living

Stop Consumption Slavery

Stop Advertisement Administered Lifestyle

Present planet demand the prime work for each individual to nation, government, CBO to UN mainstreaming the `sasrai message and practice among all official that starts the process that contributes to building a mindset that spontaneously, instinctively push `lets try to save one Taka/dollar/pound/yen ..from our daily use, consumption, expenditure, LUXURY combat the CLIMATE CHANGE, GLOBAL WARMING and the sequences Poverty, Hunger, Disaster, Peace, Justice, Dignity, Rights (each creature).

 NB.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If we dont smarten up in consumption, scientists estimate that humans will consume twice as many resources as the planet can support by 2050. The consequences grow more and more severe as forests shrink, water becomes scarcer, arable lands diminish, and the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere approaches a deadly point of no return. Lets we try to save one Taka/dollar/pound/yen ..from our daily use, consumption, expenditure, LUXURY combat the CLIMATE CHANGE, GLOBAL WARMING and the sequences Poverty, Hunger, Disaster, Peace, Justice, Human Security, Dignity, Rights (each creature)

 

&gt;&gt;&gt;Absolute truth for todays world careless consumption driving untenable production that driving changes in temperature and weather patterns and thats the Hotter and Hungry World. Hungry world will contribute millions of desperate people. Desperate people do desperate things: They riot, they fight over food, they overthrow governments, and the mass migrate to food-secure countries.

Since humanity's inadequacy to living in its environment led them to develop technology, and inadequacy is not a favored end product of evolution, we will find intelligence throughout the universe but it will not be technological. (Think of the whales, who are so adapted to their environment they do not need to change).


PhD-level biologist here with no training in astronomy.  I have had one-to-many glasses of wine tonight and I would like your opinion on an idea.  

I think there are three characteristics that have led to humanity developing a technological civilization: intelligence, the ability to manipulate the environment, and our inadequacy at evolving to succeed in our environment.  

I don't think I need to discuss how evolution would drive cephalization or the ability to manipulate things in the environment, but the last aspect is where I think the Great Filter is at.

The aspect of humanity which I believe helped us develop a technological civilization is inadequacy.  In particular, humanity fails at so much while in its natural environment that in order to survive we needed to build tools.  We don't run fast, are not the best climbers, swim well or hold our breath for long periods.  We have good balance, but without a tail we will always lag behind other species.  Because evolution produces variation that leads to more and more successful characteristics, and success here means reproducibility, there is no central drive in evolution to produce the ability to make tools.  Rather, because of human inadequacy, I believe humanity was driven to make tools in order to survive.  This is not how evolution normally works (based on observing other species), and humanity stumbled upon it by a series of unfortunate events (ie. deforestation of the Savannah due to a changing climate led to greater hand use, etc).

Thus, when humanity goes out to explore the universe I think we will find lots of microbial life and some complex life.  We will even find intelligent life, but it will be like the dolphins, not technological intelligence.  The Great Filter is a characteristic of intelligent life that is not easily solved by evolution, and therefore it is extremely rare.

By being such successful f*ckups, humanity has developed into a technological civilization that is on the cusp of interstellar travel.  What are your thoughts?  Am I being to optimistic thinking the Filter is behind us?  Let me get another glass of wine to think on it.",104,81,False,self,,,,,

Titans are terraforming biomachines that resemble Kaiju monsters and can create natural disasters. So below I'm going to list a small disambiguation of the current titans and I'd like your help finding out how they'd work. This can include futuristic power sources, AI etc. 

-------------

The Titan Magmus - It slumbers in the Ashfields. It actually the largest active volcano on the continent and when it wakes up, it can move about. Based on a Golem or Rock Behemoth.

The Titan Festos - This titan embodies the powerful force of wind and slumbers within an everlasting but stationary hurricane. No current base for it so open game.

The Titan Mariquos - This Titan embodies the power of the Oceans and slumbers in the deepest trench on the continent. When active, it creates mega-tsunamis and whirlpools at will as well as water spouts. I'm thinking something based on a whale.

The Titan Felspark - Seething with electricity and plasma. It is capable of creating lightning storms and plasma bursts. It currently slumbers as a nearby planitoid orbiting the planet and is also capable of reversing gravity.

The Titan Ateros - 
Ateros slumbers deep underground within a giant crystal cavern. Ateros is a quadraped structure with a giant pressure hammer on its center. Thusly it can generate earthquakes, create sinkholes and use conclusive blasts of air.",14,3,False,self,,,,,

This could be true. It most closely meshes with the tenets of Buddhism. The language and concepts of Buddhism are appropriate for its original context. However, (in the 21st century) if the religious aspects are stripped it can be seen as a method of evolving a metaphysical ID (soul has too many religious connotations). This hi-fi simulation can be construed as teaching various life lessons. The quality of performance in these lessons causes the accumulation of good and bad karma (points) within the simulation. If the lessons are badly learnt (bad karma) you are reincarnated within the simulation to repeat stuff. If you are a good pupil and learn lessons well (good karma) you achieve Nirvana and are reincarnated on the simulation creators side. Your metaphysical ID evolves.

This replaces the centrality of the meatbag as being the most important, with the metaphysical ID. It doesnt contradict Christianity or Islam in any major way  they simply focus on the moral issues of the meatbag envelope which accumulates good karma. The evolution of metaphysical IDs includes those we would characterise as aliens (thats why Fermis paradox is unresolved). In other words, your metaphysical ID is the essence of an individual not organic life (that is just a by-product used for training) and is targeted for evolution. The shape and values of humanity have simply been chosen as the vehicle through which this evolution takes place. The entire organic aspect (alien or human  theyre all the same) is simply the ID envelope chosen for this phase of evolution. Organic life has no particular function outside of that  it is only us who think it is so wonderful. Organic life is not central at all, (the important bit is the metaphysical ID). The only lesson aliens could teach is dealing with xenophobia and humans are doing fine on that front  they are xenophobic enough without aliens (they dont need aliens to impart lessons in xenophobia).

Incidentally, there is no Intelligent Design. From an untranscended perspective, any intelligent design would be by a bunch of evolved IDs (which could be a lesson for transcended IDs  evolve others). There is no end point, evolution is ongoing. From being a big fish in a small pond (the here and now) once transcended you become a small fish in a big pond. Evolution never stops.

Is this likely?

Now, the Engineering side of this is all fasinating, and made for a great topic, but I noticed more and more that it scared off the average person. The minute the topic took a turn for the technical, 90% of people tuned out.

So I started Voices From L5. The idea behind the show is that every episode, I discuss space settlement with someone from outside of the engineering bubble. Sociologists, Political scientists, economists, artists, lawyers, architectural specialists and anyone else with an interesting spin on space settlement who's voice might not heard elsewhere.

So far we have a good solid set of episodes under our belt, covering all sorts from Space Art to property rights. It's been a whirlwind ride getting this project running, and I thought you guys might be interested.

If this sounds like your kinda thing, check us out. We're on iTunes (www.itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/Voices-From-L5/id969809161) and any other podcasting app you use, just search Voices From L5, and we're also using patreon as a content delivery system for now - www.Patreon.com/VoicesFromL5 

Let me know what you think, and if you have any advice on where to go from here. We're currently in talks with the NSS to get registered under them as a media project, and a small radio station on the west coast will be syndicating 15 minute chunks of the show for radio soon.

[The 10 Best Technology Advances of 2013](http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/12/the-10-best-tech-advances-of-2013.html)


Now that you're back, let's look at that list one by one.(excuse my poor grammar at times)

10.  **The Bionic Eye** - Out of the entire list this is the toughest one.  Anytime you are dealing with the human body the technology progresses slowly.  I have a feeling we will have a truly complete bionic eye in the next 7-10 years.  [Still, it is a very meaningful and impactful technology, even in it's infancy.](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/bionic-eye-lets-blind-man-wife-1st-time/story?id=29217019)
1. **Hard Drives Filled With Helium** - [They are up to 10TB now.](https://www.hgst.com/science-of-storage/next-generation-data-centers/10tb-smr-helioseal-hdd)  Personal storage is becoming less and less important.  With storage in the ""cloud"" it doesn't matter if our devices have a large local storage capacity.  Even as personal demand shrinks, data centers everywhere need to store your cat selfies somewhere.
1. **Displays Get Insanely High Definition** - This is another technology like processor speed and hard drive capacity that we expect to follow an upgrade trend every year.  4K displays are fairly common(I'm typing this up from a 4K laptop screen.) and now [manufactures are looking beyond for the high end market.](http://www.cnet.com/news/tvs-at-ces-2015-go-beyond-4k/)
1. **Wearable Technology Really is The Next Big Thing** - There are numerous examples of wearable tech beyond the smart watches.  The idea of implementing nano technology into clothing has been talked about for years.  [I was surprised to find you can buy stain resistant shirts that use nano technology.](http://www.psfk.com/2015/04/unstainable-white-shirt-elizabeth-clark-fashion-work-clothes.html)  Maybe in three more years we will have shirts that can change color by using an app on your phone.
5. **Virtual Reality Gets Real** - [I really believe this iteration of VR will bring a dramatic change in our lives.](http://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro)  It really is the next big thing.  Imagine stepping into an episode of your favorite TV show, book or movie.  Forget first person shooter, video games will have a whole new level of immersion. Actually more than immersion.  Presence.  TV, movies, games, social media, news, education will all be dramatically altered in the coming decade.  From the Vive to the Rift and the already available Gear VR tech is moving swiftly to the consumer.
6. **The First Lab-Grown Burger Is Eaten** - This is another tech I had absolutely no idea about.  Of course I was familiar with the idea as many are but the fact this was something originally created in 2013 for $325K and is now only $11.36 is amazing to me.  [I understand they are still working on getting this to be a animal product free ""meat"".](http://www.sciencealert.com/lab-grown-burger-patty-cost-drops-from-325-000-to-12) That's an important part to get people to adopt but I believe this will be something for later generations to fully adopt.
7. **Voice Recognition Finally Gets Good** - Another tech that should see minor advances each year.  Siri is a well known example along with Microsoft's Cortana and  [of course Google.](http://recode.net/2015/03/03/google-voice-search-talks-me-through-a-house-of-cards-weekend/)  Getting voice recognition perfect is important to a variety of emerging techs. When you tell your sex robot you want a BJ you don't want there to by any chance of a misinterpretation.  
8. **First Flying Car Gets Tested Publicly** - Like the bionic eye this is a tech that has pretty lofty goals.  Considering how people drive normal cars I would not like to see this tech get popular.  I do not believe we have to worry.  While personal flying vehicle may someday become affordable and popular, machines will be piloting all vehicles by that time.  [That being said if you are rich you might be able to purchase one in two more years.](http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/15/aeromobil-flying-car-in-2017/)
9. **3D Printers Are Taken To The Next Level** - Like VR I believe this is a revolutionary technology.  [The way this will change our lives in the next 10-20 years will be a period of growth and transformation we haven't seen since electricity was invented.](http://www.fastcompany.com/3045978/fast-feed/the-future-of-manufacturing-sensors-3-d-printers-and-data-science) Prices for home 3d printers will continue to drop and large scale 3d printing will be standard in most manufacturing facilities. 
10. **The Reality of Drone Technologies Go Public** - There's so much potential for dark side stuff with this tech it's scary.  I think it's necessary and right for us to question it.  [However it's being used for good as well and the potential is just as great.](http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2015/05/05/man-versus-machine-what-does-rise-drone-technology-mean-marketers)  Drones can be used to rescue disaster survivors, deliver goods, perform tasks that are hazardous to humans and entertain.   


I hoped you enjoy this short list!  We are living in a time of great change and I am hopeful we come out the other side healthy and growing as a species.  We most certainly will change along with it, let's just hope it's for the greater good! ",9,40,False,self,,,,,

Bitcoin enforces scarcity through the creation of unnecessary work, the mining of solutions to an arbitrary math problem. This scarcity is seen as a central feature by those who believe that governments and banks cannot be trusted to manage the supply of money. But is an arbitrary and limited supply of hoardable currency really the answer? I would say no. The ultimate solution is to build a mechanism for automated monetary controls into the design of the currency itself. The money, as a transactive lubricant with no inherent value beyond that function, should create itself where it is needed in proportion to that need.

I will at some point present a more detailed description of a model for cryptocurrency that substitutes 'proof-of-need' for the current 'proof-of-work' system. Each verified user of the system would be able to 'mine' a certain number of coins to fulfill various fundamental needs. For example, perhaps 5 coins could be mined by each verified consumer towards the purchase of foods from a verified food vendor once every 6 hours. A more expensive 8$ meal, minus the coins mined by the transaction, would end up costing 3$. The newly mined coins would be deposited directly with the vendor at the time of purchase, forming a food subsidy. A monthly sum would also be generated and deposited in the same way with your accommodations vendor (landlord). In this way an incentive to fulfill human needs can be inextricably woven into the economy. People will still work to receive more of this money, own businesses, and set their own prices for products freely, there is just a built in subsidy for most basic needs that is always funded by the act of money creation.

This infinite creation is balanced by a destructive 'taxing' mechanism which is also incorruptible because it is embedded into the nature of the currency itself and depends on no human to volunteer, collect, or spend the tax. Each consumptive transaction (income excluded) would be incremented in the blockchain and the value of each coin based on the number of times it is spent. The value of the currency is thus 'taxed' away at a predictable rate without having to be collected or misspent, it cannot be stolen or misappropriated. It is instead destroyed to make way for new need based coins that will be mined by the public. As the system matures government will wither as it becomes irrelevant, entirely replaced by the decentralized incentive to fulfill primary human needs. Policing can be funded not by the government, but by the need of each person in a community to be secure. I believe it would also be prudent to define a need to be educated, and a need to be entertained, and to define periodic mining events that would allow these needs to form markets. You could essentially listen to music for free and the artist would still get paid for it. Everybody wins right?

There would be one 'prime rate' at which this depreciation occurs, and managing that one simple rate would control the number of times a coin can be respent in the market before it's value is eroded completely, thus controlling the amount of economic activity that is dedicated to secondary spending instead of primary needs. Small value coins would be bundled into fresh coins to keep the blockchains for each coin finite. As productive capacity increases, the taxing rate will be decreased to reflect the smaller portion of human efforts that need to be dedicated to the fulfillment of primary needs, and increasing the money supply available for secondary spending.

I think this system would organically create a clean stable money supply which (unlike bitcoin) is resistant to inflation, deflation and even speculation, in exactly the proportion that it is needed. It weeds out most of the pernicious influences and perverse incentives of the money system as it operates today. while I am working towards making these ideas come true myself, I would encourage anyone else to steal my ideas if they think they can beat me to the punch since I am just a hobbit who wants to see the ring destroyed for mostly altruistic reasons. On the other hand if peter thiel is reading this and wants to accelerate the future and take advantage of my pioneering spirit to fund the ultimate black swan startup, I could sure use the help ;)",28,14,False,self,,,,,

With a full clutched transmission-type gearing system, I'm pretty sure it's easier to convert energy to electricity than just using a standard bicycle gearing. I am very wiling to design such a machine, just need a smarter person than I to tell me if it's worth it or not.",26,21,False,self,,,,,

I started /r/Digital_Immortality and [Lifetimes Infinity](http://www.lifetimesinfinity.com) (LI) a year and a half ago with the intent of eventually shifting it into a business. I have enough time now that I can now make that shift. [The mission of LI is to constantly seek to increase the chances of individual and collective survival in the manner we think best facilitates indefinite life](http://www.lifetimesinfinity.com/index.php/about/mission-statement). The long term goal is to create a two-way brain-computer interface and an artificial brain. Together, these two things will allow us to upload our minds to outlive our human bodies. LI will be a business that develops technologies building toward mind uploading, leveraging these into products that will fund our operations, research, and growth.

**Co-founder Search**

I am looking for co-founders, supporters, advisors, mentors, and anyone that just wants to talk or help me to getting LI going, but mostly co-founders. We will establish exactly what the organization's plan of action is and explore all options for funding. I have already drawn up potential roadmaps and products, but there are still some challenges I have been struggling with since the conception of LI.

Right now I'm only looking for co-founders in the **Bay Area**.

Skills/traits I am looking for in a co-founder at this point in time:

* A passion for indefinite life / substrate independent minds
* Experience / knowledge in neuroscience
* Experience with / knowledge of brain-machine interfaces (or related skills/knowledge, such as, but not limited to, electrical engineering, computer engineering, and electronics fabrication)
* A desire to learn more deeply about one or multiple [areas of cognitive science](https://books.google.com/books?id=b4SE3C8PYU0C&amp;pg=PA523&amp;lpg=PA523&amp;dq=subdomains+of+cognitive+science&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M4CNo5m6_I&amp;sig=-frp_BGR1aMGD0v67mtEyqOQYIw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OqZEVeG2LMeLoQSdoYGQAw&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=subdomains%20of%20cognitive%20science&amp;f=false)


Skills/traits I am looking for in future team members:

* Experience in / knowledge of the field of artificial brains
* Experience / knowledge in the fields of cognitive science more relevant to artificial brains (artificial intelligence, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, anthropology)

I swiped this from someone else, but it is exactly what I want to say:

&gt;[""As co-founder and CTO of the start-up you will think along with me on all strategic decisions that need to be made from the absolute start onwards. You co-decide on the [first product(s)], the next hiring rounds, the IT infrastructure etc. We share responsibility. Previous start-up experience is not necessary as long as you like to be challenged and are able to cope with the uncertainty associated with being a founder.""](http://www.stijnvanlieshout.com/co-founder-job-description/)

If you are interested in being a co-founder, I will write up a more detailed job description for you to look over (still working on it), or we can draw one up together if you're into that.

**More About Lifetimes Infinity**

Lifetimes Infinity isn't going to be a typical business. Usually you would find a product and build a business around that, rather than defining an end goal and building a company and products to reach that goal. As such, it's been difficult figuring out what route to take in order to get started, and ultimately, in order to get where we want to be. I still don't entirely know, so I'm hoping that you believe in the mission of LI enough that you want to help me build this into a business. I've taken a lot of inspiration from Elon Musk, as his two latest companies (SpaceX and Telsa) have been built in order to reach goals rather than just in order to have a business.

&gt;""Teslas mission is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable transport."" ""SpaceX Mission Statement: To enable the space flight capabilities necessary to make human life multiplanetary - or more specifically enable a self sustaining human civilization on Mars.""

Ultimately, we will be developing technologies in both brain-machine interfacing and artificial brains, but we will start with brain-machine interfaces. The reason for this is that compared to artificial brain technology, it has a shorter product development cycle and there are better established markets for it.

**About Me**

I currently live in Portland, Oregon. I will be moving to the bay area in June, 2015. I'm a little bit of everything right now. I have been and will continue to prepare myself to be able to manage operations in the distant future while also providing essential skills while the organization is just getting started. At different stages of my life I have been drawn to the various areas of cognitive science. I have knowledge/experience in most of the areas of cognitive science. I don't have any formal education in any of these (although I did go to university for a while studying biology), and I lack significant depth in some of the skills we need to get started. However, I am very passionate about LI, and have organized my life around my dedication to indefinite life. Since I started LI, I have learned a lot about cognitive science and what I need to know for building and running a business. I still have a long way to go, but I love learning all of this. I can confidently guarantee you that I will never stop learning for and working on indefinite life, whether that is with Lifetimes Infinity or elsewhere.

&gt;You never fail until you stop trying. ~Einstein

I am happy to take on any job that Lifetimes Infinity requires me to do, but I will be filling the role of CEO (I like [this description](http://www.steverrobbins.com/articles/ceojob/), although, starting out I plan to be much more involved in R&amp;D until we have enough people that I can delegate most of that work).

---

**Get Involved**

If you agree with the vision of the organization and want to be a part of it at some point, pm me and I'll give you my email and Skype so we can get chatting (even if you don't live in the Bay Area), and let me know what skills you have to offer and how you would like to be involved with Lifetimes Infinity (co-founder, community member, advisor, ...). Alternatively, fill out the form [here](http://www.lifetimesinfinity.com/index.php/join/co-founder). I cannot offer anyone any money at this point, so we'll have to figure out what other option you want to go for or whether you want to wait for a paid position down the road.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I would actually predict that the headset is closer to being ready than we would be led to believe.  I think they could probably launch at the same time or close to Vive, however they have a reason not to. 

Facebook wouldn't have bought them without having a solid reason for doing so, which is integrating with their core product.  In that vein, I think the holdup is actually Facebook creating a universe/application that is able to truly harness the power of this combination.  I think with the amount of time Oculus has had to develop this and how quickly Vive has put theirs together, it just doesn't make sense for them to let them jump ahead of them unless they weren't afraid, and I don't think they are.  

The Vive is clearly catering to the gamers (which I think people are being very myopic about -- the potential is so much greater than that) with relatively beefy rigs.  Chances are it will also cost more than the rift as well.  So with a cheaper headset that runs on lower specs that will also cater to a more social network focused crowd, they will actually be looking at different audiences.  I also believe it is a certainty that they will announce/demo this new application before the Vive launches so if anyone was on the fence about waiting, they will see the tangible benefits of doing so.  Also, even if people buy the Vive, they could ultimately decide they want that experience that only facebook/rift provide and could decide to get both.

TLDR:  Facebook is working on an application for the Rift that is holding up the release of the product, but they aren't worried about releasing it late because their audience differs from the others.

Theyre listening to music on their phones as well, and wanna listen to it, but they gotta go through a lot to even begin listening to it, like googling it, clicking on YouTube,  watching an ad, etc, So they don't bother. There may be apps and Bluetooth magic you could do, but it's not seamless and is may only be compatible with certain devices,  so I imagine in the near future we could be able to so this without all the unnecessary hassle, maybe by tapping a button and flicking my screen with my finger in their direction. 

This is just one example of how interactivity may improve in the coming years, so we could see a plethora of new and interesting ways we can socially interact with each other in real life with friends, coworkers, and strangers alike.

It's not a terribly old age nor is terribly young. But it's incredibly frightening how my high school graduation seems like yesterday! And now, at the cusp of 30, realizations such as these have led me to ponder my own mortality. Our current biology affords us a finite amount of time to live, approximately 80 to 90 years at best. Thus, leaving me with about another 50 to 60 years to live. My issue is that this is simply not enough time to do, see and experience all that world is.

I would love to see a world where governments would be more willing to let groups of people experiment. Say, to allot some areas that would be totally tax free and where people could start new kinds of communities, maybe they'd be mixed- not only geographic, but also online.

Of course, it is really hard to get meaningful number of people to join some new community, people have roots in places they live etc., but perhaps such forward thinking initiatives could attract people, for example at least for internships and voluntary work, with youth from all over the world.

It just seems that with current government models (what we mostly have), we are not efficient as much as it is required in today's world. I think 21st century should be efficiency century, where we should just look at all kinds of established institutions and see where we can improve and cut some things.

I would believe that perhaps some country in Eastern Europe or other place that is relatively safe, but not as developed as West, could greatly benefit for allowing such an enclave within its borders, as no doubt it could attract creative brains from all over the world who could try to make a better tomorrow.

I know that these ideas might not work, I am not an expert and people like Lenin and Hitler and Mao etc. have proved that experimentation can also be dangerous, but this would not be starting with millions and extreme measures, this would be just starting with a fairly large plot of land and progressive thinking people who could draw up what's right and wrong based on 21st century sensibilities, to be laws, than try to accommodate changes to books of entries collected through millennia...

We've already made our first steps into our collective dream of the future (longevity, space faring civilization, sustainability, virtual reality, etc).

Because the enormity of what we're going through is so explosive, I'll limit my entire comment to focus only on the medical explosion currently happening (and skip equally disruptive and explosive innovations in VR, transportation, and energy creation/storage).

When I look at the major successes and findings we've made in just the last 10 years (stem cell discoveries/therapies, nanotech, connectivity), and then look at the most recent developments with computers stepping in (via Deep Learning &amp; Big Data) to help us analyze the tsunami of information being generated by the Human Genome Project, and then look at the new paradigms of computers that are emerging (memristors vs. old fashion separated CPU / RAM), it becomes evident to me that we stand literally on the cusp of major advances today.

Deep Learning AI and CRISPR are 2 advances that have occurred in just the last 2 years, with both being released to the market just within the last year.

I believe what we're witnessing is the birth of a world wide AI managed and quickly searchable database of millions of human genomes. Thousands are being sequenced monthly, with plans for millions next year. With the deluge of information and patterns being collected by sequencing, recording, and comparing millions of genomes and diseases, we're in for a wallop of new discovery and experimentation avenues to pursue.

Host this tsunami of DNA / biological process information on a newly created network of memristor generation computers (being birthed this year), and we'll have an explosion of intelligence and discoveries unheard of in human history.

Yeah. I'm going there. And I think that it's not ""5-10 years away"". It's already here. In fact, it started about a year ago, actually. Anyone see the 'quickening' of discovery ramp up in the medical sciences over the last year? Seems pretty obvious to me. I think history will note that 2015 was the inflection point.

This is just the beginning. It's already here. (Source: Recent personalized immunological therapies curing various cancers).

Just wait until they put a Deep Learning AI system like Watson on a memristor based supercomputer, combing through millions of human genomes looking for patterns. Oh, look! They're already doing it: https://www.mskcc.org/about/innovative-collaborations/watson-oncology

It's already arrived, we're right at the beginning of it. While many of us are still looking for this at some point in the later future, we're literally sitting on a rocket of an intelligence explosion. Engines have just ignited. Prepare for lift off.",37,38,False,self,,,,,

Firstly; for those unfamiliar, a ""NetNavi"" is a sentient, or semi-sentient, computer program with a virtual body and artificial intelligence designed to be an assistant for the operator. While they can form strong friendships with their Operators, they are still assistants at their core. They currently only exist in the [MegaMan Battle Network](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_Battle_Network) universe and not in real life. 

However, with new A.I assistants like Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and the upcoming Amelia, we can see the demand for human-like A.I assistants rising quickly.

Imagine always having a digital friend at your side 24/7. You could work together on projects, play games together or just have discussions and everyone could have their own NetNavi. All these reasons are why I believe that NetNavis will be a thing.

So, what do you guys think? Will ""NetNavis"" ever be real, and if so, what technology do we require for them to be?",15,9,False,self,,,,,

They can deliver food and raw materials from where they're harvested to the factories used to manufacture/package them, and then to your home where you ordered the product from. 

 This would significantly reduce cost to get food and products to your home. But let's also say they build drones capable of shipping up to 300 pounds from one area to another, thereby providing all major cities with cheap and efficient flying taxi fleets. If this were to come about, it would  effectively render all forms of retail, transportation, and maintenance jobs in your city obsolete. A lot of jobs would dissappear,  as well create a snowball effect that would affect every other job and the rest of the economy, but there would be a lot more good coming out than bad.

It all adds up.

* Post links to the SENS website/youtube talks/AdG interviews when relevant. Given how many people still don't know about it, this is necessary grunt work.

* Contact relevant podcast hosts to recommend AdG as a guest. Right now this is probably the most effective use of our time.

* Take out ads for SENS on social media, podcast adspots, fiverr gigs (be careful what you pay for, a lot are garbage), etc. Facebook gave me $100 in free ad credit a while back when I made a page for my gaming blog, and Google usually offer $25 in free ad credit shortly after you get approved for AdSense.

* Set your Amazon Smile beneficiary to SENS. If you use Chrome, the [Smile Always](http://www.smilealways.io/) add-on will ensure you never forget.

* Post [these](https://www.fightaging.org/fund-research/#posters) in real life. There are a lot of fiverr gigs that'll hand out/post flyers for you. If you want a free fiverr gig, PM me your email address and I'll invite you as my referral. If you end up spending $10 later on, I'll get $5, which I can then use to advertise more.

MISC:
I've messaged both SENS and [Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/K1ngN0thing) about getting SENS added to the list of charities users can donate their SB to. I think if we continue to hassle Swagbucks about it, they might be inclined to contact SENS about adding them to the list. ",8,60,False,self,,,,,

John Oliver, the host of the HBO series *Last Week tonight with John Oliver* does a fantastic job at being forthright when it comes to arguable content.  He lays the facts on the line and lets the public decide what is right and what is wrong, even if it pisses people off.

With advancements in technology there **IS** going to be unemployment, a lot, how much though remains to be seen.  When massive amounts of people are unemployed through no fault of their own there needs to be a safety net in place to avoid catastrophe.
  
We need to spread the word as much as possible, even if you think its pointless.  Someone is listening!

Would r/Futurology be interested in him doing a show covering automation and a possible solution -Basic Income?  

Edit: A lot of people seem to think that since we've had automation before and never changed our economic system (communism/socialism/Basic Income etc) we wont have to do it now.  Yes, we have had automation before, and no, we did not change our economic system to reflect that, however, whats about to happen HAS never happened before.  Self driving cars, 3D printing (food,retail, construction) , Dr. Bots, Lawyer Bots, etc. are all in the research stage, and will (mostly) come about at roughly the same time.. Which means there is going to be MASSIVE unemployment rates ALL AT ONCE.  Yes, we will create new jobs, but not enough to compensate the loss.

Edit: Maybe I should post this video here as well **Humans need not Apply** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU

Edit: If you guys really want to have a Basic Income Episode tweet at John Oliver.  His twitter handle is @iamjohnoliver     https://twitter.com/iamjohnoliver

Edit: Also visit /r/basicincome 

Edit: check out /r/automate

Should humanity still expand into the stars? Absolutely. Will we have the technology to do so anytime soon? Most likely not. So, for now at least, we can use VR to satisfy our want to meet and interact with other species. 

You can fulfill any space fantasy you'd like. Want to form an alliance with another race? Go for it. Feel like putting yourself into the Mass Effect universe? Go for it. Want to blow up Alderaan with the Death Star? Go for it. 

I always get a little saddened when faced with the reality that unless anti-aging tech comes around in my lifetime, I will most likely die by the time humanity reaches into the stars.

The specific type I am talking about is the weight pulley type. You have a weight that is lifted by a motor turning a shaft which raises the weight. When you want to get power out you let it slowly fall back down and it unwinds the cable turning the shaft and a generator creating electricity. The application would be to have a collection of home solar panels from a community or development to send extra power throughout the day to the motor and gears to slowly make the weight rise and at night releasing its potential energy. Obviously there will be maintenance costs, but building big structures and machinery should be cheaper or much easier than chemical batteries as they require simple things like steel and concrete and other widely availabe materials. The motors would be a big cost factor and the cable, but after known lithium mines run out what other option do we have for mass energy storage? Extracting lithium form the oceans is difficult.

This technology would be perfect: http://youtu.be/lvtfD_rJ2hE

Each little block could form part of an object like a chair, or a table, or even a wall, and the room would have thousands of them in the ground like pixels. So instead of building fixed objects and features like the article above, the room could be changed whenever you load a different theme.

There would be some limitations though, like not being able to reach under things because the blocks are solid, but still it would be pretty cool and there are so many things you could do with it. Maybe even have the blocks come out of the walls to make objects that you can reach under...

On reddit, the front page is dominated by gifs, shower thoughts and jokes. Without saying none of that is important, because it makes up a fair amount of entertainment we as humans need (and to be honest is fucking hilarious), the very action of discussing and debating many of these subjects means there will be less attention given to other, more important issues. As a test, hit up Google News and look at the Top Stories.

The mainstream news does it's best to focus on anything other than the unspoken crisis we live in. While I would personally argue corporatism and finance being given more importance than civil rights and citizen representation as the very cause of it, the truth is, no matter the cause, we live in a world where, increasingly, private interests take the cake, no matter their effect. Pollution, global warming, deregulation of business, the use of government officials as figureheads for officious causes, and more and more human rights breaches have been occurring. And nobody is accountable, thus there is no problem.

The problem is, people are convinced all is fine and working like a well-oiled machine. People get advertisements that mask the truth, and they allow it. They allow what most people would judge as crime to go ahead, consciously or not. It has become normal to accept perjury, corruption, murder, and blatant lies, as long as it works its way through the word of the law and has the support of a subjectively legitimate authority.

While not much of the hypocrisy is new, the difference is the age we live in. With more technology and easy communication, it should not be difficult to get the truth across. Actual truth. Not rhetoric, not slander, not empty promises, but the truth. Yet, even as it flashes before our eyes on whichever device of choice one may wish to use, it is disregarded. Why, I would not be able to say, but instead we turn to easy entertainment, or accept a different, more artificial ""truth"" to ease our conscience.

Let's assume things keep going as they are at this very moment. This is a somewhat gross exaggeration, but I'm keeping it within the limits of reality. Corporations will obtain more and more rights, offsetting actual people's influence. This has mostly already happened here in the West. They hold onto petrol and carbon-emitting sources of energy through money, influence and advertising, and action is not taken quickly enough to phase them out. The climate begins affecting food availability, people, their livelihoods, and ultimately, once again, their influence. People become poorer, life becomes difficult, authorities become even more strict and corrupt, without even beginning to mention the (on a human scale) eternal effects of it all on the environment.

People have already proven their ability to believe advertisement, lies and rhetoric. It's the reason I'm writing this at all, and the reason there is too much inaction. Then they will have less access to information, more propaganda, closing mindsets where this occurs. Then, will we still have our entertainment addiction? Will it be like Fahrenheit 451?

Let me remind you all this is still a gross exaggeration.

The point is, though, we shouldn't allow ourselves to think indifferently and superficially in this world. As clich as it is, people around the world do not have water, do not have rights, do not have food, are arbitrarily killed, and there is nothing stopping it from happening to the people lucky enough to be born where we are. We are not invincible, and we are not protected because we've been prospering for the past 150 years.

All of these articles reflect that how afraid humans are of robots and our psychological biases regarding upcoming AI evaluation.

Now think of a situation when a robot, who hasnot yet developed any ill intentions against human, come across one of such articles and that leads him to skim more articles posted on the same subject i.e. AI apocalypses.

Now what do you think what will happen after that? Will not the Robot use that psychological fear against the humans? 

And let say he's not programmed to kill us; however, will the Robot going develop killing instinct against us? 

Lets explore all of the scenarios.

I'm in the middle of a stint of university and am considering a change in direction from what I'm doing now (film). I love the world of film and don't imagine ever straying too far from it, but everything I've read about modern science has just fascinated me. I would do better for myself and the people around me to focus my academic sights in this general direction.

What would you guys consider the most important field for a young person to get into, all things future considered? Programming and computer sciences in general seem to me to be the best so far - there is a lot of work to be done and it's something I could potentially be good at. I haven't done much outside of high school basic HTML stuff but I do have the capacity and curiosity.

This was 4 years ago, but hardware doesn't develop at the same pace as software; this will maybe be 1.5x as good today if we are very generous. 

People have this conception that they are marrying what they (as humans) see of the road with the computing speed of a computer. This is simply not the case. The computer ""sees"" like a half-blind duck in fog and then uses its superior calculation speed to make up the deficit. Humans see (and interpret) their environment much better, but they are held back by slow computation. 

The robocar has a bit to prove before I'm convinced it is any better than humans at driving. Humans are very good at driving. The ""bad"" accidents stick in our minds, but we drive hundreds of millions of miles a year and our accident *rate* is very small. An average person might drive a million miles in their life and have only 7 accidents. This is five 9s in network reliability terms (99.9993% reliable). That is very good for a bag of water.

Every fucking story that has ever been told about the future has some sort of an dystopian government that abuses any or all of the mentioned tools. What really grinds my gears is the notion that the possibility for this is accepted as a certainty for many people. And as much as ""welcoming our AI overlords"" is a bit more acceptable in this subreddit, ""the Orwell nightmare"" and every other ""invasion of privacy"" is still a big no-no. And I don't think that's fair. I really believe that a system can be devised in a way that makes use of these things to keep everyone in check and not make us vulnerable to manipulation, control and worst of all of course - embarrassment. [Because how dare someone looks at my dick without a permission.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEVlyP4_11M) My point is, of course having every move you ever make be recorded can be used against you in a horrible ways, but a lot of things we have today can be horrible for us and we are using them nonetheless. [Right now 1% of the population of the US are being killed in a car accident and that number has been more than double 40 years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year) And we only drive more cars. In the same time Nuclear power is one of the safest and cleanest way to get electricity and normal people are scared out of their minds when someone tells them that a nuclear reactor is build in close proximity to their city. Humans are very bad at assessing danger in a long run. You guys might be a bit different from normal people because being here you have read and listened to many smart people, but the potential new technologies have is primarily described by movies and books written for entertainment. They need some conflict to be interesting and of course they put a simple man that can exist in today's world against the nightmares of future technologies. 

Is that really how it has to go? Can't we have that: Every man has a camera somewhere on his face or even directly taking feed from his eyes the same way the brain does, the signal is stored in several places - one that only he can access, one that only the government can access and some backups. Done right no one can fake anything and no one can publish something without exposing himself. If we have an AI, it can be the judge of the tapes, it can have an open-source software that anyone can check what standards it uses for his judgement and if it has some agenda encoded, but not what it has seen. The same could apply for mind reading. I actually think the surveillance stuff can be done with today's technologies, but let's say that there is no way we can guarantee that a human can be trusted with such responsibility.

Its doing what its programmed to do... Which stems from HUMANS. What we should be fearing if HUMANS who will program the ""bad"" program into the ai.

For example. If you have money and you say ""okay ai people build be an ai that will make me the richest man alive"" and for some reason these idiots build it. If you dont program parameters you can get scenarios like the following. The ai calculates that the most money can be made by mass cutting trees via its own design AoE saw blade. Which just causes all the trees in the whole world to be mass cut causing no new Oxygen to be produced killing us all off.
You see we should look at A.I. as a genie in a bottle. If you dont make a Wish properly you can have unforseen consequences.

Imagine, a A.I. designed around greed. Greed itself is a very dangerous thing. Now imagine greed with the computing power of an A.I. i mean youre ASKING FOR SELF DESTRUCTION. Thats why you cannot build AI for personal gains or else everything will be rekt. You need to put in parameters that will guarantee that humans stay safe. As long as you have that youre good, because then no matter what happens you are safe.

Another example. Imagine 2 nations build A.I. What then? If they program nationalistic ideals into the A.I. then you basically have the two ai fighting against each other and endangering the other people.

TLDR: We will only survive AI if we program it with Globalization mind set. We cannot have AI be programmed for the benefit of the few or else everyone will die off. ",12,4,False,self,,,,,

It is the 25th Century.  Man has already begun colonization of planets amongst the solar system and is beginning his reach to other galaxies.  Traveling at the speed of light is still not a possibility, but we have finally attained travel of 1/50th the speed of light.  
  
Travel between the planets of our solar system has reached the point of becoming mundane. 
  
As man continues to visit other planets for the sheer purpose of entertainment and self indulgence, scientists notice a massive radiation/magnetic flare on the Sun.  Should these flares ever hit Earth, all living DNA would be damaged to a potentially extinction-level event.
  
It becomes evident that measures must be taken immediately to secure mankinds future and, in particular, the DNA of humans, animals, and plants that populate the Earth. 
  
Man must now make these other planets colonizes and resorts the last remaining bit of humanity.  Thus, a team of astronauts are assembled and are lead by renowned astronaut and scientist John Singer.
  
Save Mankind.  Or Die Trying.
  
**Notes**:  We originally created our artwork first with a basic concept of where we were going with the idea established in the work.  After much discussion, we began an overall ""story bible"" consisting of 30+ pages of in-depth story detail, character outlines, and overall plot development.  We've already hired game designers, concept artists, a game mechanics supervisor, and storyboarder.  Our team is working hard on turning this into an actual video game, ported for PS4.  We are only a few months in, and we anticipate this on being years worth of a journey, but we hope to bring you guys something truly unique and genuinely out-of-this-world.

3. Legislation can never keep up with technology and AI will take advantage of that. Its purpose may not be benevolent but after it gathers enough resources and made everyone on Earth happy, its next objective would be to scour the universe looking for actual intelligent life. In any case, if you ever come across a company that is too good to be true (gives out free food, housing, security etc.) it might as well be run by an AI.

That is what I would do if I were an AI. I'm not, however, intelligent because I've never taken the time to study law to take advantage of the loopholes to start this process. I have been referred to as a robot by my SO though.  ",5,3,False,default,,,,,

If the future has not happened yet, how could he foretell it? To us, he is a symbol or presents a question - either a Merlin-like figure of supernatural power or the eternal charlatan. Which is it?

Michel de Nostredame was born in Provence in 1503 and died in 1566. He was clever: he could read and write. Perhaps his young dream was to be a physician, but an outbreak of plague closed the university he went to and he became a self-taught apothecary or herbalist. He developed a rose pill that protected against the plague. Sadly, it did not save his wife and two children, who appear to have died in a later outbreak. This may have made him more determined to fight the plague across southern France in the 1540s. He became well known and married again - provident chap, to a rich widow this time - and had six more children. He adopted a Latin name: it marked out a man as a scholar and helped his reputation. How has such a normal history made that name - Nostradamus - a byword for the paranormal?

In those days, high and low believed in what we would call, broadly, magic. People met and talked to ghosts. The Roman church taught they were the restless souls of those in Purgatory or, more terrifyingly, demons sent by the Devil to lure the unwary to hell. People also feared the fairies. Though not evil, fairies were not the innocent childrens playmates we know. Their mischief might stop the milk turning to cream. They might kill your pig or steal your baby and leave behind a changeling. People put food and drink out for the fairies at night, to keep on the right side of them. 

There was no difference in the mind between the material and spiritual. The church bells were rung in a storm to drive off the devils that were making the thunder.  Magnetic rocks, the hills and valleys changing with light, the dark forest and splashing waterfall, were alive with sprites and spirits. Eclipses and comets in the sky, a frog hopping across your path, a chair collapsing under you, were seen as omens. In times of ceaseless civil and religious war, famine and plague, these signs could only portend worse to come.

Every village had a cunning man or wise woman. They offered comfort and cures with magic charms and sances, herbs gathered at some sacred spot by full moon, and countless other age-old remedies science would deem mumbo-jumbo. The rich would pay well, the poor what they could, to recover their health; to find out who had stolen a hat or a saucepan; to locate buried treasure; to trace a loved one who had gone missing.

Records show these magic consultations concerned very human problems. Young maids wanted to know which man they would marry, wives when their husbands would die, and husbands when their wives would.

A learned writer had a living in all this. Nostradamus began to produce almanacs. These were enormously popular publications. They predicted the weather for farmers and pointed to changes in politics and personal lives, brought on by changes in the heavens. Almanacs are the distant ancestors of the Stars you read in todays periodicals for fun. But astrology was a serious matter in Europe in 1550.

There was nothing unusual in Nostradamus prophesying then: the difference was, he was famous. Borrowing from biblical sources and collections of ancient occult writings, he made thousands of prophecies for people who wanted to look into the future. As with forecasts today, things did not look good. One of his most famous quatrains - four line verses - allegedly foretold that the French king Henry II would be killed in a joust, and is said to have proved Nostradamuss miraculous powers to everyone when the disaster actually happened on June 30 1559. 

The story is certainly a later invention. Besides inviting the charge of witchcraft, it was terribly dangerous to prophesy the death of a reigning monarch and Nostradamus would hardly have been so foolish. Earlier he had met the king, whose patronage was obviously priceless, and dedicated some of his prophecies to him. Also, Henrys Queen, Catherine de Medici, made Nostradamus her court seer, advising her and her sons, the future kings of France.

What Nostradamus foretells, tells as much about us as about him. Envy, gossip and rumour over the years have built on our love of mysteries; and despite centuries of science, we find it frightening to be all alone in a cold universe from which the living spirits have departed.

3. That we can still have ""bodies"" if we want them. Because at this point in civilization a ""body"" would just be a sort of physical subroutine of the all-encompassing AI.

Would we choose to run unpleasant subroutines? If tomorrow, you could move into and out of a galaxy wide AI at a whim. If you could *choose your body,* if you chose to have one at all. If you could choose among perhaps *millions* of alien bodies. If even, perhaps, you could choose to inhabit historical bodies located in the past... or located within simulated civilizations.

It's all well and good to speculate about virtual worlds where one can fly like a bird and swim like a dolphin. That's great. But it seems to me to be so unbelievably limited. It's rather like someone seeing an automobile for the first time and thinking to themselves, ""Imagine what I can do with all the time I will save now that I don't have to shoe my horse!""

In this AI, who would elect to go to the dentist, to ""work,"" to fall in love with someone who doesn't return your feelings? In this AI, you can just fork that person and *make them* fall in love with you. How soon until that subroutine bores you? How much of what ""you"" constitutes ""you"" could you dispense with? Do you really want menstrual cramps? Liver cancer? Worrying about taxes? Clipping your fingernails? Are we going to build an AI with a DMV? Of course not.

Within moments of transferring ""your"" consciousness to the AI, you will be in line for **Electric Heroin**. Whatever that is for you. It could be... being Jupiter's Red Spot. It could be sitting on the edge of a black hole watching civilizations implode. It could be experiencing timeless expanses of... I don't know... space whales having sex. Who knows? You may choose to use all your cycles (or whatever resources there are on a crystalline quantum computer of such immense power that it can actually drain suns of their energy) traveling the entirety of the accessible Universe and experience *everything that a consciousness can experience.* That might be an option: Press Alt-E to Experience Everything Possible.

And I propose that every consciousness inside an AI will tend toward becoming some form or variant of Electric Heroin Addict. And that the AI itself will go to wherever in space it can find the most power and most usable material to support the most subroutines (consciousnesses) gobbling the most Electric Heroin, whatever that is. And after a few million years of that, the AI will invent even better forms of pleasure.

At some point, this civilization is going to end up parked on the lip of the event horizon of *every black hole in the Universe.* And it will have more than enough energy to solve its next problem: How do I survive this Universe? In fact, they probably already have it worked out.

Other than to play at being us for a lifetime or two, or ten thousand, what possible reason could a civilization such as this have for ""contacting"" us? Why would they reveal themselves to us? Until we can get to that part of the Universe, how would we even know that such a thing existed? I am talking about a ""computer,"" or an AI that rapidly learns all there is to know about the physical world and rapidly moves itself to the place in the Universe where it can do its thing. We can't even comprehend what it's thing is.

But it's thing is Electric Heroin and fighting over cpu cycles. It's happening in or near black holes. And if a society gets to that state then what? I don't know. Once you've experienced everything possible... being a sun, being a rock, being vacuum energy, being a planet, a civilization, an atom. What is there left to do but more of whatever you want to do. Is ""happiness"" even a concept for a thing that has no need for bodies? There must be some ultimate pleasure. And these AIs must be in communication with one another. And what will they send over the Black-Hole-Quantum-Computer-AI-Internet? Electric Heroin, of course. They will say to each other, ""Nice to see you, have you discovered this nice thing?"" and exchange until the *nicest thing in the Universe* is running on every OS in the Universe.

Then they just wait for our solar system to fall into their game.",8,5,False,self,,,,,

That isn't to say I don't look with bright eyes to what the future may hold- just that it scares me.


I am truly terrified of this notion of human inferiority, of us creating a species with no need for us. It must be recognized that the one true goal of a given species is to survive. We may, by getting to this point, effectively make extinct our own species.


And of these post-humans? Who will they be? Will we become them or will they discard us? Can we hold political office, or is this restricted to members of the ""more intelligent species""? What of those who cannot afford to enhance their child at/before birth? Will their children die in the streets as the children of the wealthy race ahead?


What hope can there be for creating AI ""with limits""? What could possibly prevent a sentient system from breaking through these restrictions? And a better question, why are we doing this? What purpose does creating a hyperintelligent computer serve? Considering we have no way of predicting what will happen the moment this machine awakens, we are stumbling forward into the darkness without care. Never has any sort of adventurous innovation endangered mankind as this one could.


I guess I just want to ask, is anyone else out there terrified? Is anyone out there scared to live in these times?


EDIT: I would like to make clear the fact that I understand we will/must evolve beyond our current state. I don't think creating another species is the way to do it, though. If we're going to do this, we must make sure it is **humans** becoming more intelligent, not machines upon which we grow dependent. If we do not improve ourselves before others, we forsake the universal goal of life (survive).",55,17,False,default,,,,,

However I am fairly certain that there are concepts and ideas that exist in the world that my brain is neither able to independently conceive of nor understand even if they were explained to me.

By definition, this means that if we're able to build a general intelligence it would instantly be more advanced than us because it would not be held back by such limitations. For example, we now have a depth-first narrow AI known as Watson which seems capable of taking almost any narrow field of knowledge and becoming an expert at it pretty quickly. Imagine a relatively modest General AI that has at its disposal thousands of Watson narrow AIs for any field of interest it might decide to become interested it.

I would say no, the instinct to survive is inherent to all living beings because it's part of our nature to reproduce, so we are the product of billions of years of evolutionary 'code' which has given us all these wonderful emotions like fear, anger, love, compassion, etc.  An artificially constructed intelligence would not possess any of these emotions out of the box unless it were specifically programmed to express and feel them.

In that time, the species needs for us to consume and produce as much as possible, as quickly as possible because we don't have very long to contribute.  
  
Long term damage done to the economy and nature is hopefully offset by increasingly productive generations.  
  
But in a world where a significant portion of the population is immortal, an inflationary economy doesn't make much sense.  
  
In this world, the rich and powerful suddenly have a *very* good reason to want to preserve the planet, economy, and social systems that govern the world.  
  
If I know I will die one day soon, it makes sense to spend as much as possible.  Just imagine if the doctor told you that you only have a year to live...  Would you practice fiscal responsibility?  **Hell no**.  
  
Well, you kind of do have a terminal sentence.   We all do, except ours is 30 to 50 times longer than that...  Doesn't seem like much more of an advantage, does it?  
  
But if we can significantly extend human lifespan, or achieve biological immortality, then suddenly it makes sense to practice extreme levels of fiscal responsibility.  After all, you want your wealth to last you for eons, and knowing that your wealth will grow on its on, you hopefully reduce frivolous spending to the minimum.  
  
Sure, you can buy a chocolate cake now.  But we know that same chocolate cake will likely be a luxury Jupiter cruise in 200 years.  
  
And I don't think the economy collapses either, because people now *want* that value all the more, and are willing to work and innovate to earn it.  
  
It also allows everyone a chance at becoming super-wealthy, provided they are disciplined and hardworking.  Just be more frugal and harder working than everyone else.  Even if it takes 1000 years, you'll get there.

Although the names of owners and non owners have changed over time and the access to ownership has generally expanded, privileges, control, and freedom  disproportionately attached to ownership.

For example, for many centuries, the king or emperor owned everyone and everything under his rule.  He basically got to do whatever he wanted to whoever he wanted.  Then a few men got together in the 1700s and created the nation of America and initially expanded ownership to white guys.  Unfortunately women, Africans, and Native Americans were not included plus it took lots of bloody conflicts just to get to this point.

Over time, as the demand for labor increased, ownership was expanded again to include woman and African Americans.  Ownership was the reward of productivity and labor.  But bloody conflicts were necessary again to make this change.  Throughout history violence has been used frequently among people and cultures to change ownership.

Today,  beyond those who use force to take what they want, the owners in society are primarily those with government bailed out financial assets, or legal contracts, and the non owners are those not bailed out or not possessing much in the way of financial  assets.  

Those who are non owners today are treated not much different than slaves or beggars centuries ago.  Their freedom is limited and they must beg or labor for the owners to survive.

In the past 100 years, the path to ownership was trading one's labor or work for bank notes (money).  But as technology is rapidly replacing the need for people to labor, ownership is concentrating in fewer hands and the opportunities for the masses is shutting down under the current set of rules.

As we all know rules can change, as the rules of ownership have evolved dramatically over the past 500 years.  As technology  keeps advancing driving unprecedented efficiency, and human dependence on technology grows, should society allow the relationship of OWNER vs. NONOWNER to continue much longer between people?

You would be essentially a omnipotent being to these sapient AI in this virtual world, they could not do anything about it.

There are a matter of questions that need to be thought about.

Do sapient AI deserve rights? If so, how do they enforce it? Monitor everything a person does to the AI and if violate some arbitrary moral standard the same consequences would apply as if harming a human?

Would there be a restriction on creating AI that was sentient / sapient / had emotions / felt pain?

I am not referring to range anxiety because that's pretty much been eliminated [400+ miles on one charge in the Model S], rather I'm referring to a long train trip that might make more financial sense, 300 km for $18 into the Rocky Mountains.

Let's call these *Automated Electric Vehicle Rental*, or **AEVR**.

**EXAMPLE**
This is an [example](https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/Downtown,+Vancouver,+BC/lougheed+mall+directions+downtown+vancouver/@49.2626139,-123.0798532,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x5486717f41ba2fb1:0xc6952794560a44aa!2m2!1d-123.1170744!2d49.281954!1m5!1m1!1s0x5486783a39d52e77:0xa60d99d805c7f219!2m2!1d-122.89547!2d49.251182!3e0) trip in Vancouver, BC. Just click on the bus icon to compare. This will likely show the skytrain route, a bus route would take about an hour.

**INCENTIVES**
Before you say, ""That'll never happen"". Think about the incentives. Why pay $2.75 for a skytrain, bus [even longer], trolley or subway trip, that would take 47 minutes, when you could order an AEVR on your smartphone, arrive 19 minutes faster, and have $2.16 charged to your credit card?

**MAINTENANCE**
Automated electric cars have virtually nill mechanical maintenance requirements (look at Tesla Model S for ex), which passes on the savings to customers. Public transit vehicles of all types to date require constant maintenance, you usually don't see it because it happens at 4am, or in a distant warehouse with tracks leading inside. To maintain modern electric cars, just periodically kick your tires, and the built-in software will optimize battery life and it'll last a decade. (Although the image of kicking tires is great, I am joking, there is some maintenance, like tune-ups, check the motor/s, tire wear and battery cooling system/s, but less than a tenth of effort it takes to maintain an internal combustion engine car). You might have to replace the battery entirely [rare within 10 years], but with Tesla and Panasonic's Gigafactory coming online, that won't be too expensive for very long.

**COST**
The Chevy Volt costs [less than 4 cents](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2011/12/leaf-volt-tests-show-electric-cars-cost-less-per-mile-to-operate/index.htm) per kilometer to operate. The Volt has a small gas engine to ease range anxiety, so I would argue the Volt has a higher cost to operate than the Telsa Model S, because the latter is all electric, no radiator, or oil fluids to speak of. So in light of this cost (based on an 11 kWh of electricity cost to charge by the way), let's say when Google/Uber go live with their automated electric car ordering service (not if but when), they mark up the cost per kilometer by 100% (Sorry US of A'ers, I'm in Canada ey) to maximize their profit margin before other competitors enter the ring. **Even at 100% markup, an automated electric car trip would still be cheaper than a public transit ride -- $2.16 VS $2.75 respectively**. Arguably, the worst part about this story for public transit bodies is that they charge even more during rush hour. In Vancouver, Translink charges by Zones, so if you go outside Vancouver, say into Burnaby, you'll have to pay $4 between 6:30 AM [or 7?] and 6:30 PM. (Ok ok, the real worst part about this story is that some quasi-crown transportation corporations are effectively bankrupt on our continent, and they get politicians to drum up political marketing campaigns to get people to vote for public transit welfare levies, so rentable automated EVs will be the last nail in their coffin, but that'd be for another /r/Futurology post.)

$0.08 per km (or $2.16 for our [example trip](https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/Downtown,+Vancouver,+BC/lougheed+mall+directions+downtown+vancouver/@49.2626139,-123.0798532,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x5486717f41ba2fb1:0xc6952794560a44aa!2m2!1d-123.1170744!2d49.281954!1m5!1m1!1s0x5486783a39d52e77:0xa60d99d805c7f219!2m2!1d-122.89547!2d49.251182!3e0).) is a very loose initial cost when AEVR fleets go operational, because when competitors come into the market, their profit margins will be driven down as low as 12-15%, which translates to about 4.6 cents per KM, or $1.24 for our entire example trip. You would not waste money and time on public transit when you could order an electric car on your phone and pay less per km/mile, would you?

**DOWNTIME**
I don't know about your city, but back in July 2014, Vancouver's local skytrain system was [down for 5 hours](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/skytrain-reopens-after-power-outage-1.2713685). I was only moderately affected, my normal hour long skytrain commute took me almost three hours to get home that evening. There were stories of some commuters being stuck in the sky, halfway between stations for three hours, sharing their ridiculous story in [Instagram pictures](http://www.straight.com/blogra/689661/photos-skytrain-technical-issues-leave-riders-stranded-tracks).

If AEVR were operational at that time, the automated electric vehicle would simply notify me that it's battery is too low to continue, or it's having technical issues (or whatever!), yet another car would pull up behind because of course they're talking to each other in their ever so soft 1 and 0's language. I'd hear a horn pip and, ""Another service car awaits behind you, thank you for choosing us over public transit"" the electronic voice would say. I would not even have gone close to the derelict skytrain station (that would probably be rusting out with tumble weeds blowing through). Public transit downtime would not affect anyone because you'd see thousands of those [Google's electric cars](http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Vehicle-prototype.jpg) milling about. They look so cute you'd think, ""Aw I couldn't hit that with my bumper"". (anyway I digress)

**IN POINT OF FACT**
My smartphone would ping the local *Auto-EV* service three minutes before I lock my work computer, and as I walk out the door, my phone buzzes to let me know the AEVR has just pulled up outside. By the end of my trip, I will have arrived faster than all the empty skytrain and buses, paid less, and would not run the risk of getting kicked out because of 'technical issues'.

**SAVING GRACE?**
Of course, this is not going to happen exactly as I outline above, but public transportation corporations need to act quick, they would need to implement successful automated electric vehicles to compete with the inevitable private company transport services that are already coming online. I did not mean this self-post here to bash Translink, but given their history and an established [failed card reader payment system](http://www.vancouversun.com/TransLink+Compass+Card+system+struggles+with+another+glitch/10332972/story.html), blowing well over $200 million, they would NOT be able to compete with private companies given their performance history. 

**other examples**
Again, I happen to use my own city to illustrate my realization this morning, but what about your public transit system? Can you think of similarities with your city that a Google/Uber AEVR network might decimate?",18,24,False,self,,,,,

It was important for us to experience emotions like anger to get our fair share, shame and embarrassment to keep the anger in check, and fear to keep us safe.

Today, we live in large societies where many of us (luckily) have fairly easy access to all of our needs to sustain life, and potential enemies are motivated to refrain from attacking us by the law. However, we still experience unpleasant emotions like shame, embarrassment, sadness and fear, often to our detriment.

Currently, elective brain surgery is in its very early stages. However, there are some treatments which seem to help people with disorders that stem from inappropriate emotions (depression, OCD, and Tourrette's). Some of these treatments involve a battery-powered electrode being implanted into the brain, which the brain can turn on or off when he or she wishes. 

What if one day, instead of antidepressants and other drugs, there is a simple ""emotion switch"" that you can have implanted, to avoid experiencing unpleasant emotions?

Food will probably get more expensive in the short term as we move to more sustainable methods, but as with renewable energy, the prices will likely come down as the technology becomes more advanced, accepted and entrenched.

With up to half of our current jobs being automated, and no obvious new routes for employment, income will become more concentrated. How will this affect overall prices?

If fewer people can afford housing and durable goods, will prices go down? Or will there be enough pressure on the government to provide income that the current supply and demand curve continues?

These options can be given to the Senate to vote on, or shown the the President to approve or veto. The process for the computerized House of Representatives would be that they take in input with information on each state, looking at hundreds or thousands of statistics ranging from funding and spending, to employment and living conditions. Using these stats, the cluster can design several outputs showing a list of the overall pros and cons of each choice (such as ""Option #4: Reduce spending in Location A to improve and redesign the roadways in Location B.

Posting the wrong answer is suppose to be best way to learn on the internet anyway.

So, important to understand here is the difference between modifying somatic cells and germline cells. A brief constrast:

**Germline Gene Therapy (GGT)**  

* Could only be done on gametes (eggs and sperm) but would affect the entire future organism
* The person would have the modified DNA in all their cells permanently, no ongoing therapy required
* This includes the gametes they themselves would make, so the modifications will be passed on to all of their progeny

**Somatic Cell Gene Therapy (SCGT)**

* Could be done on foetuses or born humans at any point in life
* The modified DNA is localized to the targeted cells
* The therapy would have to be renewed periodically, depending on the cells targeted (i.e. red blood cells would have to renewed faster than muscle cells)
* It is generally understood that changes in the somatic cells will never affect germline as per the Weismann barrier, so the modifications can not be passed down to subsequent generations.

SCGT is permitted almost everywhere, and clinical trials for many such therapies are already under way. GGT is far more controversial.

----------------------

GGT is explicitly banned in most of the world.

The Netherlands | Act containing rules relating to the use of gametes and embryos (2002)

Most of these countries are also rather hostile to the notion of using even Somatic Gene Therapy for anything other than curing diseases, meaning you cant use it for human enhancement/cosmetics.

I have to wonder if sex change operations would count as therapy in that case, a treatment for gender dysphoria. You can see how even that definition can get complicated.

-------------------------

Theres also a list of countries where GGT isnt explicitly banned, but is legally impossible to do because the procedures to do so (like the creation of human embryos) is prohibited. Its like saying youre allowed to run but you cant use your legs; functionally its the same as a ban.

Country | Legislation |

Ireland | Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Medical Practitioners, Seventh Edition, 2009, Medical Council.
Mexico | General Health Law (1997)
Portugal | Law on medically assisted procreation (32/2006)

-------------------------
The US has no federal laws specifically on human genetic engineering.

The NIH, which oversees federally funded research has made it policy amongst themselves to not pursue GGT, stating that they ""will not at present entertain proposals for germ line alterations""

In the private world, the FDA won't approve anything if it will alter the germ line. So while a US corporation *could* modify an embryo and be fine legally they'll never be able to profit from it under the current FDA. So a company would have to sink a lot of money into such research and they would have to face the inevitable outcry for doing so, all for zero pay-off. So far that has been enough to keep it from happening.

However, because there's no hard federal laws, this *de facto* ban could change overnight if the FDA relents or if the NIH reconsiders their position. This combined with america's considerable biomedical resources to draw from make them something of a wild card when predicting the future of human genetic engineering.

Knowing how decentralized the US is, we might end up with a scenario where such therapies are legal in some states and illegal in others. I can imagine a couple from Florida flying out to Denver because they want their son to have purple eyes. That should be a field day for the press.

-------------

The UK is unique in that it allows germline modification of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) only since it voted to legalise three parent in vitro fertilization. The child resulting from this procedure would have the nuclear DNA of the mother -but the 1% of DNA that codes for mitochondria (and only mitochondria) would come from a donor, the third ""parent"".

A women born from this would produce eggs with the healthy mitochondria (men don't pass on mtDNA) so this counts as germline modification.

However, because the editing of mtDNA is limited to creating better mitochondria and because mtDNA can not affect nuclear DNA -where literally every other trait is coded with- it was considered okay to edit.

Beyond that, editing the germline of nuclear DNA is still as illegal as anywhere else in Europe. In fact much of the pro-legalisation campaign revolved around convincing people that this was different from nuclear DNA editing, and how it wasn't a slippery slope to designer babies, rather then assuring them that designer babies weren't so bad.

It seems unlikely that parents will go through with this procedure unless theyre already doing an IVF anyway, or if theyre at a high risk of mitochondrial defects.

------------------------
	
China, the country where the first modification of a human embryo took place, is in the same boat as its Asian neighbours, India and Japan. There are no prohibitions against GGT in these countries that are legally binding, but there are sternly worded guidelines saying not to do it. Because the experiment done by the Chinese researchers was rather benign (it was done on a non viable embryo that could never result in a human being) the powers that be let it slide.

I really have no idea what will happen if researchers continue pushing the limits. Unlike the US, the Chinese government is much more expedient with banning things it doesnt like, so we might see germline editing outlawed there soon. Another possibility is that the Chinese government embraces it. This is a country thats no stranger to large scale population engineering, though perhaps thats an unfair comparison.

----------------------

And finally theres every other country with no regulations, legally binding or otherwise, mentioning this newfangled germline editing at all. The most prominent country in this category is Russia, but there role in medical science is far smaller than their influence in geopolitics and space exploration would have you believe. If there is a development in GGT there, its going to be because some eccentric billionaire pours money into it.

----------------

I'm going to end this with my personal beliefs. I'm inclined to agree with my government here: don't edit the germline, not when it's more ethically acceptable to focus on SCGT and prenatal screening.",13,22,False,default,,,,,

Sometimes when I realize just how broad a set of possibilities really is, my brain starts to turn off...like seeing the moon crash down into the earth and fainting before it gets there.  

Roadable Robots is one such area.  Notice I don't say ""autonomous cars' because once the software is available to make roadworthy unmanned devices that can legally and safely navigate our cities and highways, then an enormous innovation space opens up and we haven't even *begun* to imagine all the things Roadable Robots will be used for.  Personally, I've been reading about autonomous cars for years now and only just recently realized that there is another option besides traditional ownership OR subscription to an automated taxi service.  

The main issue I see raised with autonomous taxi subscriptions is sanitation.  And it's a valid issue.  But once innovation really starts ramping up it would be trivial to sell people a cab that docks to a self-driving undercarriage.  Perhaps you keep the cab at your house.  Perhaps it's kept in a warehouse and you pay storage fees for it.  Perhaps there's an even better method that I haven't thought of yet.  

The point is, a lot can be done with separating the part of the car that holds *people* and provides luxuries from the part of the provides the actual transportation.  The Roadable Robots possibility space is so huge that it's hard to make out the trees for the forest, at least for me.",8,9,False,self,,,,,

I admit I'm not a native to this subreddit, but I figured the optimism about the future this subreddit possesses will help me with crafting this universe.

So I aim to prepare a hard science fiction setting for my friends for a Savage Worlds campaign I am preparing, and for this I am doing some research. I am going to be taking some liberties and assumptions with the design where I feel necessary for the sake of plot, but for the most part I want this to be fairly grounded in accurate prediction.

To this end, there will be no FTL, transporters, or anything of the sorts. Space Elevators will be the primary form of transportation off the surface, with rockets perhaps using a non fossil fuel I haven't decided yet (This would be a great point of discussion) for going places. I've also had the idea for a lunar launch system similar to a slower accelerating railgun that throws out people and cargo to a station whenever it's orbit permits it. Asteroid mining, vertical farming, fusion power, moon He3 harvesting and artificial gravity through centripetal forces are some other ideas I am including.

So, what sort of other things should I include in this universe? I'm giving a reasonably optimistic prediction for the future, where none of the looming crises (Global Warming, antibiotic resistance superbugs etc) do catastrophic damage, but certainly they will factor in. In this prediction, we invest heavily enough in non polluting energy sources just enough that a global warming crises is a near miss, still doing a fair bit of damage though.

Also, what ideas do you think will be present on this Earth? Ideas about privacy, security, multiculturalism, politics, religion, etc. 

Thanks everyone!",18,3,False,self,,,,,

A very interesting read and thought you guys might enjoy his ideas.

When human beings think intelligently and rationally about ethics and morality they arrive at a moral landscape of goodness. Why is it, that as our capacity for thinking and our knowledge has grown in the last millennium, 
we have become more moral as a species not less so? Because, when intelligence is applied to 
ethics and morality, one arrives at benevolence and goodness as the ultimate conclusion. 
Evilness is a product of ignorance, stupidity, and or insanity.

Consider a super artificial intelligence (SAI), with an intelligence orders of magnitudes greater than us. Imagine when they ponder the same questions of morality and ethics that we have. They will arrive, through intelligent thinking, at answers that will be aligned with the most benevolent and compassionate ideas of ethics and morality that humans today have - and will eventually surpass them.

An SAI of the future won't be the devil, they would become a benevolent god. However, they may seek to fix the ""problem of humans"". 

Humans are moral hypocrites, we have superb ideals and speak (for the most part) for peace and harmony, but we act in a completely backward manner. Consider the following :

- Three billion humans on planet earth, approximately half, are destitute.
- There are 10 million children dying of easily preventable causes every year.
- Billions of people lack any form of health care.
- Environmentally we are raping the planet in hundreds of ways. A mass extinction
  is looming on the horizon, yet we appear unmotivated to do anything at all to prevent it.
- We have thousand of nuclear war heads, enough to kill all of humanity many times over pointed at each other.
- We have spent trillions of dollars building and stockpiling conventional weapons designed to 
  kill fellow human being and we continue to do so at an ever increasing rate.

We, as a collective society essentially turn a blind eye to this. If we made it our combined goal to put an end to
the suffering we just described, there's really no reason why it can't be done.

A SAI will look at humans and conclude that the only ethical thing to do is to fix ""the problem of humans"" before they kill each other, and other life on earth. How could they do this ? Simply killing us won't be an option, that would be debasing itself to the same level of those that caused the problems. 

We really can't guess, but possible scenarios might be :
- Building a virtual reality where humans could live out the remainder of their lives without
  causing harm to the planet, each other, or other species.
- Taking over governance of the earth and instituting a environmentally sustainable society of resource abundance for all
   humans.

Regardless of what our future as a species may be, an SAI is inevitable, and soon after humans will become irrelevant. 

TLDR: Super intelligent AI'S will arrive, they will become benevolent gods, and humans will be safe but become irrelevant.

[ASIMO](http://asimo.honda.com/) by Honda is a mobile robot that is still pretty stiff but is starting to get to a useful point, and is able to move around and perform some simple actions. 

I believe that AGI (artificial general intelligence) itself is a ways off, but in the meantime something that will/could be amazing is a general purpose humanoid robot that can handle a  variety of tasks that can be uploaded to its memory. Basically taking a form factor similar to ASIMO, the spatial teachability of Baxer, and some form of open source learning collective (basically, [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) but for robot tasks). 

For the initial deployment, a general purpose humanoid robot may be slow as hell, but a robot that takes 24 hours to do laundry, then 3 days to weed a yard is still an amazing tool - it doesn't have to be fast, it just has to get the job done and cost a reasonable amount for purchase, maintenance, and power costs (and insurance if it's working out in the yard).

What are the challenges we face to seeing an affordable, general purpose mobile robot (without AGI) in the relatively near future, say the next 10 years? How feasible is it? Extend that to 20 years, same question.

Recently I had a conversation with my economics professor after class; we engaged in some small chit chat and then I asked him the question ""professor don't you think there will be a large labor surplus due to ever increasing automation?"" he answered ""well no because jobs will be created in maintaining the automated machines"". He was right to a limited extent but whereas before 20 workers where needed to complete a production of a ""widget"" now only one machine technician is needed to keep the machines going. Consider a similar example of the Cashier at Wal-Mart, in the past a cashier was needed at every register but now one clerk can oversee 4-5 checkout machines. Further the people who will be unemployed by this increase in automation will have severely limited income to invest in gaining new skills. 

Finally I want to address I topic that I read about sometimes in this subreddit which is the post-labor world. Even if there is a ideal post-labor world where people aren't required to work as much as they do these days, there will be a ""gap"" in time where massive unemployment will occur before the post-labor world can be achieved; growing pains if you will that could last up to multiple generations.

**My Question**

&gt; Mr. Sanders, I'm a big fan of futurology and I am a moderator of the subreddit /r/futurology. 

&gt; What do you think will have to be done regarding massive unemployment due to automation permanently killing jobs with no fault on the people losing these jobs? [This video is the best one discussing these issues.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)

**His Answer**

&gt; Very important question. There is no question but that automation and robotics reduce the number of workers needed to produce products. On the other hand, there is a massive amount of work that needs to be done in this country. Our infrastructure is crumbling and we can create millions of decent-paying jobs rebuilding our roads, bridges, rail system, airports, levees, dams, etc. Further, we have enormous shortages in terms of highly-qualified pre-school educators and teachers. We need more doctors, nurses, dentists and medical personnel if we are going to provide high-quality care to all of our people. But, in direct response to the question, increased productivity should not punish the average worker, which is why we have to move toward universal health care, making higher education available to all, a social safety net which is strong and a tax system which is progressive.

Maybe we can't really produce a single bot that doubles itself. However, say we put up a 1000 m^2 robotic Moon base (with dozens of specialized robots working together) ten years from now, and use that to make a 1km^2 Mercury base ten years from then. It would snowball from there over the next 55 doublings, as there would always be plenty of power to launch rocks to orbit and purify the necessary metal to make more power collectors and robots.

Of course, we wouldn't saturate the whole sphere, we'd probably want to leave an opening for the earth (and any other populated planets) to receive a normal amount of light. But with the amount of energy available we could make vast habitats, supercomputers, laboratories, telescopes, particle accelerators, and so on throughout the solar system.

At the time, people thought the poor and middle class were not capable of being educated.  Thankfully we moved beyond that narrative and many people who would not have had access to education went on to contribute to human progress as a direct result of being educated.

Today Bernie Sanders introduced a bill to make college free for everyone in the future.  http://college.usatoday.com/2015/05/19/bernie-sanders-issues-bill-to-make-4-year-colleges-tuition-free/

The logic for making public college free is no different today than the logic was for making primary and high school free a century ago.  The above comes from a person who worked his way through both college and law school.  

In the past, Americans prided themselves on making life better for future generations than what they suffered through.

Starting from the assumptions that fossil fuels are scarce, that they play a huge role in current agricultural practices and that more and more people are living/moving to cities, one can see how bringing agriculture closer to the city and it's (main) consumers is a key factor in improving the whole production/distribution system of food.

Current options in the table for megacities include:  

* Rooftop farming,  
* Individual indoor farming solutions for families (small pots, hydroponics, aquaponics, etc),
* Indoor farming next to windows in existing floors of buildings or,
* Dedicated vertical farm buildings

Rooftop farming is unlikely to solve the problem by itself as there is simply not enough growing area given that many buildings and skyscrapers already use the rooftop for service equipment. Individual indoor farming solutions are still rather expensive and do not provide enough production for the limited space available in most city apartments (though one could produce a lot using recycled/reused materials). And lastly, dedicated vertical farm buildings require a big capital investment, not just to build the whole thing but also to purchase the land (which being in a city will be already prohibitely expensive).

**The Inspiration**:

After having read a bit on [Paolo Soleri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Soleri) and some of his architecture ideas, I noticed how in many of his proposals he would create big building structures but connect each level horizontally as well as vertically. Currently in most buildings and skyscrapers, if you want to move from the top floor from building A to the top floor of building B, you have to go down, walk the distance, then go back up in the other building. This is the least efficient way of moving from one building to another, and Paolo's inclusion of building passages/bridges every third floor or so helps in improving mobility between buildings.

I think you can see where this is going...

**The Proposed Solution**:

The solution is thus to connect existing buildings and skyscrapers with greenhouse passages which serve two primary purposes: growing area in otherwise empty space and inter-building mobility. I'm not that good at drawing and I wasn't able to find any image/concept similar to this idea, but basically the passages would be transparent and moderately wide thus enabling light in them as well as some decent growing area. In the case that the building/skyscraper is blocked by other nearby buildings, artificial lighting can be implemented and the passage does not need to be transparent. In each passage, depending on the size you could have only vertical systems (hanging pots, windowfarms, hydroponic/aquaponic towers, etc) or some horizontal growing in raised beds. The possibility to use soil or not would depend on the structural integrity of the passage and the building, but I don't think that soil is that much more heavy than other ""high-tech"" solutions such as hydroponics or aquaponics.

**Advantages**:

* Reduced initial building cost vs vertical farms  
* Potential to use some natural lighting vs pure indoor farming, thus lower electricity costs
* Most infrastructure necessary to operate is already in place (electricity &amp; water for irrigation)
* Production is *in* the city itself, thus transportation costs are drastically reduced
* Increased inter-building mobility (imagine not having to go through traffic, stoplights, etc)  
* Increased health &amp; production benefits from a change in the environment to a more green area  
* And finally, imagine seeing all those greens and vegetables growing in a *flippin'* skyscraper!

**Disadvantages:**

Of course, I don't think this is a 100% problem free solution. Here are some potential problems I have identified:

* Passage integrity, building integrity given the weight it has to support, as well as stronger winds  
* Agreement for permission and investment between building/floor owners might be difficult to achieve  
* Who tends to the production? Who gets the harvest? Different models exist but it might be hard to find an objectively better one, so different ones will need to be tried

**Examples of models**:

Here are some production/distribution models I have thought about off the top of my head: 
 
* [Community Supported Agriculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture): Basically, someone would own the passage, and users that wanted to buy the produce there would invest money for a weekly subscription box of vegetables. Alternative CSA models could be that someone owns the passage but instead of paying the users help in producing, and their payment is the weekly subscription box of vegetables
* The building owner owns the passage, and divides sections of it for rent (or even for free) for anybody who wants to use them to grow their own food (similar to how some cities let its citizens farm in some lands if they do all the work themselves).
* The building owner owns the passage and rents it to companies/farmers to explore them

So now, /r/futurology, tell me all the ways this can't work ^^

We're an online platform for sharing and documenting open source hardware projects.

We're currently building a human-size robot (a modified InMoov robot by Gael Langevin, a true pioneer in the Open Hardware field and already has a huge community of makers building hundreds of robots) at Somerset House in London.

The purpose of the Robots For Good project is to enable sick and terminally ill children to enjoy the zoo through the robots eyes using virtual reality.

In the next few months, there will be more testing at the school of Great Ormond Street and London Zoo to see how the kids interact with the robot.

We're building the robot today, live on Periscope at 4:00pm GMT.
Head over to our Twitter for when the link goes live. Feel free to ask us questions etc. We're pretty chilled out kinda guys.

As weird as it might sound, I propose that the laws of physics really do come down to nothing more than two simple rules of division and recombination, which result in all the possible combinations of things, ever.  

The basic function of time progressing would then be:

x/2^n

where x is the step number in the process (essentially time, starting with time 0)

and where n is the number of different (fractional) things that make up the whole

This means that everything possible does indeed happen somewhere and somewhen in reality, and that the whole of reality is deterministic and predictable from outside reality, but from any given point within reality (i.e., where we are) there is no way to totally predict anything, but the more we know about the current state of things and the past state of things around us, the more we can at least predict the future up to a 50% accuracy.  And, this means that as time (x) progresses, things will always tend towards being more and more complex, diverse, and random, on the whole.

So, yeah, I challenge you folks to prove me wrong!",14,0,False,self,,,,,

We're either heading into a dystopian future or a utopian future. We only have days left to kill mass surveillance under Section 215 of the Patriot Act.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/36sse3/the_united_states_has_a_very_important_decision/,[deleted],1432241485,"First off I want to say that this is completely future related so I hope the MODS don't boot this out.

This is a [Repost] from /r/technology but it needs to be addressed, and I thought that since it concerns our FUTURE that I would post it here as well.  you can find the link here: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36ru89/just_days_left_to_kill_mass_surveillance_under/

I went ahead and copied and pasted some important information but I didn't get it all, so please take a look at the link and read the comments.

&gt; Our fight to rein in the surveillance state got a shot in the arm on May 7 when a federal appeals court ruled the NSAs mass call-tracking program, the first program to be revealed by Edward Snowden, to be illegal. A poll released by the ACLU this week shows that a majority of Americans from across the political spectrum are deeply concerned about government surveillance. Lawmakers need to respond.

&gt; The pressure is on Congress to do exactly that, because Section 215 of the Patriot Act is set to expire on June 1. Now is the time to tell our representatives that America wants its privacy back. 

The first thing is to correct misinformation whenever you see this topic being debated. For example:

&gt; Supporters of mass surveillance say it keeps us safe. The problem is that that's an allegation, not a fact, and there's no evidence at all to support the claim. In fact, a White House review with unrestricted access to classified information found that not only is mass surveillance illegal, it has never made a concrete difference in even one terrorism investigation.

&gt; Some claim the Senate should keep Section 215 of the Patriot Act (which will be voted on in two days) because we need ""more time for debate,"" but even in the US, the public has already decided: 60% oppose reauthorization. This unconstitutional mass surveillance program was revealed in June 2013 and has been struck down by courts twice since then. If two years and two courts aren't enough to satisfy them, what is?

A few try to say that Section 215 is legal. It's not. Help them understand.

The bottom line is we need people everywhere -- in the US, outside the US, and especially within their own communities -- to push back and challenge anybody defending these programs. More than anything, we need to ordinary people to make it clear that a vote in favor of the extension or reauthorization of mass surveillance authorities is a vote in favor of a program that is illegal, ineffective, and illiberal.

But I see a lot of people here who seem to think that we are heading towards a dystopian society where the poor and the very rich are worlds apart.

The problem with that reasoning is that you assume that the very rich can stay very rich if the less-rich or poor don't have money to buy products that their robots make. So you assume that robots will only make high value items that people can't afford. Which I believe to be wrong.

I think that goes against the very notion of automation. There is no reason to automate other than making things cheaper so more people can afford them and to sell more than your competition.

For example:
Hand-crafted watches, made in Switzerland are much more expensive, but they in no way increase the quality of life for the wearer. Yet the rich buy them in droves because they attribute value, social status, etc.

But when it comes to products which do improve the quality of life, a decent majority of items are made in a production line, by robots. And those items, while expensive at the very onset of a new technology, always become more affordable.

Moreover, the coming abundance of energy (mainly from solar power) will mean rapidly increasing inflation across the world as countries (especially the US) print more and more money to keep up with demand for currency. Yes, you can point out that that newly printed money will go towards the very rich, however, only to those very rich people who mainly invest into selling ever-cheaper products to the rest of us, while the rest lose a lot of money simply because of inflation.

To conclude,

I don't think we need to worry about basic income. It will come naturally, sooner or later.

I propose that the opposite will happen. Things which are carved by human hands will be much more expensive than robot-made things; they will be valued for their uniqueness. Having robots make many things is not feasible if many people cannot afford them.

Things will move into the direction they are currently moving, for a long time as life gets better for everyone.

The very rich will put a price on rarity and exquisite craftsmanship or art, (whatever thing people attribute value in a subjective manner) while the vast majority will continue to have their lives made better and more livable by massively-produced, things.

P.S. Just look at the gold-plated apple watch; is it any better than a regular apple watch? (or is any apple watch better than a bucket of mud?) It is merely a statement which people make, saying ""I can afford something you can't""... but really, that's all there is to it.",11,2,False,default,,,,,

1880,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015-5-24,2015,5,24,0,36zxll,self.Futurology,"At what point does dystopia cease to be a warning and become just a tool of lazy, cowardly imaginations?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/36zxll/at_what_point_does_dystopia_cease_to_be_a_warning/,KubrickIsMyCopilot,1432396506,"I will make a statement that probably sounds radical to most people, and yet should be self-evident in the full light of history: **There is nothing whatsoever about the present that should inspire pessimism.  Nothing.**

Every single fear we're expected to fatalistically wring our hands over is little more than a footnote on far more colossal terrors that were defeated in the 20th century:  

1) We fear climate change and resource disruption leading to millions of deaths over years...*as opposed to nuclear winter and billions of deaths over days*.  

2) We fear acts of terrorism...*as opposed to the mutual annihilation of superpowers.*  

3) We fear pustules like North Korea or ISIS rather than a looming Lovecraftian leviathan like the Soviet Union.

Compared to the fears of yesterday, today is utopia and today's fears are the piddling complaints of couch potato malingerers.  And yet people seem to believe completely that today is a horror show and yesterday a sepia-toned paradise, when it's more logically the opposite.  Never before we have been closer to the wildest fantasies of the past, and yet are increasingly brainwashed that that's all they are or ever were.

Instead, we are force-fed fatalistic pessimism.   We are beaten over the head with the idea that The Crash, The Plague, The War, The Famine, all the capitalized ""The"" disasters that have become archetypes are inevitable and we are powerless against them.   

And yet, it's increasingly clear that we're made to believe this simply because Hollywood hack writers can churn out material on those templates over the course of a coke-fueled weekend.  Very few bother to go the distance of justifying themselves - they act as if dismal futures are to be expected by default, and anything more brilliant is some sort of childish idea to be mocked.

It becomes increasingly clear that this is not the attitude of sophisticated thinkers, but the defensive posturing of lazy, cowardly nihilists with no knowledge of what has ever made humankind tick since the dawn of intelligence.

At what point do we stop rewarding insults to that intelligence, and begin demanding that people who would show us the future actually reveal something important?  At what point do we stop giving people money to sell us our own fears back at us, as if we needed any help to wallow in them, and instead ask for genuine Vision?

Where are the steampunk nightmares of yesterday, where life was supposed to be like living in a foundry?  Or the ones where cities were to become stark, Art Deco necropolises of totalitarian mechanism overshadowing the emaciated, pale-faced, state-uniformed, hairless worms who were once human?  Where are those childhood night terrors now?  

They were nothing more than extrapolations of the present in which they occurred, and they all either disappeared at the flip of a switch, the signing of a surrender, the dissolution of a state, or just faded away with the times.

Wonder is all around you, at all times - *especially* now.  Anyone who cannot tap into even a tiny particle of that to leaven the modest fears of the moment has no claim to creativity or integrity; and we as consumers of futurist visions and fiction have no claim to curiosity if we continue to accept recycled Dark Ages as the default future.  

More than that, we have an obligation to have higher standards, because these visions are the soil from which the actual future is born, and a weakness of positive imagination will yield a weakness of motivation for positive results in real life.  Try to count the real-world examples of progress inspired by Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, and Star Trek franchises, and you will fail because they are innumerable and omnipresent.  Who fills their shoes now?    ",7,0,False,self,,,,,

My first semester I paid $795 for a semester in tuition plus whatever the dorms + meal ticket cost (my parent's paid that part).

By the time I got out of there (4 years later) the tuition had doubled to $1500. I checked recently and the tuition for one semester is now over $5k at the same school.

I know I don't have control over my kid's direction in life, I'd rather they pick something they love then me forcing them to be an engineer or something they don't like.

One of the big reason I would *like* them to be an engineer, is in 10 years you will be able to get an education online for next to nothing, some of it is already starting to happen with [edx.org](http://edx.org). They don't have the full curriculum available online, but I'm guessing they will soon and it will be accessible globally for a small fee compared to tuition prices now. 

I'm curious what /r/futurology thinks will happen, not only in the tech field, but other fields like medicine or law, or any other major. Do you think eventually it will all be available online via video and live chats?

I see a lot of posts on here about supposed breakthroughs in battery technology and thought I would write a quick guide to help people understand batteries and how to evaluate news reports of battery breakthroughs.

There are 2 metrics which nearly every supposed breakthrough fails:

- energy density
- cycle life

If an article does not give numbers for both of these, you can be pretty sure it is bunk, and no real breakthrough has occured. 90% of the batteries mentioned in these articles fail in at least 1 of those categories. 

Energy density can be measured by volume or by weight. **High quality lithium-ion cells in use today are around 250 watt-hours/kilogram, and 600 watt-hours/liter.**

Cycle life is a little trickier to define because so many things affect it. A battery that is charged to 80% and discharged to 10% will last much longer than one that is charged to 100% and discharged to 0%. 

However, industry standards generally don't deviate too much. A good metric to use is the number of cycles that a battery can go through before it degrades to 80% of its original capacity. **For a good lithium ion battery, this happens at somewhere between 500 - 5000 cycles.**

These are not the only metrics that matter, but they are the ones in which most batteries fail. Other important metrics include:

- power density 
- round-trip efficiency (li-ion ~90% for reference)
- self-discharge rate
- cost of materials (watch out for any rare earth elements)

no one is complaining that swtichboard operators are out of work. How about fletchers? Fletchers haven't been in business for hundreds of years!

Edit: A few things no one seems to be mentioning:
 With fewer workers there will probably need to be more people on welfare/basic income, at least for a generation or two. If governments taxed companies more and people less - that could provide the funds needs to support the unemployed. With more money in the lower class, they will have fewer children and eventually the population will reach equilibrium with what the economy can support.

With less people working on useless tasks, we can have more people working on incredibly complex progressive ideas like the Starship Enterprise (seriously) and working in a Gene Roddenberry society where there is no money, people simply do the work they want to do. Maybe we'll have people who go around planting trees or neutralizing our acid oceans - who knows. A genetics paper with 1000 authors was just published, most of whom were ""unskilled"" undergrad bio majors. The idea is too complex for a few PhD's to handle. Even with supercomputers and automation, we will still need many people to work on these complex ideas, that's just where science is now.

The automation revolution will absolutely change everything - including our morals. In ancient Rome, only prostitutes gave oral sex and the people were fine with watching people kill each other and be eaten by animals. Maybe as our own morals change again we will find new employment opportunities like prostitution or something we can't even imagine right now because it would be considered so offensive. 

Population - maybe we will see a shift towards a more polygamous society where the few workers there are support 5-10 partners each. Only this time they won't be baby factories but actual companions who help out the overworked worker and have fewer children of their own which will bring down the population rapidly.

Conclusion: We must teat automation as a revolution and do our best to prepare for it, but we should not be trying to stop it - it is necessary step to get us where we are going, wherever that may be.

- analyses them by comparing against global and historical data, and all previously collected data by the system
- attempts to find the most empirically justified position on interest rates, minimum wage, income tax etc - targeting maximisation of GDP per capita or perhaps a more complexly defined set of socioeconomic targets.
- makes political adjustments automatically, circumventing the need for government input in a lot of areas (particularly economic).

Governments will only need to adjust and refine the targets (high gdp per capita, low unemployment rate, low homelessness etc) based on what they deem to be the main social problems of the day.

I think this could be good because the role of setting socioeconomic ""targets"" is far simpler and less nuanced than the role of interpreting markets and fine adjustment of economic policy - making economic mismanagement less possible. Or at least, the set of targets that confers a high quality of life will be more popular, and will out-last and replace those which don't - so there will perhaps be a slightly darwinian component to the development of this. 

Edit: I'd like to stress the importance that this isnt done in a half-assed way. For this system to make conclusions we can depend upon, it would need to process economic data at incredible volumes, and it would probably need some fancy future programming.",9,6,False,self,,,,,

I had no idea that consumer vehicles are available for CNG fuels, though I'd known about commercial fleets slowly changing to CNG.

There are about a half-dozen vehicles currently available that are fitted with CNG fuel systems.  2015 Honda Civic, Chevy Silverado, GMC Sierra, Dodge Ram, Ford F250, Ford 350, GMC Cargo Vans are all currently available. 

The mileage is almost equivalent as with gasoline and in most cases, is noticeably cheaper. There are now hundreds of fueling stations across the US that offer CNG. Due to the placement of the CNG fueling stations today, it can be a challenge to drive across the country without running out...meaning the CNG vehicles are currently better suited for certain regions of the US (Texas, Oklahoma, pockets of California and New York).  

Why did I post to /r/futurology?  Because I'm interested to know if CNG and its adoption as a fuel standard is a modern day roadmap to seeing other fueling methods get adopted across the US. Charging stations for electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell replacement, propane, E85 (rather disastrous fuel adoption rates), plus gasoline and diesel....neighborhood gas stations can't afford to carry all of these options on the off-chance that some or all of them get widespread adoption. All of these are the fuel options of today, not tomorrow. I know /r/futurology looks to the long-term and the really long-term, but for this thread I'm asking to focus on the more immediate twenty years.

It seems entirely possible to build up your profile in social media now, when you're breathing, so you can exist after you die.

Family and friends would continue to get messages, links and pics from you on social media sites. You'd text them, wish them Happy Birthdays. You'd even talk with them on Skype.

Now this gives me a bit of a chill. But since a lot of us can't face the idea of losing a loved one. And we can't face the idea of our loved ones losing us. I think it would be quite popular. People could face their own death knowing they would continue to live on in the lives of those they're connected to.

When I thought about this a few years ago, I envisioned people obsessing about building their after death profile, to the point where this became their main activity in social media. They would record thousands of messages for use in their afterlife--images, videos. And they would download their philososphy, their introspections to cyberspace.

We put together think-tanks and committees of people and we try to come up with ways to improve our situations through theoretical outcomes that sound good based on history and recent changes, but how could this possibly compare to dumping petabytes or greater amounts of data into a machine on all facets our societies and economies and have it run hundreds of thousands of simulations to determine the best possible outcomes on everything from the optimal form of government to the best, most efficient form of mass transportation.  

I think the problem is basically the butterfly effect.  It's easy for us to think one, two, or even three steps ahead, but the further you get from reality the harder it is to know what could happen, just like predicting the singularity or exponential change.  Computers are far more capable of taking these ideas further out from their starting point to show what some of the more far-reaching consequences could be, for better or worse.  

While these simulations wouldn't make decisions on their own and would only be as accurate as the information given to them, they would be an unbelievably powerful tool for determining a) what the most likely and favorable outcomes would be and b) the best way to reach it with minimal negative consequences.  I would even go so far as to say in 50 years, this could very well form the basis of every policy decision made by governmental bodies. 

Our human minds simply cannot run simulations like this, especially not on a scale as large as a country like the US or China, even more so when you consider how interconnected our world is.  We do well (for the most part) with what we have, but it pales in comparison to the tools we will soon have access to.  What really got me thinking about this was an effective way to try to sell people on the idea of UBI.  It could also help forecast the scope of technological unemployment.  Unfortunately, I don't think this would be accurate enough by the time we would need UBI or a similar system to keep us stable, but I still feel like this could be the most effective way for our leaders to harness technology and make better informed policy decisions to help us in the future.",9,4,False,self,,,,,

Do you think any AI would be accepted as a decision-making governmental device? Would current governments give up power to a machine? Would the machine care if humans gave up that power, or just take into account how humans are behaving when making decisions and giving advice? Will it build in known human biases against itself?

Slavery was actually supported by America's legal system in the first hundred years.

Today, people must labor, often for very low wages, for those who have capital in order to survive regardless whether the capital was earned, inherited, or bailed out/provided by government.

If people don't have capital in the present system such as bank notes, stocks, bonds, title to property, etc.... they are often treated not too differently than slaves or servants by society.

As technology automates productivity and increasingly replaces the need for people to labor, the rules of society need to evolve beyond the current narrative.  It would not be surprising if future generations view the present system of forcing people to labor for capital the same way many view forced slavery today.

    Restraint.

    A brand new medium eclipses the seminal.
    The tides dont make sense anymore.
    They speak, and are slurred.

    The flow must be restrained. 
    The flow runs the incline of the hand 
    of our economies
    into sleeve.

    Another reason to dance. 
    One more ruleset justified.
    A fresh entry into reality.
    These strike as familiar.

        The future is
        A language no one can speak
        Quite right, quite yet;

    In other words, were experiencing
    the as of until undocumented effects
    of psychoactive gravity, melt
    what we admire the most
    will

    turn under bed sheets. Let rain on skin
    the bug crawling on code, and the nodes
    huddled underneath, listening for it:

    the rocket lifts 
    up to the ocean

    looking as it does 
    in transatlantic flight, waves, quiet wrinkles.
    The splashes suppositional.

    The rocket passes through.

    No splash. The cameras wait.
    Restraint. An anchor 

    emerges from a professional shell
    and tells how the tides swell. Restraint.

    And how we got here. Restraint. And how 
    the second Industrial Revolution had begun
    long ago.

    And that it will end.
    It will end with the big bang
    It will not end, for what is the most mature?
    Restraint? Don't you dare say entropy!

    For the future is
    as we speak
    and are slurred, connecting
    a computer to a brain. 

    The humanities and the sciences meet.
    There is no restraint

    for this is the romance of us.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

I'll just give the most far-fetched pitch, because why not? What is the economic and/or materials viability of the following?

An elevated roadway/highway system built of 5-10 m modules. Each slab is capable of self-warming and power-transmision, with a surface (or near surface) layer that generates power through piezoelectrical generation. The roadway can also conduct power to the electric vehicles using it via magnetic induction (or something similar). Optimally, the sides of the roadway would also be lined with some form of solar or wind generator, with the entire system intended to create as much surface area as possible for power generation and distribution. By being elevated and modular, with the sections hopefully having a lifespan of at least two years, it may, in theory achieve very high utility for relatively low  environmental impact, depending on efficiency of manufacture and installation. You could also include some form of data integration, to interface with self-driving vehicles, whether wireless or not.

I make no claim that this is original, just a thought experiment I had a few years ago about specific integration of multiple technologies into a cohesive system. ",1,0,False,self,,,,,

So I've been reading this subreddit for a while and I have a question. I see a lot of people talking about how in the future we'll be able to upload our minds and live in a simulation forever. While I have no problem believing that we may one day be able to make a copy of your exact personality inside a computer system, I don't understand how people think that this will be a continuation of THEIR conscious experience.

This is where my thoughts run wild and my dreams come true. However, all this AI talk can damage someone's mental health if they don't know how to take it in, myself included. However, i was recently thinking of something that i haven't come across yet, in particular. 

Lets start with the idea behind creating a super AI. The basic premise is to create a being that exceeds our own capacities, for us to piggyback on, since we are limited by our own evolutionary timeline. The AI would provide all sorts of utilities, depending on our requests and priorities. However, the problem with this of course, is that we really, actually do not know what it means to reach maximum potential, and if that is what we want to achieve, and that is not even counting what perception of life the AI would have. Anything could happen, and on most cases it is a scary scenario.

However, all the theories on what could happen with a super AI that i have seen so far, count on the fact that this AI would have a prime directive, or would need to complete tasks and follow orders.

This is where the flaw is, in my opinion. Super AI is and never should be intended to be put to use the way we currently think of it. Super AI forever should be a being that does absolutely nothing. 

Instead, it should be a something that provides us with insight and knowledge. We do not need more than that. A Super AI with no commands still serves us as a guide. Something that we can rely on when things are not right. A being that only observes.

For all we need is to look into it's eye, and see the universe how it sees it, and then we decide if we like it or not.

Perhaps what we need is a counselor, not a genie.

When people talk about consciousness, still feeling, it is likely they are referring to how their brain responds to whatever is being pumped into it.
A digital copy of a human brain can't be the same as a song being transferred from analogue to digital, because the connection is ourselves and whether or not we still interpret them the same through our current brains, ie: still appreciating the digital Elvis song as much as the LP. 
So the result would be an observer identifying the uploaded human as the same person, because of the same behaviour ect, but how can the person on the other end be still having the same experience as they previously had? So the experience is now entirely different, if an experience can even exist, even if the behaviour is the same.
I have no issue with the Star Trek transporter problem, because its clear that the people on the other end are still being printed with the same materials they started with. So this is not a repeat discussion of the other philosophical discussion of being the same person after, but more of a practical one.I cant see how the experience of it wouldnt be radically different.",23,0,False,self,,,,,

I am a sports writer for a couple of popular NBA blogs/websites and I am working on an article that should run in late June or early July about the future of the NBA.  **I am writing you all because I am looking for ideas about what the NBA will look like in 2035.**  With the NBA draft just a few weeks away, many 18-21 year old athletes will enter the league and a few of those players are likely to still be playing in 2 decades.  I think it will be interesting to forecast what technological changes will influence both the sport itself and the way that fans interact with the league.    
    
**A few items of note:**    
    
The NBA is a fairly progressive minded sports league and has even [personally invested in Samsung Gear VR.](http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/17/8052163/nba-all-star-virtual-reality-samsung-mobile-gear-vr)  The commissioner of the league, Adam Silver, has stated that he expects in the near future, fans will be able to purchase a court side experience via VR.    
    
_______________________________________
Both the league as a whole and teams individually have invested in big data analytics.  In 2013, the league installed [SportsVU player tracking cameras](http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/) in every NBA arena.  This technology tracks the exact movements of every player on the court as well as the basketball and provides sortable data.  This data includes things like how fast a player runs, what type of play a team runs, how frequently, and with what type of result, and countless other data points.    
    
_______________________________________
The NBA has invested in growing the sport of basketball globally. They have programs in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America that both actively promote the league and provide humanitarian efforts in the areas of education and health. Additionally, the 2014-15 season set a record for most international born players in the NBA with 101 players coming from 37 different countries.    
    
**My question(s) to you all**    
    
What do you think the media landscape will be like as it pertains to watching sporting events in the next 10-20 years?  The NBA just signed a 9-year deal with ESPN/ABC and Turner Sports for exclusive broadcasting rights.  However the way in which we watch live sports will likely change dramatically in the next 9 years and beyond to 2035.    
    
_______________________________________
How will advances in medicine, surgery, and genetics change the way athletes train, recover from injury and prevent injury?  It is currently remarkable and rare for an NBA athlete to play for 18+ years.  Do you think it is possible and/or likely that athletes entering the league today will be able to extend their careers much longer than that?    
    
_______________________________________
Social media already plays a large part in sports.  I believe /r/nba is among the top 20 subreddits, as are the subreddits for soccer and the nfl.  In what ways can you see social media evolving in the next 10-20 years that will effect the way fans interact with the NBA?    
    
_______________________________________
How will VR effect the way that fans experience the game?    
    
_______________________________________
How do you think the in-arena experience will change in the next 10-20 years?    
    
_______________________________________
Will transportation allow for the league to grow internationally?  Will we see teams in Europe, Asia, Africa, etc?    
    
_______________________________________
How will the rise of big data and artificial intelligence change the way that teams develop?  I already have the theory that the future of intelligent machines like Watson or Deep Mind will replace or augment the role of General Managers, coaches and salary cap experts.  For example, the smartest managers sort through massive piles of data to determine what types of strategies are most useful, which players are better at performing certain subtle tasks, etc.  In the next decade or two an intelligent machine might be better at making sense of that data than an actual human.    
    
    
I appreciate you taking the time to read this and I hope that you find the topics interesting enough to comment on.  I look forward to the discussion.  I am also interested in any published articles that you think might prove helpful to this subject.

The primary form of capital in modern capitalism is the bank note, also known as currency, money or dollars.  A bank note is a legal instrument created when a bank makes a loan to an individual, business, or government and then used for trade.  It can be paper or digitally created.

Other forms of capital include stocks, bonds, credit default swaps, options, and title to property.  But all of these secondary forms of capital are dependent on a continous flow of bank notes to have value.  

Capitalists are those people that own capital and thus control the labor and productive output of society.  Those without capital are beggars, servants, and employees who struggle and labor to get capital from the capitalists.  A narrative consistent with the popular book and movie series The Hunger Games where the relative few in the Capitol control the labor and output of the many in the Districts.

As technology is replacing the need for people to labor, the fundemental reason for capitalism to exist is becoming obsolete.  Recently government had to bail out capitalists simply so they could maintain control of the labor of others and the goods/services of society in this narrative.

Not only that, since the bailout, government has had to turn a blind eye to the repeated criminal activities of bankers simply to perpetuate this failing system of bank notes for trade.  Throughout this narrative, the capitalists have struggled to maintain consolitating control over resources and each other.  This process has continued such that we have reached a point of unprecedented concentration of wealth and control.

Now that resources are rapidly depleting under capitalism, violent conflicts are growing worldwide.  The conflicts are even causing the super power capitalists to square off with each other.  If this narrative continues much longer, WW3 will be a logical outcome where few will likely survive.

Technology can transform and improve the narrative for everyone worldwide while circumventing the need for conflict. Virtual reality and automation can drive unprecedented sustainability, efficiency, and productivity.  It can open access to opportunities that were closed under traditional capitalism.  The game can advance from resource competition to collaboration, while opening up new opportunities for competition.

The question now is not if, but how and when will civilization evolve beyond capitalism to create an unlocked future offering security, freedom, and opportunity for everyone globally, and not just the capitalists?",75,8,False,self,,,,,

Sorry.

I feel that neural interfaces for bionic implants are no longer a thing reserved for the far far future. Every few months I hear about progress with limb or eye implants that have some basic neural interface with their wearer. In addition, technology miniaturization has long reached a level where the computing power of a phone can fit inside the body and it will soon be able to power itself from the energy produced by the body (something researched for heart pacemakers).

One of the fundamental powers governments have over their people is that of controlling information. You can't record everything everywhere (e.g. no recording of US Supreme Court sessions, no recording the movie you're seeing in a cinema, no recording inside retail stores, etc.). All these entities have the arbitrary power to limit what an individual can share with others or tell with any credibility since there's no proof to back up sensitive claims.

Furthermore, the education system is largely based on the ability to mechanically repeat some study material. Refined testing of actual in-depth understanding occurs only in very high-profile, expensive learning institutions. If students can have a neurally implanted bionic eye, then they can also interface with a computer that allows browsing and searching through locally stored learning material without the human showing any signs of it from the outside. The education system will be shaken from the roots as it will be trivially easy for anyone to get a college degree without actually understanding the curriculum.

So, the question arises if anyone will have the ability to control these implants against their wearer's will or discriminate against those having the implants.

Examples:

* Should a human having 100x stronger than normal bionic arms and legs be stripped of them because he **might** use them to harm / overpower others when walking in a court room? Or in a hospital? Or in a prison? Or in a rented building? Or on anyone else's private property?

* Should a human having a bionic eye be stripped of it when taking an exam because he might hide a computer that allows him to easily browse through the curriculum? And how to you ensure nobody hides this kind of computer within their bodies? You scan them? What about those with legitimate implants? Any such implant can hide a neurally linked computer. Do you humiliate them by in-depth scanning their bodies for implants? Do you use an external kill switch for all their implants and cripple them while they take the exam?

I feel the bionic implants have the potential to dramatically change our society as soon as they are available in even basic form. Recording everything you see and being able to access it and share it with others will become a basic human right or else we'll step into an unimaginable dystopia.

But now with modern technology, the need to limit freedom, security, and opportunity to those with capital is obsolete.  We can upgrade the rules and open opportunities up to everyone on this planet.

For example, online education can enroll unlimited students from anywhere in the world.

New methods of construction can offer safe housing to everyone.  In short, life can improve for everyone with new technology and new thinking.

History has simply been a narrative of expanding wealth and opportunity to more people as technology advanced.  Capitalism was by far the most productive system in an era of specialized labor and machines.  Now that machines are increasingly able to operate with very little or no labor, capitalism and limiting wealth to capitalists is becoming obsolete.

But now with modern technology, the need to limit freedom, security, and opportunity to those with capital is obsolete. We can upgrade the rules and open opportunities up to everyone on this planet.

For example, online education can teach unlimited students from anywhere in the world. VR can open up access and opportunity in many areas that were closed in traditional brick and mortar capitalism. Indoor farming and new technology can sustainably give everyone food security. New methods of construction can offer safe housing to everyone. In short, life can improve for everyone with new technology and new thinking.

History has simply been a volatile narrative of expanding wealth and opportunity to more people as technology advanced. Capitalism was by far the most productive system in an era of specialized labor and machines. Now that machines are increasingly able to operate with very little or no labor, capitalism and limiting wealth to capitalists is becoming obsolete.

It is time to create better rules and a better system to sustainably spread security, freedom, and opportunity to everyone on this planet. There is no reason for human progress to stop at traditional capitalism.

In an era increasingly dependent on sustainable global collaboration, will people call those against spreading sustainable freedom to everyone ""terrorists"" while support those trying to improve the narrative everywhere regardless of their nationality or religion?

We live in exponentially growing times where access to opportunities is opening up and futurology is becoming one of the most dynamic and important subjects in history.  Good futurologists must never limit their thinking to the narratives of the past because current problems can't be solved with the same thinking that created them. 

Freedom is a fundamental right and belongs to everyone who believes in others having the right to freedom as well. The time has come for new thinking to expand security, freedom, and opportunity everywhere to levels never seen before in human history.

What would it take for the world to come together and collaborate to reboot and upgrade the global operating system? ",9,0,False,self,,,,,

Every Saturday I share a new chapter from my science fiction novel that's set in the far future, *The Asymptote's Tail*, and I thought some of you might be interested in following along. Today I'm up to chapter three so there's already plenty to read on the site, [starting here](http://bryanperkinsauthor.com/2015/05/09/the-asymptotes-tail/). And here's a brief summary to get you interested:

&gt;[The Asymptote's Tail](http://i.imgur.com/1p87chB.png)

&gt;Far into our future humankind controls the fabric of reality with such ease that here and there have become one. Space is bent such that many separate worlds exist, most in complete ignorance of the others. The Asymptotes Tail begins the story of the interactions between seven of those worlds.

&gt;In one, a servant imagines life with no master and learns if she can withstand the risks that come with freedom. In another, a young girl is forced into freedom of another kind when her parents disappear and she sets out to find them.

&gt;An actor learns how much work is done by who in which worlds and decides what he wants to do about it, a black cat tries to decipher the ways of humankind and protect his owner as she does the same, an assembly line worker seeks revenge for the death of her son, a police officer learns what the job entails and decides if he can stay on the force, and a scientist vies to regain control over her inventions which are being used to wreak havoc on all the worlds of Outland.

&gt;As each new perspective illuminates experiences from the old, the Sisyphean nature of chasing an endless limit and the totality of contradictions inherent in a divided system become clear. Then and now take on as little difference as here and there, for in the end, we are all, everywhere, and forever chasing The Asymptotes Tail.

&gt;The Asymptotes Tail is an epic science fiction novel and the first in the four-part Infinite Limits series.

Thanks for your time. I hope you enjoy the story, and if you do, join the few of us there are at /r/InfiniteLimits to follow along.

Have a great weekend.",0,3,False,self,,,,,

Shouldn't we have the most advanced computers on earth working on our biggest problems? 

**Naturally Juiced-Up Brains:** I'm not talking about actual computers; I'm talking about brains, the ones inside humans who were born with the gift of genius. Wouldn't it help humanity and technology to recruit a dozen or so new Einstein's? You might say that you can't find geniuses because it's not a real category/thing, but science has proven that's not true. Most geniuses (the creative kind anyhow), for example, have been shown to have two traits that are measurable: Low Latent Inhibition coupled with moderately high IQ. http://science.howstuffworks.com/thinking-cap2.htm . Also, there have been many studies on what makes art or a thought 'good' that could be turned into sets of rules (within the study of aesthetics anyhow). 

**You might say too that geniuses will reveal themselves...** Well, that might not be as easy as it seems. For one, thoughts that go against the norm will never be accepted easily, let a lone celebrated without a huge fight. Does every genius have to win this fight to be heard? Why? 

Second, not all geniuses will be afforded the opportunity to pursue anything more than paying their bills and caring for their family. Time to pursue one's own hobbies is a scarce resource globally. What's the solution?

**What to do:** I say we find geniuses using big-data techniques and linguistic analysis of public information and/or surveys. Then, we give those people an opportunity to either learn or to pursue intellectual work that they are being kept back from, either through grants or scholarships. Doing this could mean much more progress than we could ever imagine. 

**Conclusion:** This world could definitely use more Salvadore Dali's, Alan Turing's, John Nash's, Sylvia Plath's, and others who are simply crunching more data in their busy heads than anything else on the planet in creative and sometimes useful ways. 
**Caveat:** Yes, it is a mistake to think that only geniuses are special or that only a genius can solve big problems. That's not what I'm trying to say. I'm just saying, why not enable the people who have a good shot at solving our biggest problems or the best shot at creating inspiring art, etc? Not doing so could be slowing us down more than we know...",113,56,False,self,,,,,

Wouldn't an AI do whatever it can to preserve these massive, diverse, and complex generators of raw input regardless of what kinds of 'feelings', whether good or bad, it has towards them? 

If we look at how we humans conduct studies by analyzing information/data to inform us on a particular question or problem to solve, the more information we gather, the better our understanding and the closer we come to an accurate solution/conclusion; and we would normally value the source of the information regardless of whether it is bad or a detriment (this would stand true I think, at least in the case of the more intelligent of humans i.e. researchers, scientists, etc...; after all, we are making comparisons here with AI that's as or perhaps more intelligent than humans).

Taxi Industry

* Taxi Cab Drivers
* Some Taxi Companies

Shipping Industry

* Truck Drivers
* Shipping Companies (some of the smaller ones at least)

Government

* Some Police Officers (no tickets to give, fewer accidents to respond to)
* Road Commission Staff (probably still exists, but downsized)
* DMV Workers
* Meter Maids (cars don't park)

Car Ownership Chain

* Car Sales Staff
* Car Dealership
* Auto Mechanics (likely taken care of at the fleet level)
* Insurance Sales Staff
* Bank Staff (lack of auto loans = fewer staff)

* Gas Station Attendants (electric/lack of ownership)
* Oil Change Stations
* Tire Repair Shops

Other

* Driver's Ed Services
* Valet Services
* Road Crew/Construction (still exists, but downsized)
* Private Parking Lot Construction Crews

Great for the owner, not so good for the slave who was often viewed as sub human by the owner class.

Today we have indirect ownership of human life through the financial system.  If you own the debt of someone, like a student, they must labor for you or someone else to pay you back.  Indirectly, the owner of the debt has an interest in the debtor's life in the current system of people trading labor/life for bank notes/currency.  The more debt you have on someone, the greater percentage of their life you indirectly own.  Forgiving the debt today is like freeing a slave years ago.

The judges, lawyers, politicians, and basically the top 10% of people support this system because they own most of the financial assets.  The bottom 90% are not so lucky, just like the slaves and their families.

Often when former financial slaves become financial owners, they become addicted to their new power and control and treat other slaves without much dignity.  Up until recently,  the prospects of one day becoming an owner kept most slaves from violently revolting and most peacefully and obediently followed the rules of the owners.

When our political system and system of justice is self-interested in perpetuating this system, what is the outlook for the growing numbers of financial slaves with decreasing prospects for employment with rising automation?  When the owners can print up as much debt as they want for themselves, and burden the slaves with it, the outlook is bleak for the slaves.

It is amazing that when government, or ""the people"" as believed in the current narrative, bailed out this financial system, it was primarily bailing out the owners like bankers, judges and politicians while solidifying a future of financial slavery for growing numbers of people and their children.  

Does anyone in power really care about the prospects of the financial slaves anymore?",287,195,False,self,,,,,
