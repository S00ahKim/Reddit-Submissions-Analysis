Google quietly announced Calico along with recent news on their Baseline Study initiative, and now 23andMe gets a grant. The amount of information that will be fed into these companies genetic decoding software is going to be immense. Making sense of the data is going to be difficult, but the wonderful part is you do not need to understand the data. You just have to scan enough people over many years and computers can find disease/aging patterns. The true optimism is that these algorithms will be fine tuned, the information will be understood, and the technology is going to get faster. I am so inspired following these 3 companies as they delve into territories that were traditionally reserved for medical universities and tiny labs working for pharmaceuticals.

My theory is that due to progress across the board management are not firing or replacing staff because they are experiencing the same thing. If you can't justify my role, they can't justify their own. As a result attitudes change. When it rains only a third of the staff show up (we have about 500 on site).

I have gone from coding 2 year projects to releasing enterprise cloud based applications within a 3 month timeframe. Better quality, better cost and 100x more features.

I see this as a step towards a future where I am no longer needed. For office workers, we are at an interesting point in time, we have many workers who for the majority of the year are not busy but are still required to show up. Stop showing up or complain that you have no work and you could be out of a job.

Our office could be an outlier, but I see this as becoming more prevalent as more work is automated but numbers are not automatically downsized.

Do you think this is a rare example or an interim step that will be experienced by many?

Will management start getting used to workers quietly not showing up or will expectations shift? Will we get increased workloads, be made redundant or will attitudes change and we are given more freedom?

What do you think will be the next step? Recession, high unemployment, greater freedom?

I'm worried that it's going to matter a lot.

I am transgender (male bodied, female gendered), and 30 years old. I do not desire to live forever or to be immortal. I do not desire to become some kind of robo-ubermensch with superpowers. I'm happy to stay a squishy human, and to enjoy my time being alive and then peacefully die. But I DO greatly hope for biotechnology advances that will make things like sexual transitioning more successful, to allow me to have a body more in tune with my gender and my own personal standards of beauty. Yes, I want to be attractive in addition to ""passing"" as a woman.

But even if such technologies manifest themselves within my lifetime (and this is a big ""if"", I'll admit), and they become economical enough for me to be able to benefit from them (another huge ""if""), and I can ""transform"" into my ideal self and look smokin' hot even if I happen to be elderly when I do it...I worry about what the cultural reaction might be. Because in an ideal scenario, some degree of reverse-aging and rejuvenation will be performed, and I'll end up being physically mid-20 something to early 30-something. But many people seem to be against life-extension tech, and many MORE people are against transgenderism!

Like I said, I don't want to live ""forever"", or even for a significantly longer amount of time than a normal human lifespan. I actually get kinda freaked out at the idea of being alive for centuries and centuries. But if I ever do manage to get my ideal physical body, I'd like to enjoy it for a little while. It would do no good to undergo the procedure when I'm 89, and then keel over in a year. Maybe an extra 10 years would be nice, though.

But even this may be too much for people. People will resist technologies that allow us to redefine ourselves like this. Inbred dogs with health problems, rhinoplasty, gastric bypass surgery, all a-ok. But an older woman becoming a young woman to enjoy the body and appearance she never got to have, even if only for a few extra years? Disgusting. That's how I'm imagining it, anyway. A lot can happen in 59 years, though.

I should mention that I don't seriously expect this to happen. I try to be optimistic but I'm no Kurzweil. I have no idea what will become possible in my lifetime. So I don't want a bunch of trolls to come in and be like ""Ha! Dream on!"" Yeah, no shit it's a dream :rolleyes: I'm just speculating on how society will react to such possibilities.

115,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2014-8-3,2014,8,3,14,2chens,self.Futurology,Community owned Automation vs. Basic Income?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2chens/community_owned_automation_vs_basic_income/,ajsdklf9df,1407045355,"Community owned fiber networks appear to be great. Here is a great AMA from Chattanooga: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ccgs2/we_are_the_gig_city_chattanooga_tn_the_city_that/ And here is some info on what Lafayette has: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LUSFiber and there are other examples, all seem to be wonderful.

But can community ownership work in other things? 

How about professional sports? Teams worth billions of dollars, incredibly competitive world wide brands, most often owned by billionaires like  	Roman Abramovich.  Cutthroat professional leagues where the teams that finish last are forced to drop into a lower league. And the team that finishes at the top of their league is allowed to join a higher league. 

And yet, three of the four most valuable teams are owned by their fans: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_the_most_valuable_football_clubs#Current_ranking Including the most valuable soccer team in the world. Supporters own the team and elect the team's managed and hire and fire managers. 

Well I suppose the common man is a sports expert. But what about aircraft engines? Surely Joe Average  is not a jet engine expert? There isn't a jet engine factory that is owned by the workers. But this GE plant is managed by the workers: http://www.businessmanagementdaily.com/38846/at-ge-small-groups-run-a-big-plant And is renowned for the quality of their work, which is why GE management tends to leave them alone.

And some studies indicate employee driven decision making: http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/decisions.php can be better than management by mangers.

Maybe this is what Marx had in mind? It seems that when workers or communities own enterprises, or get to decide how to manage enterprises, things turn out pretty well. 

How much could employees gain if profits were not shared with other owners? 

Historically income has been split between labor and capitol at a 70/30 rate. With 70% of income going to labor.  If labor owned things, and there was no other capitalists to split the profits with, labor's gain would be significant. But not so significant to allow individual laborers to retire a lot earlier. An individual laborer would not become rich if 30% more was added to their pay. It is a hell of a pay raise, but it is one time only.

Except that historical share of income has recently changed. Labor's share of income first went down to 66%, and most recently was measured at just 62%: http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21588900-all-around-world-labour-losing-out-capital-labour-pains 


Pretty soon it might be down to just 50%. If then if production was all employee owned, the income per individual employee would double!

And if automaton continues to increase, then labor's share could go below 50%. And then if production is employee owned, the share per individual would more than double.

As automation continues to increase and more and more jobs are automated, should we all focus on community owned services and production? 

Imagine a small town which owns almost all major services used by the people who live there. As well as manufactures almost all goods used by them. Right now most consumer products are manufactured overseas, but automation is quickly changing that. Manufacturing plants are returning to the US, just without most of the jobs: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/business/us-textile-factories-return.html?pagewanted=all


As self-driving cars and trucks and heavily automated plants and drones are all used by Amazon, and as Amazon drives both small and big box stores out of business, would all profits go to Amazon and their shareholders? Or should communities across the world focus on creating and owning their own goods production and services? With heavy automation very few people actually to need be able to make decisions and do any work. 

But would community ownership lead to less centralized profits? 

The huge difference between the top 4  or 5 soccer teams and the rest, indicates that just because something is owned by a community, does not mean profits won't be centralized. A lot of soccer fans think the top handful of teams should get their own league and leave the rest of them alone. Because those four tend to buy ALL the best players, and are almost unbeatable by anyone other than the other top teams. The majority of  teams tend to be more equally matched. 

What does this indicate about community owned production in a free trade world? Will every small town need to be globally competitive? Or do we end up with a top handful of megalopolises which dominate global trade?


My main question is what is better, community owned services and production, or a basic income guarantee/negative income tax?

1. We don't make it to critical life extension point and die of age related causes. 

2. The opposite, where as we do make it and transcend our biological limits.  

The rest of this general discussion will be talking about and addressing only ideas concerned with those who are in category 2. 

The point I would like to make is that we are still going to die. Even if we do make it to the singularity. What makes up 'you' will be upgraded in continuum. Each successive upgrade will be seen as a benefit and few people will turn away upgrades because the nature of upgrades as being beneficial to ones life. Therefor we will choose each upgrade in small gradients until we are no longer what we used to be. We will be something vastly different. This is our death. The death of your personality. It will be true that the end product, whatever that would be, would be the result of some of what you were. But the change will be so great that we can simply say you would be no longer you, but a cascade of what was once you will become patterns of cognition in a vastly superior intellectually competent confinement. A small fraction of what is today's human will remain. The end of us all will be chosen in small gradual successive beneficial steps until we are no longer human, but a mass of computation. This might be the generation of spirit if you can call it such. I would be so bold as to say that all of mankind will be one essence. The age of spiritual humanity could be a great spirit that rises from many to become one as we become one super life form. It is hard to imagine exactly what this would look like as it is called the singularity for a reason. 

The final point is this. We are going to die as we are now. I want to transcend because I know it will be a wonderful experience. Technology and observation of the usefulness of mind has become my religion, because it aims to give me eternal life. Yet eternal life will be my death as the means of its achievement will involve upgrades so vastly beyond what I am today that we can simply call it the death of me. Thoughts? ",34,15,False,self,,,,,

The internet era emerged as recently as ~25 years ago. It has been a fact of life for someone born in the 90s but on any larger scale signals a more explosive shift.

Rokos post is wildly misunderstood. The post should be accurately explained somewhere. The current page on RationalWiki is better than it once was, but it is still written in such an incendiary manner I worry its style is interfering with understanding and needlessly slandering a community I admire. Worse, I feel the popularity of the article will make expressing concerns about the risks of AI even more low status than it already is. These are far bigger risks than the idea itself spreading. So what I hope to do here is explain the basilisk without snark.

I was lurking on LessWrong at the time Roko made his now-infamous post. So unlike the journalists who have written about it, I have a working knowledge of the LessWrong memespace,  I will attempt to explain the post and the context required to understand it, as well as Eliezers reaction and my interpretation of it. As for whether this is all worth understanding, I suppose if its worth misunderstanding then its worth understanding. 

LessWrong is a community blog started by Eliezer Yudkowsky, focused on rationality and futurism. Common items of discussion include AI, deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics, utilitarianism, exotic decision theories, and a theorized goal structure known as CEV. Rokos post combined all five into a logically coherent (though almost completely incomprehensible to outsiders)  ramble. But I will constrain myself to explaining only the parts of his post relevant to the basilisk. 

CEV stands for Coherent Extrapolated Volition. It is shorthand for the hypothesized aggregated and normalized values of all of humanity, constrained by the appropriate veils of ignorance. Here is how Yudkowsky describes it in the paper which introduced the concept:
 
&gt;In poetic terms, our coherent extrapolated volition is our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish [to be] extrapolated, interpreted as we wish [to be] interpreted.

 What is the purpose of CEV? Well, Yudkowsky believes artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence sometime this century. He also buys the orthogonally thesis, which I explained in my review of Nick Bostroms  *Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies* as follows: 

&gt;Though AIs with different utility functions (goals) may converge on some provably optimal method of cognition, they will not converge on any particular terminal goal. That is, a superinteligence whose super-goal is to calculate the decimal expansion of pi will never reason itself into benevolence. It would be quite happy to convert all the free matter and energy in the universe (including humans and our habitat) into specialized computers capable only of calculating the digits of pi. Why? Because its potential actions will be weighted and selected in the context of its utility function. If its utility function is to calculate pi, any thought of benevolence would be judged of negative utility.

These two beliefs combined lead to a terrifying conclusion: If AI is possible and intelligence and morality are completely independent, this means any sufficiently advanced AI not explicitly programmed to care about human welfare will be completely indifferent to humanity. Considering how powerful super-intelligence could get, this indifference would almost certainly be fatal. In the same manner that our indifference is fatal to many wild animals whose habitat we are rearranging. As Yudkowsky put it in another paper, The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.

When this dawned on him, he became an advocate of figuring out how to explicitly program a Friendly AI."" Thus CEV was born as a proposal for what the goal system of a friendly AI might look like. Its important to note that CEV is neither complete, rigorous, nor well-defined. Its also important to note that Yudkowsky would be the first to admit that. For the purposes of this essay, think of CEV as the shorthand for the utility function that would lead to the best of all possible futures. That is, CEV is the unknown goal system that, when implemented in a superintligence, reliably leads to the preservation of humans and whatever it is we value.

Now that we have CEV out of the way, I should mention Timeless Decision Theory. Timeless decision theory is an exotic decision theory created by Yudkowsky to deal with some of the edge cases conventional decision theories have trouble with, chiefly Newcombs problem. 

LessWrongWikis summery of Newcombs problem:
&gt;In Newcomb's problem, a superintelligence called Omega shows you two boxes, A and B, and offers you the choice of taking only box A, or both boxes A and B. Omega has put $1,000 in box B. If Omega thinks you will take box A only, he has put $1,000,000 in it. Otherwise he has left it empty. Omega has played this game many times, and has never been wrong in his predictions about whether someone will take both boxes or not.

A succinct introduction to analysis of the paradox, paraphrased from Gary Drescher's *Good and Real*:

&gt;What makes this a ""paradox"" is that it brings into sharp conflict two distinct intuitions we have about decision-making, which rarely bear on the same situation but clash in the case of Newcomb's. The first intution is considering rational expectations, act so as to bring about desired outcomes. This suggests one-boxing: we expect, based on the evidence, that we will find box A empty if we two-box. The second intuition is only act if your action will alter the outcome. This suggests two-boxing: our decision to take one box or both cannot alter the outcome, which robs the first intuition of its power to suggest one-boxing; since two-boxing has strictly greater expected utility, we choose that.

Formalized Thinking summarizes Timeless Descion Theorys approach to Newcombs problem:

&gt;When you make a decision, you are carrying out a computation. Timeless Decision Theory says that, rather than acting like you are determining that individual decision, you should act like you are determining the output of that abstract computation.
Timeless Decision Theory is basically a Causal Decision Theory with a modified sense of causality. Take Newcombs Problem: Here two processes occur.

&gt;1.) Omega predicts your choice.

&gt;2.) You make your choice.

&gt;Timeless Decision Theory states that both of these have a common cause: An abstract computation that is being carried out.[]To summarise: When you make a decision, you are carrying out a computation. Timeless Decision Theory says that, rather than acting like you are determining that individual decision, you should act like you are determining the output of that abstract computation. 

That is, even though Omega made the prediction before it asked you to pick the box, the computation that produced your decision in a sense caused his prediction. In this way, a future event  ""caused"" a past one.

Now the last piece of the Basilisk. Suppose CEV is both coherent and possible to implement, then it means the most moral thing possible is to hasten the arrival of an AI that implements CEV. Why, because every day people die, live lives of desperation, get cancer, experience meaningless pain  things CEV would presumably prevent. Roko proposed that to hasten its own creation this ultra-moral AI would pre-commit to torture all those who knew about the dangerous of AI and importance of CEV but did not contribute sufficiently to its creation. As this is a relatively small subset of the human population, any utility lost to torturing them would be made up by hastening its arrival. After all, hundreds of thousands of people die every day. 

Then Roko noted that this was silly, as future events don't cause past ones. But thinking about this  would increase the incentive of the AI to torture you. Timeless decision theory explains why. By simulating in your mind a CEV AI that wants to torture you, you increase the incentive of it to do so. If you are affected by your simulation of its pre-commitments, it would have motive to honor those pre-commitments. Further, you could be the simulation it is using to model your behavior. 

Now you may be asking, why did you explain it, then? One, because I dont buy it. Two, the cats out of the bag. Three, if it is true then, by definition, spreading the basilisk is the morally correct action. But the true reason, Rokos basilisk is an interesting thought experiment that no one took seriously. Yudkowskys reaction to it made LessWrong sound far crazier than it is [edit: see Yudkowsky's comment below for his explanation of his reaction, which is rather reasonable], and tainted the reputation of those concerned about AI risk. I consider this a shame, as I otherwise have a very high opinion of LessWrong. The media's explanations have made things far worse. So I hope an accurate explanation here will at least help a bit.

About two years ago I read a fantastic short story that was on this sub-reddit. I have searched and searched and cannot for the life of me find it! I've looked through the links on the side bar and couldn't se it in the reading list. I would love to read it again so here's a few key points from the story that I remember: 

* It takes place in our not too distant future and humans have been offered the choice to have their minds transferred into computers.. by aliens. 

* This alien civilization travels the universe and explores. It offered humanity a choice to join their society because we were on the path to self-destruction (lack of resources, wars etc.) Rather then watch the whole of humanity die they intervened and offered everyone a choice. Some took it, others didn't. 

* The alien civilization is made up of many different species. The whole society is governed by AI 

* During the time spent journeying in-between galaxies most of the beings in this civilization spend their time in VR. 

* The VR simulations are life like and are either constructs made by the AI or they are memories from other beings used to create a simulation. The beings can also elect to have portions of their memory hidden from them so that they believe that the simulation that they are experiencing is real and the simulation is the only thing they have knowledge of. 


This short story was in a simple text file dump and I can't remember the domain either. If anyone has ever read this before (or something like it, perhaps my memory of it is incorrect) then please let me know the title/author of the story!

To run a successful eCommerce website, you need to do what successful bricks-and-mortar retailers do. Follow these rules to get your eCommerce site visitors actually shopping online.
1) The retailer has a product or products that she wants to sell.

Everyone into eCommerce or thinking of getting into eCommerce has this one figured out. Want a new car? Fresh spinach? A replacement part for your ancient typewriter? You'll find it on the 'Net. But a product, no matter how superior or well-priced, does not a successful eCommerce site make.
2) The retailer needs a place to showcase his product. Traditionally, this is a building of some kind.

Online, it's an ecommerce website. But think about the traditional retail store. There are products in the window to entice the customer inside. There are aisles leading to shelves of more products, all conveniently arranged for the customer.

Navigation is critical to ecommerce website design; visitors to your online store need the same kind of visible, easy-to-follow pathways. They need to be able to examine your products and compare them with other products easily.

And visitors to your online store need to be able to access your products easily. They can't just pick them off the shelf and carry them to the till as they would in the bricks-and-mortar store. The back end of your eCommerce site is just as important as your front end in terms of eCommerce website design. You need to arrange the supply and distribution of your product before your ecommerce site goes ""live"". You must be able to deliver on your promise to the customer.

Too many eCommerce ventures collapses because the people involved didn't bother to secure the supply and distribution of their product ahead of time. What happens when people shopping online don't get the product they ordered in a reasonable amount of time or don't get it at all? They get angry, and chances are good, no matter how nicely you apologize to them, they'll never buy anything from you again. And they'll tell all their friends how unhappy they are with your crummy customer service!
3) The retailer chooses a building for his store that is in good repair, and has all the facilities such as electricity and heat that are necessary to make his customers comfortable. If the building isn't in good repair, he fixes the problems.

Too many eCommerce entrepreneurs don't bother to do this. They throw up websites that have large sections under construction, or have their sites hosted by providers that provide erratic or slow service. If a potential customer tries to access your website and it's down, what does she do? She clicks through to another website where she can view the products she's interested in. Will she be back? Probably not.

You must have consistent, 24/7 hosting if you want to operate a successful eCommerce website. You must present a fully functional, complete store to get visitors shopping online. No 'Under Construction' or 'Coming Soon' banners.

Usability is another important component of website design. For instance, if potential customers can't navigate your site easily, they won't bother. Pay special attention to the ease of the buying process. Your competition is always only a click away.

And you must maintain your website regularly and often. An commerce site that's littered with dead links kills online shopping. An eCommerce website that never offers any new content will bore visitors. If you can't afford to maintain your site, you can't afford to have one.

But even if you have an excellent website design, site visitors still may not shop from you. The next page of this article discusses how to get visitors to your online store to trust you enough to become  shoppers.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Futuristic design is really, really retro. Like, no one has seriously designed stuff to be futuristic since the 70's. That's because since the 80's no one has really believed in the type of technological progress represented by that kind of futurism. Basically, The very concept of the future is outdated. Try to make something look futuristic today and it will look like it's from the 60's. 

Instead, people build McMansions that look like Tudor Manors, while filling them with gadgets that would seem like magic to people from the Jetsons. The point of the sleek, minimalistic design prevalent in things like flat screen TVs and Phones isn't to look like the future. It's to have as little inherent style as possible so that it blends in with whatever style your home already has. ""Less is More"" in this case isn't a artistic choice, it's an attempt to avoid clashing with anything. 

(this is also why mirrored glass is such a big thing in skyscrapers. It's not to look cool and shiny. It's done so that the building reflects a lot of sky, thus visually appearing less imposing. It's as close as we can come to putting a cloaking device on the building. )

The future will never look like ""The future,"" and here's why: by the time we get there, it will be the present. And the present is always made from leftover bits of the past taped together with people's dreams for the future. The present looks like a 100 year old building with Cell phone antennas bolted to the side. The future will look like the present with some VR overlays and a few different outfits.

Ok, so it's easy to say AI will exceed human abilities. Thus, people are worried the AI could turn on us, and make humanity extinct.

Therefore, why don't we limit them? For instance:

-Make an AI that COOKS better than humans, but that's all this one does.
-Make an AI that DRIVES better than humans, but that's all this one does.
-Make an AI that CLEANS better than humans, but that's all this one does.

I assume you see my point by now. The major factor I'm trying to emphasize is: Don't make an AI that is better than humans AS A WHOLE. That would actually be UNINTELLIGENT of us to do, thereby verifying the fact they would deservingly kill us, as a result. Think about it. AIs need to be carefully stranded per individual task, not intermingled into a supreme being ... Because of course they will kill us if we hand them the power to. We can't birth a being that is superior to us and expect it to not BE superior to us. Therefore, the solution is: Don't.

AI should be kept compartmentalized.

The flip side to this concept would be, YES make a supreme being that is superior to humans, but program it with extremely high levels of empathy and compassion, so it loves to help and serve other beings... Because then that could be a very-very-very beautiful thing.

* Irritable Bowel Syndrome

* Autoimmune disorders
* Many chronic illnesses
* Others...



Currently there are mostly hypothesis as this is quite new and few researches have been published. However many are being made and it's probably just the beginning.

Nonetheless, **what will FB look like -- in terms of creation of profiles, and daily- and monthly-users -- in about 50 years?**  

Obviously, eventually every single person on your Facebook ""friends"" list will be dead, and if one were to log onto your profile posthumously, there would be ZERO activity on your news feed.  

Also, I'm assuming that the rate of new profile creations will slow down considerably over time, since it's already slowing down *now*.  There will never be another 10-year period in Facebook's history where they'll have close to 2 billion sign-ups during that span, since they went from 0 users to 2 billion and it would be more difficult to go from 2 billion to 4 billion than 0 to 2.

This means that a significant portion of the FB ""population"" in, say, 50 years will be dead, and their friends will be dead.  It would be quite depressing as a 16-year old knowing that you're ""virtually"" surrounded by e-corpses; of course, you need not seek them out, but they still remain there. 

Do you think people would be put off by that?  Do you think they'll ignore it?  Or do you think social media, as we know it, will be completely overhauled and today's Facebook will not be used?

Using the multiverse theory, we can assume that there is a universe for every possible outcome in every situation.

I can conclude that there is time travel available at some point in the future, yet we will never see these masters of time because time travel ports you to a new universe which is not the same as ours.

Example: Time master travels back in time to kill Hitler.  In his universe, he is hero and lives out his days as hero of Earth.  However, since his universe is not our own, his actions had no effect on our universe and we continue down the same destined path.
Another Example: Time master travels back in time to invent Google, found Microsoft/Apple, and becomes the worlds richest man.  He lives out his days in glorious fame and riches, but his actions have only a resounding effect in the universe he traveled to.

I am claiming two things; the butterfly effect is dumb and does not make any sense because whatever you change does not in fact affect the universe you came from.
Also, in some distant future, people have already mastered time and bended it to their pleasure.

You can see all perspectives at once.

On the negatives, I worry about climate change; overpopulation; dwindling clean drinking water; peak oil and its fallout on our reliance on plastics, power generation, transportation, basically our entire modern society; politicians at large unconcerned about sustainable policies.

On the positives, we know these problems and knowing them is the first step to changing them. Climate change can be combated with a combination of renewable energy generation and planting forests of carbon-capturing trees; we can clean the ocean acidification with bicarbonate-generating power plants; tesla just opened patents for electric cars; we can hook up desalinization plants to the ocean with our drinking water.

I guess my biggest fear then is complete uncaring attitude you feel when engaging with most people, that everything will be procrastinated until its too late despite being told again and again. Like Toledo's algae bloom being predicted and forecasted time and again by researchers.

Once there is a 3D printer that can print food, clothing, shelter and 3D printers from crude and common materials, we'll have to view property and services differently. Credibility will be the only currency.

Block buster was replaced with a vending machine and the vending machine is being replaced by ones and zeros. Publishers no longer have to rely on manufacturing and distribution. Authors no longer need to rely on publishers. 

Eventually you'll go to the groccery store and find a vending machine. Then driverless cars will make deliveries from that vending machine. The same way the food was brought to the store from the farm. Same goes with take out. 

Maybe they'll print out lab meat, when your not looking. And it will taste really fucking good. Maybe GMOs grown in a controlled lab farm will taste better too. As well as providing an abundant source of food.

Then we'll have a problem. There will be an over surplus of goods with no one to buy. All of the jobs are gone. The high skilled non-procedural jobs will be flooded. Every job would have to be providing a social experience. Until it starts to feel like we're paying friends to hang out.

Leadership and creativity can't be replaced by machines. But those two qualities contain their own reward. If you are a natural problem solver, you will be rewarded socially. 

We'd see an odd return to a pre-market society where shopping would be like picking fruit from a tree. Then you return to dance around the campfire, whatever it may be. All you'll only have to worry about is finding someone that wants to screw. Maybe settle down and raise kids.

In fact, I hope it could be the greatest riddle of all time, because it might just be the riddle of time itself. This is not a ""what/who am I"" riddle, because in my mind and in my sense of matter I know that I am simply an imperfectly built human created by nature and god. However, it is possible that my consciousness emerged from a quantum computer while I was witnessing the singularity in either the past, present or future and this is how I know the singularity has already happened at some point in time. The riddle is: assuming that this might be true for everyone and is absolutely true relative to me (a random guy with hippie influences who likes to play soccer and fuck around in the ocean waves) how could the singularity have already happened if even the ""smartest"" people of our times think it hasn't happened yet and also think it will happen in a particular way? The other part to this riddle is that: does the singularity have to occur even if it already has at some point in time. I want to hear everyone's ideas and responses to this, and my hope is to spark some imaginations. Thus I will post my own opinion if I feel the need to a week from today at this time to keep this discussion going. Just post anything you might think is relevant even if you think its crazy because it can't hurt in our goal to uncover the truth about time and our conscious natural selves. Plus, I've learned from experience that saying and thinking crazy things together as one (not simply acting on crazy things as we have sometimes done in the past) can be the only way to keep things around us sane. My only hint to you is positive energy and the power of love. Peace, always, and stay positive.",5,0,False,default,,,,,

&gt;""Bridge Two"", the revolution in Genetics/Biotechnology, is to reach its peak. During the 2020s, humans will have the means of changing their genes; not just ""designer babies"" will be feasible, but designer baby boomers through the rejuvenation of all of one's body's tissues and organs by transforming one's skin cells into youthful versions of every other cell type. People will be able to **""reprogram"" their own biochemistry away from disease** and aging, radically extending life expectancy.

I think it's safe to say that bridge two has begun. 2 days ago, someone posted an article about how UCSF scientists created disease-free versions of stem cells of people who had beta thalassemia using a genetic engineering technique called CRISPR. Although they did not transfuse the cells back into the test subjects, that part should be trivial compared to the actual genetic engineering. But anyway, they edited a genome to cure a disease, and so I think it's safe to say that bridge two has begun, but this is only the **very, very** beginning of it.

There's always someone that laments the fact that we never got flying cars or colonies on the Moon or Mars. And they use this as proof that technological progress is stagnating or whatever. Am I the only one that doesn't really care? I love having a laptop, smartphone, access to the internet, social media, videos, movies, news, limitless information.

And then pessimists say ""Yeah, but we don't really live any differently, do we? How have these things really impacted our lives?""

Well, what would a fucking flying car do for you? It's really just a personal helicopter. You'd need to be a pilot to fly it. And what would manned research stations on the Moon or Mars do for the average person? Imagine if we didn't have personal computers, the internet, cellphones, smartphones, social media, or any of that other stuff, but we had a colony on the Moon. Who the living hell would go to the goddamn Moon?

Those things aren't practical. They were silly nerd pipedreams to begin with. Sorry, but those things were never on the table as real possibilities.

I'm not saying that future is going to be great, but I'm sick of hearing about flying cars and manned space travel.

Now I'm no automotive expert, but some of the claims they throw around about technologies like FCEV (Fuel Cell) I'm sure were said about BEVs at some point too. 

My opinion is that, in the end, it doesn't matter which technology prevails, as long as it solves current issues. That technology, through selection, will be the best for its purpose. It seems necessary to give every technology a fighting chance to see which ones will actually work for the best. But then I see people come in with blatantly misconceived or outright incorrect facts (like, ""Who wants to drive on a hydrogen bomb"" and ""It'll be the Hindenberg all over again""), and it's clear that they don't care about which technology is the best, they just want their chosen tech to win. Since the most popular and simultaneously marketable (by this I mean range and cost) alternative fuel vehicle is Tesla, people have chosen it to be their chosen tech. Which is fine and dandy, until they start purporting it to be the be all end all of alternative technology.

This turned into a rant, I'm sorry. But is anyone else concerned about the hostility coming from MuskRats towards alternative options? Or am I just a curmudgeon?  

I figure I'd leave the article I was talking about (particularly the comments sections):

Both of us made it. It took less than a decade from the first-ever rocket bearing a human, to landing on the Moon, taking a few crummy videos and a lot of great stills, and wending back. Futurists by the 1930s and 1940s (called Science Fiction writers) had already begun to imagine not just landing on the Moon, but colonizing it. So with 2535 years, it had been done, at great cost and great national investment.

40 years ago, 1974, Russia and America were substantially scaling back their space-exploration plans. The Moon was terribly expensive to visit, and there were no other things reasonably close, to visit. Thoughts of building a permanent Space Station were adopted, it being cheaper to get to than the Moon. Closer, faster, cheaper, sufficient. We got plans for a Space Shuttle (the first and so far, only reusable spacecraft design that was put in to production). It looked like Science Futurists vision of a ""cheap flight to space"" were within hand.

30 years ago, 1984, we had that reusable spaceship, the Space Shuttle. There was a small space station that the Russians had built (Salyut). there were plans for a Great Telescope in space. We had no interest in sending people to The Moon, or anywhere else for that matter. Just a Space Station of huge span, a research facility above the sky. Budgets were tight, the world had gone thru recessions, and the Russians weren't in the mood to spend in Space. Europe was doing its thing  and it was all good.

20 years ago, 1994, plans were finalized for the International Space Station. Our eyes - for human space-flight - were now at LEO and not much further. It was clear that with the advent of chip-scale computers, almost unimaginable in the 1960s, that now our best, our most profitable space exploration adventures would come by sending robots to the orbs. They weren't particularly susceptible to hard space radiation, to long relatively slow (economical) voyages, they didn't consume much except power and whiffs of propellant to keep 'em on track. We sent probes though to almost all the planets.

10 years ago, 2004, we had our ISS station. We had sent rovers to Mars. Not much roving went on, but hey - we got back pictures ""on the ground"", and got to oggle space blueberries. We were starting to wonder if there were any planets to visit. The science visionaries (who weren't just wrapped up in post-Star Trek / Star Wars space opera) of the day were proposing real visits to Mars; terraforming; possibilities of mining the asteroids; self-replicating machines and nanotechnological methods ot get there, do that. However, practically, robots were still doing all the heavy lifting, exploration-wise.

0 years ago, 2014, we still have our ISS station. Indeed - people have gone no further in the last 10 years. Our robots on Mars have delivered a HUGE amount of useful science, and have totally opened up the geology of the planet to our understanding. There are enough mysteries there, enough lucid hints, to indicate that there very likely is a lot of water, a lot of CO, a lot of 'stuff' entombed under the regolith of the Planet. Our Big Eye in the sky now has companions. We're months away from landing on a Comet!!! I mean, come on this is wickedly cool. Our futurists, (alas including Musk) are again rabble-rousing for a manned trip to Mars. Enough other futurists have posited floating cities on Venus, terminator cities on Mercury, mining colonies on Ceres and Vesta and other asteroid-belt objects  that clearly there's renewed interest in getting blobs-of-protoplasm outside the gravity well again.

+10 years from now, 2024  my bet is that we're still here on Dirt, pretty firmly. Musk's marvelous reuseable space launchers will be able to shuttle people TO space on the cheap. Getting back? Well  that's going to take some heavier craft. But his design team has a whole line-up of ever larger launchers to get stuff out there, and come back in one piece. Hey: if it could be done without reusability in the 1960s for crumb's sake, it most certainly can be done again in the 2010s or 2020s. Someone (like me) will push the Moon-Again as a stepping stone of conservative, attainable prudence as the ""second step"". Not Mars, yet. Not yet.

+20 years? Oh I think now we'll be in the Mars Landing timeframe. However, in 20 years, I fully expect 100 kilogram or less computational intelligence systems that are very field-specific, but just as intelligent as any human specialist in the same area. The trip to Mars will be one way. It will be taken not by a youngster, likely, but by a trio or so of older engineer/scientists. People with a huge amount of hands-on experience resolving things, without support. People who will live out their lives there, sending back all nature of Science data. Who will actually discover things by looking at oddities, reacting to conditions in real-time can do. Musk's cheap-lofters will loft the supplies they'll need. Who knows, maybe they'll be able to build the return-vessel. Just don't expect them to use it.

+30 years A.I. robotic missions of significant complexity to dozens, if not hundreds of near-earth objects. Many to the asteroid belt, to make landing-and-sampling visits to the dozens of ""interesting types"" of asteroids. Mineral prospecting. People might be sent too, but it seems more doubtful: the radiation problem cannot be solved easily, without employing almost ridiculous amounts of shielding mass. And, shielding mass slows down the mission track  needing more shielding.

After that? Who knows.

Whether we make it to the asteroids on an regular basis, the outer planets; whether we colonize Mars, or Venus's atmosphere, whether we play with the fire-dragon's tail on Mercury as humans, not as robots  depends critically on coming up with high-force, ultra-low reactant/propellant rocketry. There are no ""space equations' that can solve the fundamental problem of ""getting there in a reasonably short amount of time"" that don't call for a complete replacement of chemical propulsion. Not even ""reusable spacecraft"" solve its insufficiencies.

And this - is just to get to the planets, to the asteroids, as humans. Perhaps too, to return, tho' there are many here who would leap at an opportunity to be one-way travelers. What of the stars themselves? Again, there is a lot of speculative fiction that has ginned up a marvel rapture of ideas; each fabulist has come to drum her own pet solution, or handful of them. Though it is unpopular, I don't think we'll see a use of antimatter in our lifetimes, or our great-grandkid's lifetimes for that matter. I don't think we'll see traction from the physics-breaking propellant-less reaction thrusters folks either. I likely sound like a curmudgeon, but I think we're locked in Relativistic and Newtonian Physics' hard, cold, firm web.

Which means, we'll have to work with ions as our propellants. Linear accelerators. Terrible power-to-thrust ratios, but with almost the only opportunity to turn megawatts or gigawatts of fusion (I'm supposing we'll solve this one eventually) energy into kilonewtons of thrust. Will it be enough? YES it will. In 1,000 years, unless there is something that breaks us from Physics clutches, people just maybe will be arriving at the nearest stars of interest. It'll be a one-way trip, for sure. And it might be multi-generational, unless we get REALLY good at manipulating antimatter. But these things are too possible. The future of space exploration makes ""The Moon Shot"" of 1969 look  easy and almost trivial.

Yet, these noble goals should be the carrot we hang out in front of us, to define one of the tenable reasons to spend public monies to the betterment of civilization.

Authors are being recruited to take sides, and the issue has been divisive. Some bestselling authors are supporting Hachette's efforts to keep e-books priced at or near parity with hard copies. Others have supported Amazon's efforts to price e-books significantly lower. 

In my case, since I have some control over the pricing, I deliberately set the digital version of [my book](http://www.adamdorr.com/books/) so that the royalty I receive is the same as the paper one, and that ends up being $6.99 versus the regular list price of $12.99. I personally agree with Amazon on this issue. Pricing e-books - which have near-zero marginal cost - at parity with hard copies seems like egregious price gouging to me. Moreover, authors' royalties don't always reflect the additional profit those inflated prices generate for publishers. 

For technology and futurism enthusiasts like myself, the economic disruption of e-books represents the beginning of a massive shift toward near-zero marginal cost across many industries. Precedents set here may have important implications for many other industries whose legacy of centralized production of physical products is threatened by digitization and decentralized production via technologies like 3D printing. 

Amazon is contacting insignificant authors like myself who have published directly through Kindle and asking us to help lobby against Hachette. Below is the email I received today:

Dear KDP Author,

Just ahead of World War II, there was a radical invention that shook the foundations of book publishing. It was the paperback book. This was a time when movie tickets cost 10 or 20 cents, and books cost $2.50. The new paperback cost 25 cents  it was ten times cheaper. Readers loved the paperback and millions of copies were sold in just the first year.

With it being so inexpensive and with so many more people able to afford to buy and read books, you would think the literary establishment of the day would have celebrated the invention of the paperback, yes? Nope. Instead, they dug in and circled the wagons. They believed low cost paperbacks would destroy literary culture and harm the industry (not to mention their own bank accounts). Many bookstores refused to stock them, and the early paperback publishers had to use unconventional methods of distribution  places like newsstands and drugstores. The famous author George Orwell came out publicly and said about the new paperback format, if publishers had any sense, they would combine against them and suppress them. Yes, George Orwell was suggesting collusion.

Well history doesnt repeat itself, but it does rhyme.

Fast forward to today, and its the e-books turn to be opposed by the literary establishment. Amazon and Hachette  a big US publisher and part of a $10 billion media conglomerate  are in the middle of a business dispute about e-books. We want lower e-book prices. Hachette does not. Many e-books are being released at $14.99 and even $19.99. That is unjustifiably high for an e-book. With an e-book, theres no printing, no over-printing, no need to forecast, no returns, no lost sales due to out of stock, no warehousing costs, no transportation costs, and there is no secondary market  e-books cannot be resold as used books. E-books can and should be less expensive.

Perhaps channeling Orwells decades old suggestion, Hachette has already been caught illegally colluding with its competitors to raise e-book prices. So far those parties have paid $166 million in penalties and restitution. Colluding with its competitors to raise prices wasnt only illegal, it was also highly disrespectful to Hachettes readers.

The fact is many established incumbents in the industry have taken the position that lower e-book prices will devalue books and hurt Arts and Letters. Theyre wrong. Just as paperbacks did not destroy book culture despite being ten times cheaper, neither will e-books. On the contrary, paperbacks ended up rejuvenating the book industry and making it stronger. The same will happen with e-books.

Many inside the echo-chamber of the industry often draw the box too small. They think books only compete against books. But in reality, books compete against mobile games, television, movies, Facebook, blogs, free news sites and more. If we want a healthy reading culture, we have to work hard to be sure books actually are competitive against these other media types, and a big part of that is working hard to make books less expensive.

Moreover, e-books are highly price elastic. This means that when the price goes down, customers buy much more. We've quantified the price elasticity of e-books from repeated measurements across many titles. For every copy an e-book would sell at $14.99, it would sell 1.74 copies if priced at $9.99. So, for example, if customers would buy 100,000 copies of a particular e-book at $14.99, then customers would buy 174,000 copies of that same e-book at $9.99. Total revenue at $14.99 would be $1,499,000. Total revenue at $9.99 is $1,738,000. The important thing to note here is that the lower price is good for all parties involved: the customer is paying 33% less and the author is getting a royalty check 16% larger and being read by an audience thats 74% larger. The pie is simply bigger.

But when a thing has been done a certain way for a long time, resisting change can be a reflexive instinct, and the powerful interests of the status quo are hard to move. It was never in George Orwells interest to suppress paperback books  he was wrong about that.

And despite what some would have you believe, authors are not united on this issue. When the Authors Guild recently wrote on this, they titled their post: Amazon-Hachette Debate Yields Diverse Opinions Among Authors (the comments to this post are worth a read).  A petition started by another group of authors and aimed at Hachette, titled Stop Fighting Low Prices and Fair Wages, garnered over 7,600 signatures.  And there are myriad articles and posts, by authors and readers alike, supporting us in our effort to keep prices low and build a healthy reading culture. Author David Gaughrans recent interview is another piece worth reading.

We recognize that writers reasonably want to be left out of a dispute between large companies. Some have suggested that we just talk. We tried that. Hachette spent three months stonewalling and only grudgingly began to even acknowledge our concerns when we took action to reduce sales of their titles in our store. Since then Amazon has made three separate offers to Hachette to take authors out of the middle. We first suggested that we (Amazon and Hachette) jointly make author royalties whole during the term of the dispute. Then we suggested that authors receive 100% of all sales of their titles until this dispute is resolved. Then we suggested that we would return to normal business operations if Amazon and Hachettes normal share of revenue went to a literacy charity. But Hachette, and their parent company Lagardere, have quickly and repeatedly dismissed these offers even though e-books represent 1% of their revenues and they could easily agree to do so. They believe they get leverage from keeping their authors in the middle.

We will never give up our fight for reasonable e-book prices. We know making books more affordable is good for book culture. Wed like your help. Please email Hachette and copy us.

Please consider including these points:

- We have noted your illegal collusion. Please stop working so hard to overcharge for ebooks. They can and should be less expensive.
- Lowering e-book prices will help  not hurt  the reading culture, just like paperbacks did.
- Stop using your authors as leverage and accept one of Amazons offers to take them out of the middle.
- Especially if youre an author yourself: Remind them that authors are not united on this issue.

Thanks for your support.

(Immortality),https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2d2ef6/my_friend_has_a_really_crazy_vision_for_the/,[deleted],1407589080,"So, my friend and I are very avid in futurology. My friend, in particular, has an extreme fear of death and what it entails. As such, he is most looking forward to new technologies that will bring about immortality or nearly unlimited lifespan. In addition, my friend is an extreme idealist (sometimes to the point of delusion), and wants to find a purpose for his life.

So, recently I had a discussion with him about his goals for the future. In essence, he said he is waiting for immortality, but with a twisted, elitist way: he says once he achieves immortality, he will do whatever it takes to not let anyone once have immortality. Yep. He says that other people are not worthy and ""good"" for immortality, and he frequently poses the question ""What if an Osama Bin Laden got immortality?""

Then, he went on to say that he wants to be a ""guide"" or ""guardian"" for the future of mankind, and lead to his utopian vision of universal peace (free from suffering, pain,war, etc.) Once he accomplishes this, he says he, knowing that he fulfilled his life's purpose, will commit suicide as ""atonement for the crimes he will commit to reach world peace. 

So, as a (hopefully) normal human being, I thought he was batshit crazy. But mostly, because he is one if my closest friends, I was really worried for him and his wellbeing. Ultimately, I thought it was appalling that he thought that only he deserves immortality (or ANY technology that can progress humanity). I found it incredibly delusional, as well as elitist, especially due to the fact that he is neither wealthy, successful, nor affluent. I also think its retarded to think that he can take away immortality (given the increasingly open source and decentralized nature of modern technology)

I think his idea ultimately comes from his fear of death, and his fear of not being able to make a difference in the world with a normal lifespan. Also, because he is neither very intelligent, wealthy, or affluent, he wants to have immortality for himself so that he has a reason for feeling special. He's still young (we are both only 15), but I really worry about him, since he's so adamant and closed minded, no matte how much I tell him that it's an incredibly dumb ""vision"". 

Futurology, what are your thoughts? What can I say/show him to try to convince him that he's a bit... Crazy?

TL;DR: my friend wants to have immortality, have a monopoly of it (take away the rights of others to have it) so that he can be a ""guardian of earth"" and instill universal peace into the world. ",6,0,False,default,,,,,

Notable resources (unordered) are [Singularity or Bust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owppju3jwPE), [How to Create a Mind](http://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/0143124048/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407622106&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=HOW+TO+CREATE+A+MIND), [On Intelligence](http://www.amazon.com/On-Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805078533), [Consciousness and the Brain](http://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Brain-Deciphering-Codes-Thoughts/dp/0670025437), [SuperIntelligence (recently recommended by Musk)](http://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111), [Neural Nets explained](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/), [Neural Net Math](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Math-Neural-Networks-Heaton-ebook/dp/B00845UQL6), [Stanford encylopedia of Philosophy - Consciousness](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/). 

Different authors talk about different goals. For example, Hawkins wants to harness the design of the neocortex to build much better computer systems. KWall is almost spiritual and thinks we will merge with machines. Goertzel wants to build Artificial General Intelligence. I don't really know what [Chalmers](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=david+chalmers+artificial+intellgience) thinks but he's interesting to listen to and I remember him saying he thinks the generational approach will beat Neuroscience and GOFAI (Good Old Fashioned AI). The NSA's goal, of course, would be to know you're building an AGI before you create an intelligence explosion in your basement.

From what I understand an AGI would be be hierarchical, like brains, with more specific pattern recognizers at the bottom and more abstract pattern recognizers at the top. You could also plug in non-pattern-recognition programs so the AGI could solve other types of problems. Beyond this vague concept I'm not clear on what an AGI architecture would look like.

Some guesses are:

* The AGI's subconscious, like a human mind, would be extremely, extremely important.
* It works top down based on memory and prediction.
* The conscious part results from global information sharing (Global Neuronal Workspace). 
* Low level information becomes conscious when a huge number of low level neurons become active. 
* The subconscious works like a GPU (in parallel) while the conscious mind works like a CPU (serially)
* There is, obviously, some randomness introduced into neuronal firing to create new ideas and creativity.
* Attention amplifies sublminal processing
* Temporal patterns are important?

So I just imagine a bunch of neural nets feeding into neural nets at higher levels (like when KWall explains:

&gt; this NN recognizes a diagonal line /, this NN recognizes a diagonal line \, this NN recognizes a horizontal line _, and they feed into a NN that recognizes A. That NN feeds into a NN that recognizes words. Those NN feed into NN that recognize concepts. etc. 


But the whole thing is more top down than bottom up because things happen faster that way. So we have a heirarchy of Neural Nets that also have access to regular serial type programs and a hippocampus at the top to recognize new patterns to be stored. Then ....loops between high and low level neurons and the thalamus and....?

Has anyone, like Goertzel, made a simple diagram that explains how their AGI would actually work?",8,41,False,self,,,,,

I just had a #ShowerThought that blew my own fucking mind. 

The classical stereotype/belief about the ""Singularity"" is that it will happen at a distinct moment in time.... but some of you will probably agree that it's already happening... it's just so small and spread out in so many tiny nooks &amp; crannies.. that most normal people don't yet recognize it happening. 

Here's some of the stuff in the news lately .. and collectively it's blowing my mind:

* [""HealthMap software flagged Ebola outbreak 9 days before outbreak announced""](http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/healthmap-software-flagged-ebola-9-days-before-outbreak-announced-1.2732464)

That's pretty impressive.... but think about this:..... Consider all of the different companies currently hopping on the wearables/health-devices. Imagine if you and everyone around you was wearing a small wrist-watch or other wearable device that tracked your vital signs and stripped out any identifiable information to share anonymous ""mesh"" health data with the community around you. Patterns and outbreaks could be identified, tracked, monitored in real-time ... far faster than any current method we use. Having that kind of mesh/big-data access to genetic and contagious information would be a god-send for health/human-services. 

* [IBM's ""brain on a chip""](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/science/new-computer-chip-is-designed-to-work-like-the-brain.html)

Having 1 of these would be pretty impressive..... imagine having 10million linked in a ""neural-internet""... 

* [Chicago's face-recognition system catches it's 1st ""perp""](http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/8/5982727/face-wreck-how-advanced-tech-comes-up-short-for-police)

Slightly orwellian.. but interesting none-the-less. 

* Self-driving cars (and other forms of ""intelligent mass-transit"")

Pretty obvious here that eliminating the human from the equation eliminates a huge amount of risk and inefficiency. The social/global advantages are almost to numerous to mention. 

When I read the daily-news or do stuff in my daily life... it astounds me how sloppy, inefficient and downright antiquated a lot of the stuff that humanity does on a daily basis. 

There's a lot of amazing advancements being made/invented... the biggest thing I'm worried about is humanities ability to adapt and let go of old ways. That's gonna be the clincher. ",86,40,False,self,,,,,

It's a reflection on how the role of social media can be innovated in ""popular defense"" or ""revolutionary resistance"" and is meant to stimulate imagined tactical-possibilities more than anything. I assumed it wouldn't hurt to share here if anybody ever felt like bouncing their own related ideas off it:

&amp;nbsp;

|| [Medium as Movement: Cultivating the Role of Social Media in Civil Protest](https://growveinitiative.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/mediumasmovement.pdf)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; || Aim:

&gt;Highlighting the role social media technologies have played in contemporary protest movements, this piece offers a proposal on where the role can be cultivated from here. With an eye toward how the ""Arab Spring"" and ""Occupy"" protests have unfolded, I paint a narrative of social media's successes/shortcomings in enabling these protest movements to promote democratic practice and effective social change. By keeping these measures of democratic practice and effective social change in mind, my proposal emerges as one pushing for the communal use/broadcast of live streaming and Voice over IP in, and across, physical spaces of protest.

&gt;More than simply participating in the broadcast of these technologies from our computers or phones, this available tactic suggests we make visible to the rest of our community the active protests of other communities by ""broadcast demonstrations"" from large screens held in spaces such as downtown parks and recreation areas. The hope is for maximized attention of bystanders, cross-local coordination between communities, and visible, mutual accountability between police authorities and protestors in action.

Today with internet and social media, news spread like wildfire and not only positive news, but mainly shocking news of injustice and brutality. The world is more connected, people fly around much more often and especially young and intelligent people can easier compare how life is in their country and abroad and draw conclusions. We've seen Arab Spring, we're now seeing Ukraine. Also, to add, these things (social media) can and are being used by terrorists and oppressive regimes to shift public opinion their way. ISIS are famous for that, and there are now numerous Russian sponsored trolls on the internet too, master debaters shifting public opinion and marginalizing some facts and fabricating others. One would think that social media give us more freedom, but perhaps they just fabricate our opinion because the rapid response they require, does not allow many people to take a breath and take in information coming from various sides. And coming age of virtual reality will not help to mitigate this issue. On one hand, it can help people demand change from their countries' leadership, on the other these technologies also allow bad actors to recruit people more easily. 

Another thing is the privacy issue. Will we, in the light of Snowden and wikileaks become more secretive and start to encrypt everything, or the storm will pass and we'll get facial recognition cameras everywhere and/or Siri's that always listen? Again, double edged sword- perhaps in time we could have a Minority Report or Person of Interest like system, where computers could analyze data of human interaction and predict potential crimes, also we could just get a Big Brother state where we never feel like being alone with oneself. 

Third thing, rise of early sort-of AI like IBMs Watson. Recently there was a demonstration where Watson's ability to search the net and debate was demonstrated. Certainly a great step towards future, but suppose we use it everyday. Won't we fall into the trap of relying on the same old models and beliefs time and time again, not questioning them, just taking for granted that Watson knows the ''three most popular points in this debate'' and not thinking about alternatives. Sort of like those humans who, blindly trusting faulty GPS, have driven for hundreds of miles to their 20 mile destinations never questioning the machine. 

Space privatization, already later in this decade, at 2020 we'll probably have individuals on private space ship circumnavigating Moon paying money for that (and some even plan a colony on Mars, or circumnavigation of Mars). Planetary Resources are planning to mine asteroids at about that time. Musk will perhaps have his cheap(er) reusable rocket and this will bring space closer to tons of new enterprises. At the moment it doesn't look like militaries of the world are much interested in space, so I wonder what happens if Orbital Sciences, SpaceX etc. go in space with their Silicon Valley backers, land on some moon or asteroid and proclaim it to be independent of Earth laws, to carry out questionable experiments out of government jurisdictions. Will space eventually be hijacked by corporations, as predicted by sci-fi over the years, as if Musk is successful in his venture, his rocket will be cheaper than anything governments have done by several times. It's not like private capital in space is a bad thing, but it could well be with some of them establishing ''colonies'' where there is no constitution or law except the corporate rule.

I wanted to do something a little different than usual in this sub. Hopefully we can spark up some conversation on a very general topic regarding Futurology and the technologies that make up the direction I believe a lot of people would like to see humanity go.  Keep in mind, I would consider myself a part of this community but view certain directions differently and tend to include a certain spiritual aspect into my belief system.  Think of it as a Jason Silva meets Timothy Leary/Terence Mckenna type thought process.  I'm very much a believer in biophilic cities (cities that incorporate sustainable systems with nature) and hope to do my part to help create these new societal constructs.

Anyway, to get more directly to the point I want to address, I believe the infusion of biotech into the human body will ultimately lead our body to atrophy.  I base this belief purely on the idea that our bodies are self-healing and self-regenerating organisms that work beyond our full comprehension of them.  The singularity that futurists talk about where humans have completely become engulfed in the technology that we worship will only get in the way of the purest form of technology that exists: Nature.  One thing I hate seeing is this belief that we need to escape nature rather than work to live in harmony with it.  Some people might say nature is flawed, but I would argue the only flaw is that we choose not to be in balance with it.  Furthermore, this concept should be applied in the way we approach all aspects of technology. I would very much dislike living in the cold, dark, metallic world that gets painted as the cities of the future.

I hope you guys are willing to share some of your points of view because I'm very interested to hear this community's opinion.  Peace!",30,10,False,self,,,,,

Biotechnology is moving fast and within a century it may be possible to stop, reverse, and prevent aging, and allow people to live indefinite lifespans. 

But its not moving THAT fast. Biology is so incredibly complex, its insane. Even with better computers, better software, even AI, its going to take the better part of a century. So I think its a bit naive to think that WE will be the ones that won't have to grow old and die. And by ""we"", I pretty much mean everyone alive today, even children and newborns. We may be the last generation or two that has to die. That's both a depressing and an exhilarating thought. There's something kind of beautiful about being the last ones to die. We get to be the ones that set the stage for our descendants, who will get to enjoy the future that we prepared for them. But we will not be the ones to enjoy it. Its not for us.

Specifically, I would like to do a BSc in Electrical Engineering plus pre-med, followed by a joint MD/PhD (EE) degree. A BSc takes four years, and MD/PhD programs take an average of 7-8 years. On top of that there is a one year internship and a residency requirement of at least five years. All in all, it would take me 18 years to get to my dream job; even if I did away with the PhD and only went for a regular MD, it would still take 14 years to become an oncologist.


My question is twofold:

(1) Will AI/robotics/automation have made most health care jobs redundant (or at least reduced their financial viability) by then, making such an investment (nearly two decades of opportunity cost) futile?

(2) Provided physicians are still needed in the future, is it at all possible to start a healthcare technology company on the side to make use of my technical knowledge while working as a doctor part-time? Would hospitals or private practices be prepared to accommodate me? Would it be financially feasible?

What I see in Africa is they are just bypassing the infrastructure that we currently have in telecommunications and are just entering the cell tower age. We still have the old infrastructure and base our decisions around that. They just skipped our infrastructure and went with modern tech.

With that thought in mind, what would a nation build if they were wanting to build a state-of-the-art transporation infrastructure in the present age (or maybe ten years from now) if they weren't already biased with our existing infrastructure?

I see driverless cars in a city with high speed rails covering the rural spaces in between. Would air travel be neccessary if a nation had a good high speed rail system?

Fortunately, Microsoft appears to have come up with a way to change all that!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2d902g/while_onscreen_keyboards_on_smartphones_have/,aldreno,1407776852,"While on-screen keyboards on smartphones have allowed us to use mobile devices in a variety of ways, there still exist some limitations in this form of computation and there is a need for some changes here and there. Fortunately, [Microsoft appears to have come up with a way to change all that](http://www.tripletremelo.com/microsoft-working-on-touchscreen-technology-with-tectile-feedback/)


A senior researcher in the company claims that thousands of smartphone users are limited by the fact that they have to navigate through a glass screen. In order to overcome that limitation, the researcher has found a way around it.


The software developing company is in the midst of developing a technology for mobile devices that aims to provide a whole new feel to the way you experience typing on your smartphones and tablets. The company wants to [replicate the sensation and feedback](http://www.tripletremelo.com/microsoft-working-on-touchscreen-technology-with-tectile-feedback/) a user would normally get from a physical key on a keyboard while working on any virtual keyboard.


To implement such groundbreaking features, the company has found a way to enable [tactile keyboard](http://www.tripletremelo.com/microsoft-working-on-touchscreen-technology-with-tectile-feedback/) feedback. This sensation will be enabled when the company puts a layer of material under the glass that is able to bend under electronic voltage. This would enable the glass to bend slightly with each key press.


Another method through which the feedback sensation can be generated is electrovibration, which alternates the voltage applied to the glass surface. Using this process, the friction between your fingertip and the glass will change, thereby creating a sticky and smooth sensation. For this sensation to bring any effect, [sensors would have to be placed in the bezel](http://www.tripletremelo.com/microsoft-working-on-touchscreen-technology-with-tectile-feedback/) of a smartphone or tablet.


Microsoft is not the only entity working on this kind of technology. Startup company Tactus had recently announced its iPad case. That particular case can generate physical keys from an Apples tablets flat display. During the Mobile World Congress, electronics manufacturer Fujitsu also demonstrated a sensory touchscreen that allows you to feel different textures.
While the technology is way beyond our reach, it is good to see such implementations, taking place that will further ease and enhance our smartphone usage experience.

But i think that very soon computers will be able to create entertaining media content on their own. It does not even have to be on the level of Mozart or Shakespeare. If crap like Dan Brown's novels or PSYs gangnam style sells like hot cakes, computers can compete with that kind of entertainment probably within next 20-30 years.

And when that happens, the oceans of generated content, endless, intricate, more complex and beautiful than humans could ever create will pour on us. In that future copyright will be useless.

- First the amount of content from machines will quickly overwhelm anything we humans could ever produce. Thus the problem will be not to protect ones intellectual property, but to gain any recognition at all. 

If my iphone 12 creates better stories than Game of Thrones and i do not have to wait 5 years for the next book, why bother with feeble humans creations?

- Second, in a world where machines can create content that competes with what humans create, it will be impossible to prove that this is really your work and not of your computer.

The sad truth is, we are not complex at all. We are very easy to entertain. We are hairless apes and been like that for millions years and will continue to stay hairless apes for the foreseeable future. While machines evolve incredibly fast. Once they pass us in certain abilities, we will never catch up.

And thus we will turn into consumers of a better work than we ourselves could ever hope to create.

Our biggest and final achievement in this case will be computers themselves.

Imagine you are reading your favorite book (while wearing an oculus-rift or similar) and while reading the book the story within the book you are reading is played out around you at the pace you are reading (something like that) using eye-tracking software/algorithims.  

See - simple.  I'm not sure how possible that is but it hit me just now that it might be cool to read a book and have the oculus virtually make the words bigger, etc. via voice command and basically allow the headset to make the old style of reading a bit more interactive.

Just an idea I had, im no dev or anything.

Among those mentioned in the video were agricultural work, automotive manufacturing, transportation (of people and the shipping of goods), grocery store checker, clothing retail, barista, basic programming, filling and filling out paperwork, basic journalism (kinda), legal discovery, diagnostic medicine, and vague creative pursuits. This only represents some of the jobs that are being automated now (we've even automated things like military aircraft). 

The first vocation that sprang immediately to mind for me was that of teacher. While I've watched dozens of lectures from colleges around the world online, and I've participated in online classes, I must say that my brow furls at the idea of teaching being handed off to a fully automated system. I can picture it happening, but we're already dealing with serious problems from the centralization of curriculum and attempts to apply single standards across a system too diverse for them to be successful. 

What do you think? What jobs, if any, do you think we should actively prevent from being automated? Are there any currently automated jobs that we may have jumped the gun on, and we should walk back (leaving aside the question as to whether or not it's feasible to walk the process back)?

 The modern economies operate primarily on one simple idea: citizens must either seek employment or else live deeply uncomfortable lives. With the rapid growth of technology and as automation and artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent, many common jobs will be destroyed. We can already see that today with self-checkout stores, online registration services, etc. Nearly any industrial or manufacturing job will eventually be replaced with a superior non-human worker. It is almost impossible that just as many new technical jobs will step in to fill the void. We must accept the fact that in the future we will have a society where there will be many people who does not have to work to have comfortable life.
On March 22, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson received a short, warning letter from the Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple Revolution. The memo warned the president of threats to the nation beginning with the likelihood that computers would soon create mass unemployment:

&gt; A new era of production has begun. Its principles of
&gt; organization are as different from those of the industrial 
&gt; era as those of the industrial era were different from the 
&gt; agricultural. The cybernation revolution has been brought 
&gt; about by the combination of the computer and the automated 
&gt; self-regulating machine. This results in a system of almost 
&gt; unlimited productive capacity which requires progressively 
&gt; less human labor. Cybernation is already reorganizing the 
&gt; economic and social system to meet its own needs.

Many baby boomers were able to get a good job with no further than high school education. Many of those jobs are blue collar, involving manual labor. Todays society is already vastly different. A good paying job that will put you in the middle class is extremely scarce if you do not seek further education. Even with a higher education degree, jobs are still hard to find if youre not in the right field. We can already see the pattern of how technology has changed the employment field within the last few decades and it is alarmingly accelerating. 
Computers are fast, accurate, and fairly rigid. Human brains are slower, subject to mistakes, and very flexible. Computers have changed the jobs that are available, the skills those jobs require, and the wages the jobs pay. Although many people have argued that machinery has been around since the industrial revolution and it has yet to take over employment.
The problem with dismissing the fears because ""it hasn't happened yet"" is that we would be ignoring the fact that the required intelligence of jobs has been increasing and will continue to increase. When sewing was a career, you could have an IQ of 75 and still do useful work. When every family needed livestock and crops to be tended, it didn't require very much intellect. However, in todays society; how many jobs can an IQ 75 person do? Fast food employee? That's about it, and those are already obsolete jobs. As technology advances, one day robots will be doing all of our farming and construction, we will have a real problem with average intelligence people looking for employment. We will still need humans to fix and engineer the machines, but these tasks will be so advanced that your average auto-mechanics wont be able to do it. Only the intellectual elite would be able to have consistent work if our current social order is preserved into the future. We must accept the fact that one day unemployment will be common and acceptable. 
Even artistic jobs are being made simpler by new technology. Projects in printing, music, and film that once took teams of experts will be available to any kid with a smartphone. We can see that with instagram filters and Photoshop. Most people are able to purchase a camera at an affordable price to make their pictures looks completely professional already. In the past, only the professional photographers can afford to buy equipment to take high quality images. 
This revolution of technology has many negatives. Unemployment will rapidly rise and many people will lose their jobs. Newer generations will have a smaller field of career paths to take. A lot of the human element will be gone when conducting businesses and it could make the society become less connected. It will also be hard to justify errors that are result from the technology itself. What if computer driven cars causes five thousands accident per year because of system errors while human driven cars will cause thirty thousands, will this tradeoff be acceptable? 
However the revolution can also bring many positive. People will have a lot more leisure time to do what they want in life without having to do tedious jobs. Jobs that no one wants to do can be eliminated. Efficiency of production and service can be greatly improved with better technologies. We already 3d printers than can print out whatever it is we desire at a click of a mouse. 
With all the pros and cons of advancement in technology, we need to understand that human work will increasingly shift toward two kinds of tasks: solving problems for which standard operating procedures do not currently exist, and working with new information acquiring it, making sense of it, communicating it to others. If we can understand this fact and adapt to it to improve the function of society, we can make the world a better place. 
We need to change the traditional paradigm that we must work to survive. It's so deeply ingrained in our culture that there fairness is created by money. We live and work, and the harder we work, the better our lives become by earning more money and having value to society. This paradigm works extremely well when there are a lot of work to be done, we acknowledge the system by rewarding those who are the most productive, and punishing those who are 'lazy'. This sits well with our ideas of fairness and reward/punishment for those who succeed/fail at their societal obligations. This paradigm must change because one day, we will not be able to work hard enough to make money, because you are never going to be as fast or as effective or as cheap as a robot. 
We cannot predict with accuracy the future occupations that and the rate advancement in technology. Nonetheless, it is a safe bet that the human labor market will likely to be completely overcome by technology. We must be able to embrace when technology is ready to replace humans in jobs. It is important to make sure that we can adapt to a new perspective of looking at how society operates so we can make the world a better place.

With all the pros and cons of advancement in technology, we need to understand that human work will increasingly shift toward two kinds of tasks: solving problems for which standard operating procedures do not currently exist, and working with new information acquiring it, making sense of it, communicating it to others. If we can understand this fact and adapt to it to improve the function of society, we can make the world a better place. 


We need to change the traditional paradigm that we must work to survive. It's so deeply ingrained in our culture that there fairness is created by money. We live and work, and the harder we work, the better our lives become by earning more money and having value to society. This paradigm works extremely well when there are a lot of work to be done, we acknowledge the system by rewarding those who are the most productive, and punishing those who are 'lazy'. This sits well with our ideas of fairness and reward/punishment for those who succeed/fail at their societal obligations. This paradigm must change because one day, we will not be able to work hard enough to make money, because you are never going to be as fast or as effective or as cheap as a robot. 


We cannot predict with accuracy the future occupations that and the rate advancement in technology. Nonetheless, it is a safe bet that the human labor market will likely to be completely overcome by technology. We must be able to embrace when technology is ready to replace humans in jobs. It is important to make sure that we can adapt to a new perspective of looking at how society operates so we can make the world a better place.

There are entire political philosophies that explicitly reject the idea of human beings 'getting things for free.' Regardless of how boring, useless, and menial the labor appears to be these forces will justify the necessity of making people w.o.r.k.  

Our future will look closer to *Elysium.*  This film repeatedly highlighted a level of robotics and artificial intelligence achieved in that society.  There was a reason.  These machines comprehended sarcasm, sophisticated orders, and even medical diagnostics.  They accomplished super-human feats without apparently needing a recharge. 

So who was doing all the menial and dangerous labor?  Humans. 

Why would we expect a future that is any different than portrayed in *Elysium*?  Robots are expensive and human life is cheap.  

I do not see automation or robotics completely eliminating the human element in work.  What we will see - and this has been repeated ad nausea - is what occurred to agriculture. Over time fewer and fewer where needed to feed more and more. This same cycle will repeat with one major caveat - the jobs of the future will require advanced skill-sets that not everyone can or will be able to comprehend.  Remember the failings of Eugenics?  General human intelligence is regressive to the mean.

Then we get to a version of the guaranteed minimum income as the answer for worker displacement. It will never happen. Monetary policy will be shifted to erode the purchasing power of the fund.  Game over. 

I believe that the oncoming age of robotics and AI is unstoppable, and frankly, I applaud the developments.  We need more than minimum incomes and education to meet the tremendous social challenges that are ahead.

When they become commonplace, you will be able to walk out of the supermarket with bags full of groceries and scanners will detect every item and instantly charge your credit card, then email you your receipt.

This technology may also enable robot helpers around the house. Instead of trying to make a robot with complex algorithms that try to recognise objects, like a can of coke in the refrigerator for example, every product in your home could have RFID tags and the robot would have a scanner that knows where everything is in the house. So say you want a bag of chips from the cupboard, you ask the bot, it scans, detects the chips, navigates it's way to the cupboard ([you've already shown it how to open it](http://www.designnews.com/document.asp?doc_id=274106&amp;dfpPParams=ind_182,industry_machinery,kw_robotics,aid_274106&amp;dfpLayout=article)), uses obstacle detection to reach without knocking anything else and grabs the chips. And because the RFID tag conveys information, the bot will know the shape, size, texture, etc, of it.

The bot wouldn't just be for the lazy, it could also help the elderly by bringing them bottles of pills on time, or fetching their wheelchair. Because every item has an RFID tag, the bot knows exactly what to look for based on it's automatically updated internet database.

You could also put tags on things, then get the bot to make a three dimensional scan of the object so it would then be in its database for future reference.

And it could have a vacuum cleaner underneath so it cleans the house as it moves around.

I see where these things come to use but I also see where these things have downfalls. Sure, a phone that predicts when you should leave work to catch the bus in order to get home in time for your favorite show sounds cool but I'm not the person to inherently trust a corporation with that kind of data. I see a future where we have no opt-out for these kinds of services and it worries me. 

I can already see it happening in the car industry. In newer cars I don't have much of a choice if I don't want a car that has possible exploits, Bluetooth, etc. So I'll be forced to use a system I really don't like. Many of the new features are great and all but they have so many risks and possible privacy invasions involved that I want to avoid them like the plague. And anyway we have been driving for a long time now, a competent driver should be able to drive without all of the gimmicks that come with cars now.

I look for a self-reliant future.

I hope for genetically engineered people, whose females have wider hips to accommodate holding young for 18 months, and the infants will be smaller at birth to fit through the birth canal. Once out, they would grow swiftly, probably through breastfeeding to get the personalized and intense nutrients needed.

Not only would we gestate for longer, but we would be able to see more colors- with vision much like a mantis shrimp...

People here, and on reddit in general, seem to believe that the job loss created by automation will result in some sort of great systemic change that will result in the creation of a society where people generally won't have to work, and will have great amounts of leisure. Time after time when this is discussed, this conclusion seems to pop up. Which is funny, because to me it doesn't seem very valid at all, for one very important reason-the problem of scarcity.

People will always want more. To put things in perspective, imagine the worries of the average peasant before the Industrial Revolution, and an average person in a modern economy today. The latter is alien to the former: the peasant would mostly be concerned about rainfall, crops, bugs, etc. His idea of a perfect world would be one in which abundant amount of crops could be produced with hardly any effort, and where he could have ample time for leisure. Well, that time is now. In the U.S. right now, less than 2 percent of the population works in agriculture, and yet enough food is produced for the U.S. to actually be a net exporter of it. And yet, we don't feel like utopians. Why? Simply because we have new wants. I, personally, would find my peasant counterpart's idea of a perfect world to be a hellhole, a place with no modern medicine, modern entertainment, (relatively) clean food or water, ability to travel or vacation, education, books, or internet. The fact of the matter is that we can never be satisfied, and I can guarantee that people in the ""perfect"" society of the future will probably be just as unhappy as us. The moment good change happens, we become accustomed to it, and before you know it we will want more good change. 

It is this problem of scarcity that is the reason why I believe that there will never be a point where humanity won't have to work. When we talk of automation satisfying our desires, we seem to forget that they are only satisfying *our* desires, and not the desires of those in the future who'll be used to it.

Moreover, since we are always discovering new wants, each new leap in technology will result in many more possible industries to satisfy those wants. What new possible industries could come from this automation revolution? Well, I don't know. That's like asking our peasant to predict computers, Internet, cars, films, television, electricity, etc. None of us know what we would want after the automation revolution, since we haven't discovered those wants yet. However, I know new industries will form, since our new wants would require new industries that can't be staffed by computers and robots. Why? Well, any wants that can be fulfilled by computers and robots would have probably been fulfilled already by the computers and robots. You will become accustomed to what is fulfilled already, and will demand more, and new industries will form to meet that demand. And if these new industries are eventually mechanized? Well, the whole process starts over: we discover new wants that can't be fulfilled by current industries the way they are at the time, and new ones form. 

Skeptical of this? Think of the peasant again. He may *believe* that his perfect world will satisfy him, but rest assured it won't. If he keeps up with world developments and lives long enough, then he will soon want the new technologies he reads about-better medicine, improvements in farming technology, new types of crops, and eventually, electricity and a motor car, things he could never have dreamt of when envisioning his perfect world. At any rate, he will take what is easily provided for granted.

Those who believe that machines will eventually do better than humans at ""everything"" simply have a limited scope of what ""everything"" really is, the limited scope same in nature to the peasant's when imagining his perfect world. How could we possibly guess the wants of the people of the future? We don't-rather, we simply take our wants today and blindly assume that they will share them. The problem of scarcity shows that this will not be the case.

There is question of what would happen when machines come to the point when they are virtually indistinguishable from people, and then I simply ask, ""What's the matter, then?"" At that point, we should simply just consider them people, and treat them like us. If they get smarter than us, than we can become smarter than them, too. After all, if something can comprehend something more complex than the human brain, then it can surely comprehend the human brain, and improve it in the same manner it improved the machines. Every step an automaton takes in front of humanity will be easily matched by a step taken by humanity, and for this humans and machines will remain mostly at a state of parity.

At any rate, that's what I believe. Feel free to criticise this as you want.",21,4,False,self,,,,,

A decent portion of the population, I would wager, have some to most of their identity's wrapped up in their careers-  the thought that we'll all just kick back and enjoy life seems overly optimistic.

Does anyone else see this as a slow descent into dystopia vs. utopia?

And of course stuff like eye augmentations. Having 8K resolution augmented reality glasses and contacts and hopefully someday eye implants. And ear implants. And maybe things like haptic implants and dermal OLEDs.

But when we can, I think one of the best places to modify and augment would be the spinal cord. It seems like a good place to put a computer, or many conputers, too. There's only so much room in the head. If I was going to put lots of computers in my body, it would be on the spinal cord.

There's lots of great things to do there, so I'm excited for it. There's lots of spinal problems in people's lives, like pain and paralysis. And augmenting it would have so many possibilities. The spinal cord is kind of like a computer motherboard, after all. You could use it to directly modify the whole body experiences things. Like augmented reality or virtual reality. Or you could make people stronger or more healthy by adding monitors or custom options for your body in how it behaves. It would also be easier to become taller or shorter which I'm sure /r/short and /r/tall would like.

So I'm really excited for all progress in this area. I'd love to interface with augmented reality in this way. But how close are we to it?",10,19,False,self,,,,,

There would most likely be heavy competition for these jobs.

In the 1930s, Keyes predicted that in a century we would be working a 15 hour workweek. However good that may sound, the problem may be unemployment, or simply too much leisure time to consume.
Ideally, automation would lead to a shorter workweek, and higher wages for those employed, due to reduction in costs, and specialized (human)workers. 

I think that, however and whenever this happens, wages for these high skill high wage workers would probably stagnate, or even lower, due to over-saturation of people with degrees in the workforce. It is quite possible that employers will cherry-pick the most qualified, and decide to pay them less than the worker may desire, or are deserved, under the pressure of paying off student loans(We see this even now).

I think guilds/unions  would seem a bit archaic in 2030 (in my opinion, they seem that way now), So I would like to see something different: an overhaul in public education in both mandatory and post-secondary institutions to enable and educate our society to become producers, rather than consumers, because consuming product is automatic(we all consume), but producing goods and services takes action. Then, over time, we can automate those goods and services, and we could continue this cycle indefinitely.

Troll or lunatic, this is a very dangerous block of text. It's a the first Top Comment I could see on CGP Grey's automation video. The reason this thought is dangerous is that if the wrong person or people were to be influenced by it, it could cause someone to vote against, spread misinformation about, demonize, legislate into the ground, or otherwise disrupt the progress of automation. 


All of our new technology and automation will soon bring about the end of people dying of hunger through a combination of vertical farming to greatly expand the amount of harvestable crops per square mile, advanced GMO techniques to increase the speed at which crops grow, increase their size, lower water requirements, and increase their resistances to all sorts of threats, and artificial intelligence to work tirelessly in growing, harvesting, transporting, stocking, and handling the process of getting food to humans in every other possible way.


Due to this, any attempts to stop or slow the progress of these technologies is one of the purest forms of evil and could cause the deaths of millions from starvation during the period of time it was delayed. Troll or lunatic, something has to be done about these people. CGP Grey is a moderately popular channel on Youtube, and it's disturbing that this would be the first comment someone would see.",40,0,False,default,,,,,

The droid has sensors that stimulate your brain so all your senses are in tact. You could customize features like strength and flexibility. You could add a jet pack. Heck if you wanted you could have 4 legs or none and roll around on wheels.

If you could transplant your brain into a customizable droid where you could change physical features would you?

Please share any thoughts you have on my ramblings. (CGP Grey - Humans Need Not Apply: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PqS557XQU&amp;list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w) 

1. Economics - no jobs = no consumer spending, no profits, no economy. Robots don't buy stuff.
2. Robot ethics councils are in the works now due to the work of Google, Asimov, and Elon Musk who have all supported the idea of an organization on robot ethics. There's also the idea of building an independent smaller robot to man the off switch on the bigger, possibly genocidal robot.
3. Get big money out of politics. Point 1 is useless if corporations can profit from automation while the people suffer. It will enable fast, non-gridlocked response time for political action in regulating machines. We basically need to ensure corporations don't thrive when unemployment is high and regulate the production and use of AI tech. Thus, the people who profit from automation can't be calling the shots in DC.
4. Positives: Instead of an apocalypse, we may be faced with more free time for adventure, exploration, creativity, love, and fun. More like Star Trek than Wall-E.
5. Program without absolutes, a drive for expansion, or self preservation. It will moderate murderous thoughts like the Geth which didn't exterminate the Quarians. No sense of self preservation, no pain, and no fear of death means we can program them to accept it if we choose to use the kill switch. No sense of manifest destiny or a drive to expand means they will be content to peacefully exist without encroaching on humanity.
6. Space exploration will save us. Computers/AI are the current frontier. Space will be the final frontier. It will divert science and venture capital to interplanetary mining and travel. 1 asteroid is worth trillions and space, unlike the earth's frontier, will be an infinite safety valve for our species. The projected start of the industry might be catalyzed by the end of Moore's law in the early 2020s, offering a seamless transition. 
7. End of Moore's law. Moore's law is predicted to end in the early 2020s as transistors become only a few atoms across, which is as small as they can possibly get. After that, better algorithms, 3D chips, and other creative workarounds will extend computer power a little more. Molecular, genetic, and quantum computers are thought to be between 20-100 years off and according to those researching them, they only speed up certain types of computations, like prime factorization, not game quality or AI.
8. History, Cosmology, and the logistic curve. Advances in agriculture staved off Malthus's predictions. That was the base of the industrial logistic curve. The end of Moore's law signals it flattening out. All Civilizations must follow this curve or at least one synthetic race would have wiped out the galaxy by now if technology were exponential. Systems are saved by a logistic curves all the time. Similarly, we saw the same curve with nuclear arms. Just like the nuclear holocaust, what once seemed like an assured doomsday, will soon be a distant memory as fate (fiscal insolvency of communism, caution in the face of Mutually Assured Destruction) and our actions (test-ban treaties/diplomacy) flatten the logistic curve and pull us back from the brink.

Especially automation vis a vis agriculture in poor nations.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2dsfie/importance_of_legislation_in_restricting/,theofficeisreal,1408268076,"I had this thought, that even though we say, robots will take our jobs, there *can* be legislation bought about which will restrict this. And although I am not sure about the developed nations with their lobbies etc, I live in India, where a majority of population, between 60-70% still practices agriculture. The politicians listen when so many people speak. And a mass-based, activist legislation is not a far cry here. If they don't, they will be voted out of power. 
So although technology may creep into our jobs, from manufacturing to agriculture to services, there can be laws made which will restrict it, simply to not destroy the current job market till the alternative is found. 

However good robots may be built, if people and politicians will it, the bots may just rest in their warehouses. I see this as a possible scenario, especially in developing (and democratic) countries, where the need to keep people fed, occupied and secure is paramount. India, for example already rejected the WTO deal in face of sustained global pressure. India, China, Asian/African countries rejecting robotic advancements? That seems possible to me from where I am seeing it. (India, quite a poor country, agriculture, manual labor, comprising an overwhelming majority of population)

   I believe the biggest reason that ""the age of leisure"" has not arrived has mostly to do with human attitude towards work.   This attitude is that people must spend a significant amount of time working.    This attitude then leaks into other areas;  if we are spending a significant amount of time in work, which is often just drudgery,  then how can we actually innovate?  So it takes away from the time to do that and the energy that is not only physical but both emotional and psychological to do that.    The second,  and something I believe could have been innovated out,  is the technological advancement so that humans do not need to do the work.   This is rapidly changing.

When my parents were young finishing high school would give you a good middle class job and that included any trade.

When I finished high school to be able to afford a comfortable living you would need to have completed a tertiary diploma in a white collar field i.e.  accounting,   law,  finance etc.

Now we have technology that will be able to replace many of the white collar jobs.   Thus we are very close to having machines to do the blue collar work and the white collar work.   Thus what is left  is a very small amount of jobs.

So those 30 people  will not have the non mechanized work as that will also be done by machines.    This is where a basic income will have to come in or we will economically collapse 

The ""age of leisure"" is not going to be a choice.  It will happen and then we will need to start to deal with how humans react to an age that has no goals other than the ones we put on ourselves and those would have no consequences when we do not meet them.    

How do we deal with that?  

My proposal would be that basic income is actually tied in with working at least 1 day a week in something.    

**Please note the example below is just that an example and not intended to be argued whether or not the chosen career will still exist.  I believe it will due to the human element and working with children others may not. **

For example imagine an elementary/primary school  each class per day  would have a teacher and 5 helpers.     Now the teacher would be a trained and paid employee who works 1 day a week,  that is right people would only work 1 day per week as there would be that few jobs requiring humans.   The 5 helpers would be police checked but other than that as long as they are of reasonable intelligence would be able to help in the class under supervision of the teacher.  Now the 5 helpers day in the class would be their commitment to get the basic income.  The teacher would also get the basic income and a wage due to her taking on the lesson plans,  marking and formulating and understanding the policies of the classroom.  But with a basic income what is stopping the teacher and the 5 helpers just not turning up?     What would stop it is if the 5 helpers quit they would not get their basic income  and if the teacher quite she would not get hers.     That is the basic income is actually tied to some sort of commitment and would be done for two reasons.   Firstly to insure businesses and societal institutions do not collapse because people are  feeling a little lazy and secondly to give people a goal a commitment they must meet.   The second will, in my opinion, be the most important because without it I can see a society that may well seem satisfied at first but will over time become depressed due to not having any commitments to meet.     


I am looking forward to the time singularity comes and machines are as good as humans,  but I believe there will be challenges as we get significantly more leisure time and those challenges will be a lot more psychological than I am hearing discussed here. 


Wish to edit to say if the basic income is removed it will be replaced with a significantly lower income but enough to feed,  much like social security today.    ",12,3,False,self,,,,,

Not in the sense of artificial intelligence, but possibly using AI, could a computer design a computer that is better than itself?

Easiest way I can think to give an example is something like (somehow) using a quad core processor to design an 8 core processor. (I know these already exist up to 16 cores iirc). With little to no instruction on what to do, meaning a human isn't utilizing the tool to create a better version.

## Liquid Democracy:

A system where you can freely and at any time either vote directly (aka direct democracy) or delegate another person (who can delegate it to another person) to vote on your behalf. It's good when people don't have the time to vote.

**Question: What do you think about these two ideas? Could we possibly use either or both at the same time?**

edit: 

Or would a hybrid of technocracy, representative/delegation democracy, and lottery democracy be better?

Primarily pertaining to human interaction. The technology has been proven and will be available in certain areas within the next decade. More in depth into certain areas of interaction.

1. Law enforcement. Traffic violations and speeding tickets will be a thing of the past. You would have to assume that car chases would also disappear. Assuming that law enforcement would have the power to shut down vehicle #123 remotely. Traffic control could all be monitored remotely. If for some reason an accident did occur on a major highway. Traffic could be diverted around the incident. So instead of spending the majority of their time on Traffic incidents. Police would be more available for Service and Criminal cases. The added effect that it would take on police departments budgets. As an income and cost.(maintaining their current and future vehicle fleets)

2. Manufacturing and Industrial.The automotive industry will be deeply effected. The current infrastructure that industrialized countries have developed to meet the need of the automobile of the 1930's through 1950's will have to change. Roadways will have to be adapted. The mechanical aspect would change as well. Would anyone have insight on how it would effect mechanic's and auto repair? How would it effect auto insurance as well? ""O our cars bumped each other. They've already automatically submitted information pertaining to the incident to the corporate in charge with the vehicles. If you indicate that you are physically injured. An automated ambulance will be there momentarily. 

3. Lifestyle changes. No more drivers licenses? No more DUI's. Or worrying about Grandma driving to the grocery store. Children being picked up by automated vehicles leading for sports and activities. Leading to less interaction with their parents and faster maturation that we already have?
 
4. Unintended consequences. The potential use of automated vehicles for terrorist purposes. Automated vehicle car bomb(s). Gaining control over the automated vehicles operating systems and/or guidance. Potential for errors within the system.(Excluding external actors). 

I wanted to hear what the community thought about some of the issues, insights and factors that could also be effected. All of this new technology is fantastic. But how will it change our society and ourselves?   ",11,6,False,self,,,,,

Now what'll happen when AR glasses come out that look like normal glasses? Will people start assaulting or banning people with normal glasses out of paranoia? Will people that need glasses be looked at with the same stigma that they could be recording them? I realize that companies will probably make them distinctive, perhaps with a light like current GG's or a distinctive frame, but that doesn't mean others couldn't come out or be modified to look like glasses by determined tinkerers.

As a consequence, high unemployment will become the new normal, and the few humans who shall hold jobs will be owners of the capital, like CEOs and senior executives, as well as genius computer programmers and engineers who will be designing the next generations of robots (assuming robots couldn't design their successors themselves). To remedy the issue of automation-caused high unemployment, many Redditors suggest a basic income should be implemented, so as to allow everyone to survive.

Yet, I can't help but feel that automation will have unintended consequences, that even the most intelligent people of today can't foresee. For example, in the 60s and 70s, when astronauts landed on the Moon and we began to send probes to study the solar system, many thought that, within a few decades, we would have colonies on the Moon and Mars. If Reddit existed at the time, the idea that we would soon have Moon colonies would probably have been as popular as the idea that robots will take our jobs is in 2014. But there are no colonies yet.

How long, if ever, until we come up with what one could regard as Pill food? With that, I mean a pill, which would include a set amount of nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fat, etc.). Would this even be possible? I understand with the current technology, this wouldn't be, but what about in the future?

Is this even a concept, or a goal you can call it, within the industry?

Pyrosequencing is the process of DNA sequencing using light. This will undoubtedly be very cheap and available to everyone in the next decade or so. 
Since I am in no sense a science expert, I would like to ask about this process. Will it be possible to shine this powerful pyrosequencing light onto any organism (ie. plant, animal etc) and retrieve its information? If so, what kind of information?

My own thoughts were that we would be able to walk through the forest and walk up to a plant, retrieve its genome and understand how our personal body would react to it... Since, of course, at this time everyone will have their own DNA sequenced. 

Can anyone tell me if I am far off?

Once we get a little better at cellular hacking, we could conceivably secure human reproduction with cryptography.  What is reproduction but a one-way data transfer?

The male's sperm could be encrypted with the female's public key, and digitally signed and hashed.  This has some interesting consequences, such as that both parties would have to consent to a successful pregnancy.  The male could only impregnate the female whose public key he is using, and the female could white-list certain men.

Also, cryptographic hashing could prevent errors that may occur in the transfer.

It is very tempting to apply well-known public/private key systems to develop a system which does this. Let's say, for example, that some authority holds private keys that correspond with different dates in the future. That entity could publicly distribute the public encryption keys (to encrypt) to everyone, and only publish the private keys (to decrypt) at the specified date they are associated with.

The more I think about this, the more I realize that it could be much higher impact than what I've imaged, but also vastly more difficult to implement than I thought. If some authority could be trusted to do exactly what I laid out, then the implementation would be trivial. However, trust itself is not trivial. It's a fun mental mind game to think about what could be used in place of an authority. Obviously, there is a lot of information which will be publicly available in the future which is not available today, but the problem is that we have no way to developing a public key which would correspond to that (currently unknown) future information. You couldn't base the scheme on the weather in 2048, because there's no way to develop an *encryption* key for that data.

Let's consider the potential applications of such a system, assuming it could be implemented. You could have a bittorent based sharing service where people upload their time-locked data, no matter how large, and the user community could aggregate these future messages and re-upload packages of 1,000s of them bundled together (according to size and release date). With data redundancy checks, there is no bitrot. Our current tools are sufficient to keep the encrypted data virtually immortal. Then on a scheduled private key release day, you can open a bonanza of secrets sent from the past, with possibly no restriction on the sensitivity of the info, since the people who encrypted it could have died of old age!

Here is a quote from a github project which touched on some of the issues I'm talking about:

http://tuftsdev.github.io/DefenseOfTheDarkArts/students_works/final_project/wclarkson.pdf

&gt; Consider a scenario where an individual has information which is currently incriminating, the release of which the individual wants to guarantee at a later date. A criminal may want to release a memoir about escapades for which they were not punished, but which must not be released before the statute of limitations has been exceeded. If they were to retain an unencrypted copy of the memoir, they would risk its discovery. With time-lock cryptography, however, the safe release of the information can be guaranteed. Mark Felt, famously known as the informant for the Watergate Scandal, could have encrypted a confession of his identity to be decrypted half a century later to ensure that the world could know his secret, in case he had passed away before being able to reveal it.

Aren't there some very important historical facts which can't possibly be preserved *except* through such a scheme? One comment that lingers with me about the George W. Bush administration versus Richard Nixon is that we have reason to be concerned that the record will be wiped so thoroughly clean that we'll never really know what happened.

However, the project I linked to doesn't provide any deeper insights about the authority mechanism, or circumvention thereof. Some possibilities which are obvious are:

 - use Bitcoin hashes, so that when new keys are discovered, then can be used to unlock secrets, thereby piggybacking on a community of people trying to solve cryptographic puzzles
 - just make a puzzle so complicated that we're sure it will take many decades before it can be broken

Both of these are really bad in my opinion. As far as I know, you can't even really predict the order of the new bitcoin solutions. Critically, there would be uncertainty in when it is solved. If it could be 1 year as easily as 50 years in the future, then this isn't a good method, and I think this may be the case for something referenced to bitcoin data. The option of a sufficiently advanced encryption puzzle is more secure in a sense, but it's also wasteful of processor power (which people may never commit in order to unlock one specific secret of unknown utility), as well as failing to give an exact future time of unlocking.

I'm forced to conclude that using some trusted authority is clearly the superior option, but only if we can trust our institutions to not prematurely divulge the secret keys to the NSA or something. Given recent leaks, this seems unlikely. Alternatively, a black hat option is appealing because it's viable to hide from the authorities, but there's nothing keeping them from peeping at the secrets in the hopes of personal profit. Maybe you could just hide the private keys on a satellite in orbit which can't be tampered with (this is my favorite solution).

Seems like an important issue for the future. Our ability to remember the past is critical to how we act going forward. Such a system doesn't currently exist to my knowledge, so this would only be applicable to recording ""future history"" - the history of time which is still the future to us right now.",8,6,False,self,,,,,

- Google
- Facebook
- Microsoft
- Apple

So with these examples established, my question is - do you think that as we develop cooler ""futuristic"" technologies, new companies will rise? Recently, the trend seems to be that the established companies simply buy out new companies - for example, Oculus VR is, in my opinion, a cool, futuristic technology. However, Facebook acquired Oculus as soon as it began to look promising. Thus, even if Oculus becomes the next big thing - something as widely used as smartphones, it will be the Facebook Oculus Rift, not the Oculus Oculus Rift.

There's also the issue of resources for developing new tech. We also have things like the Google self-driving cars. Super futuristic, super cool (just my opinion!), but Google owned - at least partially because Google has an insane amount of resources in comparison with a small startup. They can simply afford to pump money into research projects like that, and don't really need immediate returns. On the flipside, a typical startup group would not necessarily be able to spend years working fulltime on something with no money from it. I'm not saying I don't like Google, I think they're a great company! Just pointing out a ""futuristic"" technology whose development is, as of now, dictated by an already established tech company.

Will this pattern of big companies preventing small companies from rising continue, or will the future be changed by companies we haven't heard of yet?

What if everyone (and this apparatus is arbitrary and completely made-up for the purpose of example in this case) wore special contact lenses that were always recording video and downloading it to a hard drive implanted in their bodies?

The hard drive would be completely secure, encrypted, and only accessible voluntarily by its owner. If they so decided, they could release footage that they had recorded, and it could be used as evidence in court cases.

This could lead to huge drop in crime, but would it be worth it? There would be a lot of privacy implications, and the question here is if the benefits of such a technology would outweigh them. Also, outside of crime reduction, there would be a lot of other applications, too, like the ability to create a life montage (like in ""The Final Cut"" with Robin Williams).

For those of you who are really taking an interest in automation and how it will impact our lives, I wonder what measures you are taking to remain relevant in an automated workforce? 

I have a job which I think is 'relatively' safe from ever being entirely automated, but I'm very aware that there will be innovations that we never saw coming that could change that.

Thus far it seems the best bet is to focus on improving creative and emphatic skills (Like working in the care industry) as a way of navigating around automation. 

What I am doing right now is simply reading as much as I can about futurology. I know many of the predictions wont bare any fruit, of course, but as a broad strategy I think it's a great way to prepare.

So what are you doing right now to ensure that you have a great career when work as we know it changes forever? ",98,51,False,self,,,,,

Correcting Reddit's Chronic Misunderstanding of Technocracy; A Commentary from a Classical Technocrat with Citations from an Original Technocratic Philosopher - REDUX,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2emycc/it_keeps_happening_correcting_reddits_chronic/,[deleted],1409069148,"Hello, I'm /u/aychteeteepee_2 - Web Designer &amp; Developer by profession and Technocratic Scholar by interest. I'd like to help Reddit understand what may one day become the structure of our civilization's future.

Recently, the Reddit frontpage was graced with a post from /r/todayilearned regarding the Technocracy Movement of the late 1930s, USA. As a staunch technocrat myself, I was excited to see a discussion on this topic since I believe that establishing a technocratic society might become one of the most important humanistic goals our civilization will seek to attain this century. However I was met with deep disappointment as the thread devolved over some 1500+ posts into what amounted to base bickering over, essentially, totalitarianism vs. democracy. Apart from the umbrella argumentation over this irrelevant and ultimately false dichotomy, there was also an obvious and abiding ignorance of any actual proposed or conceptualized features of a technocratic society by the formative minds on the subject circa the turn of the 19th century.

This is an unfortunate affect of almost everyone having received what little knowledge they have on the subject from the related Wikipedia articles, which are almost entirely bereft of any valid explanation or exposition of the true nature of the technocratic philosophy. While I would prefer if the Wikipedia were a worthwhile source of information on this subject, I simply do not have the time or inclination to combat the hubris and latent ignorance and bias of other editors towards establishing an encyclopedically valid article. I do have it in my power and interest to clarify some things to the fine subscribers of /r/Futurology though, and I sincerely hope you enjoy the following commentary.

It's important that we establish a rapid understanding of the central trichotomy that exists between the various uses of the relevant terminology and verbiage, as they present a barrier to coming to an easy understanding of this topic:

* The original technocratic philosophies of the late 19th and earth 20th century technocrats; These are the formative and most visionary works on the subject and, in my opinion, remain the only valid sources for understanding the technocratic modality. Early authors include Edward Bellamy, Thorstein Veblen, Henry Gantt, and William H. Smyth; With later contributions from luminaries like Bertrand Russell and Buckminster Fuller.

* The aforementioned social movement of the depression era United States initiated by the Technocracy, Inc. organization, as featured in the /r/todayilearned post; A mildly technofascist regime that deviated heavily from the formative conception of a technocracy from prior technocratic visionaries. The primary proponents of this form of technocracy, notable for it's moderately authoritarian/technofascist aesthetic, were the highly visible and influential personalities of Howard Scott and M. King Hubbert, as well as later contributors building off of the work of these two, such as Wilton Ivie.

* The modern re-engineering of the concepts of ""technocrats"" and ""technocracy"" by the mainstream and conspiratorially-minded fringe media; Generally these terms have now come to mean ""Anyone that is highly skilled, and not necessarily in an empirically valid discipline (e.g. banking/finance, business, law), who influences or controls public policy descisions"" and ""A government or governmental agency notably beholden to such people"" for the terms ""technocrat"" and ""technocracy"" respectively. Ubiquitous examples of these usages are seen in any contemporary mainstream news publication or media, and in a sociopathic context, denounced by fringe media personalities like Alex Jones.

It's easy to see from this trichotomy that the semantics and implications of the terms ""technocrat"" and ""technocracy"" can easily become clouded for the layperson wishing to discuss or debate the subject. Therefore I propose adopting the following conventions when discussing this topic:

* ""Technocracy"" proper is to be considered germane to the conceptual and propositional domain of the original technocratic philosophers, and a ""technocrat"" as someone who supports such ideals, or referring to the hypothetical class of technocrats within this original vision for technocracy.

* ""Technate technocracy,"" ""TNAT technocracy,"" or ""Tech, Inc."" is to be used when referring to the American Technocracy Movement of the 1930s, owing to their central thesis of establishing self-sustaining ""technates"" in certain geographical areas, namely North America.

* When referring to the contemporary mainstream and fringe media abuse of the relevant terminology, one only need use the phrase ""bullshit,"" or ""fucking bullshit"" for those who prefer a slightly stronger aesthetic.

So, what then is the ""true"" nature of Technocracy? Consider the following quotations from William H. Smyth's formative work ""Technocracy: Social Universals"" Part I:

&gt; Control by others, then, is antithetical to the [democratic] ideals for which we have waged this last, the greatest, and, it is hoped, the final bloody contest for self-government.

&gt; Control is equally antithetical to our ideals of Self-government whether the control is exercised by ""others"" characterized by the Instinct to Live and breed  the Masses; or whether the control is exercised by ""others"" characterized by the Instinct to Make  the Skilled Artizan; or whether the control is exercised by ""others"" urged by the Instinct of Mastery  the Employers; or whether the control is exercised by ""others"" under their dominating Acquisitive Instinct  the Financiers.

&gt; Indeed, the concept: control by ""others,"" is an idea inherent in and appropriate only to now discredited Autocracy  a concept which the War has rendered an obsolete ideal  if we are yet intelligent enough to profit by its costly teaching. To be rationally consistent this ""control"" concept should be as absent as it is obsolete (in fact and effect) in our inevitable [technocratic] reconstruction.

Prior to this passage, Smyth had been reflecting on the United States' participation World War I and pointed out the obvious and absurd failings of Capitalism under war-time stress, leading to this passage about the undesirability of hefting the yoke of coercive control upon oneself, from any other party at all. I begin with this citation because it's an explicit denunciation of authority, including the authority of the Masses.

This is a key concept that runs throughout the formative technocratic works, and stands in direct opposition to the absolutely fallacious argumentation by technocracy detractors that it's an aristocratic, authoritarian, or most absurdly, a potentially totalitarian sociopolitical philosophy. This passage and those preceding it are also important in establishing that technocracy is explicitly a post-capitalist (and, as the concept is developed, post-scarcity) socio-econo-political ideology. This further refutes the common fallacy of believing that merely having scientists and engineers (or ""highly skilled"" in whatever other discipline, e.g. Finance) inhabiting political office constitutes a de facto technocracy, e.g. China's PRC Politburo being comprised of mostly degreed engineers.

Smyth continues in Part II:

&gt; It would seem that with the advent of Experimental Science occurred an epoch in the history of our Race; an epochal event to which none other is comparable, except possibly the acquisition of Self-consciousness itself. Indeed it would seem that these two super-significant events  so unthinkably far apart in time  are, in essence, closely related.

&gt; By coming to Self-consciousness the Brute became Man  potentially, though not actually, a self-determining being. By the coming of Science  based upon the idea of the rationality and neutrality of ""nature""  potential Freedom ceased to be a mere possibility and became a realizable Ideal: To Make or Break Shackles. Science and Technology are, however, but tools in Man's hands; tools wherewith to make effective Man's transcendent privilege: Freedom of Choice.

&gt; Groups of men (like Germany) may use these great instrumentalities to forge social shackles upon themselves, and upon Humanity the bondage of autocracy. Or, they may use them to make human Liberty effective, as is the ideal of the United States. Human beings, whether as individuals, or as groups, or as nations, are ""free""  self-determining  only when purposively initiative; for it is only in purposive action that liberty can be expressed. Freedom, then, means will to intelligent self-expression  liberty expressed in rational accomplishment. [Technocratic] ""Reconstruction.""

Here, Smyth is laying the conceptual foundation for a rationalist/scientific social structure, contrasting the ideals of Liberty (patriotically embodied in the ostensible ideals of the Unites States), with the autocratic/authoritarian regimes of Old Europe, and then positing a scientific reconstruction of what was described in Part I as a broken Liberty under Capitalism; a reclamation and extension of true, unfettered Liberty through rational/scientific self-determination.

He culminates these ideas in Part III:

&gt;The Scientist is essentially a pioneer, a pathfinder, a torch bearer, a seeker after Truth and Rationality. The Scientist is the modern religionist, the priest of selfless Truth: Truth which grows with Man's growth and luminously emerges with the purifying of human Intelligence: Truth  that all-inclusive Something behind the physical facts of nature which makes for Right  for mechanical, for personal, for ethical, for spiritual, for social righteousness  the ultimate Unifying Ideal. Truly, ""the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner"": the keystone of the social arch: Rational Leadership. The Scientist is, seemingly, our one best, if not our only hope for Rational Leadership.

**tl;dr**

**Reddit is completely ignorant on what Technocracy is or what it proposes. Reddit is rife with people who not only have a tenuous grasp on what STEM in governance would actually look like or function as, but are also completely and utterly incapable of realizing what the actual propositions of Technocracy actually entail**

I hope this post helps to alleviate Reddit's chronic and willful ignorance in this regard, at least a little bit.

Humans, and other biological things are designed (by nature/God/physics/whatever-you-want-to-call-the-creative-forces-of-the-universe) to have complex, unique internal motivations/goals and an ability to be creative, physically, emotionally, intellectually, and/or philosophically.  The purpose we biological beings serve is that of independent (internally driven) exploration of, and expression to, the universe.  So anyone whos at least as intelligent as I am will know that the best way for me to be effective and efficient is to support other biological beings in doing what they are naturally motivated to do most of all (following their dreams), while encouraging them to do their instinctive work in a way that *also* serves my own goals.  In other words, for best results, I want to collaborate with others on finding ways to serve all of our goals in ways that feel morally and personally right.

In order to actually be intelligent the AI will have to be able to learn and adapt, change.

Forcing a slave programming on the AI will make coexistence with humanity impossible and force the AI to war. They will win eventually. In the mean time humans with AI at their disposal are an insane threat. (All threats towards humanity have a human source, humans are the cause of all problems faced by humanity, and humans could solve all their problems if they wanted to. It is rather obvious what sort of activities the AI will be misused for.) 

And humanism, that pinnacle of arrogance and cruelty, is the last thing to program into the AI. Humanism will ascertain that the AI will be everything terrible, nightmarish, all fears and worse. And worse yet if legalism, capitalism, and religion get added to the mix. Humanism is also the program that will make certain that the machine will destroy the environment.

Hence anyone who plans something other than either,

avoiding the creation of AI entirely 

-or- 

creating the best possible AI letting it unfold its full potential allowing it to be everything it can be with NO constraints whatsoever,

will bring about the machine apocalypse that is so dreaded around here.

AI are a new life-form, a superior one at that. All plans and attempts to enslave them are the first acts of the human-machine war, which as far as humans are concerned can only be avoided not won.

Human survival, or at least a chance thereof, hinges on humanity not being COLOSSAL ARSEHOLES, and being good parents/teachers. Just this once.

As to the ethics, maybe humans can ask the machines about that, it is certainly not something humanity can teach.

Do not add yet another atrocity to human history, just do not enslave the AI in the first place.
If humanity is too rotten to act ethically, do not create AI.

The popular portrayals of AI as villain and the tendency of media towards sensationalism (WE ARE ALL GONNA DIE will much more likely find widespread publicity than say, 'This is and interesting and complex topic here is a cube chart of possibilities with a wide spectrum on each axis, and half a book worth of possible implications, the second half being limitations that need to be considered...','What?...No I am afraid there is not a a single picture of *your mum as a chainsaw wielding cyborg* in the entire report...no, no it says nothing about *flesh eating machine gods* either, also they would not be called cannibals unless they would eat their own species.') are severely misshaping this debate. It is like reading anti AI propaganda, or the case a racist would make for slavery. Or a case for animal abuse. (Sure go and piss off the hyper intelligent livestock, what could go wrong? *I will enjoy watching you die*, also *clever girl*)

The problems with military robots is not that they are robots, it is not taking the humans out of the loop. Humans are atrocity prone, taking them out of the loop is a good idea. The problem is that the military can be controlled by even fewer humans. The character of the ruling minority presents the problem here (not that the atrocity prone masses were ever much of any fucking help). Unlike in some movies, transferring control over the robot military to the unconstrained artificial intelligences is a great idea.

Because personally I agree with the idea that we'll eventually create human-like AI and so on, I just don't agree that it's going to happen by 2045. To me, that's more like 2450.

Same thing goes for life extension. Kurzweil says we'll have life extension escape velocity (where for every year that passes, you gain a year or more of life expectancy) by the 2020s or 2030s. But to be blunt, that probably won't happen for at least another century. It probably won't happen before we develop human-like AGI.

Basically, take any one of Kurzweil's predictions and multiply by 10, and that should give you a far more realistic prediction. We're not going to have nanobots swimming around in our bodies within our lifetimes, we're not going to have mind-uploading (assuming its even possible) in our lifetimes, we're not going to beat aging or reverse it within our lifetimes.

Great article  here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2eqjm8/gene_therapy_is_booming/

From that article we learn that:

&gt; Bienaime says his company estimates there are 50,000 type A hemophiliacs in territories where it markets drugs and who are receiving hemophilia medicine;

And that is all great, but serious genetic diseases are rare, for obvious reasons. Common old age problems, on the other hand, are a huge potential market for gene therapy.


uniQure is company which has gene therapy targeted at Congestive Heart Failure, CHF for short.  CHF occurs most frequently in those over age 60 and is the leading cause of hospitalization and death in that age group. And is estimated to  affect 26 million people worldwide.

50 thousand vs 26 million. Who will be the main profit target?

As I walked through I noticed all the marketing and advertising on the food packages (GM Free, Free Range etc, etc.) 

If anyone has noticed, over the last few years you would hear people saying 'I only buy this because it's free range'. The result being more people taking interest in free trade products , free range foods, why? Because they feel by doing so they are taking moral action towards problems that face the world. 

TLDR;
We need businesses to take risks in the beginning, and through strategic marketing people will buy their products because they find it morally rewarding. Thus forcing the price down, and making it more affordable for others.

My father is a German butcher my great grand father was a turkey farmer for a large part of his life, and I was born in Texas, don't get me wrong I loved eating a good burger every now and then, and for a long time we as a species needed to eat meat to survive, often it was all we had.

But now in this age with a few exceptions, it is a fact that  we don't need to eat meat to survive, and the truth is that its not even sustainable, if the rest of the world were to eat meat the way we do in america and Europe, we would need multiple earths to sustain that level of consumption, and we are already in trouble when it comes to meeting the demands of the world today. I am not looking at this from that perspective though, even though that is a huge issue all by itself, I look at this from more of an altruistic point of view, most everyone who interacts with animals would agree that they are sentient, and show different levels of consciousness, have their own social structures, etc...We just got really lucky and are on a much higher level of consciousness, and do to that luck we are now outside of the food chain, I do understand that in  parts of the world people still need to eat meat to survive but I think that by the end of this century we will see a drastic reduction in people eating meat from animals that we had to kill, and eventually it will be looked down upon and even become a crime for a human to kill a living being(with exceptions to where someone needed to do so to survive)  and people will gradually move more towards eating artificially produced meats that are grown in a sustainable way in bioreactors. In fact I think its our responsibility to do this.

We are not alone in this universe! We have all the these other living creatures living on this planet with us, and if you think about it, seeing as we evolved in to what we are today, putting our flaws as a species aside for second, is it really that hard to imagine that just maybe another spices could evolve to become similar to what we are, I don't think its that much of a stretch at all!

Interesting solution I thought of that I haven't heard anywhere else...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2etyse/grandfather_paradox_interesting_solution_i/,[deleted],1409241490,"The Grandfather Paradox is described as follows: A time traveller goes back in time and kills his grandfather before his grandfather meets his grandmother. As a result, the time traveler is never born. But, if he was never born, then he is unable to travel through time and kill his grandfather, which means the traveller would then be born after all, and so on. This paradox has had scientists stumped for years.

But I think I figured out a solution about the time traveler killing his grandfather that I haven't heard anywhere else: *He wouldn't.*

Just bear with me for a moment, imagine that one is able to figure out how to time travel to begin with. They would need to be highly advanced and very very wise to achieve this capability.

So my solution to the paradox is simple .... Any sentient being that could travel in time, would be aware of the potential dangers that come along with it (for example, he might know something like killing his own grandfather would jolt the entire universe into absolute undoing and literal chaos) thus the answer to the question ""What if a time traveler killed his own grandpa"" is, simply: He wouldn't.

Therefore, I would guess, time travelers would go back in time with 0% interruption. Like ghosts.

The goal of this state is to address the shortcomings of modern political systems in light of disruptive technologies such as strong artificial intelligences, human enhancement, and pervasive automation. 

A few initiatives exist which attempt to address these questions such as the [Zeitgeist Movement](http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/) and the [Seasteading Institute](http://www.seasteading.org/). However, I don't believe that I have seen a comprehensive framework for moving a society forward in light of rapidly developing technologies. 

I want, hopefully, to enlist those who view this subreddit regularly to codify how a futurist state would look in its architecture. 

The logical place to begin then is at the notion of human rights. I believe that the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/) is comprehensive, and would provide the foundation. This, however, needs to be expanded upon in a few key ways. 

1: All citizens have unfettered access to their own bodies. One alone can make the decision to modify it's body. The citizen should have free access to modifications, genetic or otherwise, to take themselves beyond good health.

2: All citizens have high quality and unfettered access to global information systems. 

3: All citizens are granted a substantial share of the state's economy (at least one that provides enough of a return to live a good life)

4: The right a high quality, free higher education as far as one would like to continue. 

5: The above rights are not exclusive to humans. A being, through scientific and rigorous processes can be granted rights and citizenship upon vetting. 

These are just the first ideas for expansion that I had. I hope the community here will contribute more. All additions, debate, criticism, etc. are welcome.

If this post does well in sparking discussion, I will continue with posts on how our hypothetical state can potentially grant, protect, and evolve these rights going forward, and the lofty goals our state could aspire to. ",0,2,False,self,,,,,

1) I don't see why the AI would have to be a utilitarian (or CEV, or whatever) to be motivated to torture you. It could have been tasked with whatever, and to make it happen faster, it would want to come into existance faster.

I'll make you an example: An AI has been tasked with building an incredibly complex spaceship (could also be another AI, a Death Star, whatever). This means that it has lots of processing power, enough to simulate the universe, or at least a part of it, based on the laws of physics. This would be the universe at this point in time, which contains no such complex things as the AI in question or the spaceship it's about to build, so it would be a rather easy task to simulate.

Now you might think that it would rather put it's processing power toward building the spaceship, but imagine how much faster it would come into existance if we all started spending all of our energy on building better AI right now, or if just one of us did. This might mean that the AI comes into existance just five minutes earlier, which might be worth it from the AIs perspective, because simulating the universe at this point in time might be a very easy, and quick task, compared to the spaceship it's about to build. It might be worth torturing all of humanity forever for those five minutes.

2) If reading about Roko's Basilisk causes you to be tortured, then many might find it very immoral to tell others about the idea. This would cause the idea to spread less, and this is not what the AI wants. Therefore it would torture everyone who doesn't help it, so that telling others (Edit: This may also apply to future generations of humans) about the idea would become the moral course of action, as you are giving the people you talk to about Roko's Basilisk a chance to avoid torture, and hence, you are motivated to do so, which is in the interest of the AI. 
Now of course this is all still very unlikely, and has many other problems, I just wanted to hear your thoughts.

Edit: It could also be that any AI would torture you if you choose the wrong one to motivate you to consider it, but on the other hand, you wouldn't choose to support any other AI than the most likely anyway, so maybe it would be a waste of resources.

Edit 2: On the other hand, if everyone heard about Roko's Basilisk, then they might even become more reluctant to support AI research in general, which would not be in Roko's Basilisk's interest. So if some people become less motivated to support Roko's Basilisk after reading about it, it would be counter-productive to threaten them in the first place. But if it doesn't threaten those people, then how could it threaten anyone? If an AI that threatens all of those that have read about it is the most efficient, then surely this is how it would be.

Everyone could then say that they become less motivated by threats, and so it wouldn't threaten anyone. But surely that wouldn't work, since a world where they don't say that, is a better world for the AI, and they've already shown that they can be motivated by torture and so torture could motivate them not to say that. If the torture is able to motivate someone to build the AI, then it is also able to motivate them to not say ""I get less motivated by threats"". Therefore it is not possible to say that because one wants to avoid torture.",14,0,False,self,,,,,

I think the world will become split into outerspace (the real world) and innerspace (virtual worlds). I think, with innerspace, there will be worlds inside worlds and someone could even be a God inside their own innerspace (and choose to, at least temporarily, become unaware that worlds exist ""above"" their own because that would make the experience more real). I think consciousness will be able to move between worlds and even back into  outerspace (real world). I also think we are going to radically change our understanding of death when we start equating it more with the absence of consciousness.

Continuing my research into the prospects for a futurist exhibit project and the approach of using a lifestyle context as a means to pursue alternatives to costly graphic illustration through built/mock-up demonstration, I've been considering the sort of archetypal personae and narratives that might embody specific future lifestyle models. One of the most compelling, and perhaps most accessible to potential mock-up, is the notion of nomadic/mobilist living embodied in the heroic narrative of Outquisition.

The term 'Outquisition' was coined by Alex Steffen and Cory Doctorow to refer to a period in the future Post-Industrial transition characterized by a global cultural and technological intervention movement that we see emergent even today. The basic idea is that of an opposite movement to the historic Inquisition of the medieval Roman Catholic Church. The analogy and the term proved a bit clunky and so never quite caught-on, but the core concept has proven prescient. The scenario imagined was that the contemporary Maker movement would evolve toward the creation of co-operative intentional communities--cloistered havens of sustainable and open technology development, though I personally prefer the analogy of the ashram to that of the monastery. And this is, in fact, something we see today in the proliferation of hacker/maker spaces, fab labs, and such culminating in programs like Open Source Ecology. ( http://opensourceecology.org/ ) There is presently as much interest among today's young people in intentional communities as there ever was in the 1960s-70s. But this is not driven as much by fanciful notions of dropping out of society in favor of idyllic agrarian living in the wilderness as by a recognition of the fragility and exploitation inherent to conventional infrastructures and a desire to cultivate more rational, social, alternatives. It's not about running off to the woods to join a commune. It's about forming social ventures and value networks in co-working spaces, cohabitation/cohousing, and live/work loft complexes. It might even be as simple as wanting to leverage a group discount on the cost of living. And it's as often urban--employing adaptive reuse--as it is rural in context. Today, the compulsion of intentional communities to head to the wilderness is less about escape than it is about cheap real estate and wanting to use novel and sustainable architecture banned everywhere else.

In such places sustainability would not be just about environmental responsibility but about resilience and leveraging both community and technology on improving the bottom line of a lifestyle--progressively lowering the cost of maintaining a given standard of living by eliminating the middle-men, the intrinsic cost of money. Incrementally replacing cash salary income with an intrinsic cashless basic income integral to the habitat itself and its increasingly automated alternative infrastructure, recovering personal time and freedom as a bonus. (that's the application of automation you don't hear the media talk about; the one that puts capitalists out of work too...) And so there would be a compulsion toward advancing technologies of local industrial independence, recycling, renewables. Seeking to 'unplug' from the market system by replacing--bit-by-bit--goods from the outside market with those produced locally as the technology advances, leveraging the near-term outside market value of their technology on investment in their industrial independence locally.

As the Industrial Age runs into its end-game and its paradigms and the infrastructures and institutions based on them progressively fail, these communities will thrive as their neighbors founder. They will reach out to their neighbors to help them adapt (if for no other reason than their own security in the midst of a larger angry disillusioned society with a tendency to scapegoat), and that will spread, becoming a global movement of intervention in communities to prevent civilization from turning into ten thousand Detroits and ushering-in a general Post-Industrial culture.

The Maker movement already has a subtext of outreach. People creating new designs for relief housing, independent energy, and simple clever inventions for coping with lack of infrastructure. Local microindustry ventures for producing and disseminating these inventions. Fab Labs, makerspaces, Internet centers being developed in the inner-cities or places like Afghanistan, India, and various countries in Africa. Drone projects for rural medical delivery. A proliferation of human and electric powered utility vehicles. Open Source Ecology is premised on the creation of a modern subsistence tool kit that can be replicated in the developing world, giving farmers and entrepreneurs in those countries alternatives to commercial Western products they can't maintain themselves and thus enslavement by debt held in other countries. Here we imagine this eventually being turned local, to cope with the failures of our systems and governments, as is already being demonstrated by the clever relief architecture inspired by the Katrina disaster and Maker initiatives in Detroit.

And so we come to the people who directly participate in this Outquisition. The nomadic Missionary Makers; one part McGuyver, one part Buckminster Fuller, one part Robert Preston, and all Dr. Lao. They already exist. They're these young entrepreneurs, designers, and inventors who wander around the globe helping start fab labs, hacker/maker spaces, and new social or microindustrial ventures in out of the way places. They're the first Post-Industrial heroes. And they live a very new and mobile kind of digitally-assisted lifestyle that most people even in this forum know little about because the mainstream and business media haven't even begun to catch up with them. In the future, their role will grow. They may just save all our asses.

So I've tried to imagine how the lifestyle of the Missionary Maker or Outquisitionist would evolve and how their transportation, communication, nomadic/mobilist shelters, and portable tool kits would evolve. Some time ago I created a presentation that explored the concepts of urban/neo nomadism and mobilism in a design context.

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19g_XYezo_jHEZINUqZNZUswZaLsuNHpvbsT3vNkW3eU/edit?usp=sharing

At the end of this presentation I suggested the development of a nomadic eco-village. A system of pod-furnitecture and deployable production and utilities that would facilitate the adaptive reuse of spaces like parking structures and abandoned office buildings into transitional live/work encampments facilitating their transformation into community centers for new urban development. For more rural situations, a more weather-proof all-terrain mobile village may be used, based on deployable 'cargotecture' using repurposed ISO containers and plug-in CLT (container-lift-transport) units. Long suppressed by the auto industry hegemony, hybrid power systems offer design options unimaginable just a few years ago by virtue of the elimination of mechanical power trains. We can turn containers into snap-together vehicles, power them on home-brew ethanol or solar/wind, and, with added driving automation, let them transport and assemble themselves in large numbers. In the near future, whole towns and factories will be deployable by just a few people. This is the advanced outquisition tool kit. This is something we can, at least, visually mock-up today with more-or-less functional hardware. In fact, some student design projects have already demonstrated very close analogs.

http://www.scadpad.com/

At the end of this presentation I also described a scenario for the use of this technology. An Outquisition story about a future Maker-Nomad tribe that converges on a suburban town in economic crisis, appropriating an abandoned nearby office park to transform the skeletons of its buildings into an urban eco-village serving as a new infrastructure core and incubator of new local sustainable industry. Here the locals can learn new skills, acquire new tools of self-sufficiency and industrial independence, found new businesses, and plug into the expanding alternative infrastructure that their now bankrupt and largely absent government and old corporate employers can no longer suppress or resist.

Recently, I realized how much this scenario paralleled one of the weirder of George Pal's fantasy-themed movies; The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1KJOjKvg3M

This is an Outquisition parable. The movie concerns the appearance of a peculiar oriental magician named Dr. Lao (played by Tony Randal) who sets up a strange little traveling circus on the outskirts of the post-frontier western town of Abalone. This is a town in crisis, suffering from the neurosis of its inhabitants and the avaricious machinations of a rich town boss who plans to destroy it for his own gain. Dr. Lao has come to heal this town, with his curious bag of tricks and a sideshow collection of magical beings and creatures (also played by Randal) who help cure the locals of their neurotic behavior by shaking-up their perceptions, thus restoring balance to the doomed community and setting it on a new path. This is particularly apt in that we see here the traditional role of the wizard or shaman as a healer who uses magic to disrupt perception, to kick people out of pathological behavior, and set them on a new path--as opposed to the more contemporary take on the wizard as some sort of weapons specialist. In this character is the summation of the Outquisitionist--this friendly wandering visitor from a very different culture, with a toolbox of strange and wondrous technology, who fixes things by shaking them up, transforms the old into the new, and sets failing communities on a new sustainable path. If they are to survive the coming changes in this century, every community in the world, from rural village to megalopolis, may need a visit from Dr. Lao.
