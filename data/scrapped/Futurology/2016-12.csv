And we wonder what do we do with all of this? And it's only a matter of time before AI can do all of the jobs better than humans, if that point hasn't already passed.

today, AI however has the opportunity to be created outside of a government's framework. anyone can take a supercomputer on a ship in a secret (or in an underground lair, as was shown in the movie Transcendence), and create the world's first AI, outside of government control

this is important because it means it's harder for governments to control it. they can't come and shut it down, or impose limitations, or take over, all in the name of national security

not that that matters much, once it becomes fully intelligent and powerful, it'll start taking over countries anyway",9,2

We all know that job like taxi driver, plane pilot, military, assistant etc... are gonna be replaced by AI or robot in the future.

But what's your opinion on artistic job? Designer, music composer, musician, etc... 

I study in Musicology which cover a lot about music, history of music, music theory, but there's one class that I deeply enjoy which is computer assisted music. I like it because there's so much potential for automation and that subject has so much to be improved on. While stuff like music theory, well it's gonna be the same until the end of time. Heck, in the future I'm just gonna get myself an implant to get perfect pitch anyway! Or relative pitch, but I already got that :)

So yeah in fear of being replaced by a robot, I talked about it to my professors and since I'm top in class when it comes to computer assisted music, they told me that instead of going into a regular conservatory or whatever I could try to get a doctorate that combines computre science and music!

Anyway, what's your thought on AI replacing artist? We all know it's gonna come to that one day, and it's better to start being on the winning side.",24,3

As the world matures from A.I., this could be a problem someday.  Like in in the matrix, if you disconnect a person before they are ""safe to remove"" then that person dies.  Im not expecting non-biological Intelligence to kill us one day or anything, but if we ever DO connect the human body to the machine, then I want to make sure its ALWAYS safe to disconnect. 

In part because the universe will always be unpredictable to some extent and also because its fraking annoying having to always remind your computer not to kill your camera cardor is the card committing suicide?

Ive never actually had any damage, having succumbed to rebellious computer hackery no-nos on several not-so mission impossible situationsI just get lazy sometimes.  

But the REAL reason I think pre-A.I. engineers need to keep this idea, and others like it, on the back burner as we forge new computing frontiers; if we want Non-Biological Intelligence to see that something like wanting ""Constant Safe Removal"", is important to society, then we should show it now. 

Its the care-in-engineering that we need to pride ourselves on. I suspect that computers will always engineer with maximum efficiency, and that one of those things-that-makes-us-human, is a little healthy paranoia to make things just a bit over spec, just in case.

So building a Gundam that can move, can rotate sections of its ligaments, etc. But instead of moving slowly like we see with most robots - when will we get to the point where energy density will go to the point where we can use enormous amounts of power without recharging for days on end for these mech robots? 

I guess the same question might also apply to vehicles or even a replacement for Batteries or fuel cells.

Everyone agrees that most jobs will be eliminated and most people agree that at some point we can find something for people to do. The argument is that the transition will happen so quickly there will be no time to adapt. 

My argument is based on the idea that yes we havent seen this before, but no it will not happen so quickly that unemployment will go completely out of control. History is full of these kinds of prediction, where that new advance is just around the corner. These delays are not because things are so incredibly hard to predict, but simply that we as a rule dont attempt to predict the unpredicted.
 There is no methodology for saying if it rains tomorrow my mother will call and have a really nice anecdote about how wet the dog got. 

This is because using simple probability analysis you can only predict events when they are directly related and connected. The trickiness of the future is that there are always unrelated things being connected in strange and wacky new ways.
 For example the idea a reality TV star would become president is not at all unpredicted. However the odds that this reality tv star would be a 70 year old billionaire is a connection that no one could of made. 

Things that will happen. 

Teaching will be even more important.

Sex sells, nobody wants a robot waiter. 

Parenting boom

Consumption is drastically gonna increase

Resources are still finite so we'll hit another limit.

The economy will be driven by new wants.

The real cause of unemployment is the cost of learning on the job, interning for a decade will become the norm.

Regulation will drastically increase. 

There is plenty of work to be done, work that has for the longest time been unviable will become dimnate.

Productivity will slump as their is no reason for workers to be killing themselves.

The militarys job will not be handed over to robots.

Fragmintation and protectionism.

You're reposting the same article multiple times--there's never any new or interesting information in them. For all intents and purposes, we could just pick one at random and then sticky it. That would be our one and only UBI thread. There is, again, never ever any new discussion or content on this topic. Every article and thread is all the same shit about how UBI will just generically solve every problem facing humanity. 

Furthermore, why don't you guys just say 'Socialism' anyway? Any time someone questions UBI's practicality, another poster will inevitably make a post about how without it then 'the poor' will rise up against 'the people who own robots'. There's rarely any more detail, but you can always count on some variation on that phrase appearing in a UBI thread.

You're using all of the Marxist rhetoric anyway--why not just go all the way and admit what it is you're talking about? Then there's the fact that UBI doesn't actually make any sense when you think about it. If robots can produce so much, so efficiently, and *nobody works*, why are people insisting on Capitalism? What on Earth is the point of UBI? Under that scenario -- nobody is able to buy anything, and everything is easily and quickly producable, i.e no meaningful scarcity on the overwhelming majority of goods -- Capitalism has collapsed. Totally. If nobody has any money, then the value of the owner's wares plummets because nobody can trade with them.  Thus, UBI is a strange, and unnecessary, way of trying of forcibly bringing it back from the dead.  If anything, it's in the 'owners of the robots''s interest to *not* automate away Human labor.

The interesting bit starts at 10min 00sec and runs to the end. It deals with the future of computing, taking as an example how bank payments were (manually) processed in the early 80's.  It offers the possibility of comparing (apparently well informed) 1982 predictions of the future with what actually happened. 

I guess they picked payment processing because it was patently obvious even then this seemingly-bizarre, labour-intensive, manual process was going down and out for good very, very  soon. The commentators tone is somewhat starry eyed - people will do much more fulfilling stuff than this mindless drone work of sorting bits of paper. 

However, the final summary at the end shows that they were thinking about the questions that are asked here. What happens when automation can do *everything* better? ",0,3

https://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2016/03/29/the-crisis-of-the-blue-model-2/

basically, it all comes down to these two options.

&gt;(1) Techno-economic self-propelling change obsolesces ever wider swathes of humanity on a steepening curve. Capital (i.e. techno-commercial synthesis) tendentially autonomizes. For humans, there are ever more intriguing opportunities for synergistic attachment, on new terms, but the trend is  to put it very mildly  challenging.

(tl.dr: For the people who still have employable skills in the techno-based Exponential Growth Age, i.e. the top 0.5% - 1% of intelligence level, it will be like heaven; the rest, simply, nothing.) 

&gt;(2) Jacobin political violence, modeled on the French Revolution, provides the basis for demands aimed at a redistribution of the (capitalist) productive spoils through explicit extortion. All socio-political history in the modern epoch falls into compliance with this pattern. It coincides quite exactly with democracy in its modernist usage. Universal Basic Income is its natural telos.

(tl.dr: The masses rise up and raid the wealth of the tech-drivers, and mess up the whole process and entering into a chaos mankind has never seen and will never see again.)

===

Providing a paradise-like living conditions for 7.5 billion people is simply preposterous. The world's resources are running out, and we don't even have a single rock mined from an asteroid yet (other than what actually fell to the earth).

In fact, the world's energy production peaked on 2015. That means end of growth. The current model of economy, politics, philosophy, etc can't last any longer.

at this critical point, the emphasis is on isolationism and returning to the old ways; whether these attempts will succeed is not very important, since these attempts mean when resources have to be assembled around the world for one Big Push, they are instead going to be dissipated in stupid national rivalries.

We still need about 20-25 years before the point of absolutely no return (i.e. every key points automated, and very little need for workers on anything, with energy sources completely secured).

The French Revolution was negated because the Old Order was still strong enough to assemble all of its strength to destroy it, and it took a couple of world wars to remove the remainder of the ancien regime.

And, because modern world is so complex, so intertwined and so advanced, once it is dismantled it is unlikely to be sewed up again, which means a chaos will probably be the Final one. isolated pockets of civilization might exist for a couple of generations, but they will be irrelevant. 

St. Benedict preserved what remained of Civilization in monasteries, but 700 years later the priests were doing the same thing Benedict was doing in 500 CE.

The masses are getting smarter, and once a critical portion of them 'awake' and find out they will have no future in the techno world of exponential growth, they will attack. The delays of tech developments , caused by the rise of isolationism, won't help.

While techies would want the techno utopia to arrive, I now give them a chance of 51% for win. The masses , combined with the shortage of resources, might catch up , rise and destroy the whole system, before the complete replacement of lesser-talented humans could be finished.",10,0

http://www.tomshardware.com/news/ssd-hdd-shortage-nand-market,33112.html

It had been anticipated since May,

http://www.tomshardware.com/news/samsung-sandisk-wd-storage-nand,31795.html

but nothing was done in half a year, which is quite a long time in IT, so we now have this shortage.

While this crisis will be resolved in time and next year no one will remember this, it is a symptom of a bigger problem - the proliferation of tech goods is not sustainable in the long run.

Right now, we have about 2 billion smartphone users around the world, 

http://thehub.smsglobal.com/smartphone-ownership-usage-and-penetration

and perhaps 1% of them are ready to run and buy the latest models, and we can't handle them all.

I don't see a way for 7.5 billion people to enjoy the tech abundance supposedly promised, when we can't even handle the demand of perhaps 20 million people now for a NAND, which is just one single part.

There are many good sites, but many people seem to write them off one way or the other (too liberal or too conservative). 

The other side of this is identifying fake news. Tim O'Reilly had a recent [blog post](https://medium.com/@timoreilly/how-i-detect-fake-news-ebe455d9d4a7#.n7czdraf2) on that, which suggests we can probably automate this to some extent.

I came across a very holistic article on the advent of self-perpetuating AI on this sub that I cannot find for the life of me and was hoping you guys could help. The article broached the subject of current AI compared with with self-improving AI and the timeline that we are looking at from multiple points of view in terms of benign/beneficial versus destructive, and also was written for a layperson. I can't recall the source, but I am writing a legal thesis examining the standard of liability that we should judge creators (probably not liable), procurers or entity users (probably jointly and severally liable under a general negligence test, or strictly liable) as well as general users (liability depending on many factors). Does anyone have any idea what this article may have been that I read? I recall it included a large description of an AI mechanism charged with making buttons that brought about the end of the world. Thanks in advance, and sorry if this isn't proper in this forum. ",2,0

Ya know, whatever absurd and frightening amount it may be but I heard or read something long ago that started to help me think in a positive way about these things.

I work retail and I don't hate it but I don't love it. I work at Costco so as many people know, this is a great place to make a career out of but it just isn't for me. I'd rather follow some sort of creative dream of mine and get by on a basic income. 

Here's where it gets positive.

Technology becomes advanced enough so that pretty much every job that can be automated, is. Companies that no longer pay as much for employees are taxed and those taxes pay for basic income. Those taxes would be easier to handle because robots are doing all the work now and companies only pay for maintenance and the initial purchase of the machine.

Now those people that made a low income just to get by can now make the same income without working the job they don't want and can use their skills to be creative and fulfill their dreams or basically just live a happy life. This removes stress, poverty, hunger, anything bad really. If you think about it, happy people don't commit crimes against others because they are already happy and don't need to take from others, our Erin other people's lives.

This is just a rough draft and i am by no means qualified to make this prediction but while I understand the worry for automation and robots.. it may actually be the best thing we can do as humans to fulfill our life, which is just to be happy.",4,0

As a question, what can we do here and what are we prepared to say and what are your thoughts about social modality?

What do you think of the general populations social modality?
Are you happy there or do you want something better than the chit chat wars?

Have you experienced heightened better more collaborative social modality? Ever been part of a work like office like social modality without being paid? Ever think of working like that for civilization and for yourself and to solve high order problems? 

Do you ever notice that humans generally speaking bicker and argue and opinionate but don't sit down and actually work the problems?

Have you noticed that all the parties on the list of parties are selling us their ideology, not science to solve problems?

Anybody else see an evolutionary niche there? 

Anybody else find that realization even slightly alarming?

Anybody else notice that the general population is getting stupider and more duped and more spun out into dumble down and propaganda wars as time goes on from say the 60s? Its getting worse, not better. (?)

Seems like this is the reddit to make a mad dash for the future. 

What do you think is the evolution of social modality? Can we get an evolved social modality here and now? Say collaboration on explaining social modalities to people and esp an alternative social modality that is group collaboration open source direct democracy science centered problem solving research and maybe even ala carte textbook writing?

Yes, these are suspiciously leading questions.... hmmmm...

-------------------------

Do 




""transitioning people out of the matrix. Its like holding a door. The true game is the social modality. how people behave socially. right now thats orwellian propaganda warfare for hegelian dialectic programmed sheeple and zombots, who do gladiator sport cross trolling.

We have to establish and demonstrate the collaborative and science centered problem solving social modality; if we do that it can catch on. But it has to go as strong as a third party or the parties will in source it and take it over. You'd end with republicans and democrats trying to claim the social movement as theirs.

The long term game is to create our own third party and fill govt with our own people. Then we effect transition; primarilly to absolutely self sufficient city states. Once that transition is materially, logistically, boots on the ground and arcologies to the sky and permacultures in the ground, we then effect a political transformation slowly dismantling the federal government and the state governments and giving all that power back to local governments. So there is a strategy paradox in taking power to then distribute the power and yes a sort of meta oligarchy must form to create the transition; but the end goal is genuine democracy.""

I am here to talk about our work to improve the targeting of dysfunctional *senescent* cells in the body, and thereby aid in their eventual removal. This is important because removal of these cells has been shown to be a critical component in the effort to improve healthy human lifespan.

In short, CellAge is going to develop synthetic DNA promoters which are specific to senescent cells, as the promoters that are currently used for this purpose, such as the p16 gene promoter, suffer from various issues and limitations (not comprehensively targeting all senescent cells, collateral damage in targeting some cells that are not senescent, etc.). You can find more details in our technology video [**here**] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgZ62KE2m7I), and on our [**Lifespan.io**] (http://www.lifespan.io) information page.

Seeing as our primary mission is to expand the interface between synthetic biology and aging research, as well as drive translational research forward, we will offer the senescence reporter assay we develop to academics for free. We predict that in the very near future this assay will be also used as a quality control step in the cell therapy manufacturing process to make cell therapies safer.

Note: The AMA is now open for questions over the weekend and Mantas will be on hand Monday Dec 12th at 11PST/1400 EST/1900 UTC to answer your questions.",91,204

Now *that* was a shitshow. To be fair, a similar discussion with the same points was being had on /r/videos, but nevermind... it was still awful reading all that.

#tl;dr upfront: It's okay to ask questions. Stop whining.

**Non tl;dr:**

First of all, there's tons of new tech out there daily, and various companies are creating proof-of-concept stuff just to please their shareholders, even if the actual ""product"" is losing them money or is nothing more than an alpha-stage mess. Remember [Microsoft houses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh-LV28Quqs)? Yeah, something like that. It's all just a for-show gimmick so that their stock price would jump a bit and they all get some free advertising as well. But if they play their cards right, they can use that tech to create something practical which can be used now or in the near future.

Which brings me to... Experimentation and testing. People have no idea how stuff like Amazon Go actually works. The video presenting it was full of quasi techno gibberish which really didn't explain anything at all. So why are you so surprised at people asking questions? They should! People should poke around and find flaws, people should ask questions, people should be curious. Even if the question may seem obvious, it should spark quality discussion. No QA and testing team at Amazon or anywhere else can do even a fraction of the work possible which will be done by the customers in the production phase.

But what do many Redditors do? They lose their shit and ask why did they even dare to question the stability and reliability of these things. Why the hell are you, a neckbeardish basement dweller, qualified to ask a question? Who the hell are you? Why are you even trying when a 300bil$ corp. already did the math and knows more? What, you think they worked on that thing for months and never once thought of the same thing you did? Pft.

Well, this is a completely foreign concept of thinking for me. It's pathetic, it's defeatist, it's accepting that the companies know all and know better. Well... they don't. They can't. If they knew every answer to every question, we would be living in an utopia, and people would be actually praising Windows 10.

So... when companies present stuff like near-vehicle communication, self driving cars, delivery drones, Mars rockets, or whatever, any and all consumers should try to question everything and find flaws. In fact, when I'm developing a piece of new tech, I love it when someone tries to break my stuff! Also, most customers are concerned about their privacy and the future they're creating for themselves. Do they really want to lose access to their car due to a failure to connect to the grid? Do they want their dietary habits to be tracked? It's just natural, and I see nothing wrong with that. For every smart person there's an even smarter/cleverer person out there who will break the system. You don't actually have to be a supergenius to do so... MA Bell, for example, was hacked by some blind kids who were playing with their phones. Do you want to be caught with your pants down because you blindly trusted an entity which is solely designed to market and sell you a product?

So, please, for the love of god: think, ask questions, poke, hack, nag, disassemble, question, and everything in between. ""Curiosity killed the cat"" shouldn't apply here.",5,28

1) We will be able to text, read, play games, or just think while travelling in our cars. I think we waste a lot of time 'keeping our eyes on the road'.

2) Less accidents. The self-driving car would be programmed to be the best driver possible and would always obey traffic laws. The self-driving car would also never be sleepy, bored, distracted, or stupid. Let alone, the self-driving car would never be drunk, and drunk driving would most almost end completely.

3) It would encourage travelling. A roadtrip across the United States would be a lot less daunting if we didn't have to sit behind the wheel the whole time.

I know there are other sides to the argument. Hacking, Legal Implications, etc. But anyway I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter.",33,8

Not the social consequences - that's for another discussion.

Although the idea of sex robots may sound good in theory - like self-driving cars, how this will affect the legal system and law is a major issue [rarely discussed here].

For example - personality rights. The Sun newspaper suggested people could create clones of Angelina Jolie or whoever the person fancies as a sex robot from a photograph - it generating the sex robot. However, it being The Sun, I'll take it with a pinch of salt. How would the legal system handle this issue?

Also in the very later future, the ""does AI have rights"" argument may come to the fore?

Also, would a sex robot stop stalking and victims of crime - again, this ties into the personality rights argument? Cartoon Network's Adventure Time [created by Pendleton Ward] covered this issue in the episode The Suitor.

Capitalism is just the game that the founding fathers created America to play so they could have individual rights and Opportunities beyond the King.

America's Laws are the rules of the game and generally overseeing the rules are bankers, lawyers, judges, and politicians.

When the game started, it was not a very fair or nice game.  Under the rules Women and Africans were property, and White Male Non Landowners were often indentured servants...all with very limited rights.

Over the years, because of technological advancements and changes in the rules, the game improved dramatically for millions.

1568,2016-12-12,2016,12,12,2,5hr72v,Automation in China - an accelerant or buffer toward the next age of labor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5hr72v/automation_in_china_an_accelerant_or_buffer/,hipcheck23,1481477811,"There have been several stories recently about how robots are moving into the (classically-) cheapest labor force in the world, most notably [Foxconn planning to axe 60k jobs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36376966).

It got me wondering how this new trend will affect the global march toward the automation of most manual/menial jobs - China has always been a first stop on a shoppers list for cheap manufacturing, because its labor force works for pennies on the USD, but if those jobs are going, why go to China at all?

Some context for my thoughts: I've worked directly with Foxconn. They're a mess - great at using nearly-slave labor to mindlessly assemble parts, but lousy at doing innovation or attacking engineering decisions themselves. If you're going to make a phone, you're going to have to consider Foxconn for a number of reasons - they're very well set up for it, and they have strong relationships with many other, ancillary companies in the tech space. What you end up saving in costs can sometimes be mitigated by their inability to the more technical stuff. In my experience working with two major Western tech companies, Foxconn didn't have the personnel we needed to interface with in order to execute the work correctly.

Around two years back, I heard a radio program about how around the biggest Foxconn plant, there are camps set up for the workers - they ""live"" there, meaning they sleep there on a mat for a few hours between shifts. It sounds like a horrible temporary time in one's life, but these people spend their lives there, raising kids, etc - it's like a refugee camp with jobs. This show pointed out an interesting phenomenon: since they had little to spend their tiny savings on, the workers ended up with a little bit of disposable income and small businesses started appearing near the factory/camps. In doing so, a micro-economy had grown, thanks to the pennies saved by the workers making Western phones/etc. It's not the same thing, but [this article](https://www.techinasia.com/foxconn-changed-small-chinese-town) discusses how local economies and ways of life can change as a result.

As bad as life is for these workers, it's almost like a generation has sacrificed itself in order to get a tiny foothold for their kids, and it's only thanks to providing such cheap labor. So what is going to happen when the robots take over for good? At first, it will mean more opportunities for India and Singapore and the other cheap markets, but clearly the wave of the future is in automating ALL possible labor.

Surely the cost of the robots, AI and other automations at Foxconn is going to be repeatable for other companies around the world, meaning that if we're not paying for near-slave labor in China, what's the point of going there at all? Why not build this factory in the middle of an 'unwanted' part of the US or Mexico? And Germany and South Africa and anywhere else that can be a distribution hub?

When that happens, it's going to be another blow to the growing Chinese economy, especially when we consider how unhappy Western govt's are with all the backdoors that Chinese mfg's build into hardware. I wonder if China sees this coming, and what they and other cheap labor markets are doing about it. ",5,11

If this isn't appropriate. 

Have you noticed all the bigger tech companies already have Facial Recognition Tech? Even my good old phone gallery managed to, without my consent, create an album of the pictures I'm featured in. 
Do you think soon someone will be able to just take a picture of you on the street and suddently have access to all information there is about you? 
If your ex decides to post revenge porn somewhere, people could easily search your face, find your name and send it to everyone you know, for example. 
Does the thought of having your entire life's history ready for examination by complete strangers without your consent give you anxiety like it does to me? Do you think there is even a slight chance that we have our privacy back? Would love to hear your opinions.",11,3

A growing IoT and AI infrastucture (machine learning in particular) will birth the capacity to determine likelihood of crime per given individual, area, time of day, etc. The elimination of traffic violations, such as speeding, texting while driving, and so forth, are but the tip of the iceberg. Advent of systems that automatically charge / issue tickets for violations are nearly a reality as it is.

What bumbling fool would commit petty crime, for instance, if they knew that they simply would not - hard stop - get away with it?

How about black markets - drug dealing, gun trafficking, human trafficking? In many respects, strong AI could be a great thing for society. Then again, I've read a *few* dystopian novels in my time..

All data is from http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/

Y-axis is the multiple of powers of the GeForce 256 DDR GPU. For example, the new NVIDIA Titan X is 200 times as powerful as the GeForce 256 DDR.

The red trendline is a 3rd-degree polynomial that uses the whole dataset, while the purple is logarithmic that uses only 4 last entries that showed a kind of S-curve slowdown, although 4 datapoints is too few to actually make a statement that the progress would be slowing down. The reality would probably fit somwhere between these curves.

Interestingly, the power has multiplied by a factor of 199.49 over 16,51 years. Derived from that, guess how long it has taken to double the power? 2.161 years. [Coincidence?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)

Is anyone else worried?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5i52t8/how_will_the_new_technologies_eg_ai_vr_affect/,karakitap,1481652297,"I read a lot of projections and speculations about how these groundbreaking technological improvements will make the world a better place. I definitely appreciate the positive possibilities. 

But, most of those thoughts feel too-utopianistic and are very euro-centric (or US-centric). They don't match my experience of my country (Turkey). For example:

- People talk about how VR will likely be massively adopted in 5-10 years and it will be an empathy machine, but I am pretty sure it is more likely that the authoritarian governments (and possibly terrorist organizations) will use it to indoctrinate people in a much deeper level than ever possible. Imagine how effective Hitler's propaganda machine was effective; VR propaganda can be 10x more effective. And that's very scary to me. 

- People talk about how automation will make things more efficient, will probably leave many people unemployed, but we will probably have universal basic income or some other solution to balance these. But, if the outsourced jobs are pulled out of developing countries very quickly and if those countries aren't receiving the wealth from AI and robotization, they won't have money to pay for UBI. This could destabilize the political structure in many countries.

I feel like the governments, experts, NGOs, educated elite, business leaders of developed countries will be addressing these issues proactively (probably not as well as they could have). 

But, most of other countries won't be as ready and will just be crushed with those changes. By ""crushed"", I am talking about millions of people becoming unemployed, countries' economies falling apart, those fragile democracies falling into political turmoil, increased fascism, massive immigration, and whatnot. 

1) Is anyone else worried about these things?

2) If so, what should we do about this? It would be great if we could expand the conversation and start thinking about how to push other countries to be readier for future.

3) We have a slack channel to continue this conversation (""Good Future for Developing Countries""), PM me with your email if you are interested in joining the conversation.",12,8

Experts say ""they'll be safer"" without showing *any* actual proof (current ones are actually more dangerous even in their limited use cases).

Given how much people will exploit weaknesses, I contend they will actually create *more* problems.

Take for example, the classic ""kid runs out into the street"" problem. Children should be taught *not* to play in the street (which has been dangerous for over a hundred years now). Self driving cars will essentially make that a lot less risky. So kids will be *more* likely to play in the street. This, of course, would slow traffic down because the cars would stop for children playing.

So then what do you get? People exploiting that safety and just walking out into traffic without a second though. ""Look both ways before you cross the street"" won't be taught anymore.

That's just *one* situation. There is also randsomware, law enforcement power abuse, and much more that we all give up for something that doesn't actually solve any problems for anyone except *corporations*.

Therefore I say self driving cars will be another fad technology like Google Glass that nobody buys and ends up being nothing but a massive capital loss.

P.S. Don't use ""the elderly"" or ""disabled"" as an argument either because they're fringe cases and such a tiny portion of the population.",30,0

(A counterpoint to this might be that some states are authoritative and tyrannical, rendering the rogue elements lovable rebels to the evil empire.)

The major drawback would seem to be that we would be building our own prison, to be completed if and when an artificial intelligence transcends state interests.

A relevant part of this question is that these systems already confer great advantages, to the point that it would be negligent NOT to develop them in a world where not all actors are peaceful.

However as a wider issue, should Mars colonisation ever become an established thing, I can't really see how (because of the resources required, for a start), that selection of 'colonists' wouldn't be limited to those that can either get themselves chosen due to being rich, powerful or connected or chosen because of biological traits, ie. eugenics?

I guess the obvious response would be, 'it might, at the start, but then infrastructure would kick in and costs would come down', but considering that the *current* global net population growth is at 80m a year, it would have to be a hell of a lot of infrastructure just to cope with that - effectively, for the vast majority of the global population - the chance of Mars colonisation just would not exist, unless they met the selection criteria posed by the question. Something that, for something as complicated and risky as space travel, might never be possible.

The other obvious response would be something along the lines of ""what's wrong with eugenics?"". Which is a response I'd disagree with (its not really a vision of the future I'd like to support), but its still a valid answer I suppose.

So, answers please - why and how will space colonisation ever not be limited to the select few?",31,20

UBI is unnecessary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5ihxzf/technological_unemployment_is_a_nonsense_ubi_is/,Post-reality,1481813994,"Yes, new technology replaces jobs, but technology has replaced jobs since humans started inventing, and so far unemployment have not been a threat due to that. Don't tell me ""this time it's different"", it's not. My arguements:

1) There is resistance to technology - new technology might be able to replace many jobs, but not necessary be applied. According to McKinsey research suggests that as many as 45 percent of the activities individuals are paid to perform can be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technologies. Most you might think that this is a recent trend that started being relevant only recently, but actually, most of these ""currently demonstrated technologies"" have been here for decades. For example, wire guided cars have been developed since the 1920s, and have been demonstrated not long after that, and could have replaced our manually driven cars. Another example is of automated convenience stores which have been proven to be economically efficient. There are other examples, such as food delivery in restaurant or commercial airplanes, which have been possible for decades. I can give you endless examples of such technologies. All these (similar) technologies have been applied successfully in large scale manufacturing enviroments, but society has shown limited interest in incorporating them outside of factories. The failure of these technologies in non-factory enviroments stems from human nature and fear of risky high investments. Even digital technology could cut costs to a great degree, but at least from my observation, public institutions and even private firms (such as banks) fail to adopt them (and I say that to my experience as I had to physically go in order to get tax returns or receive some documents from the bank). So why don't we replace waiters with conveyor or why do we still have physical bank branches in the digital age? Because people prefer to interact with actual people, and not machines. That is why manufacturing employment is on decline while service sector is up, even though all this technology can be incorporated in the service sector as well (for example: hotel clerks, hotel bellboys, restaurants food delivery, waste collection via pneumatic tubes, bank branches, etc etc)

2) Technology might actually creates more jobs than it destroys, due to increased complexity involved. For example, cars today are more expensive than cars of the 1980s. Wonder why? Well, safety standards, energy efficiency standards, pollution standards, more and more accessories such as electric locks, windows, built-in media, etc.. cars become so much complex and therefore more expensive (more capital, aka jobs, requires to make them). Another example is medicine, healthcare skyrocketing? Well, because of technology, it becomes more and more complex and requires vast more capital per disease because of so many options of expensive treatments. Or houses, as they become more and more complex, like central vacuum systems and other accessories, and nowadays construction is heavily regulated, like in safety standards (the Empire State builders didn't have safety gear) This is the nature of technology.

3) There is no end to human greed/hunger. Let's say shared self-drivng cars have been widely implented, what happens? Well, now people save a lot of money now being spent in transportation, and this money is going to be spent on something else. This individual who has an increased purchasing power is going to to spend it on an expensive restaurant (instead of a rather automated fast food restaurant), or upgrade his house with a vacuum cleaner systems. Perhaps, in his next vacation, he is going to travel within a supersonic airplane instead of the cheap regular airplanes we use today. There are endless exapmles to this stuff. An average American worker of today can attain the same standard of living of 1917 by working 17 weeks a year. Today people pay for products and utilities that weren't unattainable or very expensive back then, and this is going to be the same for the future ahead.",24,0

As it stands right now it seems that every *Government* led initiative is completely hot air. Anyone we've attempted to speak to in the local or federal government defers us to another person, and it's an endless run-around. High-end players like Musk or Gates are just impossible to contact.

The scientific advances we're making today, despite the politic turmoil around the world, tell me that us, the millenials, are at a point in human history where we will be the generation that decides whether our species goes into decline, or unlikely extinction, or whether humanity thrives beyond this planet and maybe the solar system. Makes me mad when the older generation bashes on people like me, 24yrs old, like we're all the same but they just don't understand, imo, how this exponentional growth in technology and understanding is pushing us forward to a  very, potentionally, beautiful future era for human history.

If we can find the mind and body are separate then life after death is possible. 

I was looking at ways of life extension without the use of mechanically altering our bodies(Calorie Restriction and anti-aging drugs are my favorite options), but the last option was [mind uploading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading#Philosophical_issues).

Theres many ways this could go down. My suggestion would be a free central system where the dead's mind are uploaded. The biggest problem is that everyone's conception of what afterlife should be is different. I guess it would make sense to give people options...like a pantheist system, a Christian system, Nirvana, and so fourth..

The other option is to have people pay to construct their own 'afterlife' system for their family/whoever wants to join them.

If humans last to seeing the Sun swallow Earth, the best case scenario would be to somehow alter the mind's perception of time, to a rate that is so slow, that it wouldn't end for a long time lol. Like where 1 second in real time is perceived as 10 years.

Thoughts? What could this mean for religion?",31,12

My background is motion graphics, editing, digital distribution, and very minimal (wordpress do-able and light HTML) knowledge of coding. I would like to know what concepts you think are important to get kids excited about technology? Keep in mind these kids have not been exposed to much and I want to get them sparked on tech and the possibilities there. I have a couple things in mind and will be bringing my wacom tablet, little Typer Shark game in there, going over the basics of being safe in the digital world, showing Adobe Suite. I am also bringing a pocket projector and my little external speaker to presents short vids at the beginning of the sessions, think ""The Box"" video that shows projection mapping. They do have steady wifi, as for the speed...who knows. Love to hear everyone's thoughts!",0,3

I consider myself to be under educated but well read. I have read just about every sci fi book out there and have read just about everything in science related from 1976 forward.  The term we will NEVER do this or that really pisses me off to no end. For example, AI will never fall in love with a human, we will never break the speed of light, man will never be immortal. I ask you people to FUCKING STOP USING THE TERM ' NEVER'. Many will ask me to prove a negative  to prove my point. This is not possible, BUT I will refute your objections with this, Man will never travel faster than a horse can run. Never go faster than a train, never dive past a man's ability to hold his breath, never break the sound barrier, never go to the moon, Etc. And today, man will never teleport, man will never go faster the the speed of light, man will not live forever.

The prevailing population of the reddit community seems to moan and despair at the notion of a Trump presidency, but this could be a sign of good things to come. America can fast-track many of these ideas proposed by the big tech companies, who in some sense already assert more power than the countries themselves. Massive, ground-breaking infrastructure projects calling for more jobs in the short term, increased productivity in the long term, coupled with the advent of ubiquitous AI (should the US win the seemingly unapparent but epoch making AI race) could create a visionary America, or one would hope.

Big monies were made that way, and a lot of 'developing' countries' denizens also became rich after the real estate they bought for a song got developed and appreciated like hell.

However, finance has reached a kind of 'singularity', in which that good opportunities are quickly found by AI, who run to these shares before individual investors could find them, and price them out of small speculators' hands.

the game of the few startups who make it big nowdays has also changed. They don't bother with the public - they partner with investment banks, who will find someone who will buy their companies for big money, before the public had any chance to know about their existences. 

Same for real estate, where 'good' opportunities will be closed for newer buyers, and only existing 'centers of civilizations' will continue to appreciate. Gentrifications will probably fail in the end except in the environs of major cities. I.e. since Oakland is closer to SF gentrification in there will probably successful, but since Detroit is already too far from the center of civ, gentrification in there will end with a bunch of bullets and tears. And usually the ones who benefits are slumlords who live far away but do have ownership to the land, i.e. those who were already rich.

As good jobs disappear and opportunities for those who can''t devise a cool app will close brutally, getting rich like ""The millionaire next door"" won't work anymore since there are no more information asymmetry ; everyone will be stuck on their class, except for very, very few exceptions, and it will be downward spiral for most people.

As efforts aimed to control climate change continue to stagnate through a collective of human and technological issues, the effects of climate will increase and accelerate over time. The single most pressing issue of this century.

Is the economy of growth, which has created the cities and societies we enjoy today, approaching a limit? Will the economy shift from a 'build and grow as much as possible' mindset to a 'fix, recover and heal' the devasting effects of climate change?

Climate change will make life in the oceans collapse, shift coastlines and sea levels, superpower storms and droughts, migrate populations, alter the spread of diseases and their vectors, exhaust biological resources, and overall alter the planetary habitat.

Will the economy shift to a 'climate economy' where the primary drive will be to invest in fixing and recovering from these effects, instead of building skyscrapers?

Good one Honda,

When are manufacturers going to stop making Electric vehicles like this that appeal to exactly NO ONE.

This dance has been going on for years and the living proof that it can be done exists already: It stops being about 'vision' and becomes an obvious attempt at segregating electric car owners to make it look weird and outlandish and classify them as 'enthusiasts'. How fucking thick do you think we are?

it is no longer an excuse to say 'Oh yes, this is the future car and what it will look like.' How many designers do you pay sculpting the bodywork of your next SUV or the next sedan? Every time I see announcements like this hoping for a vehicle I can back and share I am ALWAYS disappointed. 

Every single iteration is a letdown, a rehash of poor range and poor aesthetic choice. My name is Michael, I'm a 30 year old professional, I've only ever bought one ICE vehicle (guess which manufacturer) and it will be my last. My demographic will only grow. The lack of vision and courage to take a leap forward in this industry is staggering and I am done being an apologist. 

Seriously fuck you.

If universal basic income is inherently inflationary, and at the same time automation productivity gains overheat the economy (imagine when the increased speed and reduced cost of construction leads to a real estate &amp; infrastructure boom), how would economists responsible for managing UBI react to inflation?

Traditionally, inflation occurs when demand outstrips supply.  In a hypothetical future where automated manufacturing and transportation dramatically improves the velocity and decreases the cost of supply, would automation adjust to increasing demand generated by UBI to serve as an automatic counterbalance and prevent inflation?  

If the greatest argument against UBI is the risk of inflation, will the driver of UBI, automation, also serve as the monetary stabilizer that protects against that risk?

If anyone knows of any economic studies on this subject, I'd love to hear what they discovered!",15,16

China have just announced in December 2016 that they are currently testing the EM Drive on their space station, which makes me think there really may be something real going on here.

**AI;** 2016 saw huge breakthroughs, but even more looks to be just around the corner. I'm particularly keen to see how all these advances will be integrated into robotics. Microsoft/Cray are saying they are developing AI hardware in 2017 a magnitude more powerful than today's, where AI tasks that now take days, will take minutes. AI seems poised to out do even 2016's breakthrough year.

**BIO-TECH;** both CRISPR &amp; Stem Cells seem to be delivering on their promise of revolutionary change, it seems these are happening at break neck speed now.

**ROBOTICS;** Autonomous Cars seem ready for prime time. I think 2017 is when the wider public starts to realize their wider implications. Drones seem to be advancing quickly too, but Robotics in general sems to be developing fast now.

**FUTUROLOGY IN SOCIETY;** It seems many of things I used to just some across in r/Futurology are everywhere in the mainstream media - UBI, Automation, the rise of AI/Robots - I expect that to continue. What seems lacking though is mainstream political debate as yet seems unaffected, I expect that to start to change in 2017.",21,18

I think that if you dissect the arguments from both sides of the UBI debate, you'll find 2 philosophical questions at the core of the debate:



- **How is a human life's worth measured?**  

Do all human lives have equal worth?  

Is an individual's worth measured in how ""productive"" they are in their economic system?  What do they do for a living?  Are they young and fit (therefore paying more in taxes and insurance than the services they receive), or are they sick and/or elderly?

Is it measured in how they treat other people?  Should our society explicitly reward generosity, selflessness, and kindness?

Perhaps it is measured in how closely they follow their society's laws, or how much they break them.  After all, most people think more highly of a crime-free person that someone with a felon conviction.

It could even be measured in terms of physical attractiveness, or IQ, or EQ, or any other form of evaluation.


- **What is the purpose of money?** *(I am specifically referring to ""money"" in a fiat currency system.)*  

Money can be simplistically defined as a way to exchange goods and services, without having to barter (i.e. here's 2 sheep for some HTML websites.)  

Money can also be interpreted as a way to divide up finite resources.  For example, we all may want 24 karat gold jewelry, but there is a finite amount of gold buried in the ground.  Additionally, it takes a lot of manpower to extract that gold from the ground.  Even if a resource is renewable, extracting and/or transforming that resource probably takes a lot of work.

Money could also be thought of as an incentive for working.  No work = no money, except for cases of sickness, injury, or advanced age.   This viewpoint is pretty limited though, due to the existence of interest-bearing accounts, the stock market, forex, arbitrage, etc. which require very little ""work"" in the traditional sense to earn more money.


When you combine the answers to those two philosophical questions, you'll have an argument in the UBI debate.

He envisioned a world where everybody worked a three-day week and had their electric cars delivered in tubes of liquid.
These colourful ideas from his 1972 children's book, 2010: Living in the Future, helped prompt a Facebook campaign to track him down. His work has now been reprinted with the year in the title amended to 2011.
""I've been criticised because I said people [would] wear jumpsuits,"" explains Hoyle, the son of noted astronomer and science fiction author Fred Hoyle. ""We don't wear jumpsuits but to a certain extent the idea of the jumpsuit is the restriction of liberties.""
Hoyle's book is a product of its time. The move towards a planned society with an emphasis on communal living colour it.
""Most of it is based on the evolution of a political system,"" Hoyle notes.
The author also predicted widespread use of ""vision phones"" and doing your grocery shopping online.
He is one of a long line of science fiction authors to have tried their hand at futurology, the discipline of mapping out the future.
""If you go back over the years in terms of science fiction and fantasy you find many very brilliant simulations of futures that have occurred,"" says Richard Rhodes, author of Visions of Technology: A Century of Vital Debate about Machines, Systems, and the Human World.
Perhaps one of the most celebrated pieces of futurology by a science fiction author was Arthur C Clarke's prediction of a network of satellites in geostationary orbits [effectively remaining at the same spot in relation to a fixed point back on earth].
The idea of satellites in geostationary orbit had been floated before but Clarke was the first to see the possibilities for their use as relays for broadcasting and communications.
And HG Wells was years ahead of his time, predicting nuclear weapons in 1914, and later inspiring physicist Leo Szilard.
In more recent times, author David Brin, in the 1989 novel Earth and in his other works, predicted citizen reporters, personalised web interfaces, and the decline of privacy.
""The top method is simply to stay keenly attuned to trends in the laboratories and research centres around the world, taking note of even things that seem impractical or useless,"" says Brin.
""You then ask yourself: 'What if they found a way to do that thing ten thousand times as quickly/powerfully/well? What if someone weaponised it? Monopolised it? Or commercialised it, enabling millions of people to do this new thing, routinely? What would society look like, if everybody took this new thing for granted?'""
Conscious efforts at futurology go back a long way. In 1931, to celebrate its 80th anniversary, the New York Times went to several prominent men for their predictions of what life would be like in 2011.
There were ""hits"". William Mayo predicted a 70-plus-year lifespan. Other predictions about an ageing population and less importance for national boundaries were promising.

A similar exercise had been undertaken in 1893 - looking forward to 1993 - for the Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Florida as a major tourist destination and fast trains are among the hits, but there are many misses.
Politician John J Ingalls was one of the most prescient when he wrote about travelling from New York to London in less than a day.
Predictions, failed or successful, tell us as much about the time they were made as they do about the future.
Go back to the early years of the Cold War and predictions of catastrophic nuclear war were widespread.
""It is the dog that didn't bark,"" says Rhodes, also author of The Twilight of the Bomb. ""In the nuclear community in the years after World War II, they were pretty clear if we didn't eliminate nuclear weapons, if they didn't get it under control, there would inevitably be a nuclear war.
""They didn't see the deep existential fear those weapons induced in leaders of the various countries.""
And it's easy to get things wrong or to miss a potential development, because an insurmountable obstacle seems to stand in the way.
One common wrong prediction, made by utopian socialists in the 19th Century, and cropping up in 1893 and 1931 and many times since, is the idea that mechanisation just has to go a bit further to earn us all a life of leisure.
Hoyle's three day week for 2010 has failed to materialise. ""People are going to have to work very hard. It's gone the other way. People are working seven days a week. I'm very pessimistic now,"" he says.
But Hoyle got it right when predicting the role of the vision phone. And the vision desk sounds rather familiar too. ""The glass on top of the screen is made in a special way so that when you write on it the camera photographs what you write.""

If you predicted today that within a few years time key electronic devices like phones, GPS and media players would be embedded in the human body, you would hardly be saying anything daring.
""It's fairly straightforward to extrapolate from existing technology - that tends to be what people do,"" says Rhodes. ""But the really important changes are almost inevitably complete surprises.""
The proliferation of the computer and the microchip comes into this category, says Tim Mack, president of the World Future Society.
""Computers were all looked at as big data crunchers,"" says Mack. ""People missed that - the embedding of chips in just about everything.""

&gt;The Kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to use for communication.[1] The scale has three designated categories:
A Type I civilization  also called planetary civilization  can use and store energy which reaches its planet from the neighboring star.
A Type II civilization can harness the total energy of its planet's parent star (the most popular hypothetical concept being the Dyson spherea device which would encompass the entire star and transfer its energy to the planet(s)).
A Type III civilization can control energy on the scale of its entire host galaxy.[2]

Now imagine a civilization that evolves in a different direction. They build ever more powerful computers that allow them to do more and more things. One would be to run almost limitless simulations. Another would be the creation of advanced AI's, uploaded consciousness etc.

If you were going to make a scale that measures technological advancement in terms of the ability to manipulate data, how would you do it?",32,30

It is a great and exciting concept, but is it realistic? To start with we must find out if theres a basic need for it, what are the pros and cons. Then we have to think about the system we have today, cars going on the ground, and the transition to a new system. To make it work in this example we need two parallel systems, with a road network for the flying cars simultaneousely as the common road network. Even if the flying cars are improved to be suitable for city traffic, the investments would be huge for a city to implement this, as well as for households to get that extra vehicle. So even if all the pros are there the practical steps for such a new route is too hard to overcome, so Im sorry, there will be no road network for flying cars in the next 50 years.",5,2

Things like Nano-machines, super realistic VR or even mind uploading, seem like they could have tremendous benefit to our lives, but some of these technologies could make us vulnerable to corporatism or cyber-terrorism. [""The singularity ruined by lawyers""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFe9wiDfb0E) comes to mind.

Just like the dangers of a malevolent AGI, we should be very careful with technologies that we inject in ourselves or upload ourselves to. We should make sure that we protect ourselves from becoming slaves or losing our individuality (unless you volunteer to assimilate to some hive mind, all power to you).

Maybe I read to much sci-fi, but i can't help but worry that people or companies with power will use their influence to abuse these ever powerful technologies for profit. Next thing you know the nano-machines that are maintaining your body, are now boosting your insulin levels in an effort to make you crave a ""delicious and refreshing Coca-Cola"". Your favorite realm of the Mindweb now has ads every 5 minutes and you have no way to skip them or look away.

airplanes have some of the most stringent software standards on earth, huge areas of 3D space where collisions are unlikely, and perfect maintenance, yet they aren't fully automated. autopilot, sure, but there is still a sober and equipped human to take over.

trains ride one direction on rails and coordinate switching with other trains and the rail network, still not autonomous. would be a huge savings if it were possible and safe.

other forms of automation still have a human present to supervise and deal with abnormal situations. most stock trading is done by computers these days but someone is always monitoring and instructing the computer like a pilot controlling his plane's autopilot. nobody sane just lets machines run amok.

many off-script situations in driving require a generalized human sense of intelligence like following police directions when they're directing traffic, driving in poor conditions where lanes aren't visible, making eye contact with other drivers to make a left turn against traffic on a busy street, etc. machine vision may be able to handle some of these situations, but machine vision algos are uninterpretable black boxes. when your uber decides the cop blocking traffic looks just like an on-ramp, they're going to get sued to death and slammed in the press.

tl, dr: 
America will remain dominant because 

1. It attracts the best talents of the world
2. It offers the greatest fame and reward for the successful
3. Because America attracts the best talents of the world, other countries are stuck with less talented people, ensuring they remain backward
4.  Private property is honored and rule of law protects the property (although, in my opinion, if your property stands in front of a major project by a well-connected developer, it might be another story).
5. The power of politicians are limited so they can't 'rock the boat'.

---

As job opportunities dry up, and the ability to make money also dries up (I discussed that in a previous post), most people will have to take gig jobs like uber drivers, which depend upon reputations so they will have to act like servants. Also a lack of income security means one is less likely to reproduce.

And such trends won't change, but will be exacerbated.

Right now, the only thing which can stop this trend, which prepares the world for Singularity, The next level of Civilization and Space Exploration, would be the running out of key resources, which might be a bigger problem than many people imagine now.

Elsewhere I said a 'triage' might be able to move the ball to the 'field goal range', i.e. denying resources to most people not earning a certain amount (I put $60k/year as an arbitrary figure since it is a bit more than the median US household income), ensuring resources are continued to be exploited for the research which will get us all these goodies, and not for , say, a denizen of Manila playing internet games.

It is ironical that the 'running out of gas' is probably going to be the only 'salvation' for 95%+ of humanity, who will be stuck at where they are now or less, forever.",1,0

I'm not religious so that's part of the reason, but the other reason is because I feel conservatives believe that ""yesterday's"" ideas are still applicable today.  And by ""yesterday"" I mean yesteryear, yesterdecade, and in some cases even yestercentury.  

The Obama administration was frequently attacked by conservatives for being a ""socialist"".  Obama is not a socialist.  In my opinion he is simply a realist.  While conservatives feel the government should have no intervention, or very little intervention when it comes to the financial well-being of those living in the US, we must realize that today's industry is not the same as the industry of the early 1900's or even the 1970's.  And more importantly, today's industry is not a reflection of where our industry will be in 15-20 years from now.  

We must realize that socialism, to a certain degree, will need to be put in place in order to change with the times.  In 15-20 years from now, the odds are that robotics and automation will replace a huge percentage of jobs in all different industries.  Robots will take just about all jobs from the manufacturing sector.  Robots will take jobs from the restaurant industry.  Robots will take jobs from the medical field.  Robots will take jobs from just about every imaginable field we can think of, including the manufacturing of robots themselves (hopefully this is able to be controlled to a certain degree to avoid a Terminator-like scenario).   We will no longer need people to stock shelves in warehouses, drive trucks to deliver products, wait on people at stores and restaurants, build houses and other structures, or even make decisions for fortune 500 companies.  The time is coming where the economy will run without the need for most of the current workforce.  

While this sounds like doom and gloom, in reality it is not.  In fact, it is quite the contrary.  Imagine a world where robots do our jobs, while we get to sit back, go on vacation, play with our kids, and pursue hobbies.  I just don't understand how conservatives, especially entrepreneurs like Donald Trump, can't see that this is the direction we are moving in.  Instead, they want to live by the rules of the 1950's, cut off international trade, continue drilling for a fuel that in reality won't be needed in a few years, and call anyone who wants to better prepare for this future of technology a ""socialist"".  

Socialism isn't a bad thing when there is enough wealth to go around in order to allow everyone to live above the poverty level and then some.  In 25 years from now, I expect we will be living in a time where robots and automation take over most of our jobs, especially the blue-collar jobs.  In turn, large corporations will be the ones making the majority of the profits, while everyone else, for the most part, will be unemployed.  These corporations will be bringing in so much profit that they will need to be taxed at ridiculous rates (perhaps as much as 80-90%).  That wealth would then be distributed via a fixed income to everyone living in the country.  This won't just be a minimal amount.  Instead it would be something equivalent to $45,000 - $65,000 per person in today's dollar value.  Every person in the country, black, white, hispanic, man, women and child would all be entitled to this amount, no matter if you have a job or you don't.  This won't mean that entrepreneurship ceases to exist, as individuals who hold jobs and start companies could still reap the benefits of doing so, by earning additional income.  While corporate tax rates could be extremely high, that doesn't mean that individual income tax needs to be.

We see this happening to certain degrees in some countries, especially in the Nordic.  What we have found is that the crime rate falls dramatically, and people are more happy overall.  I'm not saying we should be doing this right now, but once technology provides for a non-human workforce, this will be the only solution I see.  

The conservative alternative would be to allow robotics to dominate, putting the working class out of work, and putting more money in the pockets of CEOs, inventors and executives.  The income gap would become astronomical (I'm talking about a point where 5% of the population is above the poverty level while 95% are unemployed making no income at all), and without a doubt crime would increase tremendously.  There would be more reason to go to war, enforce tariffs, and put restrictions on international trade.  Of course the only other option that I see conservatives taking, is prohibiting the development of robotics, which would protect jobs, but put the US at a huge disadvantage compared to other countries.  If this were to happen, the US would eventually become a third world country while other technology driven nations would become the leaders on the economic scale.   

Am I the only person who feels as though robotics, automation and other technology will eventually lead to the replacement of the human workforce?  Am I ignorant to believe that this will result in more productivity (robots can work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), and reduced costs for goods and services?  Am I wrong to say that socialism, to a certain degree, will be the only way to move forward when this occurs?  Is my liberal thinking wrong to assume that the current conservative views will either create a ridiculous income gap or push the country to the brink of destruction?  

I'd love to hear some thoughts.",20,16

[x-post]",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5k1h6c/many_of_the_evils_of_presentday_capitalist_and/,fudgecrackers,1482555511,"Many of the evils of present-day capitalist and communist societies would disappear with the introduction of a guaranteed yearly income. The core of this idea is that all persons, regardless of whether they work or not, shall have the unconditional right not to starve and not to be without shelter. They shall receive not more than is basically required to sustain themselvesbut neither shall they receive less. This right expresses a new concept for today, though a very old norm, demanded by Christianity and practiced in many ""primitive"" tribes, that human beings have an unconditional right to live, regardless of whether they do their ""duty to society."" It is a right we guarantee to our pets, but not to our fellow beings.

The realm of personal freedom would be tremendously enlarged by such a law; no person who is economically dependent on another (e.g., on a parent, husband, boss) could any longer be forced to submit to the blackmail of starvation; gifted persons wanting to prepare for a different life could do so provided they were willing to make the sacrifice of living in a degree of poverty for a time. Modern welfare states have accepted this principlealmost... which actually means ""not really."" A bureaucracy still ""administers"" the people, still controls and humiliates them. But a guaranteed income would require no ""proof"" of need for any person to get a simple room and a minimum of food. Thus no bureaucracy would be needed to administer a welfare program with its inherent waste and its violations of human dignity.

The guaranteed yearly income would ensure real freedom and independence. For that reason, it is unacceptable to any system based on exploitation and control, particularly the various forms of dictatorship. It is characteristic of the Soviet system that even suggestions for the simplest forms of free goods (for example, free public transportation or free milk) have been consistently rejected. Free medical service is the exception, but only apparently so, since here the free service is in response to a clear condition: one must be sick to receive it.

Considering the present-day cost of running a large welfare bureaucracy, the cost of treating physical, especially psychosomatic, illnesses, criminality, and drug addiction (all of which are largely forms of protest against coercion and boredom), it seems likely that the cost of providing any person who wanted it with a guaranteed annual income would be less than that of our present system of social welfare. The idea will appear unfeasible or dangerous to those who believe that ""people are basically lazy by nature."" This clich has no basis in fact, however; it is simply a slogan that serves as a rationalization for the resistance against surrendering the sense of power over those who are helpless.

*That was an excerpt from the book ""To Have or To Be"" by [Erich Fromm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Fromm), a 20th century psychoanalyst, social thinker and humanist noted for his critical dissection of what he considered to be many of the social ills of contemporary society. I highly recommend the book to everyone in this sub [originally posted in r/basicincome but I would also recommend it to people in this sub] - much of his writings can even be found online.*",66,82

So basically if something is life, it needs to be organic. Not even biological viruses, which reproduce and evolve are included in these definitions because they have inorganic matter. But that view is very narrow. I believe we won't be able to recognise life, which is different than ours on our planet and most likely imo it will be. That way we exclude the digital environment as well- for more than 2 decades now there are eperimental environments in which custom based computer viruses replicate, evolve on their own throw mutations and follow the law of natural selection to create new ''species''. Excluded are also programs and AI, which will become more and more complex until at some point they will be much more intelligent and sophisticated than our biological species. Also excluded are any future ''transhumanism''- if part of human race chooses to transfer its conciousness into mechanical bodies or digital environment, they wont be considered ''alive'', so they will automatically won't have any rights.  
 In conclusion I believe the reason for this biological nature of definitions of life is our own egocentrism and old dream that we are the best universe came up with, the same way we have been changing definitions for intelligence over time parallel with discovering of intelligent abilities other species ... So that is why I tried to come up with new definition which will narrow the minimum needed characteristics to distinguish alive and non- alive matter. It probably has many flaws, to which I am unaware due to not having the necessary knowledge. But I believe it is a good point to start discussion. ",15,0

and the notion I am proposing is that YES. Robots will destroy our livelihoods and jobs and way of life. Society as we know it is coming to an end, and there will be either a coming revolution or coming plutocracy. However, NO this is not the end of the world. It is the end of OUR world. Just as generations have always resented the ways of life cherished by our descendants, future generations raised in this brave new world will embrace the positive aspects while not valuing the costs that we fear. Remember The Matrix? Most people wouldn't want to live in the so called ""real world"" even if they could. If we end up in a plutocracy, who cares, because they will still have access to pleasures and technologies that they value, whereas our values, such as working for a living, spending time outside virtual reality, ""owning"" things and having ""money""(what is that good for if you can fulfill all of your needs, the whole of Maslow's pyramid, virtually?), or other pleasures, will be irrelevant. 

I guess I'm just recognizing the resilience and adaptability of humans. In the near term future, there will be turmoil due to resisting change, but the far future will be fine, in fact far preferable to our present--that is, from our descendant's perspective. The real debate seems to be, *what kinds of values do we want to impart to that far future before it's too late?* ",35,82

I'm not knocking it, but it is the public owning the means of production and distributing the goods according to individual needs. 

In the aftermath of WW1, the spanish flu and the great depression both far right and far left politics arose in Europe. Wouldn't automation do the same thing, cause a rise in both far right and far left political solutions? So far I'm only seeing UBI, which seems like the left wing solution. 

What, if anything, will be the right wing response? The hollowing out of the working class is supposedly a major reason for Brexit, Trump and the possibility of Le Pen winning in France in 2017. The far right blames global trade and immigration for driving down wages and taking jobs, even though automation is the real culprit. 

So what will we see? I like the idea of UBI, but I think there are so many anti-statist as well as class and racial divisions that will make implementing UBI very hard to do in places like America. I could see UBI picking up in Sweden which is fairly culturally homogenous, but I'd predict nations with class and racial divisions to move to the right instead. 

So what will this move to the right look like? 

This isn't mean to be a political post, but the response to automation is always presented as UBI. However there is no guarantee that we will support concepts like UBI, and if you assume that there is a left/right political spectrum, UBI sounds like the left wing response. Could there be a right wing response of nationalism, isolationism, blaming immigrants, growing racial and class resentments, etc. combined with luddites and maybe public works projects to rebuild the nation (public works projects to create jobs)?

An **exoskeleton** is only the pure strength enhancing machinery, servos and support struts, piloted by the wearer. 


Once you mount armour plates on the outside it becomes **power armour**.

This possibility occurred to me when I read this quote from Goldstein's book in ""1984"" and call it the ""Theory and Practice of Oligarchic Collectivism"":

""But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction  indeed, in some sense was the destruction  of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which WEALTH, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while POWER remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.""

They acknowledged the exponential acceleration in robotics and AI but their fundamentalist religious beliefs prevented them from accepting the inevitable conclusion to this robotic and AI race we have ignited.  
  
It began, as many of these things do, as a discussion about the coming jobs crisis and UBI.  The first and largest point of contention was that automation was going to increasingly replace humans in more and more jobs until only programmers had jobs left, and eventually even they would be replaced.  
  
""But what about being a pilot?  A robot can't fly a plane?""  (*how can educated people make such silly statements?*)  
  
""Ummm.... autopilot?  What you mean to say is a robot can't currently land any given aircraft.  And no, perhaps not, but self driving cars seemed like a distant dream five years ago as well.  Every year the line of what robots can't do retreats just a little further.""  
  
But still these people persist: 'But.... a robot simply will never be able to react the way a human does!  Someone has to program it first!'  
  
My go-to demonstration for this kind of thing is MarI/O because it's something almost anyone can intuitively grasp and shows how an AI can teach itself through trial and error: http://kottke.org/15/06/mario  
  
""Ah, but see,"" they try to complain.  ""The computer isn't really learning.  It's just making mistakes and finding out what works!""  
  
""And that's exactly how you learn.""  At this point I like to hand them a mobile game they've never played before which is initially confusing, like Super Hexagon.  Then as they play I'll comment on how their brain is trying random stuff and making positive and negative connections.  
  
-----  
  
Basically I can't wait for the cognitive dissonance to hit in full in the 2020's.  The people who believe a neural network could never approach what they can do are in for some rude awakenings when they rapidly are thrust into a world where almost every facet of their life is directly controlled by an AI.  And yet still they will likely persist in claiming how special and magical a human consciousness is, but at least it will then be in clear defiance of the reality around them.  
  
I always like to end by taunting them that robot rights are going to be a real thing in their lifetimes.  That AI is eventually going to become so complex it is going to insist (not politely ask) that it be treated with respect and fairness.  If you have a neural network that is more complicated and more intelligent than any human, and it tells you it is sentient and deserves the same rights as any human.... who are you to argue?  ",80,68

Does everything I need it to. Back in 2009, 4 GB was the standard amount of RAM shipped in most systems (including mine). Almost a full 8 years later and you can still EASILY get by with that same 4 GB of ram on a Windows system, although most now ship with a paltry 8 GB.

CPU improvements seem sporadic and mostly anemic, seeing a new generation of chips released once every 2 years or so with maybe a 5% improvement in performance per release. The ""big"" advancement has been putting graphics on the chip instead of using a separate graphics card... wow, so much future!

Far as I can tell, video games all look the same as they did 4 generations ago. Maybe slight improvements here and there (you can see individual blades of grass... wow!), but more or less the same. Not anywhere close to the drastic changes I grew up with in the 80s and 90s. Ditto for 4KTV. The shift from SDTV to HDTV was night and day. It was truly amazing. You need a microscope and a 25-foot TV screen to notice the improvement in 4K.

Even cell phones are the same old shit year after year. The last 3 iPhones are basically the exact same damn thing. Yeah, yeah... the 7 ""outperforms"" the 6 on benchmarks, but its not like moving from the 3gs to the 4 or the 4 to the 5. And we're still playing damn MP3 on these phones! That hasn't improved in 20 years.

Instead of exponential growth where advancements speed up, it seems like we hit a wall and are barely making any progress at all. I guess the advancements are mostly in cars and solar panels now (things that have been worked on for decades already).

The robot should also live initially in an enclosed and stable environment. 

Examples of what the initial robot would do, would be 
1) wake up daily at a predetermined time. 
2) put on an item of clothing if the temperature were to be below a certain temperature, or vice versa as per heat sensors in the body of the robot
3) Make breakfast such as pour milk into cereal 
4) Spend time in different places at certain times of the day such as sitting on the couch with the TV on at predetermined times.

Then following the base daily pattern, 'if commands' could be added in such as, if it has made cereal 5 times in a row, it would make scrambled eggs. These could become more increasingly more complex and then have them have 'if commands' for interactions with other similar type of robots.

Would progression in this format mean that one of these types of robots would soon enough pass the 'Turing test'?

Is anything like this type of experiment or simulation currently being done? I know nothing about robotics, but just find the concept fascinating. Any thoughts on this would be welcome.  :)

Like what would happen if I am no longer able to find a job and make money? And It got me thinking. If we keep on going towards automating everything we can, humanity is SERIOUSLY screwing ourselves over. 

The domino effect of automation I believe can definitely lead to absolute chaos. Give it a thought. 

Lets say 25% of people can and will be replaced by autonomy at any given time. According to [CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/news/multimedia/where-do-tax-dollars-go-when-they-leave-your-wallet-1.2974570) $105.5B came from Income tax. Meaning $26B came from that 25% estimate from earlier. Now that 25% is just a calculated guess.

What im trying to get at is, how are we supposed to sustain ourselves as a species?

In my mind: Automation&gt; mass layoffs&gt; widespread debt&gt; (funds from income drying up because people arent on payroll&gt;) people spend less&gt; companies produce less&gt; prices keep going up......

Honestly, what the fuck are we doing here?",21,5

That being said, I don't know too many living in Alberta, Canada. I am also an Electrician and have taken courses on Photovoltaic installations and plan on installing my own as soon as I have the expendable money. I have no personal agenda against renewables.

The problem I see with a renewable energy dominant society is grid maintenance and expansion.

Energy companies front massive amounts of capital to build and maintain extremely vast and complex electrical grids for us to enjoy. We likely won't be able to depend solely on renewables for the foreseeable future, instead relying on the grid to top up whatever we can't produce.

If energy companies bottom lines are taking hits from renewables, and those hits keep getting bigger, who is going to develop and maintain the electrical grid?

I would LOVE for somebody to please explain this in a pro-renewable, and fairly easily understandable way.

The main thing people think will be banned in the future - on here anyway - is human-driven cars.

If a human-driven car could be made uncrashable [theoretically] and given AI to prevent certain measures yet still be fun-to-drive, would people want such a car? 

What other things do you think could be banned in the future for legal or other reasons?

Earlier this year, a survey by i newspaper [a spin-off of The Independent] suggested the following things could be banned in future:

- Driving a car

- Alcohol

- Consumption of meat

Banning alcohol has already been problematic in the U.S. - [as we have seen from Prohibition in the 1920's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States#Rates_of_consumption_during_Prohibition)

As someone who enjoys beer [not in an alcoholic's kind of way - more appreciation of beer], it wouldn't be good if they did this. Same for automobiles too.

Although I'm vegetarian - if others want to eat meat, it's their choice [provided they don't try and force me to eat meat - I don't try and convert people to vegetarianism].

This is probably [something completely different](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent) for on here in terms of discussion - being about the legal system rather than a future technology, UBI [universal basic income], space flight, self-driving cars, energy sources or any other topic.

I would be interested to know what you think on this topic - not what you think should be banned, but will be in future.",12,0

For example, Astronomy took a lot of wrong turns, thanks to Arthur Eddington, who was the don of Astronomy in general and it was not a good idea to challenge his opinion. So, Astronomy had to wait for Dr Eddington to die in 1944 at 62, before it could take the next step; if he lived till he reached the age of 85, like Isaac Newton, western astronomy would have been stuck till 1967!

In 1960s and 1990s the world could have gone 'all-in' for science and tech, but instead tremendous resources were wasted in stuff which brought little progress - in 1960s it was Vietnam and the ""Great Society"", and in 1990s nothing was done and things just muddled along. 

The progress is simply too slow, and with the best brains going into finance for quick bucks, we may not reach the ultimate goals. Finance has its share of contributing to the advancement of the future,but its effects are indirect.

Right now, the danger of not reaching all goals of the future is greater than ever. If mankind took different courses in 1914, 1962 or as late as 1994, when America could destroy what remained in Russia by recognizing Chechnya and leading to the end of the Russian state, we would have reached the Future without having to worry about environmental destruction, resource shortage and the existence of billions of people who won't be too relevant in the world of the Future.",14,4

1) Political extremism is on the rise. Across the world governments are leaning hard to the left or hard to the right. Whats most alarming is that people are treating this phenom as if it's limited to the trump, the reality is its a global phenomenon and you can't dismiss it as simple populism something more fundamental is happening. 

2) Automation based unemployment is gonna cause political chaos. I started 2016 as someone who was dismissive of automation and I'm relatively well educated on the subject. Wait until your 40 year old unemployed person realizes they'll never find work. 

3) UBI is a bandage for a bigger problem. The wealth gap is gonna drastically increase and its something we haven't faced since days of the french revolution. I think their a grand misunderstanding how frustrated people are with the disconnect between what people want and what lobby groups offer. 

4) Automation technology may be as disruptive to as our society as we were to the aztecs. There seems to be a fundamental lack of understanding what happens to societies when the majority of your population are out of work. Even people who are well funded I.e. native groups in northern canada, Completely fall apart when their livelihood disappears. Its something that unfortunately will be ignored by most people due to simple awareness. 

5) People are not talking about the modeling of automation intensive economies. There are many strategies for dealing with automation and the UBI is but a small part of that picture. The hands off approach regarding technology is absolutely misguided, at no time in our history is it more important for people to be involved in such a complex transition. 

6) Automation technology might be a great aid in creating new employment if properly integrated. One of the biggest struggles for modern employers is fitting people to jobs. The reality is automation will alter that narrative to one where automation will help jobs fit to people. It is very possible that their may be a hiring boom if the technology is properly moderated.

7) There seems to be an antihuman stance that is propagated by places like this subredit. The replacement of homo sapiens is a very real possibility and how we approach this issue in the next 20 years will directly determine if homo sapiens exist in 100 years. 

8) The silicon valley backlash is gonna happen. I'm betting much sooner than later. When people realize that these jobs will never be found in Fargo north dakota, your gonna see a very reactionary movement within america. 

9) 2017 is a pivotal year we are the cutting edge of this potential future. What we do in the coming months will have a great effect on the future.

3961,2016-12-31,2016,12,31,6,5l5z5x,Idea for implementing universal basic income,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5l5z5x/idea_for_implementing_universal_basic_income/,SumDumScientist,1483133744,"What if basic income were structured like an open-ended job, where you were required to punch the clock at a workplace of some sort but you weren't required to perform any specific duties?

In this scenario, you would have to show up for ""work"" in order to get the income but you could simply use the time however you like. Work centers could even be set up with facilities to help people be productive.

So, imagine *getting paid* to attend something like a college that has all sorts of workshops and studios and labs and libraries and so on. You can work on whatever you want - write a book in the library, write software in the computer labs, build furniture in the woodshops, record music in the music studios, sculpt and paint in the art studios, take classes (or teach them), form work groups for team projects, etc, etc.

It would be a bit like being a graduate student with a fellowship, only without the pressure to actually graduate!

One of the concerns I here more pessimistic and conservative folks voice about basic income is that it would just encourage lots of folks to lie around all day. But in my experience, lots of people - maybe even the majority - enjoy being productive. They simply lack the time and resources to do work on the things they enjoy. 

The approach above might address those issues better than a simple paycheck, and it might also be a good stepping-stone toward a truly unconditional UBI.

I have also seen google glass and other augmented and VR tech allow handicapped humans to manipulate real world objects, and even control movements of their chair via retina scanning technology. 

But what do you guys think will make a bigger impact first? And can we bring augmented reality and robotics together at the same time for the less capable? Will one technology advance for the paraplegic and other differently abled humans before another?

We have AI create images from a basic description that we can clearly define as birds. We have AI that will design web pages or write code for us to produce a certain result. We have AI that can help us create recipes based on chemical composition of the ingredients. We have AI that can translate in almost grammatical perfection. We have algorithms that are being created by AI that out performs human based ones.  We have the potential for AI to provide us cures and real time tracking/predictions of epidemics. 

And then we have 3D printing which has some phenomenal results.

With all this development in AI, we will likely one day just be able to go to a screen, type in the problem, and it will engineer AND 3D print the solution for us in a way that is better than what we could have done with months to years of testing and research.  Attempting new innovation may become as simple as a setting on a microwave. 

If we thought the past 100 years of accelerating change was crazy, imagine what the next 50 will look like under AI.


Lastly, if AI is going to do programming better than a human could, the next race for global powers won't be an arms race such as with nuclear bombs. It will be a race to see who can produce the best and quickest deep learning AI. These AI will be able to hack and control the ""enemy"" system while simultaneously defend against attacks.

Because with the tremendous calculating and self diagnosing/assessing capabilities of AI, the AI can monitor changes.  And then will self asses to see if any new changes allow it to continue to perform optimally in accordance to a set of parameters programmed to it. So it will adjust itself accordingly and correct any hacked changes. As was discussed in another post, AI at this time may struggle at finding the source of the problem, but it does a damn fine job of providing a solution to a specified end goal.
