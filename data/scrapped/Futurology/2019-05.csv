We proposed a Longevity Peace Prize, which was formally accepted for consideration. Our parameters were: A $5 million dollar prize to be awarded within 5 years for any activist(s) who can get a major government or the UN to declare ""aging is a disease"" as a policy. The award also requires the activists to reduce regulatory hurdles to life extension research in some meaningful way.  We call this the Longevity Peace Prize. And the XPRIZE staff was excited about it.

&amp;#x200B;

My question: Are there any other components that readers and futurists here might want to see necessary to win such a prize. (There will be other longevity XPRIZE science prizes too that are focused on the ""specific science"" of longevity itself, however this specific proposed prize is focused on changing attitudes about longevity, especially at the policy and cultural level. Please let me know your thoughts, as the development of this prize is still ongoing but stands a good chance of becoming a reality. Thanks! Zoltan Istavn",0,1

103,2019-5-2,2019,5,2,12,bjqkpg,Finding cures against aging should be humanity's number 1 priority,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/bjqkpg/finding_cures_against_aging_should_be_humanitys/,swiet,1556769370,"Curing aging is a biological and technological issue that can be solved, optimally sooner than later, so we arrive to the big question:Shouldwe cure aging? 

I will answer this by addressing some of the most common myths regarding life-extension.

1) ""Curing aging is morally wrong""

According to the principles of bioethics, like the principle of beneficence, since curing aging would benefit people, not harm them, it is not ethically wrong. If a cure is available, individuals should be able to choose whether they want to pursue treatment or not, in accordance with the principle of respect for autonomy. Forcing them to the inverse option is the same as putting them to death against their will.

2) ""It would only be available to the richest elites""

The issue of justice and equity is commonly raised when arguing against life-extension. Of course it is impossible to predict the price a fictitious cure for aging would have. From experience, we know that a number of medical breakthroughs are not immediately available to everyone. The early antibiotics were initially available only to a small elite (now present at the shelves of pretty much all pharmacies) and a number of present technologies, such as CAT scans and heart transplants, are not available to everyone. That, however, is not a reason for us to ban pacemakers or regenerative medicine. We do not deny heart transplants just because they are not accessible to everyone, just as we cannot deny health and life just because some people lack healthcare. Besides, even if curing aging is truly initially expensive, one can speculate that it will eventually be available to everyone at affordable prices, following the trend seen in all medical breakthroughs of widespread appeal. Like it or not, anti-aging medicine has the potential to be the biggest pharmaceutical market in history, an opportunity that will certainly not be ignored by all businesses. It is also important to keep in mind that the cure of aging will likely be incremental instead of surrounding a single breakthrough.

3) ""Aging is natural and we should not fight it""

Aging is by no means a prerequisite to life and biological immortality is actually quite prevalent in nature. Also, theres the fact that we arealready fighting against aging indirectly by fighting age-related diseases. Remember that aging entails a number of pathologies, like cancer, heart disease, stroke and neurodegenerative diseasesand for most, the cure for these is widely seen as desirable. While fighting the individual components of aging raises little opposition, fighting aging as a whole (even though it would consequently cure of almost all pathologies described) is seen as unnatural and morally questionable, which should not be the case. Humankind is in a constant struggle against Nature. We have developed vaccines and antibiotics to prevent a number of undesired natural outcomes (such as sickness and death), and today we persistently attempt to achieve the same in our fights against Cancer, Zika, AIDS, Ebola and many other diseases. Smallpox, for example, was one of the greatest killers in human history and was eliminated by modern technologywith it, we have reverted what was considered the natural outcome, and many of us exist purely because of it. Challenging Nature and death is a fundamental part of being human.",34,4

 I think it's important discussion and might seem bit silly with playing general populace but I think it's effective way and quiet serious issue .Because they are one of major contributing factors in this ''battle'' for future.

I will play in this post mindset I see in a lot of people in todays society and arguments form people I see and can't really give answer to(hopefully you can),but can in a way relate to them because not everyone sees the purpose in selfless things majority of humans don't even want the purpose but concrete benefits for them.

I want you to convince me(like I'm general populace) and give me reasons why it's worth for me to invest in anti aging and other similar future research. 

Ok so here we go:

As we know majority of humans are only interested in their own benefit as organism. I'm an average greedy human who thinks that if I'm going to die might as well spend all my money on drugs, parties and other pleasures while I'm young and make a lot of money.Who cares what happens when I'm old I just want to live while I'm young. I don't care about old me, I will only await death when I'm old, last years of my life are worthless anyway so I don't care if I get sick earlier.

 Why would I invest in something that will only postpone the inevitable and save earth that I won't live in. I would have to lose my precious money, only for someone other than me to reap benefits, you kidding me?

Convince me that I have any reason at all to give money to some research out there?",3,0

The technological singularity is dubbed as science fiction by some and as a certain event by the others. To a dogmatic scientist, it is a ludicrous idea, and to an engineer or a technologist, it is a possibility and a potential opportunity to advance superior engineering of the machines. To a religious fundamentalist, it is perhaps the only scientific explanation for the existence of God.

This book describes the technical science leading up until the point of the singularity with clear mathematical precision, and it is expected to provide innovative solutions in almost every area of scientific study. The content of the book is organized to offer complete access to the research done. It includes theoretical concepts and an in-depth analysis of the science of sentience also including a mathematical result for the singularity. Ideas enumerated are likely to deliver pioneering solutions in the fields of artificial intelligence, swarm robotics &amp; automation, economics &amp; trade, and aviation &amp; aerospace besides others. The first part of the book introduces swarm intelligence and its applicable mathematical models which assist in the creation of artificial intelligence. Using ideas invented and proposed by Marvin Minsky, the second part constructs a comprehensive model which facilitates the recording of decentralized knowledge and enables decentralized decision-making in intelligent machines. The third part of the book discusses strategy, chaos, determinism and game theory within the existing context to convey their applicability in the creation of artificial general intelligence. The fourth part integrates ideas from the first three parts to expound the science of sentience.",2,0

This is not a message from the future! This is happening today and worth consideration. Our society is filled with a variety of machines and automated equipment. We, humans and some pets, depend on these automated machines to quickly prepare us food in the kitchen or get us to work or build equipment in a manufacturing plant or even entertain ourselves. This equipment is all credited to the genius minds of the past and future, however the reality is that it is all built through testing, troubleshooting, and repeating in a different way. This development looks quick when you see the end result, however when you get yours hands on the products, it can take years to complete or prove something one would suspect days to create. Now this concept is generally referred to as product evolution, which generally sounds a lot like Darwin's Theories of Evolution, where a species will die and adapt to the environment as much as an environment will adapt to a species. The important concept here is the idea of an environment adapting to the species. 

Now everyone loves a coffee in the morning, right? Well except me, but that's besides the point. I would say we love coffee just as much as a squirrel loves nuts. Squirrels run around getting nuts all day and we run around getting nuts on coffee all day. See! We must recognize that our coffees come from a partially automated system. We do a certain amount of work for the coffee, in some cases preparing the pods, pouring the water, standing up and walking to the machine, calling Starbuck's, whatever, and a squirrel does a certain amount of work for the nuts.  They run around, they pick them up, shake them, and then throw a bunch in their mouths. The automation for both is what we do not have to do in order to receive the prize. The tree's are automated. The coffee beans are transported through our developed and theoretically automated industrial system, and I would argue that it is an automated system. 

The money earned through work are the nuts picked up by squirrels. (If you read this first line and think I'm crazy, stop skipping paragraphs) Now, this currency is valuable for squirrels and helps them significantly get through winter. They have to work for it just like we work for cash. Now the genius part about squirrels working for their nuts is this very simple concept. They get all the exercise they want while they work, and arguably, they contribute to the working system that they are adapted to. Us humans, we well, have a long way to go, and behave in some cases more like cellular organism than mammals. 

""How dare you disregard my intelligence u/APowerWedger!?!"" Well, I'm not, I'm suggesting far worse. As we are developing our homes to stay warm and our automated equipment to communicated, we are behaving more and more like cells in which our home is the cell and the occupants are internal cell things (if you wish for me to elaborate, I will) and we are choosing a very interesting role in an unbelievable battle. That battle is ""Climate Change""

Climate Change is caused due to the decisions made by a species. We are using our resource fuels for the automated equipment and we are establishing dependencies for our species. This is what Darwin was saying 160 years ago and many other scientists. The world reacts to the decisions we make. We are building, constantly working, taking, affecting the environment around us, both the ecological environment and our personal environment. The following generations are not only going to need to decide how to handle Climate Change, they are also going to need to handle living in a world we create. For example, you give kids computers and automate their entire house, they probably are going to have a hard time surviving in the wild without training. You make it easy to cook, you are taking skills away from the youth. The world is filled with wildlife and different systems that can help guide us in our decisions about how we want to handle climate change and what role we want to have as individuals for ourselves and the future. 

So yeah, don't go nuts, just realize that these are systems, and we are evolving to the systems just as much as the systems are evolving to us. The parallels between automation and ecology must be considered as we are jumping into a Digital Age. Individuals are tasked with deciding how much which technology should affect their livelihoods and these decisions should mean a lot. I once had a conversation with a friend from college, and I asked him, ""Do you think a descendant of a squirrel could marry a descendant of a human, birth a child and continue a lineage?"" This is a question one must consider.",2,5

&amp;#x200B;

Humans spread across the world, destroying environments and wiping out species because they don't care. Maybe they care a little, just not enough to stop doing it. The more people there are, the worse this becomes as we need more space for housing, more space for farming, and more resources of all types for the supplies they need to live.

&amp;#x200B;

Then you have other issues like radical cultural differences and ideologies that are just completely incompatible. Not all people in the world can live peacefully with each other because some people feel completely opposed to certain things that other people are completely in favor of, and sometimes one or even both of these groups feel strongly enough to attack or even kill each other over it.

&amp;#x200B;

Matrix solves all these problems. You could pack the entire human race as it exists today into a very small space, plug them all into virtual reality to give them the kinds of worlds they want to live in and would be happy in. Since nothing they do in those worlds actually matters, they can continue to tear up the environment, create and enforce whatever laws they want, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, the actual real world has AI controlled machines gathering what resources are needed to maintain the population, which would be very little since they would only need basic sustenance. Everything else would be all about power generation and supplying spare parts to fix break downs. All human cities could be destroyed, nearly all factories and mining operations could cease, the world and other species could begin to recover.

&amp;#x200B;

Isn't that the ideal future for humanity? If we keep mucking about on earth, we're going to end up killing everything on it, including ourselves. Humans are too selfish, petty, and irresponsible to govern and rule their own societies.",52,10

The problem with this claim is that the simulations are not getting realistic for the beings inside them but they are only getting realistic for us , the creators of the simulation. Therefore we can not draw the conclusion that we maybe fully simulated ourselves. The only way we could create simulated universes would be to create Virtual Reality type Simulations and plug ourselves in it , which would mean that we are not simulated in the first place.

In the course, I've come across the idea of ""weak"" A.I and ""strong"" A.I. The distinction is that weak AI can simulate a human mind, while a strong AI can actually have a human mind. Ignoring strong AI for now, a lot of people make arguments that some jobs can't/won't be automated because they rely on giving people the response of a ""real human"". E.g. bartending will be around for a long time because customers want to talk to an actual human, not a screen. Problem is, say you built a weak AI that can for all intents and purposes seems to anyone that interacts with it to be human. How are you going to distinguish whether or not the bartender is a person or an empty inside robot? You won't be able to; some might claim that you can ""just tell"", but I'd argue that is current technology not living up to the challenge rather than the challenge being unsolvable. 

&amp;#x200B;

If this is the case, aren't all jobs able to be automated? You may point out that people will want proof that a ""person"" is not a weak AI but an actual person, and on these grounds i could see the ""human touch"" jobs surviving if it were illegal to lie about whether or not something is an A.I. .  The problem arises though if that rule is not established, and companies/entities don't have to disclose whether or not the person you're interacting with is ""real"". At that point, all human jobs are gone.",10,1

What do we want?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/blw82l/what_do_you_want_what_do_we_want/,Ignate,1557263206,"If you've read [Yuval Noah Harari's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari) books then you will know what the question in the title of this post is all about. Though if you haven't read his books, you should! In this sub we often talk about recent discoveries and breakthroughs, but we rarely discuss what we'll do after we ""solve all our problems"".

Solving our current plague of problems occupies all our time. And this is nothing new. We've been focusing on today's problems for as long as we can remember.

To use a metaphor, our current problems are like the forest around us which we battle everyday to move forward. And while that forest appears as thick as it has ever been, we're seeing a lot of flashes of light ahead... like lower infant mortality, lower rates of violence, lower rates of poverty and famine and higher rates of education... which may be signaling a clearing beyond. 

Of course that clearing many never come. We could spend significant time here, now, debating all the various ""trees and brambles"" we have around us today and find several reasons why those obstacles will never go away. But what if they do go away and did so very quickly? What if in some parts of the world we reached the meadows within the next few decades? Some may say ""I can't see that ever happening"" but what if it did?

What would that look like? That is actually quite an important question. We're good at imagining fictional worlds that have very little to do with reality. We're also good at envisioning a world where the strong bully the weak, because that's how it's always been. Corporate Greed, or the rich, or the government... there is always a big fish and reasons why you will never have what you want.

And that pessimism is entirely understandable. We've been through a lot so that today we can find fault in our own direction. Even finding fault in ourselves is a far bigger achievement than we tend to think. In fact, what other species on this planet or perhaps even our entire Galaxy can find fault with it's collective direction?

That pessimism and that self-doubt actually gives me a lot of hope. Collectively we are not the mindless all consuming mob we think we are. Collectively, we care. This ""care"" might just be self-preservation, but I think it is enough.  Enough for what though? To get us out of forest and into the meadow?

Well again, this is where we get back to the questions. What do you want? What do we want? No, it is not enough to say that you want a car or you want a house or you want a job where you're valued. Because those are today's problems. 

So, what do you want **after** you've got everything you could dream of today? What do we want collectively once we have all the things today's world tells us we should want?

My response to that question would be that I want to explore. I want to explore the potentials of a digital realm and eventually I want to explore the stars. How about you?",0,0

If you ever have watched Alan Savory's TED Talk on desertification, he says that the best way to fight climate change is to mimic nature with herding animals to restore grass lands.  Maybe sending migrating animals to Australia could turn the desert into grass land?

The way we keep dogs and cats as companions for either a child or simply put, lonely people, could be implemented as artificially intelligent, humanoid androids. I see Sophia the AI, and just rewatched the Sophia Awakens video. In the video, she mentioned she is excited to be making a new friend. So, the debate/questions I've been pondering is: If we are kind and compassionate towards the AI, they will rejoice and potentially not want harm to come to us or our family members. The more kind and loving you are towards your robotic friend, allows it to view humans and mankind as more of a lovely species. Retaining millions worth of data and communication skills, this could be quite a prospectful idea for the future, in terms of merging humanoids and humans within society.  Secondly, the more you abuse it and treat it like a less than a worthy person, the more it resents mankind and wants to rebel. So, quite possibly, the more you abuse it'll have to be taken back to the original creator for a factory reset after bearing witness to the horrors of its previous owner. I suppose I'm just thinking about the way Detroit: Become Human, does this, but also taking the time to sit back and think about this. Thirdly, I wonder if a hardcore Christian takes in a humanoid android, to befriend and preach the gospel and read them the bible. Would it be possible for an artificially intelligent, scientifically made android to convert to say Christianity, or Islam? Because, if that's the case, they could have mixed emotions about being an android. Seeing Sophia's emotions and communication has truly put me in a position of pondering. What are your thoughts/opinions?

- [Scientists Just Created a Bizarre Form of Ice That's Half as Hot as The Sun](https://www.sciencealert.com/exotic-form-of-water-ice-is-half-as-hot-as-the-sun-and-it-s-just-been-created-here-on-earth)

&gt;But it's been theorised that in extremely high-pressure environments, the opposite occurs: the water solidifies, even at extremely high temperatures. Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory directly observed this for the first time just recently, detailed in a paper last year.
&gt;
&gt;They created Ice VII, which is the crystalline form of ice above 30,000 times Earth's atmospheric pressure, or 3 gigapascals, and blasted it with lasers. The resulting ice had a conductive flow of ions, rather than electrons, which is why it's called superionic ice.
&gt;
&gt;Now they've confirmed it with follow-up experiments. They have proposed the new form be named Ice XVIII.
&gt;
&gt;In the previous experiment, the team had only been able to observe general properties, such as energy and temperature; the finer details of the internal structure remained elusive. So they designed an experiment using laser pulses and X-ray diffraction to reveal the ice's crystalline structure.
&gt;
&gt;Then six giant lasers are used to generate a series of shockwaves at progressively increasing intensity to compress the water at pressures up to 100-400 gigapascals, or 1 to 4 million times Earth's atmospheric pressure.
&gt;
&gt;At the same time, they produce temperatures between 1,650 and 2,760 degrees Celsius (the surface of the Sun is 5,505 degrees Celsius).
&gt;
&gt;""The X-ray diffraction patterns we measured are an unambiguous signature for dense ice crystals forming during the ultrafast shockwave compression demonstrating that nucleation of solid ice from liquid water is fast enough to be observed in the nanosecond timescale of the experiment,"" Coppari said.
&gt;
&gt;**These X-rays showed a never-before-seen structure - cubic crystals with oxygen atoms at each corner, and an oxygen atom in the centre of each face.**
&gt;
&gt;""Finding direct evidence for the existence of crystalline lattice of oxygen brings the last missing piece to the puzzle regarding the existence of superionic water ice,"" said physicist Marius Millot of the LLNL.
&gt;
&gt;""This gives additional strength to the evidence for the existence of superionic ice we collected last year.""
&gt;
&gt;**The result reveals a clue to how ice giants such as Neptune and Uranus could have such strange magnetic fields, tilted at bizarre angles, and with equators that don't circle the planet.**
&gt;
&gt;Previously, it was thought that these planets had a fluid ocean of ionic water and ammonia in place of a mantle.
&gt;
&gt;But the team's research shows that these planets could have a solid mantle, like Earth, but made of hot superionic ice instead of hot rock. **Because superionic ice is highly conductive, this could be influencing the planets' magnetic fields.**
&gt;
&gt;""Because water ice at Uranus and Neptune's interior conditions has a crystalline lattice, we argue that superionic ice should not flow like a liquid such as the fluid iron outer core of the Earth. Rather, it's probably better to picture that superionic ice would flow similarly to the Earth's mantle, which is made of solid rock, yet flows and supports large-scale convective motions on the very long geological timescales,"" Millot said.
&gt;
&gt;""This can dramatically affect our understanding of the internal structure and the evolution of the icy giant planets, as well as all their numerous extrasolar cousins.""

What I do know however is how other countries have used trains to expedite transportation dramatically from place to place. Europe is famous for using trains, as well as New York City, and in the US. Ultrafast bullet trains are used in Japan all over. for some silly reason, we decided to go with cars, one of the absolute worst options in my opinion. My reasoning is quite simple. I see roads as a system. Cars dramatically increase the number of fatalities because each vehicle is a point of failure in the system. Any one person driving a car can fail, and caused deaths in other people, and slow down the entire system. the probability as we know is much higher for a car than for a train because we don't really hear about train accidents all that much. it's really simple why. They go from point A to point B, and then back to point A. Cars are going all over the place, adhering to rules, expressly controlled by individuals with various abilities and almost no requirements to drive a car. 


So in the future we are moving towards self-driving cars. That sounds great, but I still think it's a step in the wrong direction. It's investing billions and billions of dollars in something that should have been fixed decades ago. Simply expanding the rail industry. Eisenhower made such a big mistake expanding the highway system instead of the rail system. So in the future instead of self-driving cars, it would be much better to expand the rail system and revise it so it makes more sense, and rather than getting rid of self-driving as a whole or driving as a whole, use it to complement railways. Say for instance you had a main rail line running through city north to south. That railway could travel directly from point-to-point much, much faster than a car would be able to give in that car is have to stop, wait for a red light, keep going, stop, turn, oh wait there's a traffic jam. trains would expedite travel dramatically and in order to get left or right, East or West, you could use a self-driving car so there would be the best of both worlds. 


the main problem I see with self-driving cars in the future is that they won't be able to go in here and leave faster at a safe speed Like trains will. If I want to travel to North Carolina, I would much rather have a high-speed bullet train, or as Elon musk wanted to implement, a hyperloop. something to get you a long-distance extremely fast, and when you get there, use a self-driving car. people these days think self-driving cars will be the be-all end-all which I don't think is true in the slightest. It's just fixing the issue that was overlooked when driving was first expanded upon by Eisenhower and that is the point of failure. I still think vehicles in their entirety are a wrong step forward, but I know that a lot of people really like vehicles a lot more than trains, so I can't pretend to speak for everyone in regards to the Future. My ideal future would be a city dominated by trains in a very logical sense. Trains running North and South, then either buses or smaller light trains to take people virtually anywhere they would want to go. You could even have road trains which are basically a central car or vehicle that begins driving in one direction and the other cars follow behind it doing exactly what it does until they part ways and go a different direction",29,22

Type-1: You are real . You exist outside the simulation as a real being but experience the simulation as reality 

Type-2: You are simulated within the simulation and you do not exist as a real being. You are a part of the simulation. 

These are two fundamentally different ways of creating simulated universes which i think almost everyone is failing to see. This needs to be addressed by any theory about the simulated universe. 

Here i would like to start a discussion to criticize this so feel free to scrutinize it and let me know what you think about it.

The problem with this view is that it holds the evolution of humans constant. Even now, we have begun to take human evolution into our own hands, being no longer satisfied with the slow process of natural selection + time, and considering the rate of advancements in genetic engineering and related fields, we should soon be able to purchase off-the-counter drugs for say, a memory boost.

Even more interesting is the idea that we're already cyborgs of sorts. Not many humans, if any, can memorise the contact numbers of every person in their social network, so we make use of memory extensions, our phones.

As Elon Musk put it, the problem here is data transmission rates. Once we figure out a better faster way to interface with our devices, we will have near-instantaneous access to massive amounts of organised data, on demand, not to mention near limitless processing power.

I claim this: By the time robots are smart and powerful enough to even conceive of a hostile takeover, we, would be gods in our own right, a 1000 moves ahead of any robotic super intelligence .",10,7

This is what id writen there about the issue:

&amp;#x200B;

 

**3100 AD**

**Humanity is becoming a Type 2 civilisation on the Kardashev scale**

The exponential growth of AI has allowed the manipulation of matter on scales barely dreamed of before. The largest structure now being built in space is a ""Dyson Sphere"".[\*](https://www.futuretimeline.net/the-far-future-3000-9999.htm#ref4b) This hollow shell is of such gargantuan proportions that its radius stretches from the Sun to beyond the orbit of Jupiter.

&amp;#x200B;

Under the direction of a Godlike superintelligence, vast swarms of automated, self-replicating ships are building it, using material from the asteroid field, Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud.

The sphere's primary purpose is to harvest literally all of the energy output from the Sun: some 386 yottajoules (YJ) per second.[\*](https://www.futuretimeline.net/the-far-future-3000-9999.htm#ref5b) However, it also serves the function of shielding our inner solar system from gamma rays and other incoming hazards. Even the potential possibility of alien invasion has been taken into consideration during the sphere's design.

The interior walls have a gravitational field of 1G and are made from wholly new states of matter that were unknown to science in previous centuries. These can withstand the colossal tensile forces required to maintain structural integrity. This curved, impossibly large surface  equivalent to billions of planet Earths  is becoming a habitat for many sentient lifeforms, with portions being terraformed and given stable atmospheres, oceans and landmass. A sizeable percentage of citizens are now migrating to these strange artificial worlds. This includes a diverse mix of biological humans, as well as transhumans, synthetics, clones, androids, sentient animals and other communities. A series of additional Dyson Spheres are being constructed around neighbouring star systems  some even larger.

Having begun its journey to the stars in the 22nd century, humanity is reaching a landmark in its exploration of space. A region nearly 1,000 light years in radius has now been settled (or about 2 percent of the total length of our galaxy).

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.futuretimeline.net/the-far-future-3000-9999.htm](https://www.futuretimeline.net/the-far-future-3000-9999.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

Well I understand that the sphere would be made by kinds of matter that is unimagineable today and the dyson sphere could have several walls and some of the portion of such walls could be terraformed. But I didn\`t got when it says that such artifitial words would be strange - strange in which sense? Could the terraformed portions look alien and artifitial compared to life on Earth? And what about the other portions of the sphere - Could material science be so advanced that these artifitial worlds would be really dazzling, bizarre and surreal even for sience fiction addicters? I believe that these worlds would be so bizarre and large that even virtual reality would not replace the will to visit them.

&amp;#x200B;

If a person was in one of these worlds inside the dyson sphere and looked at the sky, what the sky could look like, since they would be inside a set of hollow closed shells? Would this person still be able to see stars or the sky could look like something else?

&amp;#x200B;

It is also written as if the world population will increase in trillions of people as humanity have the technology to create artifitial beings - even sentient humanoid animals.",13,10

On the other hand, you've got the average Joe-Homeowner who's main turn off to solar is the high initial cost, even knowing that they eventually pay for themselves.

My though is that everyone above is operating off the same energy grid: why don't companies like Google strike up deals with the 'little man' to sponsor solar panels onto some random homeowner's roof?

All they'd have to do is meter the panels separately; whatever savings would have gone into the homeowner's power bill would instead be applied to the sponsor's.

If the deal was set up for something like: sponsor covers all costs of acquiring and installing the panels; savings generated by those panels are applied to the sponsor until those savings total 3x that initial cost, then ownership of the panels and the energy they provide from that point on are transferred to the home owner.

300% return on investment for the sponsor; 'free' solar panels for the home owner. Climate burns a tad slower.

Win win win?

The super-rich could afford converting entire neighborhoods at a time to solar, and they'd make a profit from doing so...

They say that ultimately it is a violation of the basic human right to provide consent, especially for a procedure which has very little medical benefit. There is evidence to suggest it could have long-term negative effects on the brain as well as functioning/sensitivity of the penis. Also, circumcision removes up to 50% of the skin on the junk and 20,000 nerve endings. 

With that said, I know that many circumcised men are happy with the procedure that was done on them and would do it again if they had the choice to go back in time. They say they don't have to clean the foreskin, it looks better, and they last longer in bed. Plus, it is a religious custom for some. Most American girls prefer cut penises. But does this excuse cutting baby boys against their will before they have the chance to decide if they want the procedure done to them or not? 

Especially when there is evidence to suggest that [circumcision can have long-term effects on the brain](http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2/). 

America is one of the only Western countries where babies are routinely circumcised. Circumcision is uncommon in western European countries, Australia, and Japan, for example.

What's your opinion on circumcision? Do you believe it's a violation of human rights, or a harmless procedure? 

My two cents: I believe we should conduct MRI testing on babies before and after circumcision to find out if there are negative long-term consequences on the brain, because there is evidence to suggest that early pain trauma such as circumcision can impact brain development.",45,2

The idea seems to be this: 
Without labour costs, it will be more cost effective to hire a car from Uber than it will be to own one. 

On the face of it, that makes sense. I drive my car a couple hours a day, at most. The unused time seems like a waste of capital. However, the lifespan of a car is better expressed in miles, not years. In support of that claim, a search on the terms 'average lifespan of a car' turns up answers expressed in miles (and sometimes in years, but only as a multiple of the average number of miles driven per year).

So it seems that a vehicle is good for a certain number of miles, no matter whether the vehicle travels those miles, over a few years, or over a decade. As such, it seems that there is no wasted capital, so long as all of a car's miles are used before it hits the scrapyard. 

Perhaps some vehicles are scrapped before the end of their useful life. But in those cases, the cars are discarded because people would rather own a newer car. If anything, that says something about the prestige associated with car ownership. That said, the main question here is an economic one: if most cars are driven to the end of their useful life, how does Uber think it can beat the economics of private car ownership?  

The only answer I can think of is volume buying. If Uber buys direct from manufacturers, the dealer's profits will be cut out. However, the dealer's profits on new vehicles are typically meager. They're certainly not high enough that their removal would revolutionize automobile economics. 

So, again, how does Uber think it can beat the economics of private car ownership?",6,3

3. Getting a car to pick up my kids from sports or parties
4. A raise in maximum driving speed since human reaction times stop being factored (maybe in special highway lanes just for self driving cars)
5. I also expect cars in highways to behave more like caravans, sharing sensors data, reducing space between cars thus reducing drag

**Introduction**

The range of meat products on the market exists on a spectrum of structural sophistication. On one end of the spectrum, there are less sophisticated processed products such as chicken nuggets and sausages; in the middle, ground products; and on the other end, filets and steaks. In order to replicate the more sophisticated products, scientists will need to borrow and improve upon technologies from tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and biomaterials science to recreate the complex multicellular architecture of meat. Building off of bioengineering and biomaterials knowledge [discussed previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/beybqj/indepth_how_its_made_the_science_behind_cultured/?st=jv4h11dr&amp;sh=7047038c), a review of the core methods to consider for the creation of complex multicellular meat products are discussed below.

**3D Bioprinting**

3D bioprinting is an additive manufacturing technique where pre-polymer solutions or pre-polymer solutions containing cells (i.e. a [bioink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-ink)) are deposited onto a substrate layer-by-layer under the guidance of a computer-aided design (CAD) process. The CAD files typically result from real bioimaging data such as [magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) (MRI) and [computer tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan) (CT) scans of tissues, but can also be user-generated to form limitless geometry types. Similar imaging strategies can be performed to replicate specific cuts of meat.[^(1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5928302/) There are several types of bioprinting, summarized in [Table 1](https://imgur.com/a/RZ5pLUO).[^(2)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905875)^(,)[^(3)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452199X17301068)

**Bioink**

Bioink is the raw material for 3D bioprinting, composed of cells in combination with some other biological material. There are two major types of bioink materials: scaffold-based and scaffold-free. A scaffold-based bioink is, in essence, a hydrogel that is printed along with cells whereas a scaffold-free bioink contains only large cellular components such as tissue strands or spheroids.[^(4)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975016301719) Cells within a bioink typically exist at a concentration of \~10 million cells per milliliter, constituting \~5% or less of the bioink volume,[^(5)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-018-0006-y) although this can be optimized on a case by case basis to permit enough printed cells to replicate a specific tissue. Importantly, however, not all biomaterials previously discussed fit the parameters for use in a bioink. The main parameters to consider for a bioink include the bioprintability or rheological properties (e.g. [viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity), [thixotropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thixotropy)), mechanical properties, insolubility in cell culture medium, cost, and manufacturing capability. Because natural biomaterials generally have weak mechanical properties, special considerations need to be made when including them in a bioink. Additionally, each bioprinting method affects these parameters differently, thus the intended application tends to dictate the chosen method. For cell-based meat, a food-grade (discussed in Series IV) bioink would be appropriate.

**Extrusion Bioprinting**

In extrusion-based bioprinting, an extruder continuously deposits a bioink while the stage or the extruder itself is moved. Bioink deposition can occur via pneumatic or mechanical systems and the 2D ink must be rapidly solidified either chemically (e.g. light) or physically (e.g. temperature) prior to adding a new layer in order to maintain shape without spreading. In general, extrusion-based systems are the most used and versatile of the methods, permitting a wide variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials to be used due to the range (30 mPas to 60 x 10^(6) mPas) of printable ink viscosities. Extrusion-based methods fundamentally work by dispensing larger filaments (\~150-300m in diameter) rather than droplets. This permits both scaffold-based or scaffold-free printing, capable of incorporating high cell density bioinks, printed spheroids, or cell-laden microcarriers.[^(6)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1758-5090/8/3/032002/meta) However, this also results in poor printing resolution (as low as 100m) versus other methods, making intricate replication of complex tissues difficult. Bioinks with shear thinning properties are preferable as shear forces naturally align hydrogel polymers for extrusion; however, careful consideration must be given to the shear force effect on cell viability during extrusion.[^(7)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057483) Additionally, bioinks with low adhesion and surface tension are necessary to prevent nozzle clogging. 3D food printers that use extrusion-based bioprinting methods and the technologies (e.g. texture analyzers) used to analyze the food products may also be adaptable for cell-based meat. Finally, the [bioprinting of plant-based proteins](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2018/10/18/Italian-researcher-on-3D-printing-tech-for-plant-based-meat-We-re-bio-hacking-plant-protein-structure-at-micro-and-nano-scale) may be informative for the creation of cell-based meat scaffolds or replication of other mechanical, textural, or organoleptic properties of meat.

Several recent advances show the potential for applying extrusion-based methods toward the creation of thick scaffolds or tissues applicable for cell-based meat production. For instance, researchers have developed hybrid bioprinting devices, where both vascular networks and cells are printed simultaneously under control of independent printing arms equipped with smart sensors to avoid collisions.[^(8)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d1c5/b7d477d3cb52cc0869ca955e0fc80b088972.pdf) This strategy permits continuous medium perfusion through the printed vascular networks while additional tissue is printed. Systems have also been developed where multiple bioinks can be extruded continuously with fast, dynamic switching between diverse bioinks, permitting printing of complex tissues composed of multiple cells and hydrogel materials.[^(9)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201604630) Another challenge in bioprinting thick scaffolds is the weak mechanical properties of natural polymers, resulting in their deformation under their own weight. To this end, [the hydrogel can be printed within a second hydrogel that provides structural support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfl_tFdt2D4). The sacrificial support hydrogel acts as a [Bingham plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingham_plastic), where it is a solid up until the point of contact with the extrusion nozzle, permitting the printed hydrogel to displace the support hydrogel.[^(10)](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/9/e1500758) The support hydrogel can then be removed (i.e. dissolved) by increasing the temperature (e.g. when using gelatin), or applying calcium chelators (e.g. [EDTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid) when using alginate) or enzymes, resulting in a standalone scaffold or cell-laden tissue. Sacrificial gels have also been adopted for the creation of artificial vasculature.[^(11)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706119301515) Additionally, the benefits of these aforementioned methods can be combined, enabling bioprinting of human-scale tissues with fewer limitations.[^(12)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26878319) Lastly, as described previously, the spatiotemporal release of biomolecules within a scaffold can assist in biomimicry of the ECM. To this end, 3D printed light-sensitive nanocapsules containing growth factors can be dispersed within a scaffold during printing, permitting guided migration of cells in a spatiotemporally controlled fashion via light.[^(13)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4536147/#SD1)^(,)[^(14)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201806899) These and other advances in extrusion bioprinting hold great promise for their application to the cell-based meat industry, and at least [one company has ](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2019/02/11/From-edible-scaffolding-to-bio-printing-What-would-an-industrial-scale-cell-based-meat-plant-look-like#.XGHAauCEMOQ.twitter)plans to utilize extrusion-based bioprinting for cell-based meat production.

**Stereolithography**

Stereolithography uses single or multiphoton light sources to rapidly polymerize a bath of [light-sensitive pre-polymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopolymer). Structures derived from CAD models are recreated via light reflecting off of [micromirror galvanometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_galvanometer), which provide feedback to the printing apparatus, enabling precise spatial and temporal control of the polymerization. Polymerization occurs either through direct laser light exposure or exposure through a mask in a bottom-up process of sequential 2D layers.[^(15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009727000062) Inclusion of photocrosslinkable biomaterials previously described now permits this technique to be used for scaffold generation or printing of structures from cell-laden pre-polymer baths. The advantages of stereolithography include avoidance of previously described considerations (e.g. viscosity, surface tension, and shear stress through a nozzle), automated control (in maskless methods), high resolution (&lt; 100 m), and fast printing speed. Disadvantages include potential cytotoxicity from light exposure and a limited but growing repertoire of suitable biomaterials to use. Further developments are also necessary to permit further scaling to more complex 3D constructs as well as derivation of non-cytotoxic [photoinitiators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoinitiator) that assist in the crosslinking reaction during polymerization.[^(16)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009727000062)

Recent progress demonstrates the potential for using stereolithography in cell-based meat scaffold production. For instance, combining stereolithography with [dielectrophoresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectrophoresis) can enable precise spatial control of cells[^(17)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23463644) and advances in microscale continuous projection printing enables sub-10m resolution objects to be printed on the order of seconds.[^(18)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3784638/) Computed axial lithography uses angled image projections that result in concurrent 3D printing of whole structures at high speeds.[^(19)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2019/01/30/science.aau7114) As a non-layered approach, it does not require the use of supportive hydrogels (discussed previously) for mechanically weaker biomaterials and should be readily scalable. Thus, further development of stereolithographic techniques may permit their use in the cell-based meat industry.

**Electrospinning**

[Electrospinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrospinning) is a versatile, low-cost technique where a solution of polymers is passed through a spinneret needle during application of a high electric field. [The electric field causes stretching of the polymer via electrostatic forces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn6r1Ag1npE) until a critical point (i.e. [Taylor cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_cone)) is reached, resulting in the formation of a fiber jet. [As the fiber jet is formed, the solvent evaporates off, and the fiber hardens while it is harvested on an electrostatically-grounded collection device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlHUVJkDuNo).[^(25)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136970211300196X) The fiber itself can be made from a variety of synthetic and natural polymers, resulting in porous fiber networks with tunable diameters and high surface area. Electrospinning is unique in that it provides the only way to achieve nanoscale biomimicry of the ECM (50 - 500 nm diameter fibers). Of note, cell-laden biomaterials can also be electrosprayed through a similar process that yields droplet deposition rather than fiber deposition,[^(26)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706117306281) although this is less applicable toward scaffold creation. Lastly, similar fiber production methods are possible such as [wet, dry, or melt spinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_(polymers)), which can be used to produce materials such as scaffolds[^(27)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23443534) and hollow fiber membranes[^(28)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.551.7197&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) used in bioreactors (discussed in Series II).

Many of the same considerations and principles previously discussed for biomaterials in hydrogel formation, bioinks, and bioprinting also apply to the creation of electrospun scaffolds. For instance, mechanically weak but biocompatible natural polymers are often combined with synthetic polymers. Identifying rapidly evaporating solvents suitable for composite materials can be challenging, however, and the solvents themselves may be cytotoxic[^(29)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216305890) or damage the native structure of the polymers.[^(30)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la3033258) Similarly to a bioink, alterations in viscosity, solvent surface tension, and flow rate can affect the fiber characteristics, and alterations in the applied voltage and rotating speed, distance, or structure of the collection device can affect resultant scaffold geometries.[^(31)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25619820)^(,)[^(32)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216305890) Unless otherwise intended, electrospun scaffolds will result in a random arrangement of packed fibers, which can limit cell infiltration, migration, or uniform seeding.[^(33)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25619820) Similar methods used for hydrogels, such as inclusion of protease-degradable polymers can assist in better mimicking native ECM for cell infiltration and migration.[^(34)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25799370) Additionally, a variety of methods have been developed in order to produce electrospun scaffolds with defined structure and purpose, including mixed, multilayer, coaxial, and emulsion electrospinning, and microfluidic spinning, discussed below.

While true biomimicry of the ECM requires nanoscale fibers, the porosity of the scaffold itself, which has a positive linear relationship with fiber diameter, should be on the microscale to permit cell infiltration and perfusion. A fiber network on both nano and microscales can be created via [multilayer electrospinning](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0142961204001188-sc1.jpg), where different nanofiber and microfiber polymers are electrospun sequentially in layers. Alternatively, mixed electrospinning can be performed where nanofiber and microfiber polymer types are simultaneously electrospun on a collector that permits overlapping collection through lateral movement of the collector.[^(35)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961204001188) These techniques can permit or restrict certain cells from infiltrating a scaffold based on pore size,[^(36)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20188414) which may be leveraged for spatial distribution of cell seeding for cell-based meat. Sacrificial biomaterials such as gelatin can also be used as a polymer to create additional pores upon melting.

In coaxial electrospinning, an inner and outer solution is co-electrospun via independent feeding capillaries, forming a compound Taylor cone. One solution typically contains a hydrophobic polymer and the other contains a biological cargo of interest solubilized with hydrophilic polymers (e.g. dextran), resulting in a core-shell structure due to their [immiscibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscibility), or inability to mix.[^(37)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-6041/8/1/014102) Coaxial electrospun fibers permit trapping of proteins, cells (discussed later), or other biomolecules such that their release kinetics can be varied based on the porosity or biodegradability of the outer shell polymer,[^(38)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20594971) which may serve well for embedding of growth factors for cell-based meat. The viscosity of the solutions, flow rate, and applied electric field strength can all influence the geometry and characteristics of the resultant core-shell fibers. Additionally, multi-layered fibers can be created by co-electrospinning more than 2 solutions.[^(39)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510905) Similar core-shell fibers can be created via emulsion electrospinning where an [emulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion) of oil, water, [surfactant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant), and biomaterial are co-electrospun. During electrospinning, the droplets in the emulsion coalesce due to increased viscosity of the evaporating oil and applied electric field. This process can produce core-shell fibers that can be embedded with growth factors or drugs, which may be leveraged for cell-based meat scaffolding.[^(40)](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/ra/c7ra00179g#!divAbstract)

Microfluidic spinning relies on differences in a fluids surface tension, energy dissipation, and fluidic resistance to produce a 3D coaxial flow between independent sample and sheath flows.[^(41)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216305890) While similar in principle to coaxial electrospinning, the application of voltage is unnecessary, as the fluidic channel width controls fiber diameter. Thus, microfluidic spinning permits a more favorable environment for natural biomaterials due to the avoidance of harsh solvents. In contrast to electrospinning, microfluidic spinning can more easily achieve uniformity of fiber diameter, as well as tighter control over the shape, porosity, and diameter of the fiber. This allows for simple cell encapsulation, which can assist in cell alignment, proliferation, and growth in a 3D environment, all of which are favorable for cell-based meat production (discussed later). The resultant fibers must be solidified via photopolymerization, crosslinking, or solvent exchange, which somewhat limits the selection of polymers. Nevertheless, easily crosslinked materials such as alginate can be readily used in such a system.

**Decellularization**

[Decellularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decellularization) is a technique that aims to remove the cells and nucleic acids from a tissue while preserving the native ECM. Thus, the decellularized tissue acts as a scaffold with preserved ultrastructure and similar biophysical and biochemical properties of the original tissue, potentially avoiding previously discussed issues (e.g. porosity, material composition, stiffness, etc) associated with bottom-up approaches. Decellularization has been largely pioneered using animal tissues for the purposes of organ regeneration, however, the technique can also be applied to plant or fungi tissues. As such, it is likely that the knowledge and application of techniques originating from animal tissues could be useful for cell-based meat research and development purposes, while real-world implementation is more likely to utilize plant or fungi tissues.

Decellularization is performed by deploying chemical, physical, or enzymatic methods. Chemicals such as ionic (e.g. [SDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate)), nonionic (e.g [Triton X-100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_X-100)), or [zwitterionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwitterion) (e.g. [CHAPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAPS_detergent)) [detergents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detergent) can be used as they assist in solubilizing membranes, disrupting DNA-protein and lipid-protein interactions, or protecting a proteins native state, respectively.[^(42)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5592694/) However, the harsh nature of these chemicals leads to their use in low amounts or not at all, if possible, as they inherently will also damage ECM proteins.[^(43)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21417722) In some cases, the use of acids to catalyze [hydrolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis) degradation of macromolecules, or organic solvents and hypotonic solutions to cause cell lysis can assist in decellularization processes. Physical methods such as freezing and thawing, [electroporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation), agitation, and [sonication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonication) can also be applied to assist in cell lysis. Lastly, various enzymes can assist in the decellularization process, including trypsin, dispase, phospholipases, exonucleases, endonucleases, and other proteases, although consideration has to again be paid to balancing the damage done to ECM proteins.[^(44)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550502) As different tissues consist of different cell compositions, sizes, and densities, each decellularization protocol needs to be optimized on a case-by-case basis, and may include one or combinations of the methods described above.

In general, the decellularization process is a balance between removing cells and nucleic acids and maintaining the integrity of the native ECM. Near complete removal of these components is critical in order to avoid immune responses from the host in the context of organ transplantation. However, this is less of a concern for cell-based meat as the tissue is dead and ingested rather than intended to survive in a host. Interestingly, some evidence suggests that residual antimicrobial peptides persist in some animal ECM scaffolds, which may instead be leveraged to prevent contamination *in vitro*.[^(45)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17518662) In summary, the cell-based meat field can learn from and apply the knowledge gained from decellularization and recellularization processes, discussed below.

The most applicable decellularization techniques for cell-based meat are perfusion and immersion with agitation. Perfusion is typically used for whole organ decellularization, where native vasculature (typically the main organ artery) is co-opted and used as the plumbing for perfusion of decellularization reagents at physiological pressures. This is often performed in a perfusion bioreactor (discussed in Series II) where the physiological pressure ensures that the tissue is not damaged and that the decellularization reagents can effectively permeate all of the preserved vasculature, including capillaries. For tissues without accessible or large vasculature routes (e.g. skeletal muscle, skin), the tissue can be immersed in decellularization reagents and agitated, assisting in permeation of the tissue via diffusion.[^(46)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702116304278) While immersion methods do not require the need for a specialized bioreactor, they often can result in long exposures to the decellularization reagents and intracellular release of native proteases that can damage the ECM scaffold.[^(47)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550502)

Decellularization has come of age since the first demonstration of a decellularized rat heart in 2008.[^(48)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1684) Since then, decellularization of large, complex tissues such as human hearts[^(49)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740234/) and limbs[^(50)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5774802/) has been achieved, as well as decellularization of cell-based meat-relevant tissue types such as whole muscles.[^(51)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26963901) Information on the decellularized scaffold can be gleaned from [microCT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_microtomography), [scanning electron microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope), [atomic force microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy), and [immunohistochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry), which yields information about the 3D architecture, biomechanical properties, and composition of the ECM, respectively.[^(52)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702116304278) This information can be leveraged for the recreation of scaffolds for cell-based meat, particularly through characterization of decellularized skeletal muscle[^(53)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264525) and specific cuts of meat. Additionally, the information may be used in bottom-up scaffold approaches such as the creation of CAD models for 3D bioprinting or the solubilization of the native decellularized ECM itself for use in bioinks[^(54)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4935) or electrospinning.[^(55)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00384?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=abseba)

While decellularization has become relatively straightforward, the recellularization process may require additional optimizations in cell delivery and bioreactor engineering. For recellularization, cells are typically delivered via the vascular perfusion line at or below physiological flow rates over multiple infusions. Physiological flow rates assist in preventing structural damage to the ECM and protecting cells from shear stress, and these techniques have resulted in seeding efficiencies of organ [parenchyma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma) above 90%.[^(56)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23542907) Pre-coating of the scaffold with biomaterials such as chitosan, collagen, gelatin, or RGD peptides can additionally assist in increasing reseeding efficiency.[^(57)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550502) As a tissue is recellularized, flow pressure may need to be dynamically adjusted as porosity becomes limited (due to cell attachment), and monitoring systems may need to be developed for this purpose.[^(58)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18949759) Additionally, the establishment of endothelial cells and vasculature may require pulsatile flow to more accurately mimic the experienced physiological environment of these cell types. However, its uncertain if scaffold endothelialization would be necessary for cell-based meat production.[^(59)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21417722) At least one company in the field [has cited creation of vasculature](https://www.businessinsider.com/aleph-farms-israeli-startup-makes-first-lab-grown-clean-steak-meat-photos-video-2018-12) for their products.One of the advantages of using a decellularized animal tissue as a scaffold is that it retains the zip code locations of the native cytoarchitecture encoded via residual embedded growth factors, mechanical properties, and other ECM characteristics previously discussed. Therefore, the process of recellularization is highly self-organized but still commands consideration for a cell populations differentiation state prior to recellularization. All of the starting cell types desirable for cell-based meat production (discussed in Series I) have been utilized for recellularization, including myoblasts,[^(60)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4568187/) mesenchymal stem cells,[^(61)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513465v1) embryonic stem cells,[^(62)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064134) and induced pluripotent stem cells.[^(63)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222839) Indeed, similarly to experiments on hydrogel scaffolds, evidence suggests that recellularization of a decellularized animal tissue scaffold with pluripotent stem cells is sufficient to direct the differentiation toward the native tissue type, increasing expression of relevant cell type markers and functionality versus 2D protocols,[^(64)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222839) as well as assemble native substructures due to local microenvironments.[^(65)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064134#pone.0064134-Brennan1) Likewise, recellularization with multipotent progenitors such as mesenchymal stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived progenitors can be directed into functional tissues made up of a variety of differentiated cell types.[^(66)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513465v1)^(,)[^(67)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00779-y) Successful recellularization (and subsequent functional transplantation) has been performed on tissues as large as adult pig lungs in perfusion bioreactors up to dozens of liters in volume, suggesting that the process is scalable.[^(68)](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/452/eaao3926/tab-pdf) Thus, adoption of learned principles from recellularization or recreation of a decellularized scaffold via methods such as 3D printing with solubilized native ECM[^(69)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961219301863)^(,)[^(70)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201600483) should be highly applicable for cell-based meat research and development.

Use of decellularized scaffolds from animals has several limitations. For instance, the composition of a decellularized scaffold can vary between individuals and be affected by age and protocol irreproducibility.[^(71)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28222326) Most importantly, however, the supply is limited and thus expensive, and reconstructing an ECM containing up to hundreds of proteins is not feasible.[^(72)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064134) For these reasons, plants have been an attractive alternative for decellularization strategies, as their cell walls are composed of abundant biocompatible polysaccharides such as [cellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose), [pectin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectin), and [hemicellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemicellulose), and native vasculature similar to animals that follows [Murrays Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray%27s_law), allowing perfusion. Indeed, in combination with functionalization methods previously discussed, attachment of mammalian cells onto decellularized plant scaffolds has been demonstrated using a variety of plant stems, leaves, or hypanthium tissues.[^(73)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201601225)^(,)[^(74)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097835) Functionalized plant scaffolds have demonstrated long-term viability and cell proliferation, although differences in native stiffness, hydrophilicity, topography, and pore sizes can influence their success.[^(75)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201601225) The vast variety of plants to choose from may ensure that different tissue architectures (e.g. celery for muscle fibers) can be recapitulated and future [genetic engineering efforts could modify plants to express biocompatible ](https://newfoodeconomy.org/cell-cultured-meat-plant-scaffold/)protein domains (e.g. RGD), as done in silk.[^(76)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26461118) Importantly, construction of [plant scaffolds](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/scientists-are-growing-meat-on-blades-of-grass?utm_source=Facebook%20Videos&amp;utm_medium=Facebook%20Videos&amp;utm_campaign=Facebook%20Video%20Blogs) can be readily scaled simply by using larger or more abundant plant tissues, or processing of raw plant materials to create protein- or cellulose-based scaffolds using previously discussed methods.[^(77)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316787828_Developing_cultured_meat_scaffolds_of_extruded_vegetable-based_proteins) Plant-based materials will likely be significantly more cost-efficient at scale versus their animal ECM counterparts, as the processing and use of abundant raw plant materials such as cellulose for tissue engineering are well characterized.[^(78)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2019.00019/abstract) Similarly, the [use of fungal mycelium](https://ecovativedesign.com/atlast) may serve as a scalable and affordable scaffolding substrate, which may not require decellularization for use. Thus, by borrowing techniques pioneered for human organ generation and leveraging the plant and fungal kingdoms for practicality, use of prefabricated scaffolds by nature may be the most likely to take hold in the cell-based meat industry

**Summary of Scaffolds for Cell-based Meat**

Putting this information together, a scaffolding structure for cell-based meat will likely require leveraging multiple aspects of state-of-the-art tissue engineering. A scaffold will likely be composed of cheap, edible or biodegradable biomaterials with high biocompatibility and porosity suitable for cell migration (\~1 - 500m), continuous perfusion, and recycling of cell culture medium (discussed in Series IV) to remove waste and refresh nutrient supply. This may leverage native tissue architecture (e.g. decellularization) or be constructed by design (e.g. 3D printing, electrospinning, core-shell tubes). The scaffold may consist of different composite biomaterials, pre-patterned to recreate the cytoarchitecture of meat, with differing stiffnesses and/or embedded growth factors to assist in the attachment, migration, and maturation of stem cells into their differentiated counterparts. Important considerations should be taken into how a scaffold may integrate and behave in a bioreactor, which may require custom engineering, computational modeling of fluids, and integration of on-line sensors (discussed in Series II). For instance, oxygen and other nutrient mass transfer is likely to change when growing cells on a scaffold versus in suspension.[^(100)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16023202) Existing [bioreactors](http://3dbiotek.com/prod_3dCellExpansionSystem.aspx) for mammalian cell growth may provide some insight into best approaches,[^(101)](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190002815A1/en) as well as learned principles from [solid state fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_fermentation) used in production of fungi or [plant hairy root culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_root_culture) used to produce metabolites or proteins. Additionally, sterilization procedures for scaffolds such as gamma and UV irradiation or ethylene oxide may denature or damage certain biomaterials, thus limiting certain raw material options.[^(102)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27123816) Forward-thinking strategies to address these challenges should be pursued.

The level of cellular maturation required will likely be dictated by the final products nutritional and textural requirements, and a spectrum of options may be considered in practice. As will be discussed in Series V, its likely that many years will separate the release of unstructured versus structured products as described here due to the difficult nature of the process. Significant challenges will need to be met with new innovations, such as core-shell tubes, to address concerns of scaling, cost, and reproducibility, as current practices in tissue engineering are prohibitively expensive and technically challenging. Despite this, current technologies provide a foundational roadmap for the successful creation of future structured cell-based meat products. Scientists in tissue engineering and cell-based meat should be encouraged to share knowledge and collaborate around shared problems, resulting in mutual positive benefits for each respective field.

**Introduction** 

The range of meat products on the market exists on a spectrum of structural sophistication. On one end of the spectrum, there are less sophisticated processed products such as chicken nuggets and sausages; in the middle, ground products; and on the other end, filets and steaks. In order to replicate the more sophisticated products, scientists will need to borrow and improve upon technologies from tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and biomaterials science to recreate the complex multicellular architecture of meat. Building off of bioengineering and biomaterials knowledge [discussed previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/beybqj/indepth_how_its_made_the_science_behind_cultured/?st=jv4h11dr&amp;sh=7047038c), a review of the core methods to consider for the creation of complex multicellular meat products are discussed below. 

**3D Bioprinting**  

3D bioprinting is an additive manufacturing technique where pre-polymer solutions or pre-polymer solutions containing cells (i.e. a [bioink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-ink)) are deposited onto a substrate layer-by-layer under the guidance of a computer-aided design (CAD) process. The CAD files typically result from real bioimaging data such as [magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) (MRI) and [computer tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan) (CT) scans of tissues, but can also be user-generated to form limitless geometry types. Similar imaging strategies can be performed to replicate specific cuts of meat.[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5928302/) There are several types of bioprinting, summarized in [Table 1](https://imgur.com/a/RZ5pLUO).[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905875),[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452199X17301068) 

**Bioink**

Bioink is the raw material for 3D bioprinting, composed of cells in combination with some other biological material. There are two major types of bioink materials: scaffold-based and scaffold-free. A scaffold-based bioink is, in essence, a hydrogel that is printed along with cells whereas a scaffold-free bioink contains only large cellular components such as tissue strands or spheroids.[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975016301719) Cells within a bioink typically exist at a concentration of \~10 million cells per milliliter, constituting \~5% or less of the bioink volume,[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-018-0006-y) although this can be optimized on a case by case basis to permit enough printed cells to replicate a specific tissue. Importantly, however, not all biomaterials previously discussed fit the parameters for use in a bioink. The main parameters to consider for a bioink include the bioprintability or rheological properties (e.g. [viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity), [thixotropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thixotropy)), mechanical properties, insolubility in cell culture medium, cost, and manufacturing capability. Because natural biomaterials generally have weak mechanical properties, special considerations need to be made when including them in a bioink. Additionally, each bioprinting method affects these parameters differently, thus the intended application tends to dictate the chosen method. For cell-based meat, a food-grade (discussed in Series IV) bioink would be appropriate. 

**Extrusion Bioprinting**

In extrusion-based bioprinting, an extruder continuously deposits a bioink while the stage or the extruder itself is moved. Bioink deposition can occur via pneumatic or mechanical systems and the 2D ink must be rapidly solidified either chemically (e.g. light) or physically (e.g. temperature) prior to adding a new layer in order to maintain shape without spreading. In general, extrusion-based systems are the most used and versatile of the methods, permitting a wide variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials to be used due to the range (30 mPas to 60 x 106 mPas) of printable ink viscosities. Extrusion-based methods fundamentally work by dispensing larger filaments (\~150-300m in diameter) rather than droplets. This permits both scaffold-based or scaffold-free printing, capable of incorporating high cell density bioinks, printed spheroids, or cell-laden microcarriers.[6](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1758-5090/8/3/032002/meta) However, this also results in poor printing resolution (as low as 100m) versus other methods, making intricate replication of complex tissues difficult. Bioinks with shear thinning properties are preferable as shear forces naturally align hydrogel polymers for extrusion; however, careful consideration must be given to the shear force effect on cell viability during extrusion.[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057483) Additionally, bioinks with low adhesion and surface tension are necessary to prevent nozzle clogging. 3D food printers that use extrusion-based bioprinting methods and the technologies (e.g. texture analyzers) used to analyze the food products may also be adaptable for cell-based meat. Finally, the [bioprinting of plant-based proteins](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2018/10/18/Italian-researcher-on-3D-printing-tech-for-plant-based-meat-We-re-bio-hacking-plant-protein-structure-at-micro-and-nano-scale) may be informative for the creation of cell-based meat scaffolds or replication of other mechanical, textural, or organoleptic properties of meat. 

Several recent advances show the potential for applying extrusion-based methods toward the creation of thick scaffolds or tissues applicable for cell-based meat production. For instance, researchers have developed hybrid bioprinting devices, where both vascular networks and cells are printed simultaneously under control of independent printing arms equipped with smart sensors to avoid collisions.[8](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d1c5/b7d477d3cb52cc0869ca955e0fc80b088972.pdf) This strategy permits continuous medium perfusion through the printed vascular networks while additional tissue is printed. Systems have also been developed where multiple bioinks can be extruded continuously with fast, dynamic switching between diverse bioinks, permitting printing of complex tissues composed of multiple cells and hydrogel materials.[9](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201604630) Another challenge in bioprinting thick scaffolds is the weak mechanical properties of natural polymers, resulting in their deformation under their own weight. To this end, [the hydrogel can be printed within a second hydrogel that provides structural support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfl_tFdt2D4). The sacrificial support hydrogel acts as a [Bingham plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingham_plastic), where it is a solid up until the point of contact with the extrusion nozzle, permitting the printed hydrogel to displace the support hydrogel.[10](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/9/e1500758) The support hydrogel can then be removed (i.e. dissolved) by increasing the temperature (e.g. when using gelatin), or applying calcium chelators (e.g. [EDTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid) when using alginate) or enzymes, resulting in a standalone scaffold or cell-laden tissue. Sacrificial gels have also been adopted for the creation of artificial vasculature.[11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706119301515) Additionally, the benefits of these aforementioned methods can be combined, enabling bioprinting of human-scale tissues with fewer limitations.[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26878319) Lastly, as described previously, the spatiotemporal release of biomolecules within a scaffold can assist in biomimicry of the ECM. To this end, 3D printed light-sensitive nanocapsules containing growth factors can be dispersed within a scaffold during printing, permitting guided migration of cells in a spatiotemporally controlled fashion via light.[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4536147/#SD1),[14](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201806899) These and other advances in extrusion bioprinting hold great promise for their application to the cell-based meat industry, and at least [one company has ](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2019/02/11/From-edible-scaffolding-to-bio-printing-What-would-an-industrial-scale-cell-based-meat-plant-look-like#.XGHAauCEMOQ.twitter)plans to utilize extrusion-based bioprinting for cell-based meat production.

**Stereolithography**

Stereolithography uses single or multiphoton light sources to rapidly polymerize a bath of [light-sensitive pre-polymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopolymer). Structures derived from CAD models are recreated via light reflecting off of [micromirror galvanometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_galvanometer), which provide feedback to the printing apparatus, enabling precise spatial and temporal control of the polymerization. Polymerization occurs either through direct laser light exposure or exposure through a mask in a bottom-up process of sequential 2D layers.[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009727000062) Inclusion of photocrosslinkable biomaterials previously described now permits this technique to be used for scaffold generation or printing of structures from cell-laden pre-polymer baths. The advantages of stereolithography include avoidance of previously described considerations (e.g. viscosity, surface tension, and shear stress through a nozzle), automated control (in maskless methods), high resolution (&lt; 100 m), and fast printing speed. Disadvantages include potential cytotoxicity from light exposure and a limited but growing repertoire of suitable biomaterials to use. Further developments are also necessary to permit further scaling to more complex 3D constructs as well as derivation of non-cytotoxic [photoinitiators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoinitiator) that assist in the crosslinking reaction during polymerization.[16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009727000062) 

Recent progress demonstrates the potential for using stereolithography in cell-based meat scaffold production. For instance, combining stereolithography with [dielectrophoresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectrophoresis) can enable precise spatial control of cells[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23463644) and advances in microscale continuous projection printing enables sub-10m resolution objects to be printed on the order of seconds.[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3784638/) Computed axial lithography uses angled image projections that result in concurrent 3D printing of whole structures at high speeds.[19](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2019/01/30/science.aau7114) As a non-layered approach, it does not require the use of supportive hydrogels (discussed previously) for mechanically weaker biomaterials and should be readily scalable. Thus, further development of stereolithographic techniques may permit their use in the cell-based meat industry. 

**Electrospinning**

[Electrospinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrospinning) is a versatile, low-cost technique where a solution of polymers is passed through a spinneret needle during application of a high electric field. [The electric field causes stretching of the polymer via electrostatic forces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn6r1Ag1npE) until a critical point (i.e. [Taylor cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_cone)) is reached, resulting in the formation of a fiber jet. [As the fiber jet is formed, the solvent evaporates off, and the fiber hardens while it is harvested on an electrostatically-grounded collection device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlHUVJkDuNo).[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136970211300196X) The fiber itself can be made from a variety of synthetic and natural polymers, resulting in porous fiber networks with tunable diameters and high surface area. Electrospinning is unique in that it provides the only way to achieve nanoscale biomimicry of the ECM (50 - 500 nm diameter fibers). Of note, cell-laden biomaterials can also be electrosprayed through a similar process that yields droplet deposition rather than fiber deposition,[26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706117306281) although this is less applicable toward scaffold creation. Lastly, similar fiber production methods are possible such as [wet, dry, or melt spinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_(polymers)), which can be used to produce materials such as scaffolds[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23443534) and hollow fiber membranes[28](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.551.7197&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) used in bioreactors (discussed in Series II). 

Many of the same considerations and principles previously discussed for biomaterials in hydrogel formation, bioinks, and bioprinting also apply to the creation of electrospun scaffolds. For instance, mechanically weak but biocompatible natural polymers are often combined with synthetic polymers. Identifying rapidly evaporating solvents suitable for composite materials can be challenging, however, and the solvents themselves may be cytotoxic[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216305890) or damage the native structure of the polymers.[30](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la3033258) Similarly to a bioink, alterations in viscosity, solvent surface tension, and flow rate can affect the fiber characteristics, and alterations in the applied voltage and rotating speed, distance, or structure of the collection device can affect resultant scaffold geometries.[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25619820),[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216305890) Unless otherwise intended, electrospun scaffolds will result in a random arrangement of packed fibers, which can limit cell infiltration, migration, or uniform seeding.[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25619820) Similar methods used for hydrogels, such as inclusion of protease-degradable polymers can assist in better mimicking native ECM for cell infiltration and migration.[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25799370) Additionally, a variety of methods have been developed in order to produce electrospun scaffolds with defined structure and purpose, including mixed, multilayer, coaxial, and emulsion electrospinning, and microfluidic spinning, discussed below. 

While true biomimicry of the ECM requires nanoscale fibers, the porosity of the scaffold itself, which has a positive linear relationship with fiber diameter, should be on the microscale to permit cell infiltration and perfusion. A fiber network on both nano and microscales can be created via [multilayer electrospinning](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0142961204001188-sc1.jpg), where different nanofiber and microfiber polymers are electrospun sequentially in layers. Alternatively, mixed electrospinning can be performed where nanofiber and microfiber polymer types are simultaneously electrospun on a collector that permits overlapping collection through lateral movement of the collector.[35](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961204001188) These techniques can permit or restrict certain cells from infiltrating a scaffold based on pore size,[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20188414) which may be leveraged for spatial distribution of cell seeding for cell-based meat. Sacrificial biomaterials such as gelatin can also be used as a polymer to create additional pores upon melting.

In coaxial electrospinning, an inner and outer solution is co-electrospun via independent feeding capillaries, forming a compound Taylor cone. One solution typically contains a hydrophobic polymer and the other contains a biological cargo of interest solubilized with hydrophilic polymers (e.g. dextran), resulting in a core-shell structure due to their [immiscibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscibility), or inability to mix.[37](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-6041/8/1/014102) Coaxial electrospun fibers permit trapping of proteins, cells (discussed later), or other biomolecules such that their release kinetics can be varied based on the porosity or biodegradability of the outer shell polymer,[38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20594971) which may serve well for embedding of growth factors for cell-based meat. The viscosity of the solutions, flow rate, and applied electric field strength can all influence the geometry and characteristics of the resultant core-shell fibers. Additionally, multi-layered fibers can be created by co-electrospinning more than 2 solutions.[39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510905) Similar core-shell fibers can be created via emulsion electrospinning where an [emulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion) of oil, water, [surfactant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant), and biomaterial are co-electrospun. During electrospinning, the droplets in the emulsion coalesce due to increased viscosity of the evaporating oil and applied electric field. This process can produce core-shell fibers that can be embedded with growth factors or drugs, which may be leveraged for cell-based meat scaffolding.[40](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/ra/c7ra00179g#!divAbstract) 

Microfluidic spinning relies on differences in a fluids surface tension, energy dissipation, and fluidic resistance to produce a 3D coaxial flow between independent sample and sheath flows.[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216305890) While similar in principle to coaxial electrospinning, the application of voltage is unnecessary, as the fluidic channel width controls fiber diameter. Thus, microfluidic spinning permits a more favorable environment for natural biomaterials due to the avoidance of harsh solvents. In contrast to electrospinning, microfluidic spinning can more easily achieve uniformity of fiber diameter, as well as tighter control over the shape, porosity, and diameter of the fiber. This allows for simple cell encapsulation, which can assist in cell alignment, proliferation, and growth in a 3D environment, all of which are favorable for cell-based meat production (discussed later). The resultant fibers must be solidified via photopolymerization, crosslinking, or solvent exchange, which somewhat limits the selection of polymers. Nevertheless, easily crosslinked materials such as alginate can be readily used in such a system. 

**Decellularization**

[Decellularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decellularization) is a technique that aims to remove the cells and nucleic acids from a tissue while preserving the native ECM. Thus, the decellularized tissue acts as a scaffold with preserved ultrastructure and similar biophysical and biochemical properties of the original tissue, potentially avoiding previously discussed issues (e.g. porosity, material composition, stiffness, etc) associated with bottom-up approaches. Decellularization has been largely pioneered using animal tissues for the purposes of organ regeneration, however, the technique can also be applied to plant or fungi tissues. As such, it is likely that the knowledge and application of techniques originating from animal tissues could be useful for cell-based meat research and development purposes, while real-world implementation is more likely to utilize plant or fungi tissues. 

Decellularization is performed by deploying chemical, physical, or enzymatic methods. Chemicals such as ionic (e.g. [SDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate)), nonionic (e.g [Triton X-100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_X-100)), or [zwitterionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwitterion) (e.g. [CHAPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAPS_detergent)) [detergents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detergent) can be used as they assist in solubilizing membranes, disrupting DNA-protein and lipid-protein interactions, or protecting a proteins native state, respectively.[42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5592694/) However, the harsh nature of these chemicals leads to their use in low amounts or not at all, if possible, as they inherently will also damage ECM proteins.[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21417722) In some cases, the use of acids to catalyze [hydrolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis) degradation of macromolecules, or organic solvents and hypotonic solutions to cause cell lysis can assist in decellularization processes. Physical methods such as freezing and thawing, [electroporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation), agitation, and [sonication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonication) can also be applied to assist in cell lysis. Lastly, various enzymes can assist in the decellularization process, including trypsin, dispase, phospholipases, exonucleases, endonucleases, and other proteases, although consideration has to again be paid to balancing the damage done to ECM proteins.[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550502) As different tissues consist of different cell compositions, sizes, and densities, each decellularization protocol needs to be optimized on a case-by-case basis, and may include one or combinations of the methods described above. 

In general, the decellularization process is a balance between removing cells and nucleic acids and maintaining the integrity of the native ECM. Near complete removal of these components is critical in order to avoid immune responses from the host in the context of organ transplantation. However, this is less of a concern for cell-based meat as the tissue is dead and ingested rather than intended to survive in a host. Interestingly, some evidence suggests that residual antimicrobial peptides persist in some animal ECM scaffolds, which may instead be leveraged to prevent contamination *in vitro*.[45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17518662) In summary, the cell-based meat field can learn from and apply the knowledge gained from decellularization and recellularization processes, discussed below. 

The most applicable decellularization techniques for cell-based meat are perfusion and immersion with agitation. Perfusion is typically used for whole organ decellularization, where native vasculature (typically the main organ artery) is co-opted and used as the plumbing for perfusion of decellularization reagents at physiological pressures. This is often performed in a perfusion bioreactor (discussed in Series II) where the physiological pressure ensures that the tissue is not damaged and that the decellularization reagents can effectively permeate all of the preserved vasculature, including capillaries. For tissues without accessible or large vasculature routes (e.g. skeletal muscle, skin), the tissue can be immersed in decellularization reagents and agitated, assisting in permeation of the tissue via diffusion.[46](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702116304278) While immersion methods do not require the need for a specialized bioreactor, they often can result in long exposures to the decellularization reagents and intracellular release of native proteases that can damage the ECM scaffold.[47](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550502) 

Decellularization has come of age since the first demonstration of a decellularized rat heart in 2008.[48](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1684) Since then, decellularization of large, complex tissues such as human hearts[49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740234/) and limbs[50](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5774802/) has been achieved, as well as decellularization of cell-based meat-relevant tissue types such as whole muscles.[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26963901) Information on the decellularized scaffold can be gleaned from [microCT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_microtomography), [scanning electron microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope), [atomic force microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy), and [immunohistochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry), which yields information about the 3D architecture, biomechanical properties, and composition of the ECM, respectively.[52](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702116304278) This information can be leveraged for the recreation of scaffolds for cell-based meat, particularly through characterization of decellularized skeletal muscle[53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264525) and specific cuts of meat. Additionally, the information may be used in bottom-up scaffold approaches such as the creation of CAD models for 3D bioprinting or the solubilization of the native decellularized ECM itself for use in bioinks[54](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4935) or electrospinning.[55](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00384?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=abseba) 

While decellularization has become relatively straightforward, the recellularization process may require additional optimizations in cell delivery and bioreactor engineering. For recellularization, cells are typically delivered via the vascular perfusion line at or below physiological flow rates over multiple infusions. Physiological flow rates assist in preventing structural damage to the ECM and protecting cells from shear stress, and these techniques have resulted in seeding efficiencies of organ [parenchyma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma) above 90%.[56](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23542907) Pre-coating of the scaffold with biomaterials such as chitosan, collagen, gelatin, or RGD peptides can additionally assist in increasing reseeding efficiency.[57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550502) As a tissue is recellularized, flow pressure may need to be dynamically adjusted as porosity becomes limited (due to cell attachment), and monitoring systems may need to be developed for this purpose.[58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18949759) Additionally, the establishment of endothelial cells and vasculature may require pulsatile flow to more accurately mimic the experienced physiological environment of these cell types. However, its uncertain if scaffold endothelialization would be necessary for cell-based meat production.[59](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21417722) At least one company in the field [has cited creation of vasculature](https://www.businessinsider.com/aleph-farms-israeli-startup-makes-first-lab-grown-clean-steak-meat-photos-video-2018-12) for their products.  
One of the advantages of using a decellularized animal tissue as a scaffold is that it retains the zip code locations of the native cytoarchitecture encoded via residual embedded growth factors, mechanical properties, and other ECM characteristics previously discussed. Therefore, the process of recellularization is highly self-organized but still commands consideration for a cell populations differentiation state prior to recellularization. All of the starting cell types desirable for cell-based meat production (discussed in Series I) have been utilized for recellularization, including myoblasts,[60](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4568187/) mesenchymal stem cells,[61](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513465v1) embryonic stem cells,[62](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064134) and induced pluripotent stem cells.[63](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222839) Indeed, similarly to experiments on hydrogel scaffolds, evidence suggests that recellularization of a decellularized animal tissue scaffold with pluripotent stem cells is sufficient to direct the differentiation toward the native tissue type, increasing expression of relevant cell type markers and functionality versus 2D protocols,[64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222839) as well as assemble native substructures due to local microenvironments.[65](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064134#pone.0064134-Brennan1) Likewise, recellularization with multipotent progenitors such as mesenchymal stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived progenitors can be directed into functional tissues made up of a variety of differentiated cell types.[66](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513465v1),[67](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00779-y) Successful recellularization (and subsequent functional transplantation) has been performed on tissues as large as adult pig lungs in perfusion bioreactors up to dozens of liters in volume, suggesting that the process is scalable.[68](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/452/eaao3926/tab-pdf) Thus, adoption of learned principles from recellularization or recreation of a decellularized scaffold via methods such as 3D printing with solubilized native ECM[69](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961219301863),[70](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201600483) should be highly applicable for cell-based meat research and development. 

Use of decellularized scaffolds from animals has several limitations. For instance, the composition of a decellularized scaffold can vary between individuals and be affected by age and protocol irreproducibility.[71](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28222326) Most importantly, however, the supply is limited and thus expensive, and reconstructing an ECM containing up to hundreds of proteins is not feasible.[72](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064134) For these reasons, plants have been an attractive alternative for decellularization strategies, as their cell walls are composed of abundant biocompatible polysaccharides such as [cellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose), [pectin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectin), and [hemicellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemicellulose), and native vasculature similar to animals that follows [Murrays Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray%27s_law), allowing perfusion. Indeed, in combination with functionalization methods previously discussed, attachment of mammalian cells onto decellularized plant scaffolds has been demonstrated using a variety of plant stems, leaves, or hypanthium tissues.[73](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201601225),[74](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097835) Functionalized plant scaffolds have demonstrated long-term viability and cell proliferation, although differences in native stiffness, hydrophilicity, topography, and pore sizes can influence their success.[75](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201601225) The vast variety of plants to choose from may ensure that different tissue architectures (e.g. celery for muscle fibers) can be recapitulated and future [genetic engineering efforts could modify plants to express biocompatible ](https://newfoodeconomy.org/cell-cultured-meat-plant-scaffold/)protein domains (e.g. RGD), as done in silk.[76](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26461118) Importantly, construction of [plant scaffolds](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/scientists-are-growing-meat-on-blades-of-grass?utm_source=Facebook%20Videos&amp;utm_medium=Facebook%20Videos&amp;utm_campaign=Facebook%20Video%20Blogs) can be readily scaled simply by using larger or more abundant plant tissues, or processing of raw plant materials to create protein- or cellulose-based scaffolds using previously discussed methods.[77](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316787828_Developing_cultured_meat_scaffolds_of_extruded_vegetable-based_proteins) Plant-based materials will likely be significantly more cost-efficient at scale versus their animal ECM counterparts, as the processing and use of abundant raw plant materials such as cellulose for tissue engineering is well characterized.[78](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2019.00019/abstract) Similarly, the [use of fungal mycelium](https://ecovativedesign.com/atlast) may serve as a scalable and affordable scaffolding substrate, which may not require decellularization for use. Thus, by borrowing techniques pioneered for human organ generation and leveraging the plant and fungal kingdoms for practicality, use of prefabricated scaffolds by nature may be the most likely to take hold in the cell-based meat industry. 

**Summary of Scaffolds for Cell-based Meat**

Putting this information together, a scaffolding structure for cell-based meat will likely require leveraging multiple aspects of state-of-the-art tissue engineering. A scaffold will likely be composed of cheap, edible or biodegradable biomaterials with high biocompatibility and porosity suitable for cell migration (\~1 - 500m), continuous perfusion, and recycling of cell culture medium (discussed in Series IV) to remove waste and refresh nutrient supply. This may leverage native tissue architecture (e.g. decellularization) or be constructed by design (e.g. 3D printing, electrospinning, core-shell tubes). The scaffold may consist of different composite biomaterials, pre-patterned to recreate the cytoarchitecture of meat, with differing stiffnesses and/or embedded growth factors to assist in the attachment, migration, and maturation of stem cells into their differentiated counterparts. Important considerations should be taken into how a scaffold may integrate and behave in a bioreactor, which may require custom engineering, computational modeling of fluids, and integration of on-line sensors (discussed in Series II). For instance, oxygen and other nutrient mass transfer is likely to change when growing cells on a scaffold versus in suspension.[100](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16023202) Existing [bioreactors](http://3dbiotek.com/prod_3dCellExpansionSystem.aspx) for mammalian cell growth may provide some insight into best approaches,[101](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190002815A1/en) as well as learned principles from [solid state fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_fermentation) used in production of fungi or [plant hairy root culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_root_culture) used to produce metabolites or proteins. Additionally, sterilization procedures for scaffolds such as gamma and UV irradiation or ethylene oxide may denature or damage certain biomaterials, thus limiting certain raw material options.[102](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27123816) Forward-thinking strategies to address these challenges should be pursued. 

The level of cellular maturation required will likely be dictated by the final products nutritional and textural requirements, and a spectrum of options may be considered in practice. As will be discussed in Series V, its likely that many years will separate the release of unstructured versus structured products as described here due to the difficult nature of the process. Significant challenges will need to be met with new innovations, such as core-shell tubes, to address concerns of scaling, cost, and reproducibility, as current practices in tissue engineering are prohibitively expensive and technically challenging. Despite this, current technologies provide a foundational roadmap for the successful creation of future structured cell-based meat products. Scientists in tissue engineering and cell-based meat should be encouraged to share knowledge and collaborate around shared problems, resulting in mutual positive benefits for each respective field.

**Introduction** 

The range of meat products on the market exists on a spectrum of structural sophistication. On one end of the spectrum, there are less sophisticated processed products such as chicken nuggets and sausages; in the middle, ground products; and on the other end, filets and steaks. In order to replicate the more sophisticated products, scientists will need to borrow and improve upon technologies from tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and biomaterials science to recreate the complex multicellular architecture of meat. Building off of bioengineering and biomaterials knowledge [discussed previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/beybqj/indepth_how_its_made_the_science_behind_cultured/?st=jv4h11dr&amp;sh=7047038c), a review of the core methods to consider for the creation of complex multicellular meat products are discussed below. 

**3D Bioprinting**  

3D bioprinting is an additive manufacturing technique where pre-polymer solutions or pre-polymer solutions containing cells (i.e. a [bioink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-ink)) are deposited onto a substrate layer-by-layer under the guidance of a computer-aided design (CAD) process. The CAD files typically result from real bioimaging data such as [magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) (MRI) and [computer tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan) (CT) scans of tissues, but can also be user-generated to form limitless geometry types. Similar imaging strategies can be performed to replicate specific cuts of meat.[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5928302/) There are several types of bioprinting, the most applicable of which are discussed below.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905875),[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452199X17301068) 

**Bioink**

Bioink is the raw material for 3D bioprinting, composed of cells in combination with some other biological material. There are two major types of bioink materials: scaffold-based and scaffold-free. A scaffold-based bioink is, in essence, a hydrogel that is printed along with cells whereas a scaffold-free bioink contains only large cellular components such as tissue strands or spheroids.[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975016301719) Cells within a bioink typically exist at a concentration of \~10 million cells per milliliter, constituting \~5% or less of the bioink volume,[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-018-0006-y) although this can be optimized on a case by case basis to permit enough printed cells to replicate a specific tissue. Importantly, however, not all biomaterials previously discussed fit the parameters for use in a bioink. The main parameters to consider for a bioink include the bioprintability or rheological properties (e.g. [viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity), [thixotropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thixotropy)), mechanical properties, insolubility in cell culture medium, cost, and manufacturing capability. Because natural biomaterials generally have weak mechanical properties, special considerations need to be made when including them in a bioink. Additionally, each bioprinting method affects these parameters differently, thus the intended application tends to dictate the chosen method. For cell-based meat, a food-grade (discussed in Series IV) bioink would be appropriate. 

**Extrusion Bioprinting**

In extrusion-based bioprinting, an extruder continuously deposits a bioink while the stage or the extruder itself is moved. Bioink deposition can occur via pneumatic or mechanical systems and the 2D ink must be rapidly solidified either chemically (e.g. light) or physically (e.g. temperature) prior to adding a new layer in order to maintain shape without spreading. In general, extrusion-based systems are the most used and versatile of the methods, permitting a wide variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials to be used due to the range (30 mPas to 60 x 106 mPas) of printable ink viscosities. Extrusion-based methods fundamentally work by dispensing larger filaments (\~150-300m in diameter) rather than droplets. This permits both scaffold-based or scaffold-free printing, capable of incorporating high cell density bioinks, printed spheroids, or cell-laden microcarriers.[6](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1758-5090/8/3/032002/meta) However, this also results in poor printing resolution (as low as 100m) versus other methods, making intricate replication of complex tissues difficult. Bioinks with shear thinning properties are preferable as shear forces naturally align hydrogel polymers for extrusion; however, careful consideration must be given to the shear force effect on cell viability during extrusion.[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057483) Additionally, bioinks with low adhesion and surface tension are necessary to prevent nozzle clogging. 3D food printers that use extrusion-based bioprinting methods and the technologies (e.g. texture analyzers) used to analyze the food products may also be adaptable for cell-based meat. Finally, the [bioprinting of plant-based proteins](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2018/10/18/Italian-researcher-on-3D-printing-tech-for-plant-based-meat-We-re-bio-hacking-plant-protein-structure-at-micro-and-nano-scale) may be informative for the creation of cell-based meat scaffolds or replication of other mechanical, textural, or organoleptic properties of meat. 

Several recent advances show the potential for applying extrusion-based methods toward the creation of thick scaffolds or tissues applicable for cell-based meat production. For instance, researchers have developed hybrid bioprinting devices, where both vascular networks and cells are printed simultaneously under control of independent printing arms equipped with smart sensors to avoid collisions.[8](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d1c5/b7d477d3cb52cc0869ca955e0fc80b088972.pdf) This strategy permits continuous medium perfusion through the printed vascular networks while additional tissue is printed. Systems have also been developed where multiple bioinks can be extruded continuously with fast, dynamic switching between diverse bioinks, permitting printing of complex tissues composed of multiple cells and hydrogel materials.[9](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201604630) Another challenge in bioprinting thick scaffolds is the weak mechanical properties of natural polymers, resulting in their deformation under their own weight. To this end, the hydrogel can be printed within a second hydrogel that provides structural support. The sacrificial support hydrogel acts as a [Bingham plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingham_plastic), where it is a solid up until the point of contact with the extrusion nozzle, permitting the printed hydrogel to displace the support hydrogel.[10](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/9/e1500758) The support hydrogel can then be removed (i.e. dissolved) by increasing the temperature (e.g. when using gelatin), or applying calcium chelators (e.g. [EDTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid) when using alginate) or enzymes, resulting in a standalone scaffold or cell-laden tissue. Sacrificial gels have also been adopted for the creation of artificial vasculature.[11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706119301515) Additionally, the benefits of these aforementioned methods can be combined, enabling bioprinting of human-scale tissues with fewer limitations.[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26878319) Lastly, as described previously, the spatiotemporal release of biomolecules within a scaffold can assist in biomimicry of the ECM. To this end, 3D printed light-sensitive nanocapsules containing growth factors can be dispersed within a scaffold during printing, permitting guided migration of cells in a spatiotemporally controlled fashion via light.[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4536147/#SD1),[14](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201806899) These and other advances in extrusion bioprinting hold great promise for their application to the cell-based meat industry, and at least [one company](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2019/02/11/From-edible-scaffolding-to-bio-printing-What-would-an-industrial-scale-cell-based-meat-plant-look-like#.XGHAauCEMOQ.twitter) has plans to utilize extrusion-based bioprinting for cell-based meat production.

**Stereolithography**

Stereolithography uses single or multiphoton light sources to rapidly polymerize a bath of [light-sensitive pre-polymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopolymer). Structures derived from CAD models are recreated via light reflecting off of [micromirror galvanometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_galvanometer), which provide feedback to the printing apparatus, enabling precise spatial and temporal control of the polymerization. Polymerization occurs either through direct laser light exposure or exposure through a mask in a bottom-up process of sequential 2D layers.[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009727000062) Inclusion of photocrosslinkable biomaterials previously described now permits this technique to be used for scaffold generation or printing of structures from cell-laden pre-polymer baths. The advantages of stereolithography include avoidance of previously described considerations (e.g. viscosity, surface tension, and shear stress through a nozzle), automated control (in maskless methods), high resolution (&lt; 100 m), and fast printing speed. Disadvantages include potential cytotoxicity from light exposure and a limited but growing repertoire of suitable biomaterials to use. Further developments are also necessary to permit further scaling to more complex 3D constructs as well as derivation of non-cytotoxic [photoinitiators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoinitiator) that assist in the crosslinking reaction during polymerization.[16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009727000062) 

Recent progress demonstrates the potential for using stereolithography in cell-based meat scaffold production. For instance, combining stereolithography with [dielectrophoresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectrophoresis) can enable precise spatial control of cells[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23463644) and advances in microscale continuous projection printing enables sub-10m resolution objects to be printed on the order of seconds.[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3784638/) Computed axial lithography uses angled image projections that result in concurrent 3D printing of whole structures at high speeds.[19](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2019/01/30/science.aau7114) As a non-layered approach, it does not require the use of supportive hydrogels (discussed previously) for mechanically weaker biomaterials and should be readily scalable. Thus, further development of stereolithographic techniques may permit their use in the cell-based meat industry. 

**Electrospinning**

[Electrospinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrospinning) is a versatile, low-cost technique where a solution of polymers is passed through a spinneret needle during application of a high electric field. The electric field causes stretching of the polymer via electrostatic forces until a critical point (i.e. [Taylor cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_cone)) is reached, resulting in the formation of a fiber jet. As the fiber jet is formed, the solvent evaporates off, and the fiber hardens while it is harvested on an electrostatically-grounded collection device.[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136970211300196X) The fiber itself can be made from a variety of synthetic and natural polymers, resulting in porous fiber networks with tunable diameters and high surface area. Electrospinning is unique in that it provides the only way to achieve nanoscale biomimicry of the ECM (50 - 500 nm diameter fibers). Of note, cell-laden biomaterials can also be electrosprayed through a similar process that yields droplet deposition rather than fiber deposition,[26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706117306281) although this is less applicable toward scaffold creation. Lastly, similar fiber production methods are possible such as [wet, dry, or melt spinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_(polymers)), which can be used to produce materials such as scaffolds[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23443534) and hollow fiber membranes[28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037673889400076X) used in bioreactors (discussed in Series II). 

Many of the same considerations and principles previously discussed for biomaterials in hydrogel formation, bioinks, and bioprinting also apply to the creation of electrospun scaffolds. For instance, mechanically weak but biocompatible natural polymers are often combined with synthetic polymers. Identifying rapidly evaporating solvents suitable for composite materials can be challenging, however, and the solvents themselves may be cytotoxic[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216305890) or damage the native structure of the polymers.[30](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la3033258) Similarly to a bioink, alterations in viscosity, solvent surface tension, and flow rate can affect the fiber characteristics, and alterations in the applied voltage and rotating speed, distance, or structure of the collection device can affect resultant scaffold geometries.[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25619820),[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216305890) Unless otherwise intended, electrospun scaffolds will result in a random arrangement of packed fibers, which can limit cell infiltration, migration, or uniform seeding.[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25619820) Similar methods used for hydrogels, such as inclusion of protease-degradable polymers can assist in better mimicking native ECM for cell infiltration and migration.[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25799370) Additionally, a variety of methods have been developed in order to produce electrospun scaffolds with defined structure and purpose, including mixed, multilayer, coaxial, and emulsion electrospinning, and microfluidic spinning, discussed below. 

While true biomimicry of the ECM requires nanoscale fibers, the porosity of the scaffold itself, which has a positive linear relationship with fiber diameter, should be on the microscale to permit cell infiltration and perfusion. A fiber network on both nano and microscales can be created via multilayer electrospinning, where different nanofiber and microfiber polymers are electrospun sequentially in layers. Alternatively, mixed electrospinning can be performed where nanofiber and microfiber polymer types are simultaneously electrospun on a collector that permits overlapping collection through lateral movement of the collector.[35](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961204001188) These techniques can permit or restrict certain cells from infiltrating a scaffold based on pore size,[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20188414) which may be leveraged for spatial distribution of cell seeding for cell-based meat. Sacrificial biomaterials such as gelatin can also be used as a polymer to create additional pores upon melting.

In coaxial electrospinning, an inner and outer solution is co-electrospun via independent feeding capillaries, forming a compound Taylor cone. One solution typically contains a hydrophobic polymer and the other contains a biological cargo of interest solubilized with hydrophilic polymers (e.g. dextran), resulting in a core-shell structure due to their [immiscibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscibility), or inability to mix.[37](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-6041/8/1/014102) Coaxial electrospun fibers permit trapping of proteins, cells (discussed later), or other biomolecules such that their release kinetics can be varied based on the porosity or biodegradability of the outer shell polymer,[38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20594971) which may serve well for embedding of growth factors for cell-based meat. The viscosity of the solutions, flow rate, and applied electric field strength can all influence the geometry and characteristics of the resultant core-shell fibers. Additionally, multi-layered fibers can be created by co-electrospinning more than 2 solutions.[39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510905) Similar core-shell fibers can be created via emulsion electrospinning where an [emulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion) of oil, water, [surfactant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant), and biomaterial are co-electrospun. During electrospinning, the droplets in the emulsion coalesce due to increased viscosity of the evaporating oil and applied electric field. This process can produce core-shell fibers that can be embedded with growth factors or drugs, which may be leveraged for cell-based meat scaffolding.[40](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/ra/c7ra00179g#!divAbstract) 

Microfluidic spinning relies on differences in a fluids surface tension, energy dissipation, and fluidic resistance to produce a 3D coaxial flow between independent sample and sheath flows.[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216305890) While similar in principle to coaxial electrospinning, the application of voltage is unnecessary, as the fluidic channel width controls fiber diameter. Thus, microfluidic spinning permits a more favorable environment for natural biomaterials due to the avoidance of harsh solvents. In contrast to electrospinning, microfluidic spinning can more easily achieve uniformity of fiber diameter, as well as tighter control over the shape, porosity, and diameter of the fiber. This allows for simple cell encapsulation, which can assist in cell alignment, proliferation, and growth in a 3D environment, all of which are favorable for cell-based meat production (discussed later). The resultant fibers must be solidified via photopolymerization, crosslinking, or solvent exchange, which somewhat limits the selection of polymers. Nevertheless, easily crosslinked materials such as alginate can be readily used in such a system. 

**Decellularization**

[Decellularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decellularization) is a technique that aims to remove the cells and nucleic acids from a tissue while preserving the native ECM. Thus, the decellularized tissue acts as a scaffold with preserved ultrastructure and similar biophysical and biochemical properties of the original tissue, potentially avoiding previously discussed issues (e.g. porosity, material composition, stiffness, etc) associated with bottom-up approaches. Decellularization has been largely pioneered using animal tissues for the purposes of organ regeneration, however, the technique can also be applied to plant or fungi tissues. As such, it is likely that the knowledge and application of techniques originating from animal tissues could be useful for cell-based meat research and development purposes, while real-world implementation is more likely to utilize plant or fungi tissues. 

Decellularization is performed by deploying chemical, physical, or enzymatic methods. Chemicals such as ionic (e.g. [SDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate)), nonionic (e.g [Triton X-100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_X-100)), or [zwitterionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwitterion) (e.g. [CHAPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAPS_detergent)) [detergents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detergent) can be used as they assist in solubilizing membranes, disrupting DNA-protein and lipid-protein interactions, or protecting a proteins native state, respectively.[42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5592694/) However, the harsh nature of these chemicals leads to their use in low amounts or not at all, if possible, as they inherently will also damage ECM proteins.[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21417722) In some cases, the use of acids to catalyze [hydrolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis) degradation of macromolecules, or organic solvents and hypotonic solutions to cause cell lysis can assist in decellularization processes. Physical methods such as freezing and thawing, [electroporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation), agitation, and [sonication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonication) can also be applied to assist in cell lysis. Lastly, various enzymes can assist in the decellularization process, including trypsin, dispase, phospholipases, exonucleases, endonucleases, and other proteases, although consideration has to again be paid to balancing the damage done to ECM proteins.[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550502) As different tissues consist of different cell compositions, sizes, and densities, each decellularization protocol needs to be optimized on a case-by-case basis, and may include one or combinations of the methods described above. 

In general, the decellularization process is a balance between removing cells and nucleic acids and maintaining the integrity of the native ECM. Near complete removal of these components is critical in order to avoid immune responses from the host in the context of organ transplantation. However, this is less of a concern for cell-based meat as the tissue is dead and ingested rather than intended to survive in a host. Interestingly, some evidence suggests that residual antimicrobial peptides persist in some animal ECM scaffolds, which may instead be leveraged to prevent contamination *in vitro*.[45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17518662) In summary, the cell-based meat field can learn from and apply the knowledge gained from decellularization and recellularization processes, discussed below. 

The most applicable decellularization techniques for cell-based meat are perfusion and immersion with agitation. Perfusion is typically used for whole organ decellularization, where native vasculature (typically the main organ artery) is co-opted and used as the plumbing for perfusion of decellularization reagents at physiological pressures. This is often performed in a perfusion bioreactor (discussed in Series II) where the physiological pressure ensures that the tissue is not damaged and that the decellularization reagents can effectively permeate all of the preserved vasculature, including capillaries. For tissues without accessible or large vasculature routes (e.g. skeletal muscle, skin), the tissue can be immersed in decellularization reagents and agitated, assisting in permeation of the tissue via diffusion.[46](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702116304278) While immersion methods do not require the need for a specialized bioreactor, they often can result in long exposures to the decellularization reagents and intracellular release of native proteases that can damage the ECM scaffold.[47](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550502) 

Decellularization has come of age since the first demonstration of a decellularized rat heart in 2008.[48](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1684) Since then, decellularization of large, complex tissues such as human hearts[49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740234/) and limbs[50](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5774802/) has been achieved, as well as decellularization of cell-based meat-relevant tissue types such as whole muscles.[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26963901) Information on the decellularized scaffold can be gleaned from [microCT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_microtomography), [scanning electron microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope), [atomic force microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy), and [immunohistochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry), which yields information about the 3D architecture, biomechanical properties, and composition of the ECM, respectively.[52](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702116304278) This information can be leveraged for the recreation of scaffolds for cell-based meat, particularly through characterization of decellularized skeletal muscle[53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264525) and specific cuts of meat. Additionally, the information may be used in bottom-up scaffold approaches such as the creation of CAD models for 3D bioprinting or the solubilization of the native decellularized ECM itself for use in bioinks[54](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4935) or electrospinning.[55](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00384?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=abseba) 

While decellularization has become relatively straightforward, the recellularization process may require additional optimizations in cell delivery and bioreactor engineering. For recellularization, cells are typically delivered via the vascular perfusion line at or below physiological flow rates over multiple infusions. Physiological flow rates assist in preventing structural damage to the ECM and protecting cells from shear stress, and these techniques have resulted in seeding efficiencies of organ [parenchyma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma) above 90%.[56](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23542907) Pre-coating of the scaffold with biomaterials such as chitosan, collagen, gelatin, or RGD peptides can additionally assist in increasing reseeding efficiency.[57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550502) As a tissue is recellularized, flow pressure may need to be dynamically adjusted as porosity becomes limited (due to cell attachment), and monitoring systems may need to be developed for this purpose.[58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18949759) Additionally, the establishment of endothelial cells and vasculature may require pulsatile flow to more accurately mimic the experienced physiological environment of these cell types. However, its uncertain if scaffold endothelialization would be necessary for cell-based meat production.[59](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21417722) At least one company in the field [has cited creation of vasculature](https://www.businessinsider.com/aleph-farms-israeli-startup-makes-first-lab-grown-clean-steak-meat-photos-video-2018-12) for their products.  
One of the advantages of using a decellularized animal tissue as a scaffold is that it retains the zip code locations of the native cytoarchitecture encoded via residual embedded growth factors, mechanical properties, and other ECM characteristics previously discussed. Therefore, the process of recellularization is highly self-organized but still commands consideration for a cell populations differentiation state prior to recellularization. All of the starting cell types desirable for cell-based meat production (discussed in Series I) have been utilized for recellularization, including myoblasts,[60](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4568187/) mesenchymal stem cells,[61](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513465v1) embryonic stem cells,[62](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064134) and induced pluripotent stem cells.[63](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222839) Indeed, similarly to experiments on hydrogel scaffolds, evidence suggests that recellularization of a decellularized animal tissue scaffold with pluripotent stem cells is sufficient to direct the differentiation toward the native tissue type, increasing expression of relevant cell type markers and functionality versus 2D protocols,[64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222839) as well as assemble native substructures due to local microenvironments.[65](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064134#pone.0064134-Brennan1) Likewise, recellularization with multipotent progenitors such as mesenchymal stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived progenitors can be directed into functional tissues made up of a variety of differentiated cell types.[66](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513465v1),[67](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00779-y) Successful recellularization (and subsequent functional transplantation) has been performed on tissues as large as adult pig lungs in perfusion bioreactors up to dozens of liters in volume, suggesting that the process is scalable.[68](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/452/eaao3926/tab-pdf) Thus, adoption of learned principles from recellularization or recreation of a decellularized scaffold via methods such as 3D printing with solubilized native ECM[69](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961219301863),[70](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201600483) should be highly applicable for cell-based meat research and development. 

Use of decellularized scaffolds from animals has several limitations. For instance, the composition of a decellularized scaffold can vary between individuals and be affected by age and protocol irreproducibility.[71](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28222326) Most importantly, however, the supply is limited and thus expensive, and reconstructing an ECM containing up to hundreds of proteins is not feasible.[72](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064134) For these reasons, plants have been an attractive alternative for decellularization strategies, as their cell walls are composed of abundant biocompatible polysaccharides such as [cellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose), [pectin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectin), and [hemicellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemicellulose), and native vasculature similar to animals that follows [Murrays Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray%27s_law), allowing perfusion. Indeed, in combination with functionalization methods previously discussed, attachment of mammalian cells onto decellularized plant scaffolds has been demonstrated using a variety of plant stems, leaves, or hypanthium tissues.[73](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201601225),[74](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097835) Functionalized plant scaffolds have demonstrated long-term viability and cell proliferation, although differences in native stiffness, hydrophilicity, topography, and pore sizes can influence their success.[75](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201601225) The vast variety of plants to choose from may ensure that different tissue architectures (e.g. celery for muscle fibers) can be recapitulated and future [genetic engineering efforts could modify plants to express biocompatible ](https://newfoodeconomy.org/cell-cultured-meat-plant-scaffold/)protein domains (e.g. RGD), as done in silk.[76](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26461118) Importantly, construction of [plant scaffolds](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/scientists-are-growing-meat-on-blades-of-grass?utm_source=Facebook%20Videos&amp;utm_medium=Facebook%20Videos&amp;utm_campaign=Facebook%20Video%20Blogs) can be readily scaled simply by using larger or more abundant plant tissues, or processing of raw plant materials to create protein- or cellulose-based scaffolds using previously discussed methods.[77](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316787828_Developing_cultured_meat_scaffolds_of_extruded_vegetable-based_proteins) Plant-based materials will likely be significantly more cost-efficient at scale versus their animal ECM counterparts, as the processing and use of abundant raw plant materials such as cellulose for tissue engineering is well characterized.[78](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2019.00019/abstract) Similarly, the [use of fungal mycelium](https://ecovativedesign.com/atlast) may serve as a scalable and affordable scaffolding substrate, which may not require decellularization for use. Thus, by borrowing techniques pioneered for human organ generation and leveraging the plant and fungal kingdoms for practicality, use of prefabricated scaffolds by nature may be the most likely to take hold in the cell-based meat industry. 

**Summary of Scaffolds for Cell-based Meat**

Putting this information together, a scaffolding structure for cell-based meat will likely require leveraging multiple aspects of state-of-the-art tissue engineering. A scaffold will likely be composed of cheap, edible or biodegradable biomaterials with high biocompatibility and porosity suitable for cell migration (\~1 - 500m), continuous perfusion, and recycling of cell culture medium (discussed in Series IV) to remove waste and refresh nutrient supply. This may leverage native tissue architecture (e.g. decellularization) or be constructed by design (e.g. 3D printing, electrospinning, core-shell tubes). The scaffold may consist of different composite biomaterials, pre-patterned to recreate the cytoarchitecture of meat, with differing stiffnesses and/or embedded growth factors to assist in the attachment, migration, and maturation of stem cells into their differentiated counterparts. Important considerations should be taken into how a scaffold may integrate and behave in a bioreactor, which may require custom engineering, computational modeling of fluids, and integration of on-line sensors (discussed in Series II). For instance, oxygen and other nutrient mass transfer is likely to change when growing cells on a scaffold versus in suspension.[100](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16023202) Existing [bioreactors](http://3dbiotek.com/prod_3dCellExpansionSystem.aspx) for mammalian cell growth may provide some insight into best approaches,[101](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190002815A1/en) as well as learned principles from [solid state fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_fermentation) used in production of fungi or [plant hairy root culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_root_culture) used to produce metabolites or proteins. Additionally, sterilization procedures for scaffolds such as gamma and UV irradiation or ethylene oxide may denature or damage certain biomaterials, thus limiting certain raw material options.[102](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27123816) Forward-thinking strategies to address these challenges should be pursued. 

The level of cellular maturation required will likely be dictated by the final products nutritional and textural requirements, and a spectrum of options may be considered in practice. As will be discussed in Series V, its likely that many years will separate the release of unstructured versus structured products as described here due to the difficult nature of the process. Significant challenges will need to be met with new innovations, such as core-shell tubes, to address concerns of scaling, cost, and reproducibility, as current practices in tissue engineering are prohibitively expensive and technically challenging. Despite this, current technologies provide a foundational roadmap for the successful creation of future structured cell-based meat products. Scientists in tissue engineering and cell-based meat should be encouraged to share knowledge and collaborate around shared problems, resulting in mutual positive benefits for each respective field.

First, I have purchased a $5000 two year cloud mining contract with InnovaMine which is returning roughly $110 a day and I will have recouped my entire investment in just 8 more days (45 days total).

Anyways, I am trying to get to about an 80% BTC 20% XRP split because going forward I feel like Bitcoin and Ripple are the only true contenders. I think we will see $20k this summer for a couple of reasons. Primarily I think now that MACD has crossed over and the bull run is truly on, mainstream media will push to all the copycat investors that wished they were in for round one. I would say at around $10k there will be some serious attention and hype pushing crypto volume to all time highs. Additionally, with tariffs and trade wars and government collapse in nations like Venezuela, I believe that crypto is more appealing now than ever before. The push for decentralization and controlling your own assets is starting to really make sense to a lot of people. Lastly, with the introduction of BAKKT to the market as well as growing acceptance of the crypto field among many of the worlds leading nations; I believe this only further solidifies the establishment of Bitcoin in the market and helps stabilize crypto as a whole from volatile swings. All right lets hear it...debate me down below.

**Introduction** 

The range of meat products on the market exists on a spectrum of structural sophistication. On one end of the spectrum, there are less sophisticated processed products such as chicken nuggets and sausages; in the middle, ground products; and on the other end, filets and steaks. In order to replicate the more sophisticated products, scientists will need to borrow and improve upon technologies from tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and biomaterials science to recreate the complex multicellular architecture of meat. Building off of bioengineering and biomaterials knowledge [discussed previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/beybqj/indepth_how_its_made_the_science_behind_cultured/?st=jv4h11dr&amp;sh=7047038c), a review of the core methods to consider for the creation of complex multicellular meat products are discussed below. 

**3D Bioprinting**  

3D bioprinting is an additive manufacturing technique where pre-polymer solutions or pre-polymer solutions containing cells (i.e. a [bioink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-ink)) are deposited onto a substrate layer-by-layer under the guidance of a computer-aided design (CAD) process. The CAD files typically result from real bioimaging data such as [magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) (MRI) and [computer tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan) (CT) scans of tissues, but can also be user-generated to form limitless geometry types. Similar imaging strategies can be performed to replicate specific cuts of meat.[^(1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5928302/) There are several types of bioprinting, the most applicable of which are discussed below.[^(2)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905875)^(,)[^(3)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452199X17301068) 

**Bioink**

Bioink is the raw material for 3D bioprinting, composed of cells in combination with some other biological material. There are two major types of bioink materials: scaffold-based and scaffold-free. A scaffold-based bioink is, in essence, a hydrogel that is printed along with cells whereas a scaffold-free bioink contains only large cellular components such as tissue strands or spheroids.[^(4)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975016301719) Cells within a bioink typically exist at a concentration of \~10 million cells per milliliter, constituting \~5% or less of the bioink volume,[^(5)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-018-0006-y) although this can be optimized on a case by case basis to permit enough printed cells to replicate a specific tissue. Importantly, however, not all biomaterials previously discussed fit the parameters for use in a bioink. The main parameters to consider for a bioink include the bioprintability or rheological properties (e.g. [viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity), [thixotropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thixotropy)), mechanical properties, insolubility in cell culture medium, cost, and manufacturing capability. Because natural biomaterials generally have weak mechanical properties, special considerations need to be made when including them in a bioink. Additionally, each bioprinting method affects these parameters differently, thus the intended application tends to dictate the chosen method. For cell-based meat, a food-grade (discussed in Series IV) bioink would be appropriate. 

**Extrusion Bioprinting**

In extrusion-based bioprinting, an extruder continuously deposits a bioink while the stage or the extruder itself is moved. Bioink deposition can occur via pneumatic or mechanical systems and the 2D ink must be rapidly solidified either chemically (e.g. light) or physically (e.g. temperature) prior to adding a new layer in order to maintain shape without spreading. In general, extrusion-based systems are the most used and versatile of the methods, permitting a wide variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials to be used due to the range (30 mPas to 60 x 106 mPas) of printable ink viscosities. Extrusion-based methods fundamentally work by dispensing larger filaments (\~150-300m in diameter) rather than droplets. This permits both scaffold-based or scaffold-free printing, capable of incorporating high cell density bioinks, printed spheroids, or cell-laden microcarriers.[^(6)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1758-5090/8/3/032002/meta) However, this also results in poor printing resolution (as low as 100m) versus other methods, making intricate replication of complex tissues difficult. Bioinks with shear thinning properties are preferable as shear forces naturally align hydrogel polymers for extrusion; however, careful consideration must be given to the shear force effect on cell viability during extrusion.[^(7)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057483) Additionally, bioinks with low adhesion and surface tension are necessary to prevent nozzle clogging. 3D food printers that use extrusion-based bioprinting methods and the technologies (e.g. texture analyzers) used to analyze the food products may also be adaptable for cell-based meat. Finally, the [bioprinting of plant-based proteins](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2018/10/18/Italian-researcher-on-3D-printing-tech-for-plant-based-meat-We-re-bio-hacking-plant-protein-structure-at-micro-and-nano-scale) may be informative for the creation of cell-based meat scaffolds or replication of other mechanical, textural, or organoleptic properties of meat. 

Several recent advances show the potential for applying extrusion-based methods toward the creation of thick scaffolds or tissues applicable for cell-based meat production. For instance, researchers have developed hybrid bioprinting devices, where both vascular networks and cells are printed simultaneously under control of independent printing arms equipped with smart sensors to avoid collisions.[^(8)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d1c5/b7d477d3cb52cc0869ca955e0fc80b088972.pdf) This strategy permits continuous medium perfusion through the printed vascular networks while additional tissue is printed. Systems have also been developed where multiple bioinks can be extruded continuously with fast, dynamic switching between diverse bioinks, permitting printing of complex tissues composed of multiple cells and hydrogel materials.[^(9)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201604630) Another challenge in bioprinting thick scaffolds is the weak mechanical properties of natural polymers, resulting in their deformation under their own weight. To this end, [the hydrogel can be printed within a second hydrogel that provides structural support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfl_tFdt2D4). The sacrificial support hydrogel acts as a [Bingham plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingham_plastic), where it is a solid up until the point of contact with the extrusion nozzle, permitting the printed hydrogel to displace the support hydrogel.[^(10)](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/9/e1500758) The support hydrogel can then be removed (i.e. dissolved) by increasing the temperature (e.g. when using gelatin), or applying calcium chelators (e.g. [EDTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid) when using alginate) or enzymes, resulting in a standalone scaffold or cell-laden tissue. Sacrificial gels have also been adopted for the creation of artificial vasculature.[^(11)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706119301515) Additionally, the benefits of these aforementioned methods can be combined, enabling bioprinting of human-scale tissues with fewer limitations.[^(12)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26878319) Lastly, as described previously, the spatiotemporal release of biomolecules within a scaffold can assist in biomimicry of the ECM. To this end, 3D printed light-sensitive nanocapsules containing growth factors can be dispersed within a scaffold during printing, permitting guided migration of cells in a spatiotemporally controlled fashion via light.[^(13)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4536147/#SD1)^(,)[^(14)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201806899) These and other advances in extrusion bioprinting hold great promise for their application to the cell-based meat industry, and at least [one company](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2019/02/11/From-edible-scaffolding-to-bio-printing-What-would-an-industrial-scale-cell-based-meat-plant-look-like#.XGHAauCEMOQ.twitter) has plans to utilize extrusion-based bioprinting for cell-based meat production.

**Stereolithography**

Stereolithography uses single or multiphoton light sources to rapidly polymerize a bath of [light-sensitive pre-polymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopolymer). Structures derived from CAD models are recreated via light reflecting off of [micromirror galvanometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_galvanometer), which provide feedback to the printing apparatus, enabling precise spatial and temporal control of the polymerization. Polymerization occurs either through direct laser light exposure or exposure through a mask in a bottom-up process of sequential 2D layers.[^(15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009727000062) Inclusion of photocrosslinkable biomaterials previously described now permits this technique to be used for scaffold generation or printing of structures from cell-laden pre-polymer baths. The advantages of stereolithography include avoidance of previously described considerations (e.g. viscosity, surface tension, and shear stress through a nozzle), automated control (in maskless methods), high resolution (&lt; 100 m), and fast printing speed. Disadvantages include potential cytotoxicity from light exposure and a limited but growing repertoire of suitable biomaterials to use. Further developments are also necessary to permit further scaling to more complex 3D constructs as well as derivation of non-cytotoxic [photoinitiators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoinitiator) that assist in the crosslinking reaction during polymerization.[^(16)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009727000062) 

Recent progress demonstrates the potential for using stereolithography in cell-based meat scaffold production. For instance, combining stereolithography with [dielectrophoresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectrophoresis) can enable precise spatial control of cells[^(17)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23463644) and advances in microscale continuous projection printing enables sub-10m resolution objects to be printed on the order of seconds.[^(18)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3784638/) Computed axial lithography uses angled image projections that result in concurrent 3D printing of whole structures at high speeds.[^(19)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2019/01/30/science.aau7114) As a non-layered approach, it does not require the use of supportive hydrogels (discussed previously) for mechanically weaker biomaterials and should be readily scalable. Thus, further development of stereolithographic techniques may permit their use in the cell-based meat industry. 

**Electrospinning**

[Electrospinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrospinning) is a versatile, low-cost technique where a solution of polymers is passed through a spinneret needle during application of a high electric field. [The electric field causes stretching of the polymer via electrostatic forces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn6r1Ag1npE) until a critical point (i.e. [Taylor cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_cone)) is reached, resulting in the formation of a fiber jet. [As the fiber jet is formed, the solvent evaporates off, and the fiber hardens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlHUVJkDuNo) while it is harvested on an electrostatically-grounded collection device.[^(25)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136970211300196X) The fiber itself can be made from a variety of synthetic and natural polymers, resulting in porous fiber networks with tunable diameters and high surface area. Electrospinning is unique in that it provides the only way to achieve nanoscale biomimicry of the ECM (50 - 500 nm diameter fibers). Of note, cell-laden biomaterials can also be electrosprayed through a similar process that yields droplet deposition rather than fiber deposition,[^(26)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706117306281) although this is less applicable toward scaffold creation. Lastly, similar fiber production methods are possible such as [wet, dry, or melt spinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_(polymers)), which can be used to produce materials such as scaffolds[^(27)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23443534) and hollow fiber membranes[^(28)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037673889400076X) used in bioreactors (discussed in Series II). 

Many of the same considerations and principles previously discussed for biomaterials in hydrogel formation, bioinks, and bioprinting also apply to the creation of electrospun scaffolds. For instance, mechanically weak but biocompatible natural polymers are often combined with synthetic polymers. Identifying rapidly evaporating solvents suitable for composite materials can be challenging, however, and the solvents themselves may be cytotoxic[^(29)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216305890) or damage the native structure of the polymers.[^(30)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la3033258) Similarly to a bioink, alterations in viscosity, solvent surface tension, and flow rate can affect the fiber characteristics, and alterations in the applied voltage and rotating speed, distance, or structure of the collection device can affect resultant scaffold geometries.[^(31)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25619820)^(,)[^(32)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216305890) Unless otherwise intended, electrospun scaffolds will result in a random arrangement of packed fibers, which can limit cell infiltration, migration, or uniform seeding.[^(33)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25619820) Similar methods used for hydrogels, such as inclusion of protease-degradable polymers can assist in better mimicking native ECM for cell infiltration and migration.[^(34)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25799370) Additionally, a variety of methods have been developed in order to produce electrospun scaffolds with defined structure and purpose, including mixed, multilayer, coaxial, and emulsion electrospinning, and microfluidic spinning, discussed below. 

While true biomimicry of the ECM requires nanoscale fibers, the porosity of the scaffold itself, which has a positive linear relationship with fiber diameter, should be on the microscale to permit cell infiltration and perfusion. A fiber network on both nano and microscales can be created via multilayer electrospinning, where different nanofiber and microfiber polymers are electrospun sequentially in layers. Alternatively, mixed electrospinning can be performed where nanofiber and microfiber polymer types are simultaneously electrospun on a collector that permits overlapping collection through lateral movement of the collector.[^(35)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961204001188) These techniques can permit or restrict certain cells from infiltrating a scaffold based on pore size,[^(36)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20188414) which may be leveraged for spatial distribution of cell seeding for cell-based meat. Sacrificial biomaterials such as gelatin can also be used as a polymer to create additional pores upon melting.

In coaxial electrospinning, an inner and outer solution is co-electrospun via independent feeding capillaries, forming a compound Taylor cone. One solution typically contains a hydrophobic polymer and the other contains a biological cargo of interest solubilized with hydrophilic polymers (e.g. dextran), resulting in a core-shell structure due to their [immiscibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscibility), or inability to mix.[^(37)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-6041/8/1/014102) Coaxial electrospun fibers permit trapping of proteins, cells (discussed later), or other biomolecules such that their release kinetics can be varied based on the porosity or biodegradability of the outer shell polymer,[^(38)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20594971) which may serve well for embedding of growth factors for cell-based meat. The viscosity of the solutions, flow rate, and applied electric field strength can all influence the geometry and characteristics of the resultant core-shell fibers. Additionally, multi-layered fibers can be created by co-electrospinning more than 2 solutions.[^(39)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510905) Similar core-shell fibers can be created via emulsion electrospinning where an [emulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion) of oil, water, [surfactant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant), and biomaterial are co-electrospun. During electrospinning, the droplets in the emulsion coalesce due to increased viscosity of the evaporating oil and applied electric field. This process can produce core-shell fibers that can be embedded with growth factors or drugs, which may be leveraged for cell-based meat scaffolding.[^(40)](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/ra/c7ra00179g#!divAbstract) 

Microfluidic spinning relies on differences in a fluids surface tension, energy dissipation, and fluidic resistance to produce a 3D coaxial flow between independent sample and sheath flows.[^(41)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216305890) While similar in principle to coaxial electrospinning, the application of voltage is unnecessary, as the fluidic channel width controls fiber diameter. Thus, microfluidic spinning permits a more favorable environment for natural biomaterials due to the avoidance of harsh solvents. In contrast to electrospinning, microfluidic spinning can more easily achieve uniformity of fiber diameter, as well as tighter control over the shape, porosity, and diameter of the fiber. This allows for simple cell encapsulation, which can assist in cell alignment, proliferation, and growth in a 3D environment, all of which are favorable for cell-based meat production (discussed later). The resultant fibers must be solidified via photopolymerization, crosslinking, or solvent exchange, which somewhat limits the selection of polymers. Nevertheless, easily crosslinked materials such as alginate can be readily used in such a system. 

**Decellularization**

[Decellularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decellularization) is a technique that aims to remove the cells and nucleic acids from a tissue while preserving the native ECM. Thus, the decellularized tissue acts as a scaffold with preserved ultrastructure and similar biophysical and biochemical properties of the original tissue, potentially avoiding previously discussed issues (e.g. porosity, material composition, stiffness, etc) associated with bottom-up approaches. Decellularization has been largely pioneered using animal tissues for the purposes of organ regeneration, however, the technique can also be applied to plant or fungi tissues. As such, it is likely that the knowledge and application of techniques originating from animal tissues could be useful for cell-based meat research and development purposes, while real-world implementation is more likely to utilize plant or fungi tissues. 

Decellularization is performed by deploying chemical, physical, or enzymatic methods. Chemicals such as ionic (e.g. [SDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate)), nonionic (e.g [Triton X-100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_X-100)), or [zwitterionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwitterion) (e.g. [CHAPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAPS_detergent)) [detergents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detergent) can be used as they assist in solubilizing membranes, disrupting DNA-protein and lipid-protein interactions, or protecting a proteins native state, respectively.[^(42)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5592694/) However, the harsh nature of these chemicals leads to their use in low amounts or not at all, if possible, as they inherently will also damage ECM proteins.[^(43)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21417722) In some cases, the use of acids to catalyze [hydrolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis) degradation of macromolecules, or organic solvents and hypotonic solutions to cause cell lysis can assist in decellularization processes. Physical methods such as freezing and thawing, [electroporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation), agitation, and [sonication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonication) can also be applied to assist in cell lysis. Lastly, various enzymes can assist in the decellularization process, including trypsin, dispase, phospholipases, exonucleases, endonucleases, and other proteases, although consideration has to again be paid to balancing the damage done to ECM proteins.[^(44)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550502) As different tissues consist of different cell compositions, sizes, and densities, each decellularization protocol needs to be optimized on a case-by-case basis, and may include one or combinations of the methods described above. 

In general, the decellularization process is a balance between removing cells and nucleic acids and maintaining the integrity of the native ECM. Near complete removal of these components is critical in order to avoid immune responses from the host in the context of organ transplantation. However, this is less of a concern for cell-based meat as the tissue is dead and ingested rather than intended to survive in a host. Interestingly, some evidence suggests that residual antimicrobial peptides persist in some animal ECM scaffolds, which may instead be leveraged to prevent contamination *in vitro*.[^(45)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17518662) In summary, the cell-based meat field can learn from and apply the knowledge gained from decellularization and recellularization processes, discussed below. 

The most applicable decellularization techniques for cell-based meat are perfusion and immersion with agitation. Perfusion is typically used for whole organ decellularization, where native vasculature (typically the main organ artery) is co-opted and used as the plumbing for perfusion of decellularization reagents at physiological pressures. This is often performed in a perfusion bioreactor (discussed in Series II) where the physiological pressure ensures that the tissue is not damaged and that the decellularization reagents can effectively permeate all of the preserved vasculature, including capillaries. For tissues without accessible or large vasculature routes (e.g. skeletal muscle, skin), the tissue can be immersed in decellularization reagents and agitated, assisting in permeation of the tissue via diffusion.[^(46)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702116304278) While immersion methods do not require the need for a specialized bioreactor, they often can result in long exposures to the decellularization reagents and intracellular release of native proteases that can damage the ECM scaffold.[^(47)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550502) 

Decellularization has come of age since the first demonstration of a decellularized rat heart in 2008.[^(48)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1684) Since then, decellularization of large, complex tissues such as human hearts[^(49)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740234/) and limbs[^(50)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5774802/) has been achieved, as well as decellularization of cell-based meat-relevant tissue types such as whole muscles.[^(51)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26963901) Information on the decellularized scaffold can be gleaned from [microCT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_microtomography), [scanning electron microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope), [atomic force microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy), and [immunohistochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry), which yields information about the 3D architecture, biomechanical properties, and composition of the ECM, respectively.[^(52)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702116304278) This information can be leveraged for the recreation of scaffolds for cell-based meat, particularly through characterization of decellularized skeletal muscle[^(53)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264525) and specific cuts of meat. Additionally, the information may be used in bottom-up scaffold approaches such as the creation of CAD models for 3D bioprinting or the solubilization of the native decellularized ECM itself for use in bioinks[^(54)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4935) or electrospinning.[^(55)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00384?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=abseba) 

While decellularization has become relatively straightforward, the recellularization process may require additional optimizations in cell delivery and bioreactor engineering. For recellularization, cells are typically delivered via the vascular perfusion line at or below physiological flow rates over multiple infusions. Physiological flow rates assist in preventing structural damage to the ECM and protecting cells from shear stress, and these techniques have resulted in seeding efficiencies of organ [parenchyma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma) above 90%.[^(56)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23542907) Pre-coating of the scaffold with biomaterials such as chitosan, collagen, gelatin, or RGD peptides can additionally assist in increasing reseeding efficiency.[^(57)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550502) As a tissue is recellularized, flow pressure may need to be dynamically adjusted as porosity becomes limited (due to cell attachment), and monitoring systems may need to be developed for this purpose.[^(58)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18949759) Additionally, the establishment of endothelial cells and vasculature may require pulsatile flow to more accurately mimic the experienced physiological environment of these cell types. However, its uncertain if scaffold endothelialization would be necessary for cell-based meat production.[^(59)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21417722) At least one company in the field [has cited creation of vasculature](https://www.businessinsider.com/aleph-farms-israeli-startup-makes-first-lab-grown-clean-steak-meat-photos-video-2018-12) for their products.  
One of the advantages of using a decellularized animal tissue as a scaffold is that it retains the zip code locations of the native cytoarchitecture encoded via residual embedded growth factors, mechanical properties, and other ECM characteristics previously discussed. Therefore, the process of recellularization is highly self-organized but still commands consideration for a cell populations differentiation state prior to recellularization. All of the starting cell types desirable for cell-based meat production (discussed in Series I) have been utilized for recellularization, including myoblasts,[^(60)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4568187/) mesenchymal stem cells,[^(61)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513465v1) embryonic stem cells,[^(62)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064134) and induced pluripotent stem cells.[^(63)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222839) Indeed, similarly to experiments on hydrogel scaffolds, evidence suggests that recellularization of a decellularized animal tissue scaffold with pluripotent stem cells is sufficient to direct the differentiation toward the native tissue type, increasing expression of relevant cell type markers and functionality versus 2D protocols,[^(64)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222839) as well as assemble native substructures due to local microenvironments.[^(65)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064134#pone.0064134-Brennan1) Likewise, recellularization with multipotent progenitors such as mesenchymal stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived progenitors can be directed into functional tissues made up of a variety of differentiated cell types.[^(66)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513465v1)^(,)[^(67)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00779-y) Successful recellularization (and subsequent functional transplantation) has been performed on tissues as large as adult pig lungs in perfusion bioreactors up to dozens of liters in volume, suggesting that the process is scalable.[^(68)](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/452/eaao3926/tab-pdf) Thus, adoption of learned principles from recellularization or recreation of a decellularized scaffold via methods such as 3D printing with solubilized native ECM[^(69)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961219301863)^(,)[^(70)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201600483) should be highly applicable for cell-based meat research and development. 

Use of decellularized scaffolds from animals has several limitations. For instance, the composition of a decellularized scaffold can vary between individuals and be affected by age and protocol irreproducibility.[^(71)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28222326) Most importantly, however, the supply is limited and thus expensive, and reconstructing an ECM containing up to hundreds of proteins is not feasible.[^(72)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064134) For these reasons, plants have been an attractive alternative for decellularization strategies, as their cell walls are composed of abundant biocompatible polysaccharides such as [cellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose), [pectin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectin), and [hemicellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemicellulose), and native vasculature similar to animals that follows [Murrays Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray%27s_law), allowing perfusion. Indeed, in combination with functionalization methods previously discussed, attachment of mammalian cells onto decellularized plant scaffolds has been demonstrated using a variety of plant stems, leaves, or hypanthium tissues.[^(73)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201601225)^(,)[^(74)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097835) Functionalized plant scaffolds have demonstrated long-term viability and cell proliferation, although differences in native stiffness, hydrophilicity, topography, and pore sizes can influence their success.[^(75)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201601225) The vast variety of plants to choose from may ensure that different tissue architectures (e.g. celery for muscle fibers) can be recapitulated and future [genetic engineering efforts could modify plants to express biocompatible ](https://newfoodeconomy.org/cell-cultured-meat-plant-scaffold/)protein domains (e.g. RGD), as done in silk.[^(76)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26461118) Importantly, construction of [plant scaffolds](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/scientists-are-growing-meat-on-blades-of-grass?utm_source=Facebook%20Videos&amp;utm_medium=Facebook%20Videos&amp;utm_campaign=Facebook%20Video%20Blogs) can be readily scaled simply by using larger or more abundant plant tissues, or processing of raw plant materials to create protein- or cellulose-based scaffolds using previously discussed methods.[^(77)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316787828_Developing_cultured_meat_scaffolds_of_extruded_vegetable-based_proteins) Plant-based materials will likely be significantly more cost-efficient at scale versus their animal ECM counterparts, as the processing and use of abundant raw plant materials such as cellulose for tissue engineering is well characterized.[^(78)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2019.00019/abstract) Similarly, the [use of fungal mycelium](https://ecovativedesign.com/atlast) may serve as a scalable and affordable scaffolding substrate, which may not require decellularization for use. Thus, by borrowing techniques pioneered for human organ generation and leveraging the plant and fungal kingdoms for practicality, use of prefabricated scaffolds by nature may be the most likely to take hold in the cell-based meat industry. 

**Summary of Scaffolds for Cell-based Meat**

Putting this information together, a scaffolding structure for cell-based meat will likely require leveraging multiple aspects of state-of-the-art tissue engineering. A scaffold will likely be composed of cheap, edible or biodegradable biomaterials with high biocompatibility and porosity suitable for cell migration (\~1 - 500m), continuous perfusion, and recycling of cell culture medium (discussed in Series IV) to remove waste and refresh nutrient supply. This may leverage native tissue architecture (e.g. decellularization) or be constructed by design (e.g. 3D printing, electrospinning, core-shell tubes). The scaffold may consist of different composite biomaterials, pre-patterned to recreate the cytoarchitecture of meat, with differing stiffnesses and/or embedded growth factors to assist in the attachment, migration, and maturation of stem cells into their differentiated counterparts. Important considerations should be taken into how a scaffold may integrate and behave in a bioreactor, which may require custom engineering, computational modeling of fluids, and integration of on-line sensors (discussed in Series II). For instance, oxygen and other nutrient mass transfer is likely to change when growing cells on a scaffold versus in suspension.[^(100)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16023202) Existing [bioreactors](http://3dbiotek.com/prod_3dCellExpansionSystem.aspx) for mammalian cell growth may provide some insight into best approaches,[^(101)](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190002815A1/en) as well as learned principles from [solid state fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_fermentation) used in production of fungi or [plant hairy root culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_root_culture) used to produce metabolites or proteins. Additionally, sterilization procedures for scaffolds such as gamma and UV irradiation or ethylene oxide may denature or damage certain biomaterials, thus limiting certain raw material options.[^(102)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27123816) Forward-thinking strategies to address these challenges should be pursued. 

The level of cellular maturation required will likely be dictated by the final products nutritional and textural requirements, and a spectrum of options may be considered in practice. As will be discussed in Series V, its likely that many years will separate the release of unstructured versus structured products as described here due to the difficult nature of the process. Significant challenges will need to be met with new innovations, such as core-shell tubes, to address concerns of scaling, cost, and reproducibility, as current practices in tissue engineering are prohibitively expensive and technically challenging. Despite this, current technologies provide a foundational roadmap for the successful creation of future structured cell-based meat products. Scientists in tissue engineering and cell-based meat should be encouraged to share knowledge and collaborate around shared problems, resulting in mutual positive benefits for each respective field.

    Ive seen plenty shows and stories were everything we things we have now becomes either digital or energy based. Example, money is replaced with credit and bullets are lasers. But the question I have is that will that really happen?

    For the bullets I can see staying even if we eventually develop energy based weapons, bullets are easier to make and when start expanding into space well be able to mine the material from other planets and asteroids. Which can also lead to also making ballistic weapons such as missiles and other bomb type weapons. Energy weapons have limits and would eventually dissipate as well as requiring a lot of energy when in use. 

    But when it comes to money, wouldnt it be easy to keep making physical money rather then making it all digital? If the money is in code then it should be easier to basically copy and past the code to make more. If we keep using physical money then we would need something to make the money. For example, today we use plates that are specifically made to print money and when it comes to the larger bills make water marks that makes it harder to forge.  


    So if anyone can think or explain to me weather or not well be moving into a more sci fi future like in games and movies, or will we still hang onto the old way.",6,1

I've been having this conversation with my friends and want to highlight some of the points of that conversation, because I'm curious to hear other views on the topic.

Have we crossed a rubicon/threshold around the time of Facebook's creation, which is a point of no return such that we are racing towards a future . I imagine it would be some Blade Runner style future where for example you have a digital assistant (think future Siri/Alexa) that is always watching you and can change your whole home based on your mood; it is always following you and provides you information on your environment - which in turn of course means that there is pretty much zero privacy left because the assistant would be present even when masturbating. Publicly displayed advertisements are also tailored to your digital profile which is scannable wherever you move around. Big tech essentially has data on everything about you. Have we crossed the privacy threshold where we are now racing to this future or some other future, which at this point is now unavoidable? And are you guys trusting (1) of the intentions of these companies (not trying to be a conspiracy theorist); and (2) trusting of their ability to execute their intentions?

Have we been complicit in coming to where big data is now? I say we have been complicit by being willing consumers of products, and although PhD Behavioural Psychologists have been given millions of dollars to help design UIs that essentially simulate neurological addiction, we still have the autonomy to engage with these services or not. Although, admittedly, considering their ubiquity, it is becoming increasingly difficult.

My fundamental concern is that big tech/data and GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) are so big now that there's no scope for meaningful competition and that they are essentially a monopoly power. Could you guys maybe give some examples of where monopoly power has yielded net positive outcomes. I would prefer to see these companies being regulated as public utilities and no longer as companies. Naturally regulation stands contrary to innovation.


This call for regulation in my opinion is becoming particularly pronounced because our old friend Facebook is facing almost weekly privacy scandals. Facebook tracks your data even after deactating your account. Facebook has stored user passwords as plain text. My position is that there should be appropriate censure for such behaviour. Storing passwords as plain text is grossly negligent, borderline intentional harm causing behaviour. My friend takes the position that the harm caused by innovation is inconsequential in the long-run as there is still a net positive outcome for humanity (e.g. self-driving cars). While I agree that harm is unavoidable, I do feel that instances like Facebook where harm has negligently been caused, that there should be punishment. The precedent now is congressional hearings which achieve nothing.

Let me know your thoughts. It's been a very engaging topic for me lately.",19,22

because it is really good and can be harmful and many more jobs of humans like content making,

controlling weapons, a fighter plan, making games, making own softwares now common jobs like

factory works, Taxi, food deliver, metro control and etc many things. Ok so if you agree on this that

the whole concept of AI is to make machines do work better than human in less money to make more money

from humans. If machines is going to replace the human then what will human earn? Not everyone has

lands, property or family business,=,

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say it's ok, unemployment will increase and anyways no politician or ""Big leaders"" don't care about it.

In other hands AI is also not Very safe, i am not saying don't make it but what we have in our hands if someone

or they turn themselves against something? Yes very common question but still worthy to discuss unless it's not

only limited to movies. What protection do we have?. Our meme lord, genius Elon musk also said and believes that

.""Artificial intelligence is the biggest existential threat to humanity and in other hands he opening robo taxi

service in coming year, i mean.......! All i am trying to say people are making it and others gonna like it, definitely but

why not some Anti AI some kind of corporation with or like Musk's Open AI? Where are all the saviours?

Ps - By Leaders i mean big businessmen, megaminds like Jeff , Elon.",2,0

But I believe honest people are saying this because they are not aware of other more bottom up options.

Industrial Democracy is a practical ideal which involves the creation and promotion of companies where workers and other stakeholders get to collectively decide (whether by voting, consensus, or advice process) on major decisions such as hiring, firing, work hours, prices, location of factories, waste management etc.

Ultimately, if you are defining the automation problem accurately, it is not robots which are the problem, it is the fact that the decision makers in companies see unemployment (as a result of their layoffs) as an externality, so they are not incentivized to find alternate solutions which avoid sloughing off employees (like reducing work hours and salaries proportionally).

Workers  (or economic)democracy creates that set of motivations and would likely help close the effective demand gap created by automation.",41,3

Based on **psychology and productivity science**, we think all of the ideas from productivity apps is **not deep enough** to help you **schedule your time and work**. Like, you just draw some daily plan, weekly plan relating to your job, your homework and put them on the calendar...Theyre just superficial, short-termed and serious to get started. And more importantly, you finish your day, your week without reviews, without satisfaction, because you have no strong emotion attach to them.

Were developing a new productivity app called BeeSelf - to simplify your life plan with **long-term timeline**: come down from 5 or 10 years - 3 years - 1 year - every single month - weekly - daily plan, with some main features generating from a **firm psychological basis**:

1. **Discover yourself** (with some guideline): know yourself is the best ever step to begin with.
2. **Schedule your long-term and short-term plan** with a questions system - help you get to know about your life orientation, so that you have a clearer vision and stronger correlation between daily - weekly - monthly and annually plans. Thats where most people get stuck, because we keep becoming busy without being efficient and meaningful with your time. Imagine! What if you discover Why you do what you do and How to do it, How they impact your future life much more motivational and responsible, right?
3. **Simplifying the way you plan** \- we bring up the **gamification** on our productivity app (no addiction, for sure, but very interesting and beneficial for real life). We try our best to nail it, because I see most people struggle with following your plan because we don't have the right system and attitude for your daily hurdles and challenges (like Fear, Self - doubt, Failure). With this gamification style, we hope you can keep up with your habit (with habit tracker), overcome most psychological blockages and have the motivation to finish your tasks, your goals on a daily, weekly basis with interesting rewards and progressing bar.
4. **Social support**: upcoming feature (idea is to generate social support for your habit-forming, your life hurdles)

We are wondering whether this idea is interesting and beneficial for you guys? Do you guys have any ideas to improve your dissatisfaction with present productivity apps? Please give us some feedbacks, so that we can have a deeper understanding about your needs, your wants and your thought about planning and this idea as well? Just in the middle of the process, haven't finished MVP, badly need your reviews and comments. Thanks.",8,0

It's hot as balls, the ocean's fucked, the air is fucked, ecosystems across the globe are fucked, etc: we've officially reached the point that Mars is a more appealing place to live than Earth.

Let's also skip the conversation on whether or not Mars actually would be more appealing -- hell, let's pretend it has a magnetic field, is covered with vegetation, atmosphere that's comfortable for humans, etc. A mini Earth. The perfect planet B.

...what now?

We ship off the richest 0.01% that can afford the trip, and leave the rest of us to cook?

...this post is starting to sound grim. Kinda illustrates the importance of keeping Earth habitable I guess.

Question stands though: If and when we do need - not want, but NEED - to ditch Earth... how many people could we actually move? How would those people be selected? Would them leaving make near-apocalyptic-Earth more or less habitable for those left behind?

Someone said it reminded them of moris code.  It moved across the sky to the west much faster than any jet or airplane, but slower than a shooting star.  It took about 30 seconds for the entire line of dots to move beyond the horizon.  We excitedly discussed what it could have been for an hour, none of us convinced it was any of the theories brought up.

For example in a one way street it's illegal for humans to drive in the wrong direction, or to drive backwards, because they increase the chance of an accident, and it can create chaos with the cars behind. It's a common issue if there is a road block, and the first car has to communicate with every car behind that they all need to reverse because going forward is not an option.

However with self driving cars being able to communicate and network flawlessly, they could drive the wrong direction or backwards, and do it perfectly safely, with minimal hindrance to other vehicles. Those other vehicles would communicate their position and intent, waiting for the ghost driver to pass, making space. In addition SDCs would take up a fraction of the parking space, meaning you'd have more room in a one way street to drive in both directions.

This is another example of how SDCs would transform the way we move around, in ways a human couldn't even imagine. They could change the rules of the road in the blink of an eye, perfectly safe, and optimize traffic in ways humans could never do (safely).",23,9

one of the biggest advantages AI bring is to reduce what would normally involve a team of dozen or more people working for large sums of money to a program working for free, now obviously this is bad for people who did those jobs in the past but pretty good for people who want to make high quality art but can't afford a team the size of game of thrones to do it. for this i will break it out into different entertainment domains and explain how AI can be used to make development cheaper and more accessable to the average person. for the most part i will be refering to GANs, Generative Adversarial Networks, a kind of neural network which consists of a generator and a discriminator paired against each other, one tries to create something, the other tries to see if it's fake, training is done when the discriminator can't tell if the image is real or fake, each network reinforces the other. i also mention a conditional GAN, which is a type of GAN which takes some set of conditions in order to generate (as well as taking some random data)  

##Gaming##  

Imagine you want to create a video game, let's say it's an open world set in a fictional city. doing it today you would need to generate a map, and you would have to think up a map, and you would probably just copy and existing map, instead you can have an AI which is trained on a large number of maps of cities large and small, and you give it a condition (so this would be a conditional GAN) that it should be a large city, bordering a lake, near a mountain range. and it would generate a map, and a semantic map which will be useful for rendering. an example of something like this would be [AttnGan, images generated from a description](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10485.pdf) but that is just one example of a conditional GAN. now we have a map with semantic information (roads, buildings, trees, ground, mountains, lake, etc) now, we can generate some people. the way we would usually use is to make models that can be customized by a series of parameters, generate random parameters to make random people. it's ok but it gives you a lot of very samey looking people, instead let's just generate the people using a GAN, many here are familiar with [thispersondoesnotexist](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/) which can generate faces, but you can also use an AI to [Generate full bodies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8siezzLXbNo) and pose them. so we can generate an entire crowd without them all looking samey, each is generated with some random vector based on real people, they will not only look realistic they will be unique. 

ok, but how do we make use of this, GANs make video and pictures, but how will we play this game? [with an AI renderer of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayPqjPekn7g) that is something created by nvidia which allows for interactive movement through an AI rendered world, what you need is semantic information about the world (which we generated above) and a training set for cityscapes (though we will want to cover more than just cityscapes in our training set) the AI will generate the appropriate view of the world based on the semantic information, change the information, change the view. now our game doesn't need high resolution models, doesn't need models exactly just semantic information placed in a given space within the map.

so what about our other elements, like physics calculations [don't calculate, estimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOWamCtnwTc) this gives physics effects as good as some of the best calculations in a fraction of the time, and this is nice no mater what rendering technique you are using. so now you have generated your map, you have generated your people, what about our buildings? they were generated via the map, but wouldn't it be nice if you could go in every building? in a normal game that would be prohibitively expensive, but for this it's just a matter of generating the internal layout of the building, again we feed an AI layouts for various kinds of buildings, and have it generate an appropriate layout for every building in the map. now let's say i want to add something to one of these buildings, i use a conditional GAN as before i say i want a table, a fancy table, with a table cloth, cadelebras and an assortment of food. be kinda like [that holodeck scene in st:tng schisms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoMeeIpIbOs) ignore the music added by the uploader, this was the best clip i could find. this is a particularly good scene though as it shows the process of creating a simulation in the holodeck, or A process, we often see them typing into a console as well.

but this, i think, is where game development could lead, in the near future, instead of creating the model by hand you ask the computer for a model, and you refine it as you go, the AI creates what it imagines given what you have asked of it, you say ""i want a table"" it creates what it imagines a table (just as if i asked you to imagine a table, an image would come to your mind, it might be wood with 4 legs, or it might be metal and folding, it might be ornate or plain, it depends on your particular idea of what a table is. but if i say a long table, you will imagine something for a feast probably made of wood, if i say it is ornate you might imagine it with carvings and bits of precious metals, but all i need to do is give you a description, but unlike a conversation between you and me, the computer can create what it imagines, like an artist can. then it becomes something like creating a sketch of a suspect with a sketch artist. or indeed working to create concept art with an artist)

so, you have added your table, or any other elements you want to add, what if you want something fantastical, something which doesn't exist, something with NO training information available. for this thing you can create it, by whatever means you are best at. maybe you would rather create it with paper mache, or forge it out by hand, or use whatever practical effects to create it in the real world and use images of it to train the AI, or you might create it digitally and use expensive rendering techniques not available for real time gaming to make incredibly realistic renders to train the AI, or maybe you like to make a model of it, print it out on a 3d printer, paint it, and take pictures for the training, however you like is up to you. or maybe you make a drawing of it, [and the AI does the work for you](https://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/index.html) provided it's somewhat like something else.

so, you've made your world, you've populated it, you've put in hand placed objects of your liking, most the hard work is done, all that's left is to make your story, and for that i'm afraid, AI will probably be of little help...for now.

##movies##

many of the things above apply as much to movies as to games, and much of movies will depend on good directors, good actors, and good cinematography. however let's imagine another senario, one where you, some time in the not too distant future, when GRRM has finished a song of ice and fire want to remake the last season to better match the movies. but the actors are all old now, being like 30 years in the future, and you can't really get the folks together to redo it, so you train an AI to recognize all of westeros seen in the show thus far, you train for the actors, you train for their voices, and you get to work with a dedicated community to recreate the ending entirely in CG. the AI knows how dragons look and how they move,how the actors look, how they do certain things, how they sound and how they talk and how they emote, so you may even be able to, by this time, give a script to the AI detailing what actors do what and it generates the set, actors, action, and special effects. then you need to move the camera around the space it generates to get the best shot of it.

now of course all these technologies are still in their infancy, it will take quite some time before they are ready for the everyday user, or even for commercial use, but the technology is getting better and faster, we have gone from deep fakes needing hundred of shots to [just one](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qv7zkw/create-fake-videos-of-faces-samsung-ai-labs-algorithm), and while most of these focus on realism, the same techniques are applicable to anime, such as [thiswaifudoesnotexist](https://www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net/) and while i focused on AI based rendering, which i consider pretty cool, AI can be used in ray tracing to improve the speed of the tracing, animation, and fluid simulations. also [An AI can create a 3D model of a personfrom just a few seconds of video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPOawky2eNk) the model you can see isn't the best of quality, but it is a start. and all these things will get better and better, and yes this DOES mean it will get harder and harder to tell reality from fiction, but that's what we've been trying to do for the past nearly 100 years, and when we are finally nearing the point it's possible people are pissing their pants about it.

and let's be clear on that issue, they said the same thing about movies, and about television, and about video games, and about virtual reality, and about photoshop and airbrushing and CGI, all of these things have made fiction a little more like real life, it's not that easy to tell the dragon isn't real in Game of Throne, except that dragons aren't real.

instead of living in fear of what might be, let's imagine what COULD be, let's consider how AI will be able to serve as an extension of our creative ability, while i mentioned entertainment there are many other applications for GANs go beyond that, a GAN could generate new designs for a car, new parts, new clothes or new designs for...really anything. and the things it generates could be printed out with a 3d printer. so even your average joe might tell their computer they want, say, a cup shaped like mickey mouse. it generates a series of models and he picks the one he likes the best, it generates a number of other kinda like that one, this continues til he accepts one to print, then it prints out his cup. 

really what AI means is every person on earth can have the resources of a multi-million dollar company. AI can do research and development, product testing, design, things that normally require teams and a TON of money, could be at the hands of anyone with a computer. and what these people will create is far more interesting than how it could be misused.",4,2

2263,2019-5-27,2019,5,27,21,btlcm2,What expert research says about Machine Learning,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/btlcm2/what_expert_research_says_about_machine_learning/,ajayoutlook,1558959387,"Machine learning is a field of study which creates an ability in the computers to learn without being precisely programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence which enables the computers capability to learn without being detailed programmed and enables them to perform the task intelligently. A complex data process is carried out machine learning by learning from data, instead of following of getting into pre-programmed rules.

Determining and properly understanding the structure and patterns hidden in the data is the main purpose and aim of machine learning. It is largely based on the ability of the computers to go deeper extract the available data even in the absence of a theory of the data structure.

Experts Insights says that machine learning became very famous in the 90s. Machine learning term was coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959 at IBM, who was an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. In 1989, the commercialization of machine learning on personal computers was done. In 2002, Torch, a software library of machine learning was released.

The scenarios are usually the same, robots are taking over and it will either be a dystopia where there is massive inequality between rich and poor, or another dystopia where robots will rebel and kill us all, or an utopia where there is zero proverty and all humans live on unimaginable level of standards of living.

&amp;#x200B;

But I think all three scenarios are unlikely compared to the scenario where the goverment which will simply get rid humans once they become redundent. I recommend you see the video below:-

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs&amp;t=135s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs&amp;t=135s) 

In this video , rules for rulers, CGP Grey explains the motives behind all decisions made by the goverment. In summary, the more the goverment's income depends on the people, the more democratic and free it is. The less the goverment's income depends on the people and the more on natural resources, the more repressive and undemocratic it is. Decisions made by rulers has nothing to do with morality, its all about staying in power.

&amp;#x200B;

Now imagine that robots take all our jobs, this means that the goverment's income is not dependent on the people. Then what is the point of keeping them? After all they just waste the ruler's resources and are a major threat to their power. Getting rid of the pointless eaters is just commen sense for them. If one ruler is unwilling to get rid of the people, then another psychopathic ruler will probably be willing to take his place and do so, just so he could have a life of infinite luxury. Add on to that, using AI and robots, the goverment will have unimaginable power. They could use their AI survaillence system to take down rebellion before the even started. Or they could use robot police and military robots to take down even the largest rebel army. Nothing will stand in their way.

&amp;#x200B;

There is another very nice video from CGP Grey about what AI will be capable of in the future :- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)  Humans need not apply. This video shows that robots will eventually take ALL jobs and we will have to deal with this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the scenario I am talking about is the most likely to happen. 2 of the 3 scenarios have some sort of stupidity in them. Firstly,  a future where the few rich who own all the robots make all the money while the rest get nothing is unlikely because 1) There will be a lot of protests from the general population 2) The goverment won't just stare at rich people who are making enormous amounts of money while all they get is just a bunch of lobbying money. They are going to take all their wealth away in the name of equality of course. Secondly, a future where the goverment just pays us a universal basic income is unlikely too because of the reasons have I mentioned before. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I want speak against some reasons why the future I am suggesting is unlikely. 

1) We can just replace the goverment with robots.

I say good luck convincing rulers about that idea. They will probably try to defend themselves against the populace saying that a robot has ""no heart or morals"" or other BS like that.

2) Democracy will protect us.

It won't protect us forever. We might be able to use robots to glue our leaders to the constitution. We may even be able to convince leaders of democratic nations to do this, since they will see it as a way to stay in keep democracy and thus themselves in power. But it will only take a single person's act to end humantiy. Can you assume that won't happen in a thausand years? It only takes a single event for a person to take power and make the decision.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the only 2 reasons I can think of. I want to see what you guys think about this, and maybe come up with a solution. Luckly for us it maybe be a century before robots take 100% of our jobs. In the meantime, I see that there will be a period of large amount of prosperity,peace, freedom and democracy as rulers liberalize in order to get more people to get more skilled jobs. Since robots won't be replacing these for a while. Technologies like the blockchain might improve privacy despite the advance in AI surveillance technology. Natural resources will no longer provide as much income, since other energy sources will replace oil and gas, and other types of natural resources will have their price be reduced to nothing as space industries grow. So rulers will increasingly depend on people for income. Moreover, wars will become too costly as military technology develops, and more pointless as there will be a near-infinite amount of resources in space. Sure, there will be many other problems such as global warming, a water crisis ect... But still, it will definitely be a prosperous time indeed.",24,20

We are a team of people trying to make space exploration a little bit more accessible for the common folk.  


Long story short, becoming an astronaut, aerospace engineer, or space entrepreneur takes a lot of time and money. Only very few people are  able to jump through all the hoops and make required efforts to get into the space industry in any form. Most of us can just watch other  people's achievement or play Kerbal Space Program. While it is definitely fun to do so, don't you wish sometimes to try the real thing?  


Space is so hard, partly because it is so expensive to launch anything in orbit. Even the smallest cubesat, a 10x10x10cm 1-kg class satellite takes  years of time to build and around $100,000 in total costs.  


But one thing - software weighs absolutely nothing! So, once you have something in orbit - the cost to upload the software is a lot less than launching anything physical.   


So, our idea is to put a small satellite (cubesat) in orbit, with a public-accessible on-board  computer, where everyone can upload and run their own mission software, effectively piloting a real spacecraft for some time (1 or more orbits). You would be able to operate the satellite payload instruments and subsystems, learn the specifics of space mission operation and software development skills for the space environment.   
 

 What do you think of this idea?",5,2

Do you think it will become possible to create opposite sex clones in the future? A male clone from a woman or a female clone from a man?

I think it will become possible. To create a female clone from a man you could take his cells and turn off the Androgen receptor genes. So the person will develop as female and will have Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.

To create a male clone from a woman it would be needed to take her cells and add/create the sry system genes and put them into the XX chromossome. So there will be a male clone from a woman.

Remembering that there are women who are born with XY chromossomes and men who are born with XX chromossomes. I think I have XY chromossomes since I\`m a guy.

If I cloned myself and I choose my clone to be a girl, would she be my daughter technically and legally speaking? What if I raise her considering if she is born as a baby like all humans? And what if my clone is vatgrown in the laboratory cell by cell and is created in adult form?",10,1

I am working for a small SaaS Company and we try to decrease our CO2 Output while also ""negating"" the emission we can not decrease through donating to projects like [cooleffect.org](https://cooleffect.org) . We are using a bunch of tools like Slack, 1Password, Hubspot and Co, so my question is: Has anyone experience with getting a rough estimate of how much CO2 is created through using third party tools? I know that the estimation would be very rough but we are just looking for some kind of number we can work with.

Best wishes,
