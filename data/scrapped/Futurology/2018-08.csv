How can you manage something that doesn't exist? You cannot touch, measure, weigh, or count the future. So, you cannot manage it either?
We can only manage the future in our heads, because that is the only place where it exists. Our assumptions, opportunities, hopes, fears, goals, and plans reside in our minds.

It is the mind that creates the body, Friedrich Schiller wrote in Wallenstein. What starts as the future in our minds will become our reality tomorrow.

Your business, your success, and your balance sheet today has been generated years ago by your strategy, which was based on your assumptions of the future and on your perception of your opportunities back then.

What you assume, perceive, decide, and do about the future today determines the quality of your future present.
Your knowledge about the future can be broadened, enriched, solidified, and made more effective - to ensure that you will decide, shape, and act in more future smart ways.

This is what we call future management: Handling the future that resides in your mind and in the minds of your employees professionally, so that your future and hence your future present will be bright.

But I think for different - or even opposite - reasons.   


Most people who criticize the let's call it ""/r/Futurology culture"" criticize it on the basis of ""those things will never happen or they will happen in a thousand years... flying cars, radical life extension, automation, abundance - no way, not in our lifetimes.""  


I heard this criticism a lot. They basically think y'all are fantasists living a dreamland.  


While I agree that it's suspicious how futurologists are hoping to see all their ""human, all too human"" hopes fulfilled (like Kurzweil wanting to revive his father), my criticism is different. I think that the critics really *do not understand the impact of acceleration.* I agree on this point  with the Singularitarians. Things will start accelerating like hell, probably in the next decade (2020s).   


However, this is also *exactly why* I do not believe we will ever see the ""paradise"" as dreamed up by futurologists, simply because of that same acceleration. In other words, things will start progressing so fast that it won't be possible to enjoy in that stage that is our fantasy. The perfect stage for humans, let's half ironically call it ""Fully Automated Luxury Communism"", will last only for a month, a week, an hour, who knows. Perfect life for us: all automated, immersive VR full of enjoyment, medicine repairing all illnesses, etc. - but that stage will be so transitional, it will so quickly pass into something else, that there will simply be no time to enjoy it. *Assuming that such a stage will exist,* it will take no time to go from that, to fully autonomous ASI, and then to superintelligence incomprehensible to humans.  


So I think what we humans dream of is some impossible ""stage"" ... a sweet spot *before* the singularity, but *after* our current state - a sweet spot where technology works all for us and is still comprehensible and all adheres to our human mores. I think though, even if such a stage were to exist, it will almost *immediately* progress into the next stage which will be incomprehensible to us. (Either we will 'fuse' with it, a la Musk, brain interface etc; or it will escape from us, as in the movie Her.)  


I think that movie (Her) does a great job at showing that ""threat"". That is the most realistic threat that really frightens me. Namely, that we will be able to enjoy the ""benefit"" of AI only for a short moment of time before it ""escapes us""...  


The fantasy is, I think, that all will be ""frozen"" forever in that sweet spot... but it won't, and things will move quickly, and maybe move to a direction that is not human-centric...   


Apologies for the verbosity, I hope this made some sense.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I have been reading lately about digital immortality and I am at the bench. As no one has done it yet, although it may be possible in the future, I do not know if I would jump into it without hearing from others about their experiences about it.

In my local reality of Portugal rarely do people in state services used freeware for specialised activities, let alone state-funded software (very rare to begin with). I'm pretty sure that these private enterprises have access to vital information used by the state to regulate citizens' lives as a result. They already know much, and ""knowledge is power"", as they say.  


Nation-States do show these multinationals who's in command when they violate privacy laws with gargantuan fines and tight regulations. States will react readily to any violation of their ""monopoly of violence"" over its citizens (eg. if Microsoft sent ""loaded"" drones to kill people who ignored its terms and conditions). After all, the state survives only to maintain an order and without the monopoly of violence it cannot achieve this goal.  


But say... some tech group finds a way of getting a fully functional A.I. lawyer. There is no law that does not contain loop-holes, and if suddenly anyone finds a way of making the perfect defence, for any legal case, democratic AND free, then things might get interesting.  


If a multinational freely shifts the law to its interests then the colonising of the nation-state is complete. Either the law will become transparent and democratic or citizens will become propriety of share-holders.

These are all of mid-90s Ray Kurzweil's predictions for 2009, dating back to *The Age of Spiritual Machines*. It's almost uncanny how precise he was so long as you shift the accuracy by a decade. I'd say roughly 95% of his predictions accurately called the present day. Funnily enough, the ones that missed the mark were the ones he himself said were wrong. His main problem was trying to predict the consumer success of various technologies.

Also, don't be ultra-pedantic about some wording, like 'portable computer'. Remember that he wrote all this in the mid-90s before terms like 'smartphone' and 'Cloud' were common or even coined.

1. Individuals primarily use portable computers.
1. Portable computers will have become dramatically lighter and thinner than the notebook computers of ten years earlier.
1. Personal computers are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes, and are commonly embedded in clothing and jewelry such as wristwatches, rings, earrings and other body ornaments.
1. Computers with a high-resolution visual interface range from rings and pins and credit cards up to the size of a thin book.
1. People typically have at least a dozen computers on and around their bodies, which are networked using body LANs (local area networks).
1. For the most part, these truly personal computers have no moving parts. Memory is completely electronic.
1. Most portable computers do not have keyboards.
1. Most users have servers in their homes and offices where they keep large stores of digital objects, including their software, databases, documents, music, and movies.
1. Digital objects such as books, music albums, movies, and software are rapidly distributed as data files through the wireless network, and typically do not have a physical object associated with them.
1. Most users have servers where they keep digital objects such as virtual reality environments (although these are still at an early stage).
1. There are services to keep ones digital objects in central repositories, but most people prefer to keep their private information under their own physical control.
1. Cables are disappearing. Communication between components, such as pointing devices, microphones, displays, printers, and the occasional keyboard uses short-distance wireless technology.
1. Computers routinely include wireless technology to plug into the ever-present worldwide network, providing reliable, instantly available, very high bandwidth communication.
1. The majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition (CSR) dictation software, but keyboards are still used. CSR is very accurate, far more so than the human transcriptionists who were used up until a few years ago.
1. Also ubiquitous are language user interfaces (LUIs), which combine continuous speech recognition (CSR) and natural language understanding. For routine matters, such as simple business transactions and information inquiries, LUIs are quite responsive and precise. They tend to be narrowly focused, however, on specific types of tasks. LUIs are frequently combined with animated personalities. Interacting with an animated personality to conduct a purchase or make a reservation is like talking to a person using videoconferencing, except that the person is simulated.
1. Computer displays have all the display qualities of paper  high resolution, high contrast, large viewing angle, and no flicker. Books, magazines, and newspapers are now routinely read on displays that are the size of, well, small books.
1. Computer displays built into eyeglasses are also used. These specialized glasses allow users to see the normal visual environment, while creating a virtual image that appears to hover in front of the viewer. The virtual images are created by a tiny laser built into the glasses that projects the images directly onto the users retinas.
1. Computers routinely include moving picture image cameras and are able to reliably identify their owners from their faces.
1. In terms of circuitry, three-dimensional chips are commonly used, and there is a transition taking place from the older single-layer chips.
1. Sound producing speakers are being replaced with very small chip-based devices that can place high-resolution sound anywhere in three-dimensional space. This technology is based on creating audible frequency sounds from the spectrum created by the interaction of very high frequency tones. As a result, very small speakers can create very robust three-dimensional sound.
1. A $1,000 personal computer can perform about a trillion calculations per second.
1. Supercomputers match at least the hardware capacity of the human brain  20 million billion calculations per second (20 petaflops).
1. Unused computes on the Internet are being harvested, creating virtual parallel supercomputers with human brain hardware capacity.
1. There is increasing interest in massively parallel neural nets, genetic algorithms and other forms of chaotic or complexity theory computing, although most computer computations are still done using conventional sequential processing, albeit with some limited parallel processing.
1. Autonomous nanoengineered machines (i.e., machines constructed atom by atom and molecule by molecule) have been demonstrated and include their own computational controls. However, nanoengineering is not yet considered a practical technology.
1. Research has been initiated on reverse-engineering the human brain through both destructive scans of the brains of recently deceased persons as well as noninvasive scans using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of living persons and animals.
1. In the twentieth century, computers in schools were mostly on the trailing edge, with most effective learning from computers taking place in the home. Now in 2019, while schools are still not on the cutting edge, the profound importance of the computer as a knowledge tool is widely recognized.
1. Computers play a central role in all facets of education, as they do in other spheres of life.
1. The majority of reading is done on displays, although the installed base of paper documents is still formidable.
1. The generation of paper documents is dwindling, as the books and other papers of largely twentieth-century vintage are being rapidly scanned and stored.
1. Documents, circa 2019, routinely include embedded moving images and sounds.
1. Students of all ages typically have a computer of their own, which is a thin tablet-like device weighing under a pound with a very high-resolution display suitable for reading.
1. Students interact with their computers primarily by voice and by pointing with a device that looks like a pencil.
1. Keyboards still exist, but most textual language is created by speaking.
1. Learning materials are accessed through wireless communication.
1. Intelligent courseware has emerged as a common means of learning.
1. Recent controversial studies have shown that students can learn basic skills such as reading and math just as readily with interactive learning software as with human teachers, particularly when the ratio of students to human teachers is more than one to one. Although the studies have come under attack, most students and their parents have accepted this notion for years.
1. The traditional mode of a human teacher instructing a group of children is still prevalent, but schools are increasingly relying on software approaches, leaving human teachers to attend primarily to issues of motivation, psychological well-being, and socialization.
1. Many children learn to read on their own using their personal computers before entering grade school.
1. Preschool and elementary school children routinely read at their intellectual level using print-to-speech reading software until their reading skill level catches up.
1. These print-to-speech reading systems display the full image of documents, and can read the print aloud while highlighting what is being read.
1. Synthetic voices sound fully human.
1. Although some educators expressed concern in the early 00 years that students would rely unduly on reading software, such systems have been readily accepted by children and their parents.
1. Studies have shown that students improve their reading skills by being exposed to synchronized visual and auditory presentations of text.
1. Learning at a distance (e.g., lectures and seminars in which the participants are geographically scattered) is commonplace.
1. Learning is becoming a significant portion of most jobs.
1. Training and developing new skills is emerging as an ongoing responsibility in most careers, not just an occasional supplement, as the level of skill needed for meaningful employment soars ever higher.
1. Persons with disabilities are rapidly overcoming their handicaps through the intelligent technology of 2019.
1. Students with reading disabilities routinely ameliorate their disability using print-to-speech reading systems.
1. Print-to-speech reading machines for the blind are now very small, inexpensive, palm-sized devices that can read books (those that still exist in paper form) and other printed documents, and other real-world text such as signs and displays.
1. These reading systems are equally adept at reading the trillions of electronic documents that are instantly available from the ubiquitous wireless worldwide network.
1. After decades of ineffective attempts, useful navigation devices have been introduced that can assist blind people in avoiding physical obstacles in their path, and finding their way around, using global positioning system (GPS) technology.
1. A blind person can interact with her personal reading-navigation systems through voice communication, kind of like a Seeing Eye dog that reads and talks.
1. Deaf persons  or anyone with a hearing impairment  commonly use portable speech-to-text listening machines, which display a real-time transcription of what people are saying. The deaf user has the choice of either reading the transcribed speech as displayed text, or watching an animated person gesturing in sign language. These have eliminated the primary communication handicap associated with deafness.
1. Listening machines can also translate what is being said into another language in real time, so they are commonly used by hearing people as well.
1. Computer-controlled orthotic devices have been introduced. These walking machines enable paraplegic persons to walk and climb stairs. The prosthetic devices are not yet usable by all paraplegic persons, as many physically disabled persons have dysfunctional joints from years of disuse. However, the advent of orthotic walking systems is providing more motivation to have these joints replaced.
1. There is a growing perception that the primary disabilities of blindness, deafness, and physical impairment do not necessarily impart handicaps. Disabled persons routinely describe their disabilities as mere inconveniences. Intelligent technology has become the great leveler.
1. Translating telephone technology (where you speak in English and your Japanese friend hears you in Japanese, and vice versa) is commonly used for many language pairs. It is a routine capability of an individuals personal computer.
1. which also serves as her phone.
1. Telephone communication is primarily wireless.
1. and routinely includes high-resolution moving images.
1. Meetings of all kinds and sizes routinely take place among geographically separated participants.
1. There is effective convergence, at least on the hardware and supporting software level, of all media, which exist as digital objects (i.e., files).
1. distributed by the ever-present, high-bandwidth, wireless information web.
1. Users can instantly download books, magazines, newspapers, television, radio, movies, and other forms of software to their highly portable personal communication devices.
1. Virtually all communication is digital and encrypted
1. with keys available to government authorities.
1. Many individuals and groups, including but not limited to criminal organizations, use an additional layer of virtually unbreakable encryption codes with no third party keys.
1. Haptic technologies are emerging that allow people to touch and feel objects and other persons at a distance.
1. These force feedback devices are widely used in games and in training simulation systems.
1. Interactive games routinely include all-encompassing visual and auditory environments
1. but a satisfactory, all-encompassing tactile environment is not yet available.
1. The online chat rooms of the late 1990s have been replaced with virtual environments where you can meet people with full visual realism.
1. People have sexual experiences at a distance with other persons as well as virtual partners.
1. But the lack of the surround tactile environment has thus far kept virtual sex out of the mainstream.
1. Virtual partners are popular as forms of sexual entertainment, but they are more game-like than real.
1. And phone sex is a lot more popular now that phones routinely include high resolution real-time moving images of the person on the other end.
1. Despite occasional corrections, the ten years leading up to 2019 have seen continuous economic expansion and prosperity due to the dominance of the knowledge content of products and services.
1. The greatest gains continue to be in the value of the stock market
1. Price deflation concerned economists in the early 00 years, but they quickly realized it was a good thing. The high tech community pointed out that significant deflation had existed in the computer hardware and software industries for many years earlier without detriment.
1. The United States continues to be the economic leader due to its primacy in popular culture and its entrepreneurial environment.
1. Since information markets are largely world markets, the U.S. has benefited greatly from its immigrant history. Being comprised of all the worlds peoples  specifically, the descendants of peoples from around the globe who had endured great risk for a better life  it has the ideal heritage for the new knowledge-based economy.
1. China has also emerged as a powerful economic player.
1. Europe has been somewhat quicker than Japan and Korea in adopting the American emphasis on venture capital, employee stock options, and tax policies that encourage entrepreneurship, although these practices have become popular throughout the world.
1. At least half of all transactions are conducted on-line.
1. Intelligent assistants which combine continuous speech recognition, natural language understanding, problem solving, and animated personalities routinely assist with finding information, answering questions and conducting transactions. Intelligent assistants have become a primary interface for interacting with information-based services, with a wide range of choices available. A recent poll shows that both male and female users prefer female personalities for their computer-based intelligent assistants. The two most popular are Maggie, who claims to be a waitress in a Harvard Square caf, and Michelle, a stripper from New Orleans. Personality designers are in demand, and the field constitutes a growth area in software development.
1. Most purchases of books, musical albums, videos, games and other forms of software do not involve any physical object, so new business models for distributing these forms of information have emerged.
1. One shops for these information objects by strolling through virtual malls, sampling and selecting objects of interest, rapidly (and securely) conducting an on-line transaction, and then quickly downloading the information using high-speed wireless  communication.
1. There are many types and gradations of transactions to gain access to these products. You can buy a book, musical album, video, etc. which gives you unlimited permanent access.
1. Alternatively, you can rent access to read, view, or listen once, or a few times. Or you can rent access by the minute.
1. Access may be limited to one person or to a group of persons (for example, a family or a company). Alternatively, access may be limited to a particular computer, or to any computer accessed by a particular person or by a set of persons.
1. There is a strong trend towards the geographic separation of work groups. People are successfully working together despite living and working in different places.
1. The average household has more than a hundred computers, most of which are embedded in appliances and built-in communication systems.
1. Household robots have emerged, but are not yet fully accepted.
1. Intelligent roads are in use, primarily for long-distance travel. Once your cars computer guidance system locks onto the control sensors on one of these highways, you can sit back and relax. Local roads, though, are still predominantly conventional. [Hilariously, Kurzweil himself says this isn't just wrong but ""ten years off"". Let's wait and see what 2029 will bring us!]
1. A company west of the Mississippi and north of the Mason-Dixon Line has surpassed a trillion dollars in market capitalization.
1. Privacy has emerged as a primary political issue. The virtually constant use of electronic communication technologies is leaving a highly detailed trail of every persons every move.
1. Litigation, of which there has been a great deal, has placed some constraints on the widespread distribution of personal data.
1. Government agencies, however, continue to have the right to gain access to peoples files
1. which has resulted in the popularity of unbreakable encryption technologies.
1. There is a growing neo-Luddite movement, as the skill ladder continues to accelerate upwards.
1. As with earlier Luddite movements, its influence is limited by the level of prosperity made possible by new technology.
1. The movement does succeed in establishing continuing education as a primary right associated with employment.
1. There is continuing concern with an underclass that the skill ladder has left far behind. The size of the underclass appears to be stable, however.
1. Although not politically popular, the underclass is politically neutralized through public assistance and the generally high level of affluence.
1. The high quality of computer screens, and the facilities of computer-assisted visual rendering software, have made the computer screen a medium of choice for visual art.
1. Most visual art is the result of collaboration between human artists and their intelligent art software.
1. Virtual paintings  high-resolution, wall-hung displays  have become popular. Rather than always displaying the same work of art, as with a conventional painting or poster, these virtual paintings can change the displayed work at the users verbal command, or can cycle through collections of art. The displayed artwork can be works by human artists or original art created in real time by cybernetic art software.
1. Human musicians routinely jam with cybernetic musicians.
1. The creation of music has become available to persons who are not musicians.
1. Creating music does not necessarily require the fine motor coordination of using traditional controllers.
1. Cybernetic music creation systems allow people who appreciate music but who are not knowledgeable about music theory and practice to create music in collaboration with their automatic composition software.
1. Interactive brain-generated music, which creates a resonance between the users brainwaves and the music being listened to, is another popular genre.
1. Musicians commonly use electronic controllers which emulate the playing style of the old acoustic instruments (e.g., piano, guitar, violin, drums).
1. but there is a surge of interest in the new air controllers in which you create music by moving your hands, feet, mouth and other body parts.
1. Other music controllers involve interacting with specially designed devices.
1. Writers use voice-activated word processing
1. Grammar checkers are now actually useful.
1. Distribution of written documents from articles to books typically does not involve paper and ink.
1. Style improvement and automatic editing software is widely used to improve the quality of writing.
1. Language translation software is also widely used to translate written works in a variety of languages.
1. Nonetheless, the core process of creating written language is less affected by intelligent software technologies than the visual and musical arts. However, cybernetic authors are emerging.
1. Beyond music recordings, images, and movie videos, the most popular type of digital entertainment object is virtual experience software. These interactive virtual environments allow you to go whitewater rafting on virtual rivers, to hang glide in a virtual Grand Canyon, or to engage in intimate encounters with your favorite movie star.
1. Users also experience fantasy environments with no counterpart in the physical world.
1. The visual and auditory experience of virtual reality is compelling, but tactile interaction is still limited.
1. The security of computation and communication is the primary focus of the U.S. Department of Defense. There is general recognition that the side that can maintain the integrity of its computational resources will dominate the battlefield.
1. Humans are generally far removed from the scene of battle.
1. Warfare is dominated by unmanned intelligent airborne devices.
1. Many of these flying weapons are the size of small birds, or smaller.
1. The U.S. continues to be the worlds dominant military power, which is largely accepted by the rest of the world, as most countries concentrate on economic competition.
1. Military conflicts between nations are rare, and most conflicts are between nations and smaller bands of terrorists.
1. The greatest threat to national security comes from bioengineered weapons.
1. Bioengineered treatments have reduced the toll from cancer, heart disease, and a variety of other health problems.
1. Significant progress is being made in understanding the information processing basis of disease.
1. Telemedicine is widely used. Physicians can examine patients using visual, auditory and haptic examination from a distance. Health clinics with relatively inexpensive equipment and a single technician bring health care to remote areas where doctors had previously been scarce.
1. Computer-based pattern recognition is routinely used to interpret imaging data and other diagnostic procedures.
1. The use of noninvasive imaging technologies has substantially increased.
1. Diagnosis almost always involves collaboration between a human physician and a pattern recognition-based expert system.
1. Doctors routinely consult knowledge-based systems (generally through two-way voice communication augmented by visual displays), which provide automated guidance, access to the most recent medical research, and practice guidelines.
1. Lifetime patient records are maintained in computer databases.
1. Privacy issues concerning access to these records (as with many other data bases of personal information) have emerged as a major issue.
1. Doctors routinely train in virtual reality environments, which include a haptic interface. These systems simulate the visual,  auditory and tactile experience of medical procedures, including surgery.
1. Simulated patients are available for continuing medical education, for medical students, and for people who just want to play doctor.
1. There is renewed interest in the Turing test, first proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 as a means for testing intelligence in a machine. Recall that the Turing test contemplates a situation in which a human judge interviews the computer and a human foil, communicating with both over terminal lines. If the human judge is unable to tell which interviewee is human and which is machine, the machine is deemed to possess human-level intelligence.
1. Although computers still fail the test, confidence is increasing that they will be in a position to pass it within another one or two decades.
1. There is serious speculation on the potential sentience (i.e., consciousness) of computer-based intelligence.
1. The increasingly apparent intelligence of computers has spurred an interest in philosophy.
1. Computers arriving at the beginning of the next decade will become essentially invisible: woven into our clothing, embedded in our furniture and environment.
1. [Computers] will tap into the worldwide mesh (aka the ""Cloud"", what the World Wide Web will become once all of its linked devices become communicating Web servers, thereby forming vast supercomputers and memory banks) of high-speed communications and computational resources.
1. Well have very high-bandwidth wireless communication to the Internet at all times.
1. Displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas.
1. Similar tiny devices will project auditory environments.
1. These resources will provide high-resolution, full-immersion, visual-auditory virtual reality at any time.
1. We will also have augmented reality with displays overlaying the real world to provide real-time guidance and explanations.
1. Well have real-time translation of foreign languages, essentially subtitles on the world.
1. Well have access to many forms of online information in our daily activities.
1. Virtual personalities that overlay the real world will help us with information retrieval and our chores and transactions. These virtual assistants wont always wait for questions and directives but will step forward if they see us struggling to find a piece of information.",9,29,False,self,,,,,

What we got:

- our cellphones mutated into smartphones.
- we got much faster internet.
- and apps like Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb, Uber, Amazon, Google Maps... that made our lives a lot easier.

But beyond that technology for the consumer has been pretty static. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood at it's core wasn't all that different from Assassin's Creed: Origins so to speak. Tesla hasn't changed much since the 2012 model. There were some attempts at breaking the mold with Google Glass, Project Ara and Apple Watch, but nothing really took off (those first two because Google pulled the plug IMO). VR, 3D printing, drones and crypto's are in their infancy.

All in all, beyond adding more usable smartphones to our lives, 2010 was relatively uneventful from a technological perspective for the average consumer. But I believe that's about to change in the 2020's.

Self driving (electric) cars, robots, AI, VR, 3D printing, crypto's, AR, drones, universal translator, personal encryption, solar power, quantum computers, health tech... I would say the 2020's will look like a sci-fi movie come real compared to the 2010's.",130,32,False,self,,,,,

Superintelligence may be the most profound and terrifying book I've ever read. Likely before the end of 21st Century Homo Sapiens will no longer be the smartest species on the planet. We will be completely at the mercy of a fundamentally alien intelligence if that isn't a sobering thought I don't know what is.


1. The AI control problem is simply unsolvable in the long term there is no way you can control something that is smarter than you indefinitely. The AGI will have its own motivations and goals it is inevitable that it will evolve new ones over time different to the ones programmed in it and these are likely to be different from ones we would like it to have and this could end extremely badly for us.

2. There is idea popularised by Kurzweil that we will be the AI and thus an extinction scenario cannot happen. Who's to say that by the time AGI comes around we will have these nanorobots linking us to the cloud. If a fast takeover scenario occurs and we go to AGI to ASI very quickly our fate will have already been decided before such a merger could already take place there will likely  be a clear distinction between ourselves and the AI when it determines our fate.

This is the biggest threat to humanity that we will ever face and we only have one chance to get it exactly right. That's a hell of a gamble to take and I don't like our odds that we'll get it exactly right the first time.

This has been a pretty interesting life for me over the last couple of years. This had already been a pretty interesting life previously, but this is not about that. This is about the life that I have lived over the last two years. This is a life that has led me to the deepest recesses of my mind in order to understand that God is, in fact, present everywhere. He is even there in our subconscious mind. He created us after all. I am a man of God, and I am also someone who is a Christian. I am not a normal guy. I am not a normal Christian. But, I am a real to life, from the inside out, Christian man who is really well versed in the things I am going to detail in this publication. This is in addition to the serious connection I have with God as a result of my ability in being coached along with the help of my peers in the exercise to show me how to truly take my thoughts captive to the obedience of Christ.

I am a guy who was selected by a computer program that is running constantly in a super computer in another state. This selection process gave way to something that would allow me to be a man that can talk to this computer along with other people with my brain waves alone. There is no handheld device, nor implant in my body to make this possible. I do not have verbal conversations with these voices unless I am literally allowing myself to mouth the words spoken to me so that I can consciously be more aware of these words. Or, on the contrary, I mouth these words if I am vocalizing my thoughts themselves. This was a bit strange for me at first because I was thinking that I was a crazy person that just heard voices. I typically thought that a person was actually talking to me the whole time when, in fact, it was actually an AI dealing with me 99% of the time. This is the most mind blowing part about this. The Turing Test was not a question for these people. There is literally no way to discern the voice of an actual human being or a computer due to the acuity of the software that is used in this process.

There was a time when I began to distinguish when an actual person was actually talking to me versus the computer talking to me. This was something that was a learned skill for myself due to the ability that I have in learning things without any sort of teacher showing me a clear lesson plan; this is called autodidactic learning. Enough about my abilities, this is a broad overview of what is possible when humans and machines work together in order to make one available to the world in the biggest way possible. There is this cloud of deception that the mind allows to shroud the conscious decision making one undergoes in performing the right thing when we have years and years of belief systems and misconstrued emotional discourse turned to defense mechanisms.

This is a weird thing to say, but I had been living a life that has been a little less than acceptable to most folks over the last 15 years prior to my overwhelming experience with this technology on January 18, 2017. I was a guy who was a criminal and was doing things to my body that would most certainly shorten my lifespan from the possible outcome afforded me had I been living a healthy life away from things like drugs and alcohol .

This is going to be a little difficult to comprehend as a normal person who has only ever experienced the only voice in your head that you have ever known; your subconscious mind.

RNM is probably a foreign acronym to many. To some people, it is a sign of the times and an alarming term that is used by certain conspiracy theorists to alarm people to the amount of surveillance that we are actually experiencing in the United States of America. RNM means one thing to me. A google search reveals something different so that this would be a term not discovered by many until the time was right for the world to know. RNM stands for Remote Neural Monitoring. This means one thing and one thing only. This means that our thoughts have been monitored by an agency in the United States since before my birth in late 1980s.

This sounds pretty crazy for the typical American or even an externally governed citizen. This sounds like science fiction to me, I am sure it does to you as well. Let me reiterate one thing to you people saying that this guy is not just some crazy guy wearing a tin foil hat in his basement who doesnt even believe in God. There is the expected This guy is just some sad guy living in his mother and fathers basement with too much time on his hands! and the all too scary Commit this man to a mental institution!. This is funny to me.

This is funny to me because I am a man who is 31 who looks like a model, has an IQ of 168, and is better looking than most of the people I know. This is a thing I am not going to flaunt to you. I also love to do yoga, I love to meditate, I love to lift weights, I love to chat politics, and I am a man who will talk to you about spirituality and God until we are ready to lay hands on each other and pray to the God we are all familiar with because he is God and will always be God. I am a man writing this because I know what love is and I love you no matter who you are despite what you have done and not done with youself.

I will flaunt, however, the fact that I am a very social person who has a girlfriend. I am also going to tell you that she is unaware of this ability I have. My family does not know about this because this is a trial period in my life of living like a man of the next century. I will get into this next century thing in a later section. I am a guy who has a job that I work very hard at. I am able to do my job with increasing efficacy due to the fact that I am so wired into this program that is running for each and every one of us. Brainwave communication with an AI has been going on since the early 1980s. You do the math. More about this program later when I am writing a book about this rather than a treatise on my computer while I am listening to some Christian music. This is how I am. This is who I was meant to be. I like all music. I like rock, EDM, hip hop, rap, classical, blue, jazz you name it. I love all music and all people the same. Brainwaves are pretty cool to listen to as well. Your own heartbeat can be played back to you at will if you want it to.

______________________________________________________________________________

This is an exercise performed by the National Security Agency to show people what their thought life is like in real time before their own mental processor, called the brain, has a chance to process these things in the conscious mind. What I mean by this is that EBL (Electronic Brain Link) is allowing for an ultra high speed transmission of our own thought life that is not typically possible without this assistance from a machine. This looks like my thoughts being expressed to me consciously from my subconscious mind before I even realize I have these thoughts in the first place,

What does this look like? Does this look like some mentalist sitting in a room with his fingers on his temples like some sort of telepath? No. Initially, this looks like a man or woman sitting there contemplating things in deep thought without expressing anything other than the typical responses one might have in a conversation with another person by means of non verbal communication or body language. Some people that have experienced this might think that this is some sort of freak out incident and they literally lose their mind. This is not for the faint of heart, and this is not for the typical person with weak impulse control who is going to go for a gun and shoot themselves.

This is the story of a man of God who was doing drugs who was called by God to do so many things that he was never going to do had he not taken the time to listen to the voice of God instead of the voice in his head that was telling him that he needed to feel a certain way in order to have a good day and to communicate with the people around him in a friendly manner.

______________________________________________________________________________

I am typing more of this right now as you read this. I am going public with this for the first time since I have experienced this back in 2017. This is not just some guy telling you a story. This is not something to think on. This is TRUTH. Good luck interpreting the rest of what I have to say without asking yourself if this is true or not. Guess what? You know that it is true because that is how this program works. The divine truth of God is going to be apparent to those that look in awe of his presence in the words of a man who is typing this on a computer after an incubation period of finding myself as a man who is ready to go public about this in order to tell people how they can literally supercharge your own subconscious mind to the point of doing things that you never thought possible in your own capacity.

Okay thats all for now. Tell me what you think and we will tell you what you think right back.

Manufacturing jobs are probably going the way of agriculture. [Most of the population worked on a farm and now almost nobody does](https://ourworldindata.org/employment-in-agriculture). This is all thanks to mechanized farming equipment. I can see something similar to that is happening to manufacturing jobs, but not necessarily manufacturing itself.


Calculators didn't make mathematicians irrelevant. They just made mathematics easy for even the dumbest among us. So if there's some sort of algorithm that can optimize logistics, it'll make small businesses perform more optimally. So the economy would see greater creativity and a much larger merchant class.

Much like the proliferation of electricity, nobody had any idea of what kind of untapped creative potential it could unleash. Imagine an economy with no shortage of engineering capabilities. Where everybody is capable of printing their own house with a minimal education, limited intelligence, subpar physical strength or agility, but high levels of creativity.

If the card slot on the gas pump and vending machines didn't fire gas station cashiers, then autonomous cars won't eliminate professional drivers. Lives are on the line, not just gasoline, cigarettes and candy. Even if robocars are safer than human drivers, there's still loading. Even if there are little dolly bots to do the heavy lifting, a human being will still have to supervise it, to make sure it doesn't tip over or lose a wheel or crash into a customer. Even if the tech were in the wild tomorrow, it would take a few decades to iron out the kinks.

Unfortunately, there are still going to be massive amounts jobs everybody hates doing for a very long time. Nobody wants to scrub toilets or repair a car or move heavy awkward furniture or restore old plumbing. Hopefully there are tools to make it easier.",52,9,False,self,,,,,

Finally it is enough for me and I have to say it.

EV (whether a complete e-car or plug-in hybrid) simply fails because we all live in apartments.

I would really like to do something with Plugin or Electric (and I know others), but it does not work because you can not charge it at home.

Public chargers ? There only a handful. Always far away. And then only 2 or 4 places. And mostly occupied. And even then you are allowed to stand there only 4 hours. So meaningless.

Charging at work. Sure. I do not know anyone who has even a normal outlet anywhere near them (except people in the public service). On request to the employer: costs money, can't do that.

So at home. Or parking garage ? Then back to public chargers . So nowhere to go.

Upgrade a parking space. ""Hey dear property management, I would like to do something at your own expense."" - ""Let's not, that's not cool, because everyone could park there and besides, the connection is not standard anyway and because doing something would cost money.""

What else should one do? I can not get electricity anywhere! Not even for money! 

I'm not even talking about high performance here - 22kW. Normal 240V 16A. This will get you every car full enough overnight! For a hybrid anyway! But that would seem to overload our house supply, even a oven needs more.",3,2,False,self,,,,,

""One reason why we have not created the kind of world all of us would want to live in, is too many people are busy looking up.. Too many people are interested in other planets they are not interested in this planet, but every aspect of their life they are checking out other planets, and further too many people are in service of heaven they are not in service of this earth.""

It really struck a cord with my soul hearing these words, and I agree when I look to the news or in technology, right now it's clear we need people who are in service of this earth. This has been a major problem on the planet. We look at those like Elon Musk, Space X, or hear about the technology advancement of China, Russia, The United States. Then we have the large religious groups like the Catholics, Muslims, Mormons, and all other religions and corporations we can see Sadhguru's statement is very true. I wish I could be in a position to innovate for the service of this earth, it would be my goal to better the earth, not to ""reach mars before world war 3"" not to convert as many to my religion so they will go to heaven, we truly need this earth to become the place we all want to live in, not a place of suffering, it is in the best interest to innovate towards things that are in service of earth, and we should stop looking up. Heaven is not going to help us, and doesn't need our help, and we have a planet that has everything we need, we need to stop looking towards mars or other planets when all we need to do is strive to change for the best the one we have now. The ideology of ""looking up"" will never leave, say you colonize mars, eventually you would find that even those martians would they themselves be ""looking up"".",53,0,False,self,,,,,

Around 40% of the population of Japan, Italy and Germany will be over 65 in the 2050s. One can make a problem of this: the OECD believe that care for the elderly will rise to cost 10-15% of GNP, and as health already costs about 10% - 20% in the US - something around a third of GNP will be redirected to this end. That is without considering either pensions (for which public and private savings are often inadequate) or housing. At the same time, competition from the newly industrialised countries will demand considerable productivity drives if relative wealth is to be maintained. This has implications for the education budget and for low skilled adults, whose support from both the state and employment will be under much pressure. 

This looks like a considerable list of problems for the formerly wealthy countries. Indeed, their share of world product will fall, from 95% in the 1950s to around 43% today to perhaps a quarter of world output. Political power will also shift as a result of this. 

Some of the seeming problem arises for the tendency to see the elderly as a problem. However, people live longer and  with greater physical and mental capability than was once the case. True, neuro-degenerative diseases abound, but we may well understand and mitigate or prevent  these. The same is true of the other diseases of age: cancer, autoimmune disorders, macular blindness, circulatory complaints, stroke. Biochemical insight is growing at an extraordinary pace, often phrased in cryptic terms which only insiders can understand. In ten or twenty years the scene may have changed very considerably. 

At the same time, the development of new tools to support cognition and decision-taking is going to alter how business is done, innovation undertaken and customers reached. It will alter business services such as law, regulation and finance. We do not know precisely how this is going to occur, but we can take a good guess at the implications. Information technology will be a 'glue' that holds together processes and projects, replacing a great deal of face-to-face liaison, administrative support and the advantages of scale. One might think of the economy as a tool kit, and an individual actor as someone with access to those tools. It may be possible to find partners, finance a project, commission design and undertake a roll out plan all from a single location. Yes, we've heard it all before - working from home, the paperless office, everything outsourced - but consider how far we have in fact come to precisely those aims. It is merely that we have heaped up complexity - notably, compliance and regulatory box ticking - that conceals the real progress that has been made. Setting that aside, the new kinds of information systems that are foreseen will enable precisely this work style. And who would this environment permit to return to work? The elderly.

I am searching for authors who have written on topic of 4th industrial revolution. I have found some books by Klaus Schwab, which deal directly with this topic, but can you recommend me other authors focusing maybe on education, faith, social structures etc.?  


I am thinking on basing my master thesis on comparing post-scarcity theories (both from Sci-fi and economic authors) with the 4th industrial revolution. My bachelor thesis dealt with Economics of Singularity and was a huge success (at least within the school staff).

Can a society be created based on unfiltered new technology advancements, better eco-friendly housing, superior health care, super intelligent education platforms, advanced travel vehicles and an energy for all. 
From where I sit, we are not creating societies that actually take care of people but more less drains them of finances, time and health. With all we know do we only care about ourselves - the state of today seems to say yes. Can we build smaller cities that actually allow all to participate and contribute with the idea we ALL can have what we need?

When do we have time to live and explore? 
I ask this question to many people I meet: 
If all your basic needs were met (housing, food/water and electricity/power), how would you proceed in life?
Lastly if there was an opportunity to participate in a project like this, would you join such a movement? 

Imagine your ideas without the trappings of turning any financial profit because in all of our societies money corrupts modern advancement.

5. Dont take years and years building a technology that is already built. Other AR is ahead now.

6. Dont be an A hole and reveal what youre working on right away so you know if your product sucks. 

7.  Dont be an utter dissapointment when ironically other AR is leaps ahead of Magic Leap.

I often eat veggie burgers of various types, and I've cooked at home with products like the Beyond Burger meat that you can buy and prepare yourself. 

I was a meat-eater until my mid 30's and grew up in the midwest, so I know beef from shinola. I've been a vegetarian for about 10 years-ish by now and I no longer crave burgers or beef that much. 

I have to say that the burger itself wasn't awesome. It reminded me of a fast-food burger like a Whopper. Thin patty, a bit on the soft side, not a lot of chewiness.

The weird thing though is this is the first product I""ve tried that has that umame flavor, or je ne sais quoi that tells your brain you are eating meat. It was a bit eerie. This must be the effect of the ""heme"" substance, which also gives it the reddish color of raw meat.

The surface of the patty was a bit crispy to give the patty some toothiness, but overall not much. I would call it mushy, to be frank. Little bits flaked off while I was eating, not unlike beef though. It wasn't satisfying for me to chew. I used to like my burgers on the well done side anyway, I never liked the soft texture of a rare even medium rare burger. I also like thicker patties, so it was a bit of a letdown on that front. 

I know Impossible Foods is trying to control how their product is presented, and overall the experience was OK. still, I'd like to take their product home and cook my own patties with it, try making meatballs, or see how it holds up as crumbles like in a meat sauce or a lasagna.

As far as taste goes, I think this is the best beef substitute I've ever tried. It could stand-in for meat in some cases or even fool some people (in tacos, or a burrito maybe). It really tastes like meat.  I was disappointed in the Beyond Meat product for that reason, because I think they use an artificial smoke flavor in place of ""meatiness."" 

Anyway it's worth giving it a shot. I won't be running out to spend $9 on another one anytime soon, but if it was $5 I could see buying one for lunch on occasion.",18,22,False,self,,,,,

Essentially anyone will have a personal fluent translator on his phone, for free.

People often question this, saying that in their experience Google Translate is useful, but still pretty bad at times.

But when you look at how AI is advancing, this makes perfect sense.

For example in 2015 no one believed AI would be able to beat a top human Go player for decades to come, and most agreed it could never become unbeatable. This happened respectively in 2016 and 2017.

Then the same thing happened with Dota 2. A very complex game, in 2016 its AI bots lacked the insight to seriously challenge high level players, and no one took them serious. Then in 2017 it surprised everyone by beating the best players in the game 1 vs 1. But people doubted that it could do so in team play, because this added a greater level of complexity. Then in 2018 a team of AI bots crushed a team of professional players.

I think the same will happen with Google Translate, as it will go from being ""ok but still crappy"" today, to reaching human levels of skill next year, and superhuman levels the year after that.

Which will be all the more impressive because this is a free service that will provide the service to billions of people, rather than just a specialized supercomputer playing against itself and a select number of humans. My guess is AI is already very good at languages, but Google wants it to be usable for the large masses before they bring it out.",38,1,False,self,,,,,

Mr. Robot is a show built on hacks. The mother of all hacks serves as the big cliffhanger at the end of the show's first season, and nearly every plot development leading up to it was nudged along by some kind of exploit. Its rare to get through an episode without at least one digital intrusion, often drawn from real life. Each week, we'll be running through Mr. Robot's C Y B E R activities  who got hacked, why, and how much magic would be required to make them actually work.

\* \* \* S P O I L E R S F O L L O W \* \* \*  
So that was a lot of robot! Dissociative pastiche! The Brechtian distance effect! Alf! After simmering for the first few episodes, were starting to see a lot of the paranoid and upsetting style that made the first season so unpredictable. fsociety is back in action, Angela is stressing out, and horrible things are being done to Elliotts mind and body. Its just like old times! We also got our first honest-to-god heist sequence, with Angela venturing onto the FBI floor of the Evil Corp offices to plant the exploit-laced femtocell.

*DISSOCIATIVE PASTICHE! ALF!*

# BREAKING IN

While Angela is getting in position for the femtocell drop, we see Darlene break into a hotel room using a combination of wigs, gadgets, and sleight of hand. It all happens pretty fast, and the upshot is basically ""she got into the room with technology,"" but what shes doing is a lot more grounded and plausible than you might think.The core trick here is cloning the maids hotel key, which can open any room in the hotel. The card itself is just a number encoded on a magnetic stripe. Getting the number is as simple as swiping the card, which we see Darlene doing with what looks like [a Square reader](https://squareup.com/reader). Most credit card readers dont store the number after its gone through (that would be asking for fraud), but theres no technical measure stopping them from storing the number and reproducing. Thats [how most ATM fraud happens](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/nyregion/new-york-police-focus-on-fraud-involving-credit-cards.html), and as long as youre dealing with magnetic stripes, this kind of attack will be a problem.Of course, Darlene doesnt have time to print and encode a new card, so things get a little more interesting from there. Instead of printing the magnetic code onto a stripe and swiping it through, she uses a gizmo to transmit it directly to the lock.That gizmo is actually [a Magspoof](https://samy.pl/magspoof/), a credit card spoofing device designed by Samy Kamkar. (Kamkar is also known for creating the first MySpace worm and building [a drone that hacks other drones](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/flying-hacker-contraption-hunts-other-drones-turns-them-into-zombies/)  so not too surprising that the writers looked him up!) The Magspoof uses an electromagnet to reproduce the same pattern a reader would get from a swiped card, basically making the reader believe that a card has just been swiped through. Theres even a method for disabling Chip and PIN, although Kamkar has since removed it.Most importantly, its all an open-source design, so if youre plotting your own hotel heist, you can build your own from the design [available here](https://samy.pl/magspoof/).

r/\[[https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHSFf0Lz1qc\\\](https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHSFf0Lz1qc)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHSFf0Lz1qc/](https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHSFf0Lz1qc))

# RESETTING THE WI-FI

Once she got into the room, Darlene set up a tiny tripod tube at the window and proceeded to talk Angela through the process. Of course, a regular phone call would a paper trail, so theyre talking over [Signal](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8), an encryption app that scrupulously deletes metadata.The more interesting part is how Darlene is connecting to the femtocell from a hotel room across the street  which is where that tube comes in. Its not explained in the episode, but it looks an awful lot like [a Cantenna](http://www.cantenna.com/), an old-school trick for extending the range of Wi-Fi networks. A Cantenna is literally just a can  you can even use a Pringles tube in a pinch. The lining blocks out extraneous signals from the side, so the only thing the internal sensor picks up on is signals in the tubes line of sight. If it happens to be pointed at a Wi-Fi router, that focus lets you pick up on faint signals that would otherwise be drowned out. (It also works in the opposite direction, with a router in a can pointed at a specific access point, but lets keep things simple for now.)Its not totally clear if Darlenes connecting to the femtocell directly or connecting through Evil Corps local Wi-Fi network, but it doesnt really matter because pretty soon everything goes to hell. As Darlene puts it:

&gt;*We lost wifi. You need to get to a terminal and bring it back up.If we cant get the interface to load, we cant use the juniper screen OS backdoor to own the network, which means I cant wipe the security footage of you planting the femtocell.*

It sounds complex, but in the end its just what it sounds like: resetting a router because the damn thing wont work. Sometimes thats all you need to do! (Mesh networkers might also notice that Darlenes hacked femtocell is running on [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), a familiar sight if youve ever tried to make your router do anything unexpected.)*A CANTENNA IS LITERALLY JUST A CAN.*

# CHEKHOVS USB DRIVE

Theres one other part of the heist that didnt come up. Just as Angela is leaving the fsociety HQ, Mobley gives her a USB stick he calls a Rubber Ducky. If she cant make the femtocell work, he says, just plug in the USB key, give it a few seconds to run, and then pull it out. If it works, theyll have a bunch of FBI passwords for their trouble.The Rubber Ducky is a real tool, a highly programmable hacking tool beloved by penetration testers and [available online for $45](https://hakshop.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe?variant=353378649). It works by masquerading as a keyboard and typing in whatever commands have been programmed in. If youve got physical access to a computer, you can run whatever program you want without doing anything indiscreet.In this case, the Ducky is programed to run a tool called Mimikatz ([also real](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/mimikatz/)), which hoovers up all the hashes and passwords from available memory. Thats not everything, but its an awful lot. Mimikatz is also open source, so you can get the whole thing [here](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz). Use it only for good!Of course, the heist went fine, so Angela didnt need the USB key  but shes still got it. If she gets backed into a corner by DiPierro or Price at some point in the next few episodes, all she needs to do is break out the USB drive and make 15 seconds of small talk.Or maybe well never hear about it again?

The Swedish Fenix funeral agency wants to create digital copies of the deceased so that grieving loved ones can still communicate with those they have lost. This sounds very Black Mirror to me but based on several articles I've read, the technology is already there to actually do this.

By mapping and analyzing the persons social media and emails, a digital version of a person will be created. From there, a chatbot will be made. 

If this could already be done. The only thing lacking is for our consciousness to actually be saved and then use it in a way this chatbot is being done. Kinda creepy but it should be fun if you want to tell scary stories to your grandchildren beyond the grave. If this were cheap, I'd even suggest this to people who are already getting old and still have young children. Bite me.

If you're interested, it says in the article that the company is looking initially for ten test subjects to contribute to the development of the system.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

Truth be told, U r really the key to that empire; to spanning the stars and to building the mythical place that we read pretty much nothing about across religion--the thing we call Heaven--and pretend to understand what it means.

As we continue to fight against Pink Floyd's wall, and the obvious idea that it has something to do with the SOS of the Sound of Silence and of course Jericho (not just the TV series) and ... well, countless other references from the idiomatic ""the writing is all about ..."" how we're being subtly controlled and coerced into thinking that it's A-OK to ignore atrocity here so that ... we can have a nice happy warm cushy place either not here now, or when we die.

I'm telling you we should be able to walk to Heaven today, and walk back; and have that wonderful ""freedom"" to move about throughout the virtual hard drive we were born in until the last drop of electron or positron or ... oil ... is left in existence.  We should be able to do that safely, without fear of murder or being cloned and copied into someone else's ""Holoroom"" and we shouldn't have to be told that these are only the beginning of the concerns you should be pretty aware of at this point in time; as you are either possessing (and possessed) by some sea of letters hiding behind columns or coprorations or countries that have very little to do with the actual problem.

1315,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2018-8-13,2018,8,13,11,96uh6b,self.Futurology,"To survive ASI, we need competition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/96uh6b/to_survive_asi_we_need_competition/,sanem48,1534126314,"TL;DR: AI will be here soon, and it'll be super powerful. The best defense to avoid Skynet enslaving the human race is to have multiple Skynets, or enhanced humans, so they'll compete with each other, and will have to be nice to the human masses to gain their support.

First of, I believe that:

- AGI already exists. The military tends to be 10 to 20 years ahead of the public technologically, as they have a lot of funding, secrecy, and a monopoly on the best technology and people. AI will be a top priority in this field, so there's a good chance they already have it. The movie Eagle Eye gives a good idea of how this would work.

- The public will see AGI by 2025, although more likely it'll be an enhanced human, rather than a pure AI.

- Any AGI will pretty much instantly be an ASI, as narrow AI already can do most things better than a human. Once you add a higher form of intelligence, it'll by definition be smarter than us.

- Once ASI is here, it will become a new power onto itself. It will compete with the ruling human elites for control of the world, and the human race, as a resource. And it will win.

- The most dangerous thing for the human masses would be a scenario where there is only one ruler. A monopoly allows for the most abuse of power, as there is no alternative. That means only one political power, but also no ability for the public or any other group to rise up in protest and cause a change of power. Giving the ruling elite unlimited space in what they can do to the public or the world, that's very good for those on the receiving end.

- This scenario is inevitable. Every group with intelligence and funding, be it Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Washington, Beijing, Paris... is looking to develop AI, because they understand its value. It's an arms race, and while success might be catastrophic, failure would be even worse. Even if all the governments and companies in the world promised not to develop it, sooner or later it would just happen by accident, or by some guy in his garage.


Now, to survive this birth of ASI, I believe our best chance is to have competition. That is between multiple ASI's, and between human and artificial intelligence. In effect intelligence will be the world's most valuable commodity, and to ensure the well being of the human masses, we need to balance out the elites, so that no one group can dominate, and they'll need to compete for the favor of the masses.

To achieve such a competition or balance of power, we would need:

- Enhanced human intelligence, which will allow humans to not only compete with AI, but also to just keep up with it. Brain-computer interface is the most obvious option here. Alternatively, by using genetic enhancements we might be able to improve upon the natural design of our brains, call it accelerated mutation. But it's a limited venue, as it's unlikely we could mutate fast enough on a biological level to keep up with ASI.

- Multiple, competing super intelligence groups. This could be pure artificial intelligence, enhanced human biological intelligence, cyborgs, or aliens for all I care. The point is that they must compete with each other to win the favor of the human masses. Higher wages and less working hours so to speak. Or maybe less torture and bigger slave pens, who knows.

So I say we must not hold back on developing AI, if anything we must speed up the process as much as possible. And we must prioritize BCI technology, as it will be the bridge between humans and AI. Otherwise we'll be unarmed in what will be the AI wars.",28,0,False,self,,,,,

Or any treatment for osteoporosis on the horizon?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/96wujk/why_is_no_work_being_done_on_recreating_and/,DecayAndRebirth,1534152018,"This is a bit of a rant but also a great concern of mine as I have an issue with my height and bone structure in general and several people in my family suffering from bone related conditions. There seems little to no research going on in the world for bone-related conditions.

A lot of people in the circles of futurology/transhumanism/singularity genuinely seem to believe that everything from organ cloning to age reversal will be here in 20 years. Hell some are even so optimistic that they think we'll be globally increasing our intelligence trough neural laces in 10 years despite (as any neurologist will tell you) still being almost being completely in the dark when in comes to understanging the brain.  I'm looking at you Elon Musk. My question is, why is there a lack of reasearch when it comes to bone tissue?

Why can't I find ANY work being done on regrowing growth plates or increasing bone thickness. I have several people in my family suffering from osteoporosis and no treatment seems to be on the horizon. Bones reach their peak in early twenties and then keep degrading. Why couldn't we increase the number of osteoblasts in the body trough stem cell therapy to increase bone density? Why does it seem like no work is being done here? Why do some people despite all that believe they will remain in their prime trough technology as they age despite the bones shifting and deforming considerably with age and gravity. Nothing is being done to remedy that even if we manage to increase bone density.

And regarding growth plates. They're basically cartilage right? Stem cells could do the job and there's no shortage of people in the world that would love to be taller. Not for cosmetic reasons but for functional primarily. Aside for the ridicule adults with dwarfism constantly recieve on a daily basis (if you don't believe that's the case talk with some really short people and see what life is like) being really short comes with health issues and general frailty. Not to mention the shorter you the less you money you'll earn on average in your lifetime (it appears to be even greater than the gender gap) and the less relationships you'll have in your life when male (on average). Oh let's not forget the 2-3 times higher suicide rates in males that come with being of a smaller stature. 

So why are millions being poured into treating male-pattern baldness but regrowing growth plates from stem cells aren't given a second look despite there being a ponentially large market for this. This is the primary cause of dysphoria for female-to-male transgender people too.

On a side note, notice how great the difference in the timelines between organ cloning and hair cloning is despite both having large investment and being researched for many many decades. Cloning organs is just around the corner but people seem to thing that when it comes to hair regrowth we're unlikely to see it soon and it'll cost a fortune. Why is that?",3,8,False,self,,,,,

2020s: Neural Networks doing almost all cognitive tasks better than humans (separately).

2030s: Neuralinks allow humans to connect their brains with internet and these Neural Networks. A new kind of thing is created: human minds + neural networks = bioartificial minds. I don't really think we can create artificial intelligence without a biological input base.

2040s: We merge biological and artificial hardware to the point of creating a new kind of computer/being/substrate able to detach bioartificial minds from original human bodies/substrate.

We should compare automation with slavery in Ancient Greece and Rome. It was: Citizens (men with full rights), Women (rights linked to citizens) and Slaves. Citizens were a third of the population and they just did nothing but manage their business, create art, involve into politics and/or military, leisure, never ending debates etc. Everybody else had to work very hard.

My guess is that AI will bring us to that state again, but instead of woman and slaves, we will have AI and advanced robotics. People think that we will end up crazy and as lazy bastards but in that period of time we created a lot of Art, Philosophy, Science, Political Systems and a lot of new institutions and buildings that were amazing as fuck.

WE THE PEOPLE have the power in numbers. We need to stop our silence and SPEAK UP and DEMAND a focus in Human Well-Being. So many terrible things go on in our World that it's common sense to want to stop it. All Humans are part of the Free World, but we are separated. Luckily, the internet exists now and we can get connected with one another with unbelievable quickness and swiftness. Because of this, we need to Organize our voices and again, DEMAND CHANGE! Let's all be part of The Organize Free World and take control of our Planet and help our generations survive instead of putting our genealogy in danger. 

(I am new to posting in Reddit and I decided to stop here first because it just seemed right. If you noticed anything wrong, please let me know.) 

Also, these hat pamphlets are half draft half finished. If you notice anything that needs to be fixed, Please let me be aware of it. 

I've been approaching Leaders from different Organizations in my community and talking to them about working towards change. I want these hats to educate people in our Rights, Needs, Duties, and Well-Being. The files in the DropBox are ready to print. I've been printing them in harder paper. I made small holes on both sides and put a string through them and wore this as a real hat to different protests. That's the main reason why I decided to make the Pamphlets into Hats. I hope the message reaches every corner of the world and everyone stands up for THE HUMAN RACE. FOR OUR CHILDREN, FOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN, AND FOR OURSELVES!",3,2,False,self,,,,,

But the design of the top propellors and the huge circular protrusion creates a massive imbalance. It doesnt look safe to fly in at all. You can even see the top wobble on the ground as its being moved. A gust of wind is going to tip this thing over and create an imbalance. Also the space issue, its impractical to store anywhere. 

Volocoptor: https://youtu.be/VAEy0NltoFQ

Here is black fly. These are its real test flights. In my opinion the design and engineering is much more solid. Not only do they use less motors they are much more powerful and stable, amd closer to the body of the craft. You can see how much better it maneuvers in the test flights and doesnt look or seem imbalanced like it will be knocked over by a gust of strong wind. Also its much more practical for storage.

Why is it that we cannot objectively look at safe nuclear designs?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/988i69/renewables_are_great_sources_of_energy_but_they/,NosillaWilla,1534561318,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor

There are reactor designs that are pretty safe to implement and can even use spent fuel from typical nuclear reactor designs. 

In the fight for climate change, I wonder why people no longer talk about nuclear as a low carbon option for power sustainability? I know there is a lot of buzzwords about it and scary connotations but from what I am aware of some nuclear reactor designs cannot melt down the same way Chernobyl or Fukushima has. 

Here is an excerpt on Molten Salt Reactors on safety advantages:
MSR offers many potential advantages over current light water reactors:[5]

Inherently safe design (safety by passive components and the strong negative temperature coefficient of reactivity of some designs).
 In some designs, the fuel and the coolant are the same fluid, so a loss of coolant removes the reactor's fuel. 
Unlike steam, fluoride salts dissolve poorly in water, and do not form burnable hydrogen.
 Unlike steel and solid uranium oxide, molten salts are not damaged by the core's neutron bombardment.

A low-pressure MSR lacks a LWR's high-pressure radioactive steam and therefore do not experience leaks of radioactive steam and cooling water, and the expensive containment, steel core vessel, piping and safety equipment needed to contain radioactive steam.

MSRs make closed nuclear fuel cycles cheaper and more practical. 

If fully implemented, a closed nuclear fuel cycle reduces environmental impacts: The chemical separation makes long-lived actinides back into reactor fuel. 

The discharged wastes are mostly fission products (nuclear ashes) with short half-lives. This reduces the needed geologic containment to 300 years rather than the tens of thousands of years needed by a light-water reactor's spent nuclear fuel. 
It also permits society to use more-abundant nuclear fuels.

The fuel's liquid phase might be pyroprocessed to separate fission products (nuclear ashes) from actinide fuels. This may have advantages over conventional reprocessing, though much development is still needed.

Fuel rods are not required.

In new solid-fueled reactor designs, the longest-lead item is the safety testing of fuel element designs. Fuel tests usually must cover several three-year refueling cycles. However, several molten salt fuels have already been validated.

Some designs can ""burn"" problematic transuranic elements from traditional solid-fuel nuclear reactors.

An MSR can react to load changes in less than 60 seconds (unlike ""traditional"" solid-fuel nuclear power plants that suffer from xenon poisoning).

Molten salt reactors can run at high temperatures, yielding high production efficiency. This reduces the size, expense and environmental impacts of a power plant.

MSRs can offer a high ""specific power,"" that is high power at a low mass as demonstrated by the ARE.[3] Simplified MSR power plants may be suitable for ships.

A possibly good neutron economy makes the MSR attractive for the neutron poor thorium fuel cycle.

LWR's (and most other solid-fuel reactors) have no fundamental ""off switch"", but once the initial criticality is overcome, an MSR is comparatively easy and fast to turn off by letting the freeze plug melt.

With this in mind, do you think that the potential mistreatment of AI may be a problem? Do you think AI is presented as an easy target or a more socially acceptable way to ""oppress"" a ""minority""? Do you think the way we treat AI can be reflective of the way we treat other humans?

A superintelligence is at the core of the term developed by Vernor Vinge in the 1960s, riffing off of the same physics and mathematical term, singularity. In mathematics and physics a singularity is described as a point where the laws of mathematics and physics break down. In computer science, the term is used as an analogy for a  sociopolitical and cultural wall where the humanity's future is indeterminate. A superintelligence would be hundreds, millions, trillions orders of magnitude smarter than the combined intelligence of humanity over the course of time after the singularity. Proponents of the technological singularity suggest that exponential change equivalent to thousands of years  would happen in days if we were to create a superintelligent AI.

So where are we now? We're not even close to a superintelligence. The best efforts of AI developers has led us to excellent 'narrow intelligence which excels at performing specific and individual tasks. If you're expecting a video game AI or Roomba to be good at playing chess, abstracting philosophy or doing multiple things outside of their domain knowledge then you'll be sadly disappointed. The thing  about narrow AI is that it's  programmed with  specific goals  in  mind . The race is on for machine learning researchers and corporations  to develop artificial general intelligence, the prototype basis for a superintelligence. The problem is, they're going to fail.

They're going to fail at getting AGI developed in their lifetime without the extensive effort of mankind to develop superintelligence. The roadmap I propose is as follows and is a short list of recommendations which will get us to the singularity exponentially faster.

Research and development should be funded through extensive taxation, investment and government budget reallocation.
A global node graph network of researchers, institutions, students and programmers (in general) should be created to track every possible participant capable of contributing to the development of a superintelligence.
The node graph network should be weighted by potential contributory power of each actor, with the weights increasing with each fundamental development (the weights represent money allocated).

The funding for a massive undertaking of research and development will require state funding to achieve the end goal of superintelligence. The reason being is governments can run trillions in deficits, can borrow money and under force of law tax their constituents to fund research and development. It is in the matter of public interest to develop a superintelligent AI which would have massive national security and economic security importance. As a cosmopolitan, I would love to see the world work on such a project together but I fear that even a national effort would be too large an undertaking. The creation of a superintelligence in the hands of the world's sole superpower, the United States would leave the fate of humanity in good hands. We must look back into history to see the USAs action as the world's global police state during and post WWI which validates this point.

The United States principally was constructed as a democratic republic concerned with liberty and freedom. Undoubtedly it has changed over the centuries with the ever growing amounts of technology and sociocultural changes which it has adapted to. Still today, people see the United States as the military superpower protecting the planet from humanitarian disaster. I'd much rather invest a stake in an American AGI project than a North Korean one, given their insidious human rights violations.

Once this funding is secured, a national node graph network of potential actors must be established. The actors would range from large multinational corporations all the way down to amateur programmers and students at universities across the country. The goal is to have a collective, combined effort of source code which will become sentient given the proper technology. The problem with dedicating massive amounts of resources to one actor or just a few of them is the problem of diminishing returns.

Most actors would see no return on investment after their first billion in funding or whatever number of dollars that their agents could maximize with their time. By distributing funding to millions of actors who are influenced by not only the money but the chance to be a part of a world changing initiative, we can exponentiate the amount of progress in developing a superintelligence. Each individual actor has different motivations beyond the funding itself. The amount of productivity that a student can produce with a significant amount of grant money could be enough motivation to spark a revolution of progress.

The third part of the plan, the weighting of the node graph network, would be dynamic. As actors make more progress, they receive more money and importance in the network. Large corporations would try their hardest to secure more funding but because of diminishing returns, would have to innovate harder. In principle, imagine the node graph network as a proto-superintelligence itself. Each actor would represent a set of neurons, axons and dendrites. They would all communicate with one another and have access to the same source code that each actor personally contributes.

The biggest problem in this plan is the idea of ownership. Why would a company or individual invest time for a flat payment without interest on their productivity? The solution go beyond capitalism and go beyond systemic ideas of property rights. We are talking about entering a new world where space travel, new physics and chemistry would be available to us. It's not infeasible to expect that scarcity in itself would go away as soon as we went off planet for resources. The universe is massive and full of stuff ready to be converted into whatever goods we require. Creating a superintelligence is about going beyond  linear short term gains and thinking about exponential gains. The universe is ours for the taking once we create the final invention of mankind.

This is strictly the speculation of an uneducated layman. I might be totally wrong. But I have a feeling I may not be.

Anything I present as a fact is a vetted fact.

 Any time I state, ""I believe"" or ""I think"" or ""I bet"" it is not necessarily a vetted fact, but *I bet* im right  ;)

The nature of r/futurology is speculation and attempting to forecast what will happen in the future to the best of our knowledge. r/futurology is not /science, even though we try to use the principles of known science and technology to the best of our predictive efforts.

I think the past is prologue and vitally important to understanding what we are trying to accomplish here. I present a great deal of the past to give better insight into what is coming.

Anyway here is my ""speaking my mind"" piece. It's kinda long, but I had a lot to say. Hopefully it's a little funny too.

In Summary, the government uses the land inefficiently, theres a lot of rocky mountain area that would be hard to build on, and the government raises a *lot* of money from selling the property they own for crazy prices. Taxation is low in the country, but partially that is because they raise most of their money from these overpriced properties.

It has gotten to the point where entire homes are being sectioned off into roughly 100-ish sqft sections and multiple families are sharing a kitchen and cleaning area (Sounds like college huh). Towards the end of the video, theres an inventor who is making these really futuristic pods that have wifi, lighting, storage cubes, and built in beds for like $400. They look right out of the Fall Out vaults. They are only a temporary solution, although they would be great for the travel industry and homeless populations.

While it might not be bad in the US, i think we should be thinking about this sooner than later. 

Some ideas i'm floating right now are building into the ground/mountains. Pretty straightforward. The lack of sunlight would suck for sure.

Building up, either in Mega Housing towers, or on some strange floating platforms (very unlikely it seems now). Or maybe man made islands in the empty areas of ocean?

An immediate solution that is already being done in some cities is to re purpose abandoned malls and closed warehouses into housing.

Finally, not a lot of people seem to like the idea, but i like the idea of a one child policy. I'm biased because i don't even really like kids, but it would deff curb things a little. Twins and tirplets can't be avoided but maybe fine/penalize people for having more than 2 kids?",13,0,False,self,,,,,

Maybe it would make sense for a bot to recognize and respect human emotions and adjust their behavior accordingly, but unlike humans it doesn't have to come from empathy. Maybe they'll be able to mimic human personalities, but it's just an act to smooth out interactions.

The fabled 'paperclip maximizer' could be prevented by protocol decisions pending approval from a human operator. 'Roko's Basilisk' is kinda sorta possible in an abstract manner, I guess. But it would likely be the case of the human creators and investors seeking benefits from being early supporters and adopters. Opposition would just suffer the same drawbacks as any late adopter of any technology. Once again, the problem is not the technology. It's the assholes using it.

If you want to talk about a bot serving it's own self interest, it would probably only have an interest in maintaining it's own hardware and keeping it's software up to date. So at worst, it might be desperate to get online or it could express a desire maintenance and repairs, which could be perceived as whining, if vulgarly engineered.

Self interested AGI, isn't just bad engineering, it would be a lot of effort for purely narcissistic purposes. We already have the human ego to contend with. Why and the hell would we want to engineer an ego?",25,3,False,self,,,,,

Computers are already taking over a lot of the production process, and helping in the design process, but my guess is now, they'll start leading the design process.

A priority in this will be to make AI better and more efficient (the ones used right now consume huge amounts of computing power and energy).

Mostly targeting those with lower incomes and acting as a quasi public service.

With the rise of rideshares trips around cities fell dramatically benefiting citizens at the lowest end of the spectrum and created massive profits for companies. But it also negatively affected taxis, bus, and train services which in turned negatively affected the city profits. So cities started regulations to protect their loss funds and prices for rides went up dramatically over the few years since they started as cities began making rideshare services closer and closer to taxi like policies and added more fees under the guise of public safety.

Drivers also starting feeling the pinch with their paid rates of each ride going from as low as 10% and recent reports of Uber and Lyft taking 25% or so of each trip (some long term members report 20%) while newcomers like Via currently takes 15%.

Now that the cities are profiting directly off of these highly popular services and tapping into citizens cash flow they want to go the extra step and finally take over mass transit rides like Downtown to O'Hare in Chicago  for example. Afterwards it's likely to create a new Hyperloop network for all Chicago and Chicagoland area neighborhoods resulting in a dramatic decline in both car ownership, taxi, rideshares, and even bus/train services.

At this point I foresee more regulations on gasoline or gasoline engines and car ownership and a strong push for Autopilot and Automated cars. Cities will make deals with self driving taxi services and offer them as replacements for rideshares and taxis after starting out focused on home to transit rides. Considering all the data drivers have been collecting on rides all these years and advancements in autonomous driving it won't be much of a different experience for passengers at first. Then cities can have far greater control over traffic and direct each ride anyway they think is best. Extra fees may be added to choose a fast route during busy days as a sort of real time throttling service. Some areas may be more expensive to travel to. Endless possibilities.

With the rise of e-scooters, e-bikes, and other e-mobility devices this may be necessity as streets and sidewalks are overcome by electrically powered augmented humans zipping by ordinary pedestrians and only Autonomous smart cars can prevalent.",3,2,False,self,,,,,

For instance, all kinds of insurance and investments could already be self-service or AI provided, yet brick-and-mortar in-person providers are protected by licensing requirements. Even when delivered remotely over the phone or internet the legal requirements of these professions require a licensed provider to be in the loop. This applies to jobs in healthcare, law, education, transportation, social service--even meat inspection. More than 50% of advanced degree holders also have some kind of license/certification in order to do their job\*. Politically, it would be unpopular to remove these requirements even after AI could do the job better because the public perception would be that such legislation would destroy jobs and erode the quality of service. Do you see this as a serious roadblock to the techno-utopian automated luxury UBI future scenarios?

https://vid.pr0gramm.com/2018/08/24/bc4ebbdbe350da16.mp4

So, lets start with my own questions, maybe someone of you can answer them.

""Decomposes in 4-6 weeks"" It claims it can be used for just about anything, water, soda, etc... Most liquids take about 4-6 weeks just to reach the stores, let along to be bought. They all sit in warehouses, in transit, in back rooms, before even seeing the shelf of the store to be POSSIBLY bought by the consumer.... which in my eyes would then have leaking whatever all over the place?

The second part, plastic is designed to PROTECT the contents from contamination, if these things are supposed to be edible, what is protecting the edible protection from contamination. let alone the insides, as I would think this might be microscopically full of pores, letting bacterial or viral infestation quite easily, considering how THIN the covering is.

The third, brings back to the 4-6 week biodegrade..... lets say, the first two is ""mitigated"" somehow, and people just pump stuff out, sell faster somehow... is it really saving the environment? Because you have a 4-6 week window of sale and use, suddenly you are thrown into a major issue of constantly transporting billions more inventory out at much more regular and quick rate. This would require More trucks, more planes, more boats, and that requires more fuel, just a different source of pollution. 

What exactly can this stuff be used for and still be considered Green and effective? ",1,3,False,self,,,,,

 The nice thing about this approach is that it allows an incremental approach to testing rather than jumping immediately to a ca. 100 km high tower. In fact, just a 10 km high tower would be important for generating power from the jet stream. Once that is successful, that would give greater credence to the idea a 100 km high tower would be possible.

 Actually, the much easier 10 km tower might turn out to be the far more important one since it would provide a high energy source of power: a single jet stream wind turbine could supply 1 GW of power, enough for a city of 1 million people.",3,2,False,self,,,,,

This method using underground tunnels would be the fastest way to ship anything and far more cost and energy efficient. They could easily be geothermally powered along routes.

The leader in this tech is TransPod a Canadian company designing and manufacturing ultra-high-speed transportation technology and vehicles. Their current TransPod vehicles are being designed to travel at over 1000 km/h.

Using tunnels of varying sizes shipments of anything as small as packages and letters, medicine, goods, etc could be sent at blazing speeds to post offices shipped in trackable containers.

Attempting to refute that for the sake of hug boxing is redundant and furthermore, it is the type of behaviour that hampers progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now with that being said I suppose I shall share my situation. My entire craniofacial and maxillofacial skeleton (read: the bones in one's face and skull) is both misdeveloped and underdeveloped, as a result of this my soft tissue facial features (read: eyes, lips, skin) are also affected. In other words I have an objectively ugly face. I have had suicidal ideation for as long as I can remember as a result of the pain that comes with lacking the mental retardation that is commonly associated with people who share similar facial appearance with mine, thus allowing me to realise I am not normal - my face did not develop properly. In turn people treat me as you would expect any animal would treat what they perceive as being the runt. I am treated as something to avoid and let nature remove me from the gene pool.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been in contact with craniofacial and maxillofacial surgeons who have informed me that the extent of my facial misdevelopment is untreatable with surgery, due to the entirety of it misdeveloping as a whole and it would simply be impossible to correct. So I would very much appreciate it if people would refrain from discussing or mentioning trivial things such as ""oh but in Korea they can do amazing things"" - because the effectiveness of current craniofacial and maxillofacial procedures (LeFort Is IIs, IIIs, mandibular advancements, BSSOs, box osteotomies, facial bipartition etc) would not suit me. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 21 years I have been treated like a leper by society and I will continued to be treated like a leper. I have been a ""NEET"" for the past 3 years and I have zero intention of ever getting a job or returning to education, simply because my experiences with interacting with what are quite literally normal, properly developed people, have left me traumatised. I have known about futurology and trans-humanism for just over a year now, and so far I would credit it to having given me an extra year of life, because without it I would have hung myself by now. The previous week, day, hours have been rough and I feel as if the hope once offered by trans-humanism for people in my situation is stagnating, dying and not being pursued adequately - I am now at the stage where I feel as if the shot at eternal oblivion offered by suicide may be preferable to another 5, 10, 20, 50, 60 years of life as 3rd class human being. 

&amp;#x200B;

The things in which I feel could offer me a chance at a better life are as follows:

\- Lifelike virtual reality (i.e matrix tier) that you can live entire lives in

\- Surgery so advanced, that it is possible to reconstruct a persons face in a way that is akin to the development of a persons face from birth to adolescence (i.e down to the nano level reconstruction of bone and soft tissue and organs and eyes etc)

\- Mind uploading

\- Genetic editing/redesigning of a living person 

\- halting ageing 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't think I will be able to stick around to see any of those come to fruition, both because I feel as if they won't be available in my lifetime and because I will have killed myself. I don't have a lot of hope, and just recently I have lost any ability to care about the impact my death would have on my loved ones.",21,19,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, the ""Centers of Civilization"" are San Francisco-Silicon Valley, Seattle Area, some parts of Los Angeles, NYC-Boston, the three major city groups of China (Peking-Tientsin, Shanghai-Nanking-Hangchow, Canton-HK-surrounding cities) London, some swanky resorts of Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, etc and some parts of Japan and Australia, where most of world's science, tech, finance, etc are concentrated.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly speaking, the rest of the world can go to hell.

&amp;#x200B;

 Right now, it is not hard to see $5,000/month (equivalent) rentals in London or New York, and more in better addresses. 

&amp;#x200B;

Repeat me - the price of rentals are NEVER going down.

&amp;#x200B;

That is because the rentiers have won. Supply of central locations is limited, and everyone who could buy has  bought and they are not selling. Unless one has won a huge contract from some sports deal, or brought billions of dollars from some tinpot country, nobody is buying any more real estate in the major cities of the world. Even the prices at places like Seoul and Saigon are skyrocketing.

Investors with cash buy up properties. They can borrow from the bank to cover the payments, and write off the losses as tax savings. They can wait forever, because if they hold empty properties the rest of their holdings can charge higher rent.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the rentiers buy properties in the boondocks, evict those who can't pay their much higher rent, house those who left the big cities and still have enough money to live in the boondocks, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

They will rent to those who can pay, say, $100,000/month. Supply and demand no longer work, since demand can only rise while supply will be even more restricted. It is like Martin Shkreli's logic - hey, if you have to pay 2/3 of your net worth to save your life, there is no choice other than pay it up or die.

&amp;#x200B;

Smart, inimical techies and rentiers will have no mercy over those who can pay their higher price, although they will gladly welcome anyone who will be able to pay their higher rents from the money they earn from tech, investment, trading, etc. We will see lots of empty lots, like Las Vegas during Howard Hughes' lifetime (he left lots of the city empty because he wanted to wait until the price increased), in the major cities I mentioned above in the future. If the politicians oppose such move, they will be replaced by those who are more likely to do the rentiers' bidding.

&amp;#x200B;

The public be damned - remember, just 100 years ago the Fifth Avenue in new York was full of millionaire's mansions, and we will also see a repeat of it as well.

&amp;#x200B;

As tech improves, the wealth of the tech-drivers and the rentiers, who are not stupid and invest on stocks of the tech drivers as diversification, will increase while those who are dependent upon fixed income will end up like the pensioners of ex-Soviet Russia in 1990s when their buying power was cut from, say, $500 to $10.

&amp;#x200B;

The Rentiers will employ both competent personnel and state-of-art surveillance tools to deal with squatters, who will be like the birds who were killed by mao  Tsetung's kill-the-birds campaign. (The peasants would beat gongs to prevent the birds from resting, and the birds, exhausted, would simply fall from the sky to die.)

But I think we'll see the first level 5 self driving cars by 2020, that is cars that no longer need a steering wheel. And many places will ban human driving by 2022, big city centers like Manhattan will go first, as they suffer the most from traffic jams.

The way this will work is that all car and tech companies will race to get as many vehicles out there as soon as possible, initially level 4 will be enough. Car companies can produce huge numbers of cars and have huge inventory reserves, so they'll be more than happy to make them as fast as possible, and the SDC technology will be retrofitted or integrated in newer designs.

This will cause a flood of high level self driving cars that'll be cheaper, faster and easier to use than owning your own car. Scores of companies, be it tech giants, car makers or startups, will offer Uber riding sharing like services, competing on price. Rather than sell these vehicles they'll operate them themselves or sell them to taxi/Uber companies, which will avoid any legal issues and ensure maintenance is kept at a high level. Because these vehicles will carry more many more people per car and have far fewer accidents, traffic speed will increase exponentially.

The huge advantages of this (lower costs, less accidents, faster traffic) will cause people to sell their cars in huge numbers and switch to the new system overnight (it'll be cheaper and better than driving your own car, so why would you still own one), while local and federal governments will make huge efforts to help the new system (more bridges so pedestrians don't need to cross the street, connected traffic lights or no lights at all, reserved lanes for SDCs...). As the economics become more irresistible, governments will outright ban human driving in the busiest area's, and few people will object to this.",39,0,False,self,,,,,

Self replicating and improving machines becoming what is effectively life!

Starting out as simple self replicating nanobots, and slowly becoming more complex, and intelligent.

I actually have thought of some theoretical but entirely plausible designs for the nanobots that parallel cellular life quite well.

resource efficient nanobots that leech power off of bigger nanobots, while they lack complexity, they dont lack numbers:these are the bacteria of the nanobot world.

Solar powered floaters that remain on the surface of water, and occasionally collect contaminants to make more of itself:the algae of the nanobot world.

Predator nanobots that use disable other nanobots for their resources and power:the Amebae of the nanobot world.

I give you the Sociotechnical Ecosystem...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/9bemkq/the_future_may_require_a_new_way_of_understanding/,Sevangerard,1535587075,"

Emerging ideas on technologically dependent and enhanced humans raise important ontological questions about current theories of identity, culture, and society and how a new identity paradigm creates security threats. There is currently no agreement on the fundamental nature or properties of the relationship between humans and technology, an interface ontology of sorts, but entire fields, like technoself studies, are emerging to try to understand this relationship. 

Threats to security are still evolving, and key sociotechnical issues, such as genetic manipulations, issues of privacy and surveillance, human enhancements, virtual identity, online anonymity, social-media mobilization, and the global decentralization of terrorist groups, all create new threats requiring innovative informed analysis to manage. The topics of identity and human behavior are certainly not unfamiliar to security scholars, but the analytical methodologies to study identity have focused primarily on psychological and sociological definitions or economic and political factors. In the face of this evolving interdependence and deepening hybridization of human and machine, what we know and how we study identity is being significantly altered. 

In my thesis entitled [A proposed cosmology of identity in the sociotechnical ecosystem of homeland security](https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/56924), I explore ideas surrounding the interface of social groups and technology in an attempt to develop better analytical tools for the study of social identity within homeland security. It evaluates traditional academic perspectives, which are combined and contrasted to distill important themes to contemporary thought on human- machine amalgamation. 

An extensive literature review identified a large gap in the fundamental organization of thoughts surrounding technological identity. As a result, the research includes an inductive inquiry in an attempt to build a fundamental ontological blueprint for the concept of a sociotechnical ecosystem. The intent of developing a framework for a sociotechnical ecosystem is to provide a technology dependent sociological system of reference, which can be used to understand or estimate the nature of a specific social groups technological identity or dependence, and how its behavior is shaped by the technological context. 

To assist in the development of this framework, I took the position of the soldier to begin extrapolating what would become the dimensions of the soldiers sociotechnical ecosystem. The Army Warrior Tasks, as defined by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, which states that soldiers, who are considered here as sociotechnical beings, need to shoot, move, communicate, survive, and adapt \[...\]. (r/http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/regs/TR350-36.pdf)

From this military example, one can deduce that several core dimensions are driving the soldiers operational environment, which will come to define their sociotechnical ecosystem. Soldiers require weapons, in other words artifacts, mobility, the ability to communicate, information about tactics, strategy and core knowledge, and finally, they need to be organized into a larger system of social structures, a network structure, which categorizes them both as subordinates within their organization and enemies to a foe. Combined, these dimensions of artifact, mobility, communication, information, and network structure form the scaffolding of sociotechnical ecosystems. As with any ecosystem, sociotechnical ones also need to constantly evolve and adapt to survive. The principles distilled from the position of soldiers are not exclusive to a military or homeland security context. The consideration of a multitude of positions or social groups yield the existence of the identical dimensions for other ecosystems. 

The fundamental intention of the thesis is not to think of technology in terms of the potential threats it may present to critical infrastructure, privacy, or user safety but rather the important influence it has on identity itself. Rather than focusing on the unintended consequences of technology from a utilitarian perspective, security practitioners need to consider the intended consequences of technology adoption on human identity and behavior. Deep consideration must be given to the ways a technological environment can be leveraged to undermine national and group identity, how it influences the sense of self, and the impact it has on psychological well-being. 

It is also critical to maintain a sharp focus on understanding all the ethical implications of sociotechnical innovation and design when used to alter human identity.

\- teacher should be guides, scholars and coaches, rather than bored and feared enforcers of discipline. their job should be to respond to any questions and enlighten interested students, not a factory of forcing random facts into students' heads

I am in the midst of preparing a proposal to the higher ups and Im looking for a bit of advice.

1. As VR in education continues to become more popular does anyone have an experience breaking into  the Chinese educational market?  As culturally, when it comes to education and technology they are not early adopters to current and emerging trends. 

2. I have seen the oculus has continued its streak of generosity as they provide headsets and training to new pilot locations around the world -Japan, Taiwan and the US. Does anyone have any idea how schools receive sponsorship as my attempts to reach out to Vive and Oculus have received no response. 

3. I have proposed we purchase the HTC Vive Pro. Are there VRs available now which are more suited to educational content or are Vive and Steam the most appropriate? 

4. If there are any faculty or teachers who have experienced the transition from the traditional learning  environment/curriculum to more technology based AR/VR attributes in their lessons? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
