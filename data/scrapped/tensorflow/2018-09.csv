the `[loss, gradients]` is the output? If so, what the function of the `gradients /= (K.sqrt(K.mean(K.square(gradients))) + 1e-5)`. From my understanding, its value will be wiped.

    def build_backprop(model, loss):

I want to use the TPU on training my model. The code I have is basically written in low level API using Graphs and Sessions. For the TPU it is necessary to use the TPUEstimator API. Basically I have to translate my code into the Estimator API first from what I understand.

Is this the only way for now I can use the TPU? Also how much work is it to translate the code into another API? 

Maybe someone can guide me through doing it?

I invite you to join new community of machine learning professionals: [r/MachinesLearn](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachinesLearn). Just in three days our community has grown from 0 to 2.5K members.

Here I will try to explain why we need a new community about AI and machine learning, and how it's different from the major existing ones, namely [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning), [r/artificial](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial), [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience) and [r/learnmachinelearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning).

After multiple discussions with moderators of those communities, here's how we position our new subreddit.

First of all, it's a community for industry professionals. This differs us from [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning), which is seen by many as an academic/research focused community. We assume that our typical reader is a machine learning professional, a programmer or an engineer. This differs us from [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience) whose range of topics is much wider, including a much larger body of statistics, visualization, storytelling, experiment design, A/B testing, and so on. This also differs us from [r/learnmachinelearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning), which plans a merger with [r/MLQuestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/MLQuestions) to focus primarily on answering ML-related questions from subscribers. [r/MachinesLearn](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachinesLearn) only accepts posts with questions if they contain answers, even if partial, to the problem of the poster.

Finally, the main focus of [r/MachinesLearn](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachinesLearn) is sharing links to tutorials (video or with source code), packages, libraries and frameworks, DIYs and how-tos. This differs us from [r/artificial](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial) which is often used as a platform to share AI-related news, and is seen by us as less programmer-oriented.

I hope now you see our niche. We will be happy if you join!

I am planning to use TensorFlow to create a DeepLearning tool that can classify/categorize customer tickets if they are related to one another.

Plan:

- Extract tickets and put them into a .csv (or maybe google sheets)
   - these tickets have their distinct fields to identify where they belong to (e.g customer name, description, issue, categories)
- I am planning to use TensorFlow's data API (tf.data) to feed my csv file so TF can read through it and classify which tickets are related
- Output: TF program will know which tickets are related with one another based from their distinct fields as mentioned above.

Initially, I am just planning to store everything locally
- CSV files and TensorFlow program installed and living in the same drive.

Do you think this will work? This project doesn't have to be complicated. As long as it can compare data and know they are related then it's a good start.

Each day, this window of length *n* is slid over by one day.

Another way I have seen is to use an LSTM unrolled into just a single timestep for these predictions. The previous *n*  (or more or less) datapoints are passed through the single timestep  LSTM one at a time to ""warm up"" its hidden state. Then, for each of the *m*  prediction days, just the input data for this day is fed into the LSTM  and a prediction is produced from this input and from the hidden state.

Is it possible to train an LSTM in TensorFlow which is unrolled into *n*  timesteps, and then use a single timestep LSTM with the trained  parameters to make predictions? My idea would be to train the unrolled  model, save the parameters, initialize a single timestep LSTM, and  populate its parameter with the stored ones. Can this be done?",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I have a very unbalanced dataset, so I want to use oversampling. I found the [imbalanced-learn library](http://imbalanced-learn.org/en/stable/) which has implemented some nice algorithms for this and want to use it with my existing custom estimator.

The problem is, that the methods don't work if there are strings in the dataset (which I have). Since I'm using an estimator, I of course also use feature\_columns to encode the strings in my data.

So I would need to get my training data back after it has been encoded by the feature columns and then I can oversample it. Is there any way to do this?

The trouble seems to be with compatible versions of CUDA, cuDNN, and tensorflow itself. The machine in question is running Ubuntu 18.04 (I wanted 16.04 but didn't get to choose this), and 2 NVIDIA Tesla P40's.

Can anybody tell me exactly which versions of CUDA, cuDNN, and tensorflow-gpu to install so that they all play nicely together? I don't mind compiling tensorflow from source but I'd rather not.

Thanks

I essentially want to create a low-function model that uses approx 3 inputs to predict future damage. The model would be more to show the capabilities of machine learning, and not the most accurate outputs. Is the TensorFlow environment the best for this?
