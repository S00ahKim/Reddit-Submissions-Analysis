How would I go about doing this?",0,1

I'm trying to create a lstm-rnn to generate sequences of music. The training data is a sequence of vectors of size 4, representing various features (including MIDI note) of each note in some songs to train on. 

From my reading, it looks like what I'm trying to do is have for each input sample, the output sample is the next size 4 vector (i.e. it should be trying to predict the next note given the current one, and because of the LSTMs incorporating knowledge of samples that have come before).

I'm using tflearn as I'm still very new to RNNs. I have the following code 
    
    net = tflearn.input_data(shape=[None, seqLength, 4])
    net = tflearn.lstm(net, 128, return_seq=True)
    net = tflearn.dropout(net, 0.5)
    net = tflearn.lstm(net, 128)
    net = tflearn.dropout(net, 0.5)
    net = tflearn.fully_connected(net, 4, activation='softmax')
    net = tflearn.regression(net, optimizer='adam',
                         loss='mean_square')

    # Training
    model = tflearn.DNN(net, tensorboard_verbose=3)
    model.fit(trainX, trainY, show_metric=True, batch_size=128)

Before this code I have split the trainX and trainY into sequences of length 20 (arbitrarily, but I read somewhere that training on sequences like this is a good way to do this).

This seems to be fine but I get the error
    ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (128, 16, 4) for Tensor u'TargetsData/Y:0', which has shape '(?, 4)'

SO: my assumptions so far is that the input shape [None, seqLength, 4] is saying to TF [batchLength (which gets fed by tflearn sequentially), sequence length, feature length of sample]. What I don't understand is why it's saying the output is the wrong shape? Am I assuming wrongly with the data sequence split? When I just try to feed in all my data without splitting into sequences, so the input shape is [None, 4], TF tells me the LSTM layer expects an input shape with at least 3 dimensions. 

I can't get my head round what the shapes of the inputs and outputs should be. It feels like this should be a simple thing -- I have a set of input sequences of vectors and I want the network to try and predict the next one in the sequence. There's very little online that doesn't assume a fairly advanced level of knowledge, so I've hit a brick wall. Really appreciate any insight anyone can give!",1,3

I would like to buy one which has a dedicated GPU (dGPU) for using it with TensorFlow.

Does anybody know if the following GPUs are supported by TensorFlow?

* 940MX
* M1000M
* M2000M

Are there comparisions of the performance of those 3?",1,1

Would be very glad if somebody cleared them up.

1) I installed tensorflow using pip. Does it mean that I still have to clone the git repository?

2) I ran the demo [tensorflow MNIST model](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html#run-a-tensorflow-demo-model) by 

    python -m tensorflow.models.image.mnist.convolutional

Does it mean that after the model completes training, the parameters are automatically stored on secondary storage? Or do we have to edit the code to include ""saver"" functions for parameters to be stored?

3) I was using the tutorial for LSTM-based [language model](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/tutorials/recurrent/index.html) . This article, at the [Run The Code](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/tutorials/recurrent/index.html#run-the-code) section, states 

&gt;We are assuming you have already installed via the pip package, have cloned the tensorflow git repository, and are in the root of the git tree. (If building from source, build the tensorflow/models/rnn/ptb:ptb_word_lm target using bazel).

I've installed using pip, but haven't cloned the git repo. Do I still have to do that? The file ptb_word_lm.py file is not present by default, and I had to create that manually by copying code from the official tensorflow git repository. I then simply ran

    python ptb_word_lm.py --data_path=/tmp/simple-examples/data/ --model small

and then it went through a number of epochs and got the perplexity down to &lt;120 and then stopped. I assumed that the model was trained(As 120 was the target for the small option). Again, are the NN parameters/weights automatically stored on secondary storage in this case?",2,3
