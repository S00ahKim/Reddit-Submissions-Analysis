so we have implemented a specific machine learning algorithm and trained it on cloud-ml engine on tensorflow. We have launched the model there and tested it a couple of times.

Where we are very confused is how to export the model so that it can be used on android tensorflow or on our desktop for prediction.

The problem is that there is very less coherent info on how to do this (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38947658/tensorflow-saving-into-loading-a-graph-from-a-file)

 Options include:    
1. freezing - https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12319    
2. savedmodelbuilder - https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12750  (which doesnt look to load on android)    
3. convert_variables_to_constants - https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/38 (not sure if this saves with all the values)    
4. tf.train.export_meta_graph - https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/meta_graph (is this the same as freezing) ?    
5. optimize_for_inference - https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow/issues/286 . However, they wrote their own [save function] (https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow/blob/479c83e14559fd5eceb9a9f612503b29a67fac5c/darkflow/net/build.py#L156) and [graph function](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow/blob/e4ab7c8bfbb1da3e7455047d5e8c8bae086125da/darkflow/net/help.py#L155)

Basically, we are all super confused on how to do this.

Even worse is the fact that in one case, we are using the Tensorflow high level estimator framework (https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/estimators) to do this. When we do this, we are even more stuck on how to save this model. Basically, we are here - https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/3340#issuecomment-302146136

Ultimately, we are badly stuck on how to export the whole model, graph, metadata, constants, variables in one shot to be usable on different platforms.

I have spent three frustrating days trying to install on Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10 with no luck.

I'm able to install on OSX and Ubuntu with CPU support only easily (10m installation), but havent been able to get anything to work with GPUs.

If anyone can find a tutorial with up to date versions (or just specific versions named) I'd appreciate it. I have gone through about 10-20 different tutorials and none work.

the main issue seems to be about installing CUDA; which version, which parameters, what PATH to set etc. 

I was able to get TensorFlow to install on Ubuntu, but without GPU support.

I couldn't get TensorFlow to run on Windows due to issues with CUDA. I also couldn't get CUDA files to compile / test CUDA due to issues with Visual Studio versioning (again, couldn't find a tutorial for CUDA that didn't include VS).

Thanks in advance.

I looked around and it has something to do with chosing the input and output layer, the script label_image.py has 'input' and 'output' set as default. The architecture I'm using is 'inception_v3'.

I can run it in Jupyter Notebook and it works fine.

Now I want to integrate this model with a software I will be distributing.

What is the best way to do this? Ideally Tensorflow's dependencies would just be installed with our software and then you would be able to run the software and the model in your CPU or GPU.

How can I achieve this? Most of what I find is about serving models online

I have a neural network that gets as an input a set of 15 numbers and needs to predict 15 different numbers. The thing is, that statistically there can be up to 10 other possible outputs. So then I thought to build it like this:

-Add another input neuron

-Propagate the net 10 times with the same input but each time add 0.1 to the extra input node I added , thus getting 10 varying results. (sameinput,0) (sameinput,0.1) (sameinput, 0.2) etc.. 

What I need is a cost function that will be able to find the option that was least wrong from the 10 outputted and backpropagate only this option. Now it's very difficult.
Because I get 10 output tensors all of shape (-1, 15) for each of the 10 iterations.. 

And I need for each particular row check in which tensor it had the least amount of error and backpropagate only this loss back to the net.
