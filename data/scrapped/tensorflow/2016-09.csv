The inputs are an image and a motion vector (e.g.: up:-1, right:3, down:4, left:-5) and the output would be the next image. For the training we would have the image, the motion vector and the correct next image (imagine like sequencial frames of a video, for instance).

I'm having troubles implementing this net and the vast majority of the things I find online are mostly for classification in specific labels. In this case there aren't any specific labels as the pixels in the output can be in different ranges of gray (if we consider a gray scale to simply).

Does anyone have any suggestions or know any tutorial?

Thank you in advance.",3,5

It is working great except for its outputs in the prediction section (line 90 of NeuralNet.py). They aren't ranging between -1 and 1. It is my understanding the neural nets are supposed to stay within that range, am I wrong?

To get started with the neural net simply download off of github and run playground.py. This will generate data consisting of two numbers per set. The net will output two classes per set with a 1.0 for whichever number is bigger and a 0.0 for the smaller number.

Please let me know if you find anything wrong with my code or have any suggestions. Thanks!",3,6

Let us, for the moment, ignore the reason as to why my samples have to have a length of 330k and just take it as a given.

    x = tf.placeholder('float', [None, 330750])
    y = tf.placeholder('float')
    nr_classes = 2
    batch_size = 64

    def conv1d(x, W):
        return tf.nn.conv2d(x, W, strides=[1,23,1,1], padding='SAME')

    def maxpool1d(x):
        return tf.nn.max_pool(x, ksize=[1,2,1,1], strides=[1,2,1,1], padding='SAME')

    def cnn(x):
        weights = {'W_conv1':tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([575,1,1,32]))
            ,'W_conv2':tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([575,1,32,64]))
            ,'W_fc':tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([157*64,1024]))
            ,'out':tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([1024, nr_classes]))}

        biases = {'b_conv1':tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([32]))
            ,'b_conv2':tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([64]))
            ,'b_fc':tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([1024]))
            ,'out':tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([nr_classes]))}

        x = tf.reshape(x, shape=[-1,330750,1,1])

        conv1 = conv1d(x, weights['W_conv1']) + biases['b_conv1']
        conv1 = maxpool1d(conv1)

        conv2 = conv1d(conv1, weights['W_conv2']) + biases['b_conv2']
        conv2 = maxpool1d(conv2)

        fc = tf.reshape(conv2, [-1, 157*64])
        fc = tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(fc, weights['W_fc']) + biases['b_fc'])

        output = tf.matmul(fc, weights['out']) + biases['out']

        return output

What I'd like to do here is significantly increase the stride of the max_pool and possibly of the 2d but actually 1d convolution (there is a function for conv1d in tensorflow but I can't figure how to build a model using it, since every max_pool function seems to expect 4D rather vector...)

However, every time I try to fiddle with this (I'm ashamed to admit, ""experimentally found"" numbers, I get strange errors about the size of Filter not matching the size of inputs... which rather dumbfounds me, since I am unaware how said ""inputs"" are computed.

Anyway, I don't expect people to actually have the time to look at this code (though I am crossing my fingers), rather, I'm wondering if you guys could recommend a Tensorflow tutorial out there that deals with the subject of 1 dimensional convolution (or at least with the subject of nD convolution) which explains EVERYTHING in the convolution model (even if the final model ends up being simplistic), as of now the  convolution for MINST on the official TF websites is kind of blurry as to why the hell going through a convolutional layer reduces the inputs size and how that reduced size is calculated, what the ""depth"" is and why my vectors needs reshaping into a strange [-1, original_vector, 1] vector.

Sadly enough, most ""advanced"" tutorials out there go into all kinds of details I, quite frankly, don't care or even cannot understand, is there a good tutorial out there that explains CNN's for dummies which explains 'em well enough so that I can then build my own, unrelated, models ?",0,3

I am the developer of [tensorflow.rb](https://github.com/somaticio/tensorflow.rb) the Ruby API for Tensorflow. 
The Ruby community has been very enthusiastic about developing a Ruby API for tensorflow (more on this [thread](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/50)) and I decided to work on it. 

I faced incredible challenges along the way but I do have many interesting findings that I would like to share with you guys. The tensorflow.rb gem can be found on this [link](https://github.com/somaticio/tensorflow.rb). Aside from that, I have written three blog posts where I have given a very brief summary of the work
 
1. [Introductory blog post](https://medium.com/@Arafat./introducing-tensorflow-ruby-api-e77a477ff16e#.mhvj9ojlj)
2. [Developers blog post](https://medium.com/@Arafat./ruby-tensorflow-for-developers-2ec56b8668c5#.97tng1qqi) (This post is for rubyists and developers of other languages.)
3. [Image Recognition Tutorial](https://medium.com/@Arafat./image-recognition-in-ruby-tensorflow-df5d5c05389b#.ty1vygtrg)

The project still needs a lot of work and contributions are very welcome. I encourage everyone to read the blog posts and then install and play with Tensorflow.rb. Any comments/suggestions would be nice and you can always post your thoughts on the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/tensorflowrb/Lobby?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge&amp;utm_content=badge) or comment below.
