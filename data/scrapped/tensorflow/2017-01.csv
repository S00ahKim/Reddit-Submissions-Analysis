And so, I'm going to start simpler with some basic project. I've looked through their code and think I get the main idea, but haven't gotten very far beyond pseudocode. But since I'm tackling this, I thought other people might want to practice something like this as well and why not share this or toss it out as a challenge to others so we all can benefit from how to tackle ML problems. So here's my planned projects to build up to this.
  
**A Simpler Problem: Color Removal**  
What if you wanted to do something more simple? Such as replace all of the reddish color in [one image](http://sites.psu.edu/ashtonrclblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5474/2014/03/Kool-Aid-Man.jpg) to [blue](http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f331/theMcollection/Lionskoolaid.jpg)?  
  
In my pseudocode I have it broken down as such:  
  
1. Take in the first image and convert it to a tensor (via scipy imread as utilized [here](https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style/blob/master/neural_style.py) ).  
2. Pick a color at random from within the image's palette.  
3. Pick an acceptable range near that color from within the image's palette.
4. Pick a color at random from within the goal image (in this case red kool aid man)'s palette.  
5. Replicate the range of red colors to a range of blue colors. 
6. Do the transformation.
7. Write the output image file.
8. Compare using PIL's image_entropy function: (ImageChops.difference(img1, img2))  
9. Try to minimize the difference, repeat until minimized.  
  
Now to fill in the pieces. Would you guys use a softmax to do this? Or does Tensorflow have [something better which is utilized for this purpose](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/image/) which you'd use? Would you even use Tensorflow? Or just stick to sci-kit learn?

**Project Iteration 2 - Texture exchange**  
The next iteration of the project will be replacing a texture, so exchanging hair from a dog with the bark of a tree? Could I write a tensorflow program to endlessly generate images of [Birds with Arms](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/birds-with-arms)?  
  
Some Questions:   

* See with the texture replacement, I don't have an image I can test it against. How do you tackle that?  
* Would you use an adversarial network and feed it my generated birds with arms vs others' birds with arms like they do in [StackGAN](https://github.com/hanzhanggit/StackGAN)?  
* Does anyone have any code they can show on how to set that up besides how StackGan did it? I'm fairly certain neither neural-style or neural-doodle used an adversarial network, so I'm still working out how they did that, but I'll get to that.

Anyways, hope this breakdown is useful for someone who is learning on the road as well. I'll let you all know how it comes along and let me know if you have any suggestions or things you've tried or would try. If you want to jump in and try your hand at it, I'd love to see other's tackling this.
