However, I have implemented interfaces with other optimizers that perform line searches, and I need to evaluate not just the gradient, but also the loss at multiple points for the same batch. Unfortunately, with the normal queueing system each loss evaluation will execute a dequeue instead of computing for the same batch several times.

Is there a way to decouple the dequeuing operation from the gradient/loss computation in such a way that I can execute dequeue once and then execute the gradient/loss computation several times on the current batch?

Edit: Please note that my input tensors have variable length. We work with molecular data and each molecule has a different number of atoms. This is different from image data, where images are typically all scaled to a fixed size. So, for example, I think that using a tf.Variable assignment will not work because tf.Variable must have a fixed size.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I have been studying ML and Statistics concepts since a month and it would be helpful if someone could guide me.

While doing an regression, we have multiple tests like ANOVA, p-val, F/T - tests etc. 
Are they applicable while using tensorflow - or is it because you are using a deep learning neural network, it is not necessary?
In the example on tensorflow.org, while an SGD is run, there are no tests performed. Does a learning NN take care of it, or do we need to run them. 

If we have to run them, is there some example where I can relate.

TL;DR - I am trying to understand whether we need to run diagnostics when using TF and are the applicable - if so how.

Edit1 - Does training take care of not needing to run diagnostic tests?
