But i want to avoid to recalculate each of them just to be able to visualize them. How could I go about returning the hidden activations from the training step without recalculating them?,1,1

First, the file wasn't in the example folder. I don't think this was a huge deal as I copied the files from the github repo. However next, when I tried to build the model with bazel, I get this error

    Problem with java installation: couldn't find/access rt.jar in /usr/lib64/jvm/java-1.9.0-openjdk-1.9.0 

I found git issue about this but haven't found anyone who posted a resolution:
https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/1068

I tried to install JRE 8 and use

    sudo update-alternatives --config java

but bazel still gives me the same JRE 9 issue. Has anyone encountered this and found a workaround? Could I be doing something wrong in switching the Java version? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",0,2

I'm new to TensorFlow this week.  As a preliminary idea that I had with a corpus of mine, I first just want to print the hidden layers/state after each incoming input example.  I need to do this simple thing ASAP.

I'm using the [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/recurrent/index.html) example, [whose source code is found here.](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/rnn/ptb/ptb_word_lm.py)

How can I do it?  I've gone through the MNIST sample and understand the basics, along w/ Colah's nice LSTM explanation.


**Question 1:** I've tried outputting the 'state' variable which is assigned on line 122.  Is this the variable I need?  I don't see any variable named 'hidden'.

**Question 2:** does this require using TensorBoard and serializing the graph?

**Question 3:** is there any other framework/library that is easier for printing the hidden layer of an LSTM?

Thanks!

I noticed Inception model always refer to 299*299 image for both training and input. 

I wonder if anyone : 

* knows if it's possible to train a model with larger images ? 
* knows if there's a theorical limit ? 

*Disclaimer1 : i'm totally noob on deep learning but registered to next coursera session* 

*Disclaimer2 : why should i want to use larger images ? the basic idea here is to know if tensorflow could analyse a full photo (5Mpx  for example) and analyse objects in background instead of forground* 

Thanks. ",1,3
