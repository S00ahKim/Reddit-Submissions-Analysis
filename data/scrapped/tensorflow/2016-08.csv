I want to learn about neural networks and image recognition/classification.
I already did severel Tutorials on the Tensorflow website and watched a lot Youtube tutorials.

My problem is that all tutorials that i did so far, worked with prebuilt datasets, or pretrained models.
Iam interessted in something that teaches how to build a simple neural net in Tensorflow. Including:

-decoding/implementing image data
-training/testing

Is there anything you could recommend?

So essentially I would like the equivalent of v.save(filename) and something like vloaded = model.load(filename) so that the restored v can be used with another sess.run(vloaded) but I was unable to find anything that actually works that way.

Presumably this is what its supposed to be. I do not know the meaning of the beginning of the output when running it on the GPU, does this mean it has successfully used my GPU?

If I had set up CUDA and CUDNN incorrectly, would the test program be able to run? 

What I'm getting at is: does this mean I have incorrectly setup CUDA and CUDNN, or is it different problem? I have heard of people getting issues when changing batch sizes and things.

I am quite new to Linux, it took me about a week to finally get the nvidia driver working on my distro. It also was quite complicated to install CUDA and CUDNN and add all the correct path environment variables etc. and all the numerous workarounds on many forums.

I worked with OpenCV and I built a little face recognition app but I used there Eigenfaces and I know that that's not the best method. So I found this tensorflow and it looks cool.

Where should I start to create a face recognizer?

I have a script where I can detect a face with Haar Cascades and than I would like to recognize that face (so I only got an image about the person's face).

I have another script where I can prepare dataset for people. Crops every face from the photo (about a person) and reduce the size of the photo to 512x512 and place the cropped faces to a folder with the persons name. So I think I'll have 40-50 photos from a person.
