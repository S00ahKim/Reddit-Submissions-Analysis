I'm currently working on a 5-computers cluster and the data I work with can't stay in the memory of a single node.

Has somebody here already tried TensorFrames ?
Is it mature enough to work with DataFrames ?
Would it be better to start from scratch with TensorFlow ?

I am confident in my understanding of the theory of RNNs - I have even coded my own very simple one from scratch.

However, I am now trying to become familiar with the TensorFlow API in order to implement my future NNs with it. Although I am confident with the theory behind NNs, I am struggling to grasp the intricacies of TensorFlow and what it does behind the scenes.

As my first project in Tensorflow I am attempting to write a RNN which takes fixed length ascending or descending sequences as inputs, and then classifies each as either ascending or descending. This is the code I have written until I reached my first error:

    from __future__ import print_function
    import tensorflow as tf
    import random

    numSequences = 10000
    sequenceLength = 5
    maxNumber = 100
    hiddenDimension = 16
    numClasses = 2

    def generate_data():
        data, labels = [], []
        for _ in range(numSequences):
            type = (0 if random.random() &lt; 0.5 else 1)
            temp = []
            if type == 0:
                labels.append([1, 0])
                temp.append(random.randint(0, maxNumber - sequenceLength + 1))
                for i in range(1, sequenceLength):
                    temp.append(random.randint(temp[i - 1] + 1, maxNumber - sequenceLength + i + 1))
            if type == 1:
                labels.append([0, 1])
                temp.append(random.randint(0 + sequenceLength - 1, maxNumber))
                for i in range(1, sequenceLength):
                    temp.append(random.randint(0 + sequenceLength - i - 1, temp[i - 1] - 1))
            data.append(temp)
        return data, labels

    x = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [None, sequenceLength])
    y = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [None, numClasses])

    W = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([sequenceLength, numClasses]))
    b = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([numClasses]))

    RNNCell = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicRNNCell(hiddenDimension)
    outputs, states = tf.contrib.rnn.static_rnn(RNNCell, x, dtype=tf.int32)

The input is a list of lists/sequnces of integers such as `[[1, 2, 3], [9, 8, 7]]` and the labels/outputs will be one-hot vectors of length 2 with the a 1 as the first digit corresponding to the input sequence being ascending, and the second being descending. 

Here are some queries I have:

1. Is the one-hot vector necessary? I have seen plenty of examples that use them, but if there are only 2 output possibilities, can I just output a single 1x1 tensor of 0 (descending) or 1 (ascending)?

2. Are my dimensions for the `x` and `y` placeholders ok? My input tensor will just be a single column vector, each row corresponding to each element of the sequence, and the output another column vector of length 2 (the one-hot vector)

3. This code is giving an error at the last line stating that the inputs to the `static_RNN` must be sequences - how is my `sequenceLength x 1` tensor not a sequence, and what shape does it need to be in order to be considered a sequence?

4. In all the theoretical explanations of RNNs, as well as coded examples (and the first RNN I coded) without using TensorFlow, there are 3 (or more depending on the amount of layers) weighted matrices - one transforming the input into the hidden state, one transforming the hidden state to output, and one transforming the hidden state from one time step into the next. Why is it that any RNN example using TensorFlow only has one of these matrices defined? And have I defined the correct one above (`sequenceLength x numClasses`)?

5. I haven't come to it yet, but I have seen examples of the training loop such as the one below. I understand this code as:

* each loop of in `range(num_epochs)` is one full forward and back propagation of the training data - so these loops are repeatedly training the network on the same dataset
* Each batch is some subset of the training data. After each, the variables are tuned in order to reduce the loss. So if we were to use my ascending/descending sequences example: say there are 10,000 sequences in the training data and 10 batches, this loop would iterate over 1,000 sequences, then adjust the variables, and repeat 10 times, each on a different 1,000 sequences, for each epoch.

Does all of this seem correct, or am I misunderstanding anything?

    for epoch_idx in range(num_epochs):
    x,y = generateData()
    _current_state = np.zeros((batch_size, state_size))

    print(""New data, epoch"", epoch_idx)

        for batch_idx in range(num_batches):
            start_idx = batch_idx * truncated_backprop_length
            end_idx = start_idx + truncated_backprop_length

            batchX = x[:,start_idx:end_idx]
            batchY = y[:,start_idx:end_idx]

            _total_loss, _train_step, _current_state, _predictions_series = sess.run(
                [total_loss, train_step, current_state, predictions_series],

                    init_state:_current_state
                })

            loss_list.append(_total_loss)

            if batch_idx%100 == 0:
                print(""Step"",batch_idx, ""Loss"", _total_loss)

I'm looking for a way to train my model by using a constant stream of data (kafaka).

Situation:
System A is a system that generates images and their labels and pushes the result as a json on a queue.
System B (Tensorflow) would listen to the queue and pick up the image + their label as they come in. It's not a batch, but they could be accumulated as a batch.

Specification:
I don't want the image size to be fixed. 
The JSON would contain the array of bytes, the size of the img (ex 16x16) and the actual label within the image.

What direction would you guy take to build the training architecture.

It's my first project using tensorflow, so any example is more than welcome.
