&gt; oops, you're not invited

Excuse me? Was this a mistake? Was my invitation lost in the mail? Because I've checked the post offices. All of them. And they tell me to leave pretty promptly after I begin demanding they turn over my invitation to Somi's celestial birth celebration.

# But It Gets Worse

&gt; Everyday is my birthday

Bros. D-does this mean..... I'm unniinvited to EVERY day? All of them? I used the transitive property of sadness to determine that because I was unniinvited to her birthday and everyday is her birthday that Somi privileges have been revoked for all days and that's unniceptable. Because that's like.....a lot of days. With No. Somi.



How do I handle this? She's out there. Shaking it like it were her birthday. Every. Day. Probably as we speak, even. And I have no invitation.



Soobin would never have done this to me. I'm devastated. Help, bros.

Andrew from [Truly Daebak](https://www.youtube.com/trulydaebak) here, and welcome to the Monthly K-Pop Recap.

Normally at the end of each month, we peruse /r/kpop's Upcoming Releases List (lovingly maintained by /u/tastetherainbeau), compile a list of our favorite songs and comebacks of the month, and discuss it as part of our weekly DaebakCast YouTube show.

However this month ~~due to scheduling conflicts hehe~~ we've decided to switch things up and write out a post here on Reddit. You can watch our Top 10 songs of the month video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwlbXS_QLco&amp;feature=youtu.be), and you can also check out [Youtube.com/TrulyDaebak](https://Youtube.com/TrulyDaebak), where you can also find our [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlTXLeq0IcwsnWQ7kZs2d_lnNNl0vestK) of all the songs covered in this post. Otherwise, let's get started!

(Hint: Click the Artist/Song Titles to see the MV, and click the  icon to see a screencap)

# August 1st

[**D1CE -** ***Wake Up***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo3A9QSVdrI&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/TuMoXP0.png)

This brand new five member boy group making their debut has former Produce 101 Season 2 contestants, and the 1st place winner from MixNine. This super hype Hip Hop/EDM boy group anthem is a pretty solid first outing, and fans of groups like Monsta X and Stray Kids are sure to enjoy this.

# August 2nd

[**Tiffany Young -** ***Magnetic Moon***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_t7Y8gBwU&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/2yDsWgI.png)

Released in anticipation of her North American tour of the same name, ""Magnetic Moon"" is Tiffany Young's 4th single of this year.

Despite featuring a striking visual aesthetic, and Tiffany's own brand of classy yet sensual outfits, the song itself has received a bit of a mixed reception from fans, myself included, for it's generous amount of vocal processing, that muddies an otherwise good release.

It's been noted that this is a signature stylistic choice of the song's producer, Fernando Garibay, that draws from influences like Lady Gaga and Madonna, but for me it seems unnecessary, and ends up distracting away from the incredible vocal talent Tiffany already possesses.

[**Rockim -** ***Don't Give It Up***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D86oGAT9EXg&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Like it says on the title, some of the songs we'll cover on this list won't be either good or bad, just plain weird.

Weird is pretty much the only way to explain the MV for this song. Rockim, showcasing a raspy singing style alongside the foreboding, industrial rock sounding instrumentals, juxtaposes the music to footage of some crazy pro wrestling moves and uhh, for lack of better term...[gratuitous plot](https://i.imgur.com/UIgYsue.png).

What compelled Mr. Rockim to make such a decision??? We may never know. It certainly leaves a lasting impression on the viewer, for better or worse.

[**Tur-v -** ***bbaji go***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6cXT61bE2Y&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/ZhSDa6P.png)

Continuing on the weird K-Pop train, Tur-v, a collaboration between comedic musical duo UV, and legendary 90s K-Pop group Turbo, blends the best sounds of early Korean pop music, trot, and eurobeat synths straight out of the Initial D sountrack.

Memeable as this song may be, it still manages to be an incredible vocal showcase for Kim Jong-kook, who these days is better known for his antics on Running Man than for his singing prowess.

# August 3rd

[**Choi Ye Geun -** ***Virtual World***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r61I3iAHydc&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/VJtHvJs.png)

If this [album art](https://i.scdn.co/image/391e19b7d8bd8f46fa952e2d02ed91a230e0d23d) wasn't already enough of a dead giveaway, Choi Ye Geun's ""Virtual World"" pulls some heavy inspiration from 80s City Pop and Disco for its sound.

From the funky bassline to the vintage synth chords, this song is sure to please retro-fanatics, and city pop/future funk enthusiasts like myself.

[**Chung Ha -** ***At the end (Hotel Del Luna OST)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFBk05QGFI&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/XnqUW6o.jpg)

Chung Ha is the latest singer to release music as part of the Hotel Del Luna soundtrack.

The tvN K-Drama, starring singer-songwriter extraordinaire IU, is already proving to be one of this season's most popular Korean dramas, and the accompanying OST may be one of the best we've seen in years, with female vocal powerhouses such as Taeyeon and Heize having contributed their talents.

Other notable Hotel Del Luna releases this month included, [***""See the stars""*** **by Red Velvet**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HABlP_2L384&amp;feature=youtu.be), [***""Can you hear me?""*** **by Ben**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ralf-WydvSs&amp;feature=youtu.be), [***""Done For Me""*** **by Punch**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hmHeTpMHjg&amp;feature=youtu.be), [***""Love del Luna""*** **by Taeyong of NCT &amp; Punch**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joVz8HZqzVU&amp;feature=youtu.be), and [***""Our Happy Ending""*** **by IU**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVzbknPjmoQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)

[**Pink Noise -** ***Smile Man***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RtrFxuzs2g&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/vVYoAlu.png)

One of the most interesting stories to come out of this month, ""Smile Man"" by Korean producer Pink Noise is an unreleased demo song intended for OH MY GIRL, with guide vocals performed by Chuu from Loona, prior to her debut.

Idols providing guide vocals is fairly common, but rarely does the general public ever get to hear the unfinished demos, so be sure to check out this rare peek into Chuu's pre-debut music history.

# August 4th

[**My Name Is Red-Haired Anne -** ***I'M JUST ME***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DStaXxsMkvo&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/oeX9Dnv.png)

Yes, that really is the actual name of this artist.

Complimenting the fairly unique stage name, it's only fitting that ""I'M JUST ME"" sports a moody electropop instrumental, reminiscent of Billie Eilish, on top of it's stylized music video, which incorporates real life footage, painted over with an eyecatching art style.

# August 5th

[**OH MY GIRL -** ***BUNGEE***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTD_yleCK9Y&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/cq5ZyYO.png)

Released as part of a repackage for THE FIFTH SEASON, ""BUNGEE"" is a return to the catchy upbeat style that we saw with Liar Liar, Coloring Book, and Remember Me.

Even as someone that gets easily jaded by these type of girl group songs, there's absolutely no resisting OH MY GIRL's brand of fun and cuteness.

[**SEVENTEEN -** ***HIT***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9CrRG6j2SM&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/s1VG36B.png)

Seventeen continues their banner year in 2019 with ""HIT"".

A slight reprieve from the EDM and Hip Hop influenced music on their previous album ""You Made My Dawn"", this song is a ""hype levels through the roof"" high energy dance track, complete with the the clean and intricate choreography that they've become known for.

They've certainly cemented themselves as a front runner for Best K-Pop Artist, and I'm excited to see what they'll have for us before the end of the year.

[**PinkFantasy -** ***FANTASY***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfjpUTt9PJQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/aDNhIIx.png)

PinkFantasy takes a page out of the Dreamcatcher playbook with this latest single.

Gothic rock style music feels right at home with the visually dark concept the group was already going, and adds another layer of intrigue to a group with a member permanently hidden under a Bunny mask.

[**CSVC -** ***SUMMER LOVE***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5fGpFwqeq8&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/SzpNVs2.png)

A project girl group made up of female solo artists, including CHEEZE, Stella Jang, Lovey, and Park Moonchi, CSVC's ""Summer Love"" is an homage to the style and music of 90s Korean Girl Groups like S.E.S and FinKL.

From the soft vocals, bright synths, and a Hip Hop breakdown filled with DJ scratching, pretty much everything about this song oozes authenticity and nostalgia.

# August 6th

[**FANATICS -** ***SUNDAY***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC_-T581Dbs&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/njvHjIF.png)

After FANATICS-FLAVOR released their pre-debut song ""Milkshake"", we now get the debut of the full 6 member lineup, including Chaelin from Produce 101 S1, and Doah from Produce 48.

If you'd like to hear our full thoughts on this song and the rest of their mini album ""THE SIX"", you can check out our DaebakCast video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD9sbycJ35s&amp;feature=youtu.be).

[**Dynamicduo -** ***Blue (Feat. Crush, SOLE)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYecF5RUU7k&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/YGyyvWk.png)

Dynamicduo are known to have some of the best features, and the trend continues here with newly signed P NATION artist Crush, and SOLE, a female soloist produced by Devine Channel.

This chill hip hop track definitely takes on some of its guests influences, with Crush proving his reliability on the hook, and SOLE's unique singing voice, definitely proving she deserved more than just one verse.

# August 7th

[**Rocket Punch -** ***BIM BAM BUM***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUOeg1LYF7Y&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/FXBO0l5.png)

Featuring a line up of former Produce 48 contestants Kim Suyun and Kim Sohee, as well as former AKB48 Team B Captain Takahashi Juri, it's safe to say that Rocket Punch came into 2019 as one of the most highly anticipated girl group debuts.

You can see the full review of their debut mini album ""PINK PUNCH"" in our DaebakCast video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeB3ld-Ve-8&amp;feature=youtu.be).

# August 8th

[**FANXY CHILD -** ***Y***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao2qQCqRSZs) [](https://i.imgur.com/DARgB4B.png)

The 6-man Hip Hop/R&amp;B collective including Zico, Crush, Dean, Penomeco, DJ Millic, and producer Stay Tuned, are all back with this chill, trap beat infused digital single.

Directed by Hobin, the MV makes great use of light and dark contrast, leaving an impact just as strong as the music the visuals are accompanied to.

# August 9th

[**V (BTS) -** ***Winter Bear***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk7ESz6vtyA&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/RYjZs96.png)

A mellow acoustic guitar ballad that channels more Bon Iver or City &amp; Color than it does Bangtan, the BTS One Letter Wonder gives us some of his unique vocals, alongside quiet moments captured during BTS' recent world tour.

# August 13th

[**Weki Meki -** ***Tiki-Taka (99%)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgrOljOXdCQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/xTJS2LL.png)

Though sadly both this song and it's MV have nothing to do with [advanced Spanish football tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiki-taka), it does however mark Weki Meki's first attempt at a summer comeback song.

To hear our full thoughts on Tiki Taka and the rest of Weki Meki's repackage album ""WEEK END LOL"" check out our DaebakCast video review [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvDPP2yOReo&amp;feature=youtu.be).

[**PENTAGON -** ***HAPPINESS***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D2Q5IfwA0c&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/B8ngpol.png)

Speaking of summer comebacks, PENTAGON's latest Japanese single ""HAPPINESS"" definitely falls under that same category.

New Jack Swing seems to be alive and well in 2019, and Pentagon combines this light-hearted track with, some trademark  summer beach scenes, and their enjoyably goofy choreography.

# August 14th

[**Robbin, 5Joo -** ***Let's Go To See The Flowers (feat. Ump)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHHBeCrTWQk&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/l1zS1BR.png)

Featuring softly sweet vocals, and synths straight from the Wii Shop Channel, ""Let's Go To See The Flowers"" might be one of the happiest sounding trap songs you'll hear all year.

[**Raiden -** ***The Only (Feat. Irene of Red Velvet)***](https://youtube.com/watch?v=nIONbXLkA1g&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/inOx0qs.png)

Raiden is a popular Korean EDM producer that has performed at venues such as Ultra Music Festival, and the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.

Recently signing an exclusive contract with Big 3 music label SM Entertainment, he continues his collaborations with SM idols, first with ""Always Find You"" with SNSD's Yuri, and now with Red Velvet's Irene.

[**015B, Wyne -** ***Sweet, Melting &amp; Dangerous***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKa6cMiSEes&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/bAzVRW4.png)

Combining elements of indie rock, and a surprise trap breakdown, 015B's ""Sweet, Melting &amp; Dangerous"" continues to experiment with both their sound and concept with each and every singer they collaborate with.

Wyne's vocal performance is easily the highlight of this song, perfectly conveying the bittersweet and lamenting nature of the vocal melody.

# August 15th

[**SHAUN -** ***36.5***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEeZ-cQHJeo&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/MnJeKKZ.png)

SHAUN released a trio of MVs for the songs off his latest single album ""36.5"".

The title track features a fun upbeat latin inspired instrumental, complimented both by SHAUNs smooth vocals, and a nice female vocal harmony during the bridge, [""To Be Loved""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up4MdPH_RUU&amp;feature=youtu.be) has a funky bassline with chill R&amp;B key sections, and [""Moon""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djQTmfhj7Zw&amp;feature=youtu.be) is a retro sounding pop ballad.

SHAUN's music has been hit or miss with me over the past few months, but really seems to be hitting his stride with the quality of these latest songs.

[**LIMHARA -** ***Mr. Green***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL0fcOo6ys4&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/8NPNv5C.png)

A female vocal trio who released their first single earlier in 2019, are back this time with a soulful 70s throwback song, complete with Beegee's-esque vocal harmonies, jazzy saxaphone interludes, and an incredible trumpet solo that manages to steal the spotlight.

# August 16th

[**ANS -** ***Wonderland***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMBhehFpimI&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/zzEniDc.png)

ANS' predebut summer track is one of the most interesting releases of the month.

The 5 member girl group, scheduled to debut later this year, had their MV released both on 1theK and the [official ANS Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOhT42cg6yk). However, the 1theK version had issues with the videos framerate appearing choppy and laggy, whereas the ANS Official version was fine.

First impressions are everything in K-Pop, and this technical error may have unfairly dealt a blow to ANS' debut hopes.

[**KIDZ BOP Kids -** ***Boy With Luv***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuSsLzORDTQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/AAe2Ltj.png)

If last month's Seoul Town Road by Lil Nas X &amp; RM didn't convince you that we live in a computer simulation, then this KIDZ BOP cover of BTS' ""Boy With Luv"" should do the trick.

Featuring lyrics sung entirely in Korean, and a dance cover video in the middle of Times Square, its' more and more proof that K-Pop has hit mainstream recognition here in the US.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go purge myself of this version before it gets permanently seared into my brain.

# August 19th

[**THE BOYZ -** ***D.D.D***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTTczRe-Pj0&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/JzI0xZ8.png)

THE BOYZ' 2nd come back of 2019, this MV features various scenes filmed in New York City during their US visit for KCON NY.

You can see our full review of ""D.D.D"" and the rest of the songs off their new mini album ""DREAMLIKE"" in our DaebakCast video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViUNWuf6c4w&amp;feature=youtu.be).

[**EVERGLOW -** ***Adios***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gX_p1VkgA4&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/GiUFga6.png)

Continuing their non-English title trend, ""Adios"" is EVERGLOW's first comeback song.

Despite encountering visa issues that prevented them from attending both KCON NY and KCON LA, EVERGLOW continues to be one of the most popular new acts of 2019, with both Bon Bon Chocolat and Adios amassing 39 million and 46 million YouTube views respectively.

From my perspective however, Adios doesn't manage to hit the same level of quality that Bon Bon Chocolat reached back in March, mostly due to how the loud EDM drop style of this song simply feels derivative of BlackPink, but there are stil some parts I enjoy, like E:U's rap verse, and the high budget cinematography from the accompanying MV.

[**Red Velvet -** ***Umpah Umpah***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHS9E6JFja8&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/2lBKpLy.png)

Following the onomatopoeia theme of ""ZIMZALABIM"", ""Umpah Umpah"" has fun upbeat vocals that match the bright, colorful, yet absurd MV, a staple of Red Velvet's concept over the years.

To hear our full thoughts on Umpah Umpah and the rest of The ReVe Festival Day 2, check out our DaebakCast video review [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU-vx1QAM4Q&amp;feature=youtu.be).

# August 20th

[**Celeb Five -** ***I wish I could unsee that***](https://youtu.be/p21n7yQX4uE) [](https://i.imgur.com/SF8HD2A.png)

A drastic change from their usual 80s throwback concept, this ""emotional"" ballad from the Queens of Comedy, Celeb Five, showcase some great vocals, elegant choreography and outfits, all with a sincerely moving narration, courtesy of Seolhyun from AOA.

[**AKB48 -** ***Sustainable***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pKfxbCHLoU&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/QR5ojS4.png)

Wondering what your favorite 48 Group members from Produce 48 are up to back in Japan? This list will cover AKB48 and all the sister groups from time to time.

Featuring familiar faces such as Muto Tomu, Matsui Jurina, Shiroma Miru, and Tanaka Miku, ""Sustainable"" is a throwback to the classic AKB48 sound that first made the group famous in the mid-to-late 2000s.

The MV features plenty of easter eggs and nods to previous AKB48 singles, as the girls put together a time capsule which outlines the history of AKB48, and the ""sustainable"" nature of the music they wish to leave behind.

# August 21st

[**IZ -** ***Final Kiss***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkzDPFV7oEw&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/XCjN6Ls.png)

In contrast to the fun and colorfulness of the MV, IZ's latest comeback song still has all the same heavy guitar riffs and loudness that the idol band have become well known for.

With their singles Eden, Hello, and now Final Kiss all releasing in 2019, IZ are certainly positioning themselves to be a dark horse candidate for Best K-Pop Band.

# August 22nd

[**UP10TION -** ***Your Gravity***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOo3fJ8lqbA&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/Kaj1aci.png)

While UP10TION may have lost Kim Wooseok to Produce boy group X1 for the next few years, they don't miss a beat whatsoever with this catchy dance track, and brightly pastel colored music video.

The group will only grow more in popularity once Wooseok returns, and they're certainly starting off on the right foot with a quality song like ""Your Gravity"".

# August 23rd

[**Sam Kim -** ***WHERE'S MY MONEY***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INzd1VNEUuE&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/Nkz3gRy.png)

Former runner up on K-Pop Star Season 3, Sam Kim returns to his roots on this single, with his trademark bluesy guitar riffs, powerful vocals, and rapping sections that easily channel the likes of Ed Sheeran and Jason Mraz.

He continually proves to be one of the most talented performers in all of Korea, so be sure to check out the rest of his music if you enjoy ""WHERE'S MY MONEY"".

# August 25th

[**PigLipstick -** ***Dongle (Feat. Ritz)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuoJdEMj4VQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/OQLFZ8g.png)

This debut track from PigLipstick pulls some disco influences with its guitar riff and bassline, as well as some future funk type production during the drop.

Add in the Korean Indie vocals, and this song ends up being one of the real hidden gem releases of this month. Definitely check this out if you're a fan of artists like Oohyo.

# August 26th

[**Jimin Park -** ***Stay Beautiful***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfLZnNby97c) [](https://i.imgur.com/a73vUHR.png)

Jimin Park's last release under JYP Entertainment before leaving the company, ""Stay Beautiful"" might be her best work by far as a solo artist.

This magnum opus of trap R&amp;B, blues guitar, and future bass instrumentals feel right at home with her smooth vocal delivery.

Having often been under the public microscope for her appearance, there's no better person in the K-Pop landscape to release a song about having confidence, and a positive self image, than Jimin Park. (Be sure to check out the ['Jamie Ver'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9Vlj5HgAiw) of this song for an English rendition)

Her preaching most certainly goes into practice with this MV, having the confidence to sport a bold purple ombre and blonde hairstyle, with an outfit that leaves her many tattoos in full view.

Also making an unexpected appearance in the video are June &amp; Jung Jinwoo from the Hip Hop musical collective ""PLT"", which would make for an exciting musical collaboration in the future.

While Jamie leaving JYP after 7 years with the label may be bittersweet, she's definitely leaving her mark on the company with ""Stay Beautiful"". Both Jamie and her fellow 15&amp; bandmate Baek Yerin have earned my consideration for Best Female Solo Artist of the Year; the future seems brighter than ever for both singers.

# August 27th

[**the Night of Seokyo -** ***Story Line (Feat. Dawon)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6NupjOtMwI) [](https://i.imgur.com/UcKkjs4.png)

the Night of Seokyo are back again with mainstay collaborator Dawon for this latest single.

A slight departure from their usual style, ""Story Line"" trades in loud 80s synths, for some more subtle effects. This in addition to a Latin guitar section makes for a unique experimental sound that blends together elements of indie, electronic, and tropical music, anchored by Dawon's whisper-like vocal style.

[**PENIEL -** ***Flip (Feat. Beenzino)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USlrvoGQGEc&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/qe4Qdma.png)

""Guys like me we're like them holographic shadowless Pokemon cards, we rare"" is either the greatest English lyric ever used in Korean music, or the worst English lyric ever used in Korean music.

I'm still not sure.

[**X1 -** ***FLASH***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlQEKB2H7z4) [](https://i.imgur.com/zVH4TLp.png)

The hotly anticipated debut of Produce X 101's boy group, X1 looks to make their mark on the K-Pop industry with this energetic dance track, crafted nby members of K-Pop production powerhouse MonoTree.

To hear our full thoughts on FLASH and the rest of the songs on X1's debut mini album ""QUANTUM LEAP"", check out our newest episode of the ProduceCast.

The video review is scheduled to release on Sept. 5th, so be sure to subscribe to [Youtube.com/TrulyDaebak](https://Youtube.com/TrulyDaebak) so you don't miss it.

[**SUNMI -** ***LALALAY***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrggmyDhWBo) [](https://i.imgur.com/eVvVOM4.png)

SUNMI's 2nd comeback of 2019 continues her weird and wacky visual style, alongside her latin pop influenced sound that stretches back to 2017's ""Gashina"".

Despite the visuals being on par with her previous release ""Noir"", I feel the quality of production and overall interesting vocal elements falls just short.

Sunmi certainly has one of the most unique styles in K-Pop, and her musical ambition can be greater than some of her contemporaries, but at least for my own liking, this is just a song that doesn't resonate with my particular taste in music.

[**GIRLKIND XJR -** ***MONEY TALK***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sPT5wJxnn4&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/DsPeQid.png)

Members Xeheun and JK headline GIRLKIND's first ever subunit, XJR.

Unfortunately, this attempt at an American style trap song ends up with production quality that's all over the place. From poorly leveled vocals, to a beat that attempts to simultaneously sample every popular American Top 40s hit of the past few years, ""MONEY TALK"" is yet another microcosm of Next Level Entertainment's numerous attempts in getting this group into the limelight.

Everything, including the concept, the music, the choreography, the styling, and the cinematography, everything needs to improve for GIRLKIND as a whole, for them to survive past their two year anniversary in January of 2020.

[**Fanxy Red -** ***T.O.P***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Sz3UhwFPYg) [](https://i.imgur.com/aJZ7pxI.png)

This 4 member Chinese group, formerly known as Acrush or FFC-Acrush, are making their first move into the Korean market with the new single ""T.O.P"".

Originally making headlines back in [2017](https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/27/entertainment/china-acrush-boy-band-androgny/index.html), Fanxy Red's androgynous concept, which features an all female lineup, styled and presented in the same vein as male idol groups, is one of the more unique ideas to come to market.

Despite the nonconformity to tradition, Fanxy Red has attracted a significant fanbase, with over 150,000 followers on Chinese social media site Weibo.

This attempt to break into the K-Pop space makes sense to help reach a wider audience, but maintaining a following in an already saturated musical landscape will be enough of a challenge for a group with no native Korean members, on top of having a gender-neutral vision that flies in the face of established idol concepts and mores.

[**Crush -** ***NAPPA***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoMIAo0a2TA) [](https://i.imgur.com/X3i14v8.png)

His first release under PSY's newly established P NATION music label, Crush's ""NAPPA"" is a trademark melancholy R&amp;B track.

The music video plays into this well, with Crush seemingly guilt ridden and without motivation after stealing someones bike in the middle of LA, making light of the deeper romantic strife at the heart of his lyrics.

Crush's creativity in both songwriting and visual accompaniment has always been his greatest strength, and it looks to flourish even more at his new home in P NATION.

[**SUMIN -** ***Love Is Strange (feat. Qim Isle)***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NqFPVMTJjI&amp;feature=youtu.be) [](https://i.imgur.com/ffywLr9.png)

Part of the Onstage Digging Club Seoul project, this remake of a [1987 song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZs8SHbMlaw) by Korean artist NAMI is almost unrecognizable in all aspects.

What originally was a happy-go lucky 80s synth pop track, now sports SUMIN's own brand of trippy and experimental R&amp;B.

The MV lives up to this notion as well, featuring retro-futuristic, iridescent clad ballerinas, a recreation of the moon landing, and a nightmare-inducing CG human/fly/mermaid hybrid.

SUMIN spared no efforts to make this song her own, and continues to be one of the most avant-garde artists in Korean music today.

I think mine would focus on a different group every episode, like it could talk about well-known groups in a fun way but also introduce groups that people may not know as well. Or maybe each episode could be like a syllabus/greatest hits thing where they go through the best that each group has done on stage, on various albums, behind the scenes; stuff like that. Maybe give out awards to members for different things, like Most Fashionable; Best Dancer; stuff like that? idk, I love that kind of thing!

Also.... I know it would be too controversial but as a huge multi I would love to listen to a debate style podcast where two hosts compare similar groups and go back and forth about who has better discography, MVs, performances, styling, variety show appearances, etc etc. and then land on a winner at the end. People may complain too much but I love basically every group out there and I would love to hear two people trying to figure out who is better at what kinds of things.

I, as I'm sure many of you have been watching and listening to the performances of multiple girl groups in Queendom.
However, in regards to AoA's cover of Egotistic by Mamamoo, I think there was something missing and they did not deliver it the way I know they could have delivered it.


Let me clarify, I like certain songs of AoA and they have good vocals, however I know what AoA sounds like and how they can deliver a song and this wasn't it. This wasn't the AoA that delivered 'Mini skirt', 'Heart attack', 'Like a cat' or etc. when they deliver their songs they make it theirs and this cover just wasn't it. That AoA I know by their sound and delivery and that AoA is amazing. 


Now I love Mamamoo, but when I see a great cover of their songs I can appreciate it and I so wanted to love AoA's cover, but I just couldn't because it wasn't the AoA I know from performances delivering it - it was clear that they held back, that for some reason they didn't make it as big as they could have, that it didn't have the same classy but still sexy flow that AoA is known for. 


Which leads me to believe that they either held back, the producer really messed them up or etc. If this was the same AoA that delivered Mini skirt on on Queendom, it would have been amazing and regardless of my stans I would have said, yes you go girls - you were amazing. But this was like a half baked pancake, not bad but not amazing either.


Am I the only one thinking like this? Do you agree that they held back? I think the producer really did them a disservice or there was a conflict with their image contract, because this wasn't the AoA I know.",0,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm looking for new artists, I always try to stay active in the K-World releases, but it is a LOT sometimes. 

Is there any group, band, soloist, rapper you think we should feature?? Also, any Music Video you think is a must watch.

I'm open to any recommendation.

Thank you.

Hands down one of my absolute favourite things about kpop is the choreographies. Whether its just watching them or learning them, I really enjoy almost being a part of the music.
So my question is, what are some of the most original and impactful choreographies youve seen? Basically anything that was really different and maybe even groundbreaking.
For example, the first thing that comes to mind for me is Cherry Bomb by NCT. The moves were so unlike anything I had seen before and I still think its so unique.

Please let me know so I can look them up and enjoy them in my free time ",22,7,False,self,,,,,
