Its been a while but since TWICE releases so many products Ive kinda just made more room for them while putting my extra albums in my closet. The additions have been mostly just girl groups that I currently like which is crazy since I have so many more than my last post,0,1

What are some songs that you'd add to a playlist that radiates BDE from your favorite Kpop artist? Non-Kpop recommendations are welcome as well, as long as you include some kpop too-- after all, this is /r/kpoppers. I recently added the following songs for reference of what I'd consider a ""Bad Bitch"" song.                
HyunA's Red                 
BLACKLIST (ft LE)              
Do it!              
LE's Velvet                
Non-Kpop songs like CHANMINA's I'm a Pop/Doctor or Qveen Herby's BDE are always welcome as well.

42,2019-3-6,2019,3,6,4,axpglo,I really need to share my K-Pop experience with someone. I also have a few questions as a newbie.,flippdipp,1551815932,"I just recently got into k-pop a couple months ago and I don't know anyone else in my real life that is into it, so I just found this community and wanted to share so I hope this is the right place. I knew k-pop was a thing but never really paid any attention to it for most of my life. The first group I heard about was BTS randomly from a youtube video I watched from a Korean youtuber who danced to DNA. I was like hmm that song is pretty cool what's BTS? So I looked into their music and added some new songs to my playlist. In the process, I found out more about them and their story and the leaps and bounds they've accomplished for k-pop artists on an international scale ,so I kind of got a little starstruck and watched enough dance practices, mvs, performances, and variety show clips until I knew who was who. At this point, I thought neat I can follow BTS and like k-pop low-key it will be great! Enter Monsta X, listened to HERO since it was in my recommendeds on spotify and really liked it so I watched the dance practice and well the rest is history. Learned who's who and I was like ok two groups is manageable I can do this its still low-key. Then, I watched GOT7's ask-in-a-box on a whim and that's when I knew I was in trouble lol. Finally, got names and faces down for them and thought I would be satisfied. At first I didn't know that some groups are formed from survival shows like MX was so ended up watching No Mercy (so emotional btw jeez) and one of the comments said that MK debuted in ONF, so I mean I had to take a look, and ended up downloading literally every song they have on spotify. I haven't had as much time lately so still learning names and faces, but omg what is happening to me??? This doesn't even take into account the groups that I've come across that have songs in my playlist (stray kids, ikon, btob, EXO, blackpink, red velvet, and don't even get me started on NCT, and now ATEEZ and TXT!!! god help me) that I want to follow but I am trying not to sell my soul to this, it might be too late though. Sorry I mostly like boy groups so far, but can anyone blame me. I think at this point I'm officially kpop trash and I guess I'm not sorry. My current playlist has like 5 songs in English and even one of those is by DEAN lol. So if anyone actually read all that was it like this for anyone else or am I just a crazy obsessive weirdo and I'm also really curious because no matter what group I stan I've never been able to choose a bias. Is it normal to have one? How is it even possible. I'd love to be able to hear people's reasoning about it since I have no one to gush to about any of this. Thanks for your time.",24,23

127,2019-3-17,2019,3,17,0,b1tna1,"How my turned me, a metal-loving music fan into a kpop lover",Alaskan_Lost,1552750261," 

I grew up listening to anything metal/rock. I spent 20 years listening to the same 50 songs over and over and as time went on I would stop turning on the radio. I was getting tired of the same songs on rotation for years upon years. When she started to listen to kpop I rolled my eyes wouldn't even give it a chance. As time went on I would find that kpop songs were stuck in my head and I found it annoying. You're not going to hit me with that Du-dudu-du-du. I'm too much of a man for that.

That's when she started explaining things like ""bias's"" to me and she forced me to pick one. I chose Wendy from Red Velvet cause, cute. About two weeks later I was singing Ice Cream Cake in my head. Then it was TT by Twice. Then I heard Black Pink and I was like wow. The beats are amazing. The way the songs were arranged was amazing. But what I noticed is, I had a new love of music. I have never heard anything like that before and was finding myself reading about the bands online and looking up songs. I must have listened to CLC - I like it 500 times in two weeks. I was hooked. But I was too ashamed to play it in the car with the windows down for fear of looking like less of a man. That soon changed.

Look, I'm not good at saying what I feel the correct way. I know this post is in terrible format but the point is that now I love kpop. I love the fans. I love the fact that I can enjoy music again and have this huge catalog of new songs (new to me anyway) that I can enjoy. I no longer get annoyed by whats on the radio because it's now usually a kpop song I haven't heard. I roll down the windows and blast Very, very, very. I crank up CLC - No. I love me some Twice. And I've started to like boy bands in kpop because they don't mess around. They just shred those lyrics.

So, thank you kpop for giving me my love of music back. Thank you for welcoming a metal loving guy into the fold. And thank you, Wendy for being awesome. I'm now just a music lover not a metal/rock lover. I found out that no matter how old I am I still can learn something new. And I'm excited for US tours of bands because WENDY SIGN MY SHIRT!!

And mostly, thank you to my wonderful wife for opening my eyes and sharing something she loves with her husband. It's helped our relationship grow because we have more to share with each other. Thank you for letting me get this off my chest.",8,43

Saw some group called PD48 sang it, then found out that it's just some TV show. It's clearly not unknown as it has a couple of million views but how is a song that polished being released by a reality tv show. I think it's better than all the popular songs I heard last year and would be in the hundred of million views if Twice/Blackpink had released it, sweeping awards etc

I realise you could say this for any unknown song but objectively as someone newish who has listened to most popular kpop songs from 2018 and has no bias, Rumour is a certified banger and catchy as hell.",4,0

But sometimes stage fashion could be too extrime,so lets focus on simple comfortable style.


Whos style is your favorite? Maybe there is some inspiration that you drew from idol? Whos airport pictures you are always looking forward to see?Lets share

I was thinking about this earlier, about how some fans do and say some things due to ignorance or just lack of experience in life or some other reason. Sometimes they'll get into heated arguments online and may or may not learn from them because they feel slighted. 

So I thought of creating this ""explanation thread"" here so you guys could list certain  fan (or even artists) behaviours or that are wrong and calmly explain why they are too.

Hoping we can all learn from the stuff that's posted on here.
