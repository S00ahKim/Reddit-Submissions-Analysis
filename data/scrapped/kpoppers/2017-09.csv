Have you wanted to discuss, critique and learn about Kpop on the go? I wanted introduce a kpop podcast I've been working on for the past year. It's called ""Kpopcast"" and you can listen to the weekly program from your phone on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kpopcastshow), [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/kpopcast/id1133068655?mt=2), [Google](https://play.google.com/music/m/Itifq5exzrsnme5ldokwmmmshia?t=Kpopcast), [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/peter-lo/karea), etc (really anywhere you can find a podcast). We review the latest releases in kpop, provide weekly song recommendations, and bring on subject matter experts to weigh in around a topic. I think podcasting as a medium is still fairly nascent for the kpop crowd, but hope you give us a listen and consider subscribing!

We're not the only one doing this. See [this post here](https://kpopcast.net/2017/09/10/12-kpop-podcasts-to-listen-to/) on some other fun podcasts you can find and reasons to listen to each. 

We're continuing to tweak and perfect the show format based on listener feedback so if you have some constructive criticism we're receptive to that too. ",3,4
