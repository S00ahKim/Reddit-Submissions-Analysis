I like to think they are fairly diverse playlists tho so I hope any of you who check it out enjoy most of the songs on them! or just check them out to disagree with me hahaha

Feel free to disagree and argue with me about my rankings (you might even change my mind) but let's keep it friendly ;)

This is my [Top 75 Kpop songs of 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkkYYtowiwfg-vchifYfnYa8EUfn-jZpx).

Same as last year I tried to make a Top 50 and I just couldn't do it. A lot of the lower songs a subject to moving up/down based on my mood tbh but I tried to put them in a fairly cemented place as best I could!

This one is also an annual playlist I've started doing, my [Top 100 Kpop songs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkkYYtowiwfhUgb2NTlC4evbsvvdVOArS&amp;disable_polymer=true).

This list is my all time favourite Kpop songs as of 1/1/18 it was much harder than the other one to make as I had to cut about 20 songs that had made the list last year.

Oh and the playlist is ordered such that my favourite song is the last song to play - just to clear up any confusion.",1,2,False,self,,,,,

**How to nominate and vote**

Categories for the Razzies can be anything your hearts can imagine.  So the first step is to post whatever category you want in the comments below.  Then other users (or even you) can add nominees to that category.  Be sure to include pictures and links when appropriate.  Everyone else upvotes the nominees they want to win.  At the end of the voting period, we'll take the top 25 most upvoted categories and announce the winners on r/kpop.

**The voting period will end on January 15th at around 00:00 est.**

Some background - a discussion earlier today with my friends about Asian music lead to them talking about Korea and agreeing that the west has influenced their music, and vice versa they have influenced western music. But the kicker, stupidly, is that none of them could really say why they thought it, and I'm a pretty new listener of KPOP so didn't really have a lot to say. So now I'm genuinely curious what other people think, and I could only think of asking on here because it has been grating on me all day that I couldn't really answer it myself - has the west influenced Korean music, and has KPOP influenced the west? 

Thoughts?

Im working on a psychology project examining how ones music preferences and personality are related to their work and other relevant outcomes.  I pretested the survey for length, if you have just 15 minutes to spare, can communicate fluently in the written form of the English language, are at least 18 years old, and are either working in a paid capacity or attending school you are eligible to participate.  I will be granting access to your personal results through a password-protected system.  If you would be willing to help a young student out, I would really appreciate your time and effort.

Thanks again,

About two weeks ago, the Idol Star Athletics Championships were held and they will be broadcast soon.

I took a special interest in the women's 4x100m relay and thus decided to collect the results from every single instance of this relay ever run, at https://pastebin.com/1US9yKDA. They're in YAML format so if you want to parse the data and do some analysis on it I suppose that would be possible.

I'm not sure why I take such an interest in Idol Athletics. Something to do with:

* We know k-pop group members need to be fit enough to sing and dance on stage, but now we are curious as to whether they are fit in other ways as well
* Well, being fit is a good thing no matter what your job is, isn't it? It's interesting to see who keeps themselves fit
* At the end of the day, just looking for more reasons to like your favourites

Why the 4x100m race in particular? Probably because it's relatively easy to collect results for (as opposed to, say, archery!)... and because I also used to run races. Not saying I was any good at running, but nevertheless I did run.

Sistar was dominant in relay for a long time, but starting in 2013 they no longer ran, even though they were still participating in archery. I wonder why. Then 2013-2015 was an era of mostly A Pink wins, though strong contenders EXID and Dal Shabet each take one win, and Sistar makes one triumphant return in 2015. Oh My Girl emerged as strong contenders and took two wins in a row by a large margin (4-5 seconds). Funnily enough, both of those wins were against the same opponents. Oh My Girl has always fielded the exact same team, except for this most recent event where Jiho sat out presumably because of her injury. Wondering if a new era is here or if Jiho will make a triumphant return next time.

163,kpoppers,t5_2vb0n,2018-1-30,2018,1,30,9,7twtsd,self.kpoppers,It's the zombie apocalypse. You get to make a roster of 10 idols to join your survival team. Who do you pick? (but there are rules),https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/comments/7twtsd/its_the_zombie_apocalypse_you_get_to_make_a/,Im_Currently_High,1517270642,"**Rules:**

1. You only get 2 idols from one specific group. (keeps this whole exercise interesting)

2. Your roster cant be one gender (must have at least one male and female)

3. Dont base your picks only on your biases. You can pick your favorites for some of them, but remember, you must survive the apocalypse! Make sure you think strategically. 

___
___


**Bonus options:**

1. Explain why you made each pick.

2. Who are your honorable mentions? Why didn't they make the list?

___
___



**My picks:**

1. **Jisoo** - BlackPink - My ultimate bias. I must protect her at all costs.

2. **Jennie** - BlackPink - Well rounded and seems to have a good strategic 
mind. Also has great chemistry with Jisoo. They make a great dynamic duo.

3. **Sana** - Twice - Shes hilarious and will keep morale high. Its the apocalypse, someone needs to entertain us, and that will be her job. (although her clumsiness could prove to be a liability But no Sana no life, am I right?!?!)

4. **Jihyo** - Twice - The best leader in Kpop. She knows how to unify large groups of people and is always there to comfort her fellow team members. Plus she has proven to be an extremely dedicated and hard worker. (She will also keep Sana in line when shit gets serious)

5. **Seulgi** - Red Velvet - You just KNOW Seulgi would kick ass during an apocalypse. The girl is bad ass as fuck.

6. **Yeri** - Red Velvet - Although she may seem small and lack physical strength, I have a feeling Yeri would end up being a surprisingly good asset in an apocalypse. She seems resourceful and like she may come up with some outside the box solutions to problems when we are in a bind. 

7. **Somi** - I.O.I - She's young, but has a lot of potential. Shes a blackbelt in taekwondo. She learned from her father (who you should check out, he's an awesome guy). I think it's safe to assume she probably also learned some other badass shit from him as well.

8. **BM** - Kard - Have you seen him? He's shredded. Simply from a physical strength perspective he makes sense. He is also from America (like me) so itd be nice to have someone with similar cultural background to relate to. 

9. **T.O.P.** - BigBang - Not only is he cool and funny, but hes a taller fellow and has some military training. Easy pick. 

10. **RM** - BTS - Im not even a big BTS fan or anything, but RM is clearly a genius. If you watch him in interviews (both English and Korean) he just comes off as a multitalented and intelligent individual. Plus hed make a great leader with Jihyo.


___
___


**Honorable mentions:**

1. **Lisa/Rose** - BlackPink - I love these girls (BlackPink is my favorite group), but there's the pick two rule So I had to go with Jisoo/Jennie instead.

2. **Dahyun** - Twice - Shes my twice Bias, but strategically she doesnt work in my lineup. 

3. **Jeongyeon** - Twice - Bad ass like Seulgi of RV. She would probably kick butt as well.

4. **J.Y. Park** - Does he count as an idol? I couldn't decide, so I ultimately didn't put him in the roster. However, if we do count him as an idol, then I would definitely put him on my team. Whether you like him and his music or not, you must admit he is a strategic genius. JYP artists are killing it financially lately, and it's arguably because J.Y. Park runs one of the most efficient companies in Kpop. He would be a fantastic leader and strategists.
