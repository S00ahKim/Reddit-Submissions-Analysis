   I grew up listening to anime op/endings while drawing. One day in the side bar of youtube suggestions the door to kpop opened and I fell into it hardcore. It was the whole bundle deal that I didn't even know I wanted in my life. It's been around 10 years. I still obsessively watch kpop. 

   This isn't some recent epiphany, but I have as of late been taking it more seriously. Kpop has pulled me away from my dear hobby drawing and years of seeing the model-esque members have negatively attributed to my self image etc. I remember in my first relationship I was irritable that I couldn't binge it like I used to and when we broke off I had so much free time that I felt lost cause I finally wasn't binging on kpop nor being clung to from my clingy ex. I became so productive and flourished. Now here I am fallen back into the addiction looking back missing the productive person. 

   I know any country's ent industry have this power over viewers no matter what generation even social media, but for me it's kpop. The kpop fanbase also is so persistent to try and push their favs and support them that I feel it's possibly naturally even more obsessive than others. 

TLDR: Do you feel kpop has had a negative effect in your life no matter how small?",0,3

Since **JYPE FANS are incredibly kind**, it would be really cool to support him, the **most views** on his **youtube** channel are **3,4Mln** views and on **his last song** ""Still alive"" just **8 Mln**,on his **twitter post** (about his comeback) **just 39 comments** and on **instagram just 400** .....**so sad**

Do you think is possible to ""make him feel special""?

Everyone deserve to debut! They deserve to be appreciated, loved, and respect. Not only XI or Iz\*one but everyone who dream, who believe and everyone who work hard just to reach the place where they are right now. When I heard about the news about the backlash that they are receiving right now, I ask myself? those people who curse, who say bad things about them, are they happy? all the things that they said is enough to harass those kids? We are all the same! Yes! they are famous, but they are just like us. They are human being. They are just dreaming like all of us. When some famous died because of depression, all the bashers become the supporters as if they didn't call them b\*tch, sl\*t, and other hurtful words.

I watch Produce 101 since Season 1. I know how every trainee work hard just to debut. I know how they cried just because they can't dance. I know Sohye's struggle when she can't follow but their is Sejeong just to help her. I know how Chungha did'nt want to credit herself when she make the dance step in bang bang but their is Doyeon and Yoojung just to tell how Chungha help their group. I know the hardwork of Growl Team just to give the best dance. I even know how great Jeon Soyeon when she perform Turtle. Have about those haters? They even know that the most memorable dance evaluation is when THE POP TEAM perform the song of NSync. Then don't know that Kang Daniel was once left behind. That he becomes viral when he perform his famous hip dance and he becomes the Nations IT BOY. They also don't know that Ha Sungwoon becomes part of Top 11 at Episode 10. They don't also know that Nu'est is existing because they have gust to join Produce 101 even if they are sunbae who debuted 4 years ago. All the haters of Jpop arrived when the collaboration of produce and AKB happen. EXCUSE ME? Kpop or Jpop it does'nt matter because like what I've said, every people dream, every one work hard. SAKURA, HITOMI, NAKO, CHOWON, GAEUN, and every trainee from that season they are all family even if they can't understand each other. Everyone study each others culture just to understand each other. And I will not forgot my Produce X 101. They are all multitalented. My sassy Dongpyo who got the burden of debuting because he becomes the center of Produce song, but he got all the hate just because of his sassy attitude. My Han Seungwoo, Wooseok, Byungchan, Jinhyuk, Cho Seungwon, Hangyul and the other trainee who also have guts to join the PD even if they already debuted because they are also dreaming that MAYBE they can be like Nu'est. Kim Yonghan who left his career in Taekwondo because his dream is to become a Singer, A 3 month old trainee who has a rapid growth. And to all the trainee that join PD Series I salute them. Because they are all working hard to achieved their dream while their haters are just sitting on their chairs who can't even paid for their own underwear, still asking money from their parents just to buy all the things they want but they don't need.

Don't hate IZ\*ONE AND XI because it is not their fault. It is the fault of that M\*therf\*cker PD. Don't you dare hate my group, Don't you dare say hurtful words to my Inspiration. Don't harass every KPOP IDOL who are just dreaming. IN SHORT, if you don't stan some group just focus on your group. Buy their album and merch, stream their song so that they can win the award that they deserve not because they are rank 1 from fan vote.

I've been in kpop community since 2012, I already experience fanwars but not like the fanwars this days. Because us from my year, we become fans because of their stories, because of they talents not because they are famous and I want to be at the date. I become a fan because even if I cant understand their songs I can feel it. I cant afford to buy merch, album or lightstick because I am still young that time and I cannot afford it but I am still happy and I can that I am a solid fan because I appreciate everything that they do. SO, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO STAN MY GROUP, NEVER EVER SAID BAD THINGS TO THEM. BECAUSE KARMA WILL STRIKE YOU.",2,1

To answer the below question put your kpop playlist of choice (we all have at least one Im pretty sure) on shuffle and answer with the songs that come on.

1. Describe the way you are feeling today: Twit-Hwasa 

2. Describe your love life: Blow Your Mind- (G)-IDLE 

3. The meaning of life is?  Twenty-three - IU (Ha! Looks like Douglas Adams was wrong)

4. Describe your ex: L.I.E - EXID 

5. What would you say to your ultimate bias if you met them: Oh! My Mistake - April

6. The next big kpop scandal will involve: Someone Like U - DalShabet (well if it involved someone like me it would probably involve accidentally cursing or telling a dirty joke on TV)

7. What song would play at your funeral? 365 Fresh - Triple H (amazing and ironic at the same time, I approve)

8. What is your favorite way to spend your free time? Now or Never - SF9 

9. If you were an idol your fandoms name would be: Trouble Maker Troublemaker (sounds about right)

10. What is your goal for the future? What is Love? - Twice",12,1

There's a slew of scammers sending people fake proofs of PayPal transfers so the person thinks they've been paid and transfers the ticket only to later be blocked and never actually receive the money. I and a handful of other people were stolen from in this way. All I can say is don't get desperate even if you're just selling and wait for an actual email from PayPal that the money transferred before doing anything. And plz don't come at me for this I know I messed up. 

Anyway I was gathering info left and right about the scammer to file a police report. I figured out quite a bit about them. They were using throwaway accounts, emails, the works. And then I found them selling my stolen ticket on Twitter on a selling account. I outed them to a buy/sell/trade group on Facebook and multiple people started messaging them and calling them out. Apparently the scammer felt bad because they decided to return the tickets they stole as long as I clarified that the selling account as a whole wasn't a scam. So.....we Jopping?",0,1

I only remember the music video. It is sung by, I think a male and female co ed kpop group (it might be jpop idk)))and this particular song features another male Asian rapper. 

The music video is video game themed. 

The music video starts with a bunch of people in a white room watching a TV. It zooms into the TV and shows the singers in a pixelised form. It then proceeds to have the real life singers and it plays out a story, where the girl loses her heart's (displayed at the top of the screen)  as the male flirtS with other girls. It then cuts to the featuring male rapper and they're like all dancing and then the video ends with it zooming back out from the TV to the white room. 
The video is really unique and colourful

&amp;#x200B;

K-Pop Sundae is a podcast that discusses K-Pop topics. For about two years, we have been researching and making daily posts about older (or forgotten) K-Pop on [Tumblr](https://kpopotd2.tumblr.com/), but we recently decided to start a podcast. We release two episodes per month: the first episode is a discussion about our opinions on a topic and the second leans into being informative. For example, in October we talked about how people discover K-Pop by diving into the history of how it spread, what factors led to the rise in popularity of K-Pop, and how people continue to discover it.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, the issues can be big and hard for us to solve but we can do something, just like we send memes and jokes and experiences let's try and use this mediatic world we live in to send love and support to the humans that makes us happy, support and love are always need it so go and give love as much as you can to the ones you love and to yourself. I don't know all of you, I don't know all the idols but I know that we all matter and we all deserve to be loved.

I am attempting to make a video regarding the band Se So Neon and their front women So Yoon. The video would be a brief summary of where they came from, how they came to be, the different tours or accolades they achieved, and why I humbly consider them to be among one of the most successful Korean groups. The only problem is that most of the articles or interviews that answer such questions are in Korean. (I cannot read Korean)

I'd greatly appreciate it If anyone would be so kind as to help contribute any information found about them to this thread. Of coarse I will credit you as an individual in my video!

I've got tickets to the A.C.E concert and the hi-touch, and while I know hi-touches aren't like, a time to stand and chat, I always try to say something nice to the groups I've done hi-touches for, like ""Noona is cheering for you!"" or ""I'll always be your fan!"" But the thing is, I had someone ask me what case I was using, and now I'm wondering if I've been rude the whole time. XD 

I'm older than the A.C.E boys, so in theory I don't have to use polite language. However, just walking up to them and using banmal seems rude. If anyone can read Hangul, I've been trying to hit the level between  and  - probably using . Can anyone who's been studying Korean longer than I have tell me if I have the right idea, or if I should be more or less formal?",1,1
