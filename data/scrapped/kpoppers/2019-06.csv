I came up with an idea based on what I saw in the comments of Somi's Inkigayo performance on 20190616:https://youtu.be/KDhAB7lIQyU

Her outfit was a bit awkward, so many people commented on how she needs a new stylist and better outfits. After reading so many, I went to Pinterest and set up a folder of single pieces to make up outfits that fit the vibe and aesthetic of the song. It was actually a lot of fun. It got me thinking. What if I made like an IG or Twitter account dedicated to outfits that I think would fit the vibe/aesthetic of an idol, music video, song, group, etc. Just something fun since putting together kpop-inspired outfits has proven to be entertaining. That and who knows? I might just get acknowledged as a stylist one day ",3,7

ok so basically this started when me and my friends were all having a casual discussion about the three girl groups. i am a new kpop fan and only recently got introduced to the industry. each one of my three friends argued for each person and idk which one is right for the title of ""BEST DANCER""

people argue that lisa isnt actually that good but my friend says that its just because her group is made up of 4 members and thats why her choreorgraohy cant really come through as there is not much you can do with the limited amount f positions, similarly this is why she argues why momo isnt as good because she thinks everything looks better with the 9 people groups and all the formations, canons and other dance techniques that can be implemented

she also says that lisa is much better compared to her other members so therefore she has to do less advanced stuff to accomodate

my other friend says that Seulgi is the best because even in songs like Be Natural and Automatic which are slower she still dances well.

another reason towards lisa is that she can supposedly just learn songs by 'looking at them' as seen by the video of her learning what is love and red flavour after a single watch

in twices likey and a few other songs momo also gets center dance break

so which of my friends is right??",6,3

183,2019-6-21,2019,6,21,9,c33sey,Welcome to r/kpoppers. Here's an introduction!,NishinosanTV,1561077622,"Welcome to r/kpoppers! 

[r/kpop](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpop/) is an amazing community for enjoying and discussing the latest K-Pop  news and releases, but there's also a whole lot of K-Pop-related content  that doesn't fit in; especially the things that K-Pop fans pour their hearts into creating. This subreddit is focused on you guys, the fans, and what you create and share with the rest of us. Whether it's a song  cover, dance cover, remix, reaction video, compilation video, fan art, or just funny meme or joke, it's all welcome here.

[r/kpoppers](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/) is the final piece in our vision for a complete [""K-Pop Ecosystem"" on Reddit.](https://i.imgur.com/EUHaYLK.jpg)

The linked diagram should help clear up what content goes in which sub.  The three main subs, [r/kpop](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpop/), [r/kpophelp](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/), and now [r/kpoppers](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/) are managed by same mod team that you all love *or maybe hate*,  so you'll get consistent visual style and moderation across all three  subs. Although this subreddit will be more casual, it's not ""Friday-For-All"" every day here.  We have [detailed rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/wiki/rules) and active moderators to enforce them.  Official content that belongs in [r/kpop](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpop/) will stay there, questions that go in [r/kpophelp](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/) will stay there, and group content that belongs in the group subreddits will stay there.  We also have the same great flair and filtering  system that we created for [r/kpop](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpop/). If you don't want to see fan covers, you can just click and hide them, or if you're searching for a certain remix, hit the flair and find all  of them in one click.  If you want to see all three subs on one page, this [multi-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop+kpophelp+kpoppers/) is exactly what you need.

As we said, [r/kpoppers](https://new.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/) is primarily focused on fan-created material. Anything that you, or a  member of the K-Pop community have created will fit in great here.  We have 16 custom flairs that cover just about every type of post that you  might encounter.  Here's the full list:

* **Funny** \- This includes memes, shitposts, reaction gifs, jokes, whatever is funny.
* **Compilation** \- Videos of your favorite idols or themes all mashed together.
* **Fan MV** \- Create your own MV for your favorite song and share it.
* **Remix** \- Become the producer and drop your fresh remix or share your favorites.
* **Mashup** \- When two songs love each other very much...
* **Song Cover** \- Let us hear you sing or share your favorite fan covers.
* **Dance Cover** \- Think you can dance?
* **Podcast** \- Have a favorite K-Pop podcast? Share it with us.
* **Reaction** \- All your favorite reaction channels are here.
* **Review** \- Share breakdowns of songs or albums and why they don't suck.
* **Article** \- Funny, sarcastic, edgy, not-quite-news articles from the community.
* **Meta** \- This post!
* **Fan Art** \- Share awesome artwork of K-Pop stuff or people.
* **Collection** \- Unboxings, shelves of CDs, walls of posters, show us what you got.
* **Misc** \- Fan-made stuff that we forgot to include a flair for.  D'oh!
* **Discussion** \- Talk about anything you want any time you want.

That's a lot of stuff!  If you're a content creator, feel free to post your own content here, but check out Rule 3 on the sidebar.  In fact, give  all those rules a good read and mouse-over them for more information about each.  If you're not a content creator, please share your  favorites from around the K-Pop community so that we can all enjoy them, or start a discussion about any K-Pop topic you want. No topics are stale here!

We're going to do our very  best to support this subreddit and help it grow.  If you think this sounds good, let us hear your ideas for it.  What kind of weekly  features would you like here?  Should we make any adjustments to the  rules?  You guys know that we take your suggestions to heart, so speak up in the comments or drop us a modmail. Thank you all for checking out this subreddit! We hope that you'll stick around, click that join button, and start submitting cool content.
