98,2017-12-20,2017,12,20,15,7kznr2,A Letter to Depression: For Jonghyun,ExoKoreaboo,1513751747,"Dear Depression,

We know who you are,
We know your ways. 

We know that your teeth are dull but your tongue is sharp,
Like a leech,
You draw life from vein,

Loneliness is your welcome,
And we know that youre definitely
The creative type because 
Sometimes you weave the doormat yourself.

Dear Depression,

Many hear your whispers 
And fall,
But the strong stand between us and you;

Strong are those who stand against the screams,
But those who keep grounded 
Instead of running,
Are not invincible.

To guard us,
They hurt too. 


Dear Depression,

Its our turn.

I hate to break it to you, 
But
I cant let you take them.
I wont let you take them.
Do you see?
These are the people we love
And love can conquer anything.
Even you.

There is always a way to thwart you.
Though you are clever, 
We are more.

You are not going to take them.

You are not going to take from us.

You are not going to take them from their families.

Not anymore.
As long as we are here, you will have to get through us.

You will not take Xiumin, nor Chanyeol, nor Suho, nor Sehun, nor Baekhyun, nor Lay, nor Kyungsoo, nor Chen, nor Kai, nor Jimin, nor Jin, nor Suga, nor Namjoon, nor Hobi, nor V, nor Jungkook, nor Taemin, nor Minho, nor Onew, nor Key, nor Jisoo, nor Rose, nor Jennie, nor Lisa, nor Yeri, nor Irene, nor Joy, nor Wendy, nor Seulgi, nor Mark, nor Jackson, nor Yugyeom, nor Jinyoung, nor Bambam, nor Jaebum, nor Younjae, nor Chenle, nor Taeyeon...

Dear Depression,

Dont even think for one second
That you have Jonghyun.
Dont even think for one second
You think you have broken us.
Because YOU have united us. 

We are one, under Jonghyun,
An angel who holds us together with his smiles,
Who loved us through his pain.

Now, he lives within us,
Within his family,
Within his music,
Within his group.

And nothing you can do will ever take him away.
I hope you know that. 

And dear Idols,

Never forget that you are loved. You are strong. No matter what happens, we will support you. We promise. Dont ever be afraid to take care of yourselves because you know what is best for you. 

And we will trust you until the end. 

With utmost appreciation, 
                                  The fans. 

(Add your favorite idols if I missed them...THEY ALL DESERVE SUPPORT NO MATTER WHAT FANDOM YOU'RE APART OF! WE ARE ONE COMMUNITY LOVE YOU GUYS) ",0,8

Im working on a psychology project examining how ones music preferences and personality are related to their work and other relevant outcomes.  I pretested the survey for length, if you have just 15 minutes to spare, can communicate fluently in the written form of the English language, are at least 18 years old, and are either working in a paid capacity or attending school you are eligible to participate.  I will be granting access to your personal results through a password-protected system.  If you would be willing to help a young student out, I would really appreciate your time and effort.

Thanks again,

If you guys could make a group using ANY idols you want (Active or inactive, doesn't matter) to form your Unit, who would you all like to see work together and which song would you love to see them cover?

You can have as many or as few members that you want, it's your dream unit so take this question in any direction you want.

Twice:
Mina - lawful good
Momo - chaotic neutral 
Sana - chaotic evil
Tzuyu - lawful evil 
Jeogyeon - lawful evil 
Dahyun - chaotic neutral
Chaeyoung - True neutral 
Jihyo - lawful good
Nayeon - chaotic neutral 

BlackPink:
Lisa - Chaotic neutral 
Jisoo - Chaotic evil 
Rose - Lawful good 
Jennie - lawful neutral 

Other:
IU - true neutral
PSY - chaotic neutral 
YG - neutral evil
JYP - chaotic good 

Do you agree with mine? How about your favorites and where they'd fall in the chart?



Edit: after looking over my list, I noticed that my biases and ""bias wreckers"" tend to be ""chaotic"" idols... Sana, Dahyun, and Jisoo are some of my favorites, and I often find Lisa, Nayeon and Momo wrecking me... do you guys notice any patterns in your favorites and where they fall on the chart?",4,8

I was wondering what company you guys think would be best for you to debut under, if you were going to be an idol. I mean this in every way, including success, enjoyment, and even relationships with other idols. 

For me, I would probably choose SM, because even though they take wayyyy too much money, I feel like I have a good chance of being successful and I really like the family atmosphere there seems to be between groups over there. That, I think, would make me really enjoy it. What do you guys think?",53,22
