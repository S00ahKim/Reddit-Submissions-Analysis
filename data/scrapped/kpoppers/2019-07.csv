As we know Mamamoo is already 5 years old(time flies fast :D) and after the 7th year they won't have as many comebacks and probably focus on solo work/acting. In fact they have already started their solo careers with members debuting one after another. 

They usually have solo tracks in their group albums but don't have MVs for them. In fact Hwasa even had a solo song in their debut album called ""I Do Me""(great hip hop song btw). 

So let's have a look at their solos so far:
1. Solar
-She has not had her debut so far but she has an album with remakes of old songs from veterans in South Korea. Also stream ""Honey Bey"" it's iconic :D.

2. Wheein
-Wheein debuted on April 2018 with the digital single ""Easy"" featuring Sik-K. The song did well for a debut and peaked at number 36 on the Gaon Digital Chart. She also released the song ""25"" on 25th of May 2019 and it didn't do well because it was an unexpected comeback and limited promotions didn't help either ;(.

3. Moonbyul 
-Moonbyul debuted on may 2018 with ""Selfish"" featuring Seulgi of RedVelvet. The song peaked at number 84 on the Gaon Digital Single Chart and it became quite popular on Youtube reaching 15 milion views so far. International fans of Mamamoo and RedVelvet loved the song and it was overall well received. 

4. Hwasa
-Hwasa debuted recently in February 2019 with the single ""Twit"". As we all know the song was well received and peaked at number 1 on the Gaon Digital Chart and on number 3 on the Billboard US World Digital Songs chart. The debut was extremely succesful and it even received a music show win on Music Core. 

Conclusion: To me it seems like with each debut they are becoming more and more succesful and they all have very different styles and genres and ""Twit"" was a pop song with elements of the house genre(something pretty popular in kpop rn). I hope all the other members achieve success with their solo work and I hope it doesn't turnout to be a Miss A-Suzy situation. Hwasa is really popular and her personality is adored by fans. Not all of them can be succesful but Hwasa has been doing pretty well while the others can't really pass the success of Mamamoo. To me Hwasa's video/song/promotions were all excellent but I hope the other members are also treated well.

174,2019-7-17,2019,7,17,14,ce8tfu,YG is one of the best companies.,MaxwellSH,1563343023,"YG is shit and we all know it but for the love of god they are not the worst company knowing they are far better than others. 

We all know of small companies who abuse their trainees/idols. Here is the [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FTyrHOGqmVw) of Grazy Grace that didn't reveal which is her company and covered it with an emoji everytime the sign comes but at a split second you cat catch it in this [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7DZyBmZnge0). If you manage to do it than congrats it's Nega Network.

Does it ring a bell? Yeah because Brown Eyed Girls were once under their label. Overall Grazy Grace talks how she was yelled at, strict dieting and the company calling them ugly and letting them rot essentially. They made group A and group B and A were the ""pretty"" ones(although she is really pretty too I don't understand) that got to debut while the manager just cut group B and were thrown away from their dorms to the point she had to live in the manager's shitty apartment. 

She talked how the company was trying to get investors in and basically have a joint idol group because Nega Network was too poor. She said the company had one popular group(Brown Eyed Girls) and the other company had a semi-popular boy group(it's most likely NH ENT. so I guess U-Kiss but it's possible the investor was different back then or smt). She also talked how the company had a boy group(LC9) that they debuted and didn't have a comeback and just took all the presents fans gave them and after jeeping them in the dungeon for 2 years just disbanded them. So who is group A and did they debut? Yes they did and yes the girl group is Laboum. The group is a joint venture between Nega Network and NH ent. so I guess U-Kiss although I will call them popular idk. Also I forgot to mention how shitty NH are but I myself don't know much about them or U-Kiss although I have seen pretty disturbing things about them. I think I saw a video or smt about them but I am not sure.

Laboum has went as far as winning a music show win and has been relitively sucessful and you can go watch predebut videos and it's the same training room Grazy showed. The fact that the compnay has been able to go unnoticed for their abuse towards idols/trainees just shows how bad things are. Ofcourse there are companies that are known and confirmed abusers towards their artists like TS ent. 

Most small companies are just abusive and usually disband you if you don't have success in your first comeback or smt. The amount of groups debuting is huge and you can go see how many get unnoticed because of their compnay being unable to promote them and disbanding them the next year. 

There are other abusive companies and there is even a Youtube channel called [Chaennie Lisoo](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCJXAcIHDsFlD6bMUXBA4d_Q) that has made many videos about small companies that are abusive and outright inhuman towards their idols. She has made many videos about small companies that even when they have a popular group are still abusive and promote them badly.

Hell even CNA designer made a [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G66uRJ6pAfI) about it and the life of a japanese trainee in a small company and the instructor/teacher was so rude and yelled at her pushing her back ON CAMERA. Mind you this is not some idol or anything but a news outlet or smt and they revealed their cruel ways of training to the entire world just like that. The company is Star Road enterteintment.

What I am trying to say is that there are so many small companies that do things that are illegal and inhuman, cruel, disgusting and you are gonne tell me YG is the worst company? No, they are one of the best companies because they atleast have money and are a part of big 3 so their group is guranteed success and attention when they debut and are not abusive as the other small companies. They have done some bad stuff but they can't compare to the likes of the smaller companies.

Smaller companies are THAT BAD that YG is considered one of the best companies and nobody cares or pays attention ti that but do when it's YG? YG is still a bad company but they are not worse than the standard and are actually pretty good knowing other companies out there. 

It's just kinda strange how people claim they are the worst when there have been so many bad companies that YG is a saint next to them. 

You can comment other small companies that have abused their idols down in the comment section as I don't know every single company and there have been to many that have been able to just... idk go unnoticed.",1,1

2. **How does being a K-pop fan impact other areas of your life?**
3. **Do you ever feel a need to lead a 'double life' as a K-Pop fan?** (e.g. like Curator Sung in 'Her Private Life'?)
4. **What are some things you wish people (in general, those around you, etc.) understood about you as a K-pop fan?**
5. **If there was an ultimate platform that could help you keep updated with the K-Pop world (beyond just music), what would you like to see?**",1,1

Like when I was new to K-Pop years ago, my biases were 10-12 years older than me, and I'm used to having older biases. But now my current biases from the recent groups are younger than me. It's so weird, and I can't fathom the thought of becoming a 'noona' fan already, but it has begun. Still, no matter the age, I stan these talented rookies, seriously I'm loving these lineups! I can't wait to follow X1 on their 5 year journey :))",4,15

So ive been on a few sites to look for albums, since im on a budget im trying to find the cheapest albums with the cheapest shipping. Im buying 2 cherry bullet albums, im thinking of buying it on yesasia since the shipping is free and the albums are quite cheap since theres a sale going on, but its still quite expensive when u add the two albums together.. 

I refuse to buy multiple albums on ktown4u since the shipping is wayyy too expensive for me. So im just wondering what websites do u guys prefer to buy from?",1,1
