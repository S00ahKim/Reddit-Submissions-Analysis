This is just a quick thought I had, As most people know I think it is fairly undeniable that black culture has played a big part in culture. Music, style and even the way people talk and decide on what is generally popular. Non black people wanting to talk walk and dress/look and act black. With American Cultures impact on Kpop taken into consideration; I was thinking now that Kpop is slowly starting to become more and more mainstream with time, are we going to see more people want to emulate this style and be more ""Korean""/Kpop? More people wanting to go to Korea and learn to speak and act Korean? or more of Korean/Kpop culture/speech/dress/behavior be integrated into mainstream society? Just looking for thoughts and opinions. I personally think that we are seeing the beginning stages of this, but probably wont be as huge but I may very well be wrong. ",5,0

124,2018-5-17,2018,5,17,16,8k2jbj,Is it just me or are kpop idols looking younger and younger?,onelifetolive1,1526543947,"The Korean groups are looking younger and younger even though they're staying approximately the same age - 18-22. But why do they look so young? They look like they're 16 while before they used to look like they were 25 or so.

You'd never, ever see someone like Fei debut these days. She was 23 when she debuted and their concept wasn't that much more mature but all of them, including Suzy, just seem mid-twenties. 9muses, Dal Shabet, etc all looked like fierce unnis in their mid-twenties as well at the time of debut. But they're the same age as kids debuting nowadays like Nayoung, Dahyun who look like they're 16. The cognitive dissonance is pretty baffling to me; idols used to look like people to look up to, fierce unnis/oppas who seemed more mature in the face were preferred. Now they all look super duper young. But they're the same age.

Boy groups as well; 2pm at 21/22 is VERY different from WannaOne at 21/22. They just look... young. Beyond the concepts and all of that.

As a consequence, I realized that I started thinking that groups like Fiestar, 9muses, Stellar, all seemed super old and could not pull of these cutesy concepts. Is it because the market is dictating that groups look even younger? Soshi at debut seems much more mature and old compared to Twice at debut or Gfriend at debut even when they were the same age.",8,14

18. B1A1
19. UNIQ

CONSIDERING...

Artist freedom and control.
Treatment (includes how freely they can talk, not being too restricted, restriction of phones).
Management
Living Costs: whether they take care of your plane ticket, dorm, food, etc.
Also, I'm curious about the quality of training in each company, but I'm not sure if anybody knows that.

IMO: YG and RBW seem to be best for artistic freedom. The thing is RBW being a smaller company, it may not be as good for foreigners with limited resources (they may have to deal with more expenses than in bigger companies). Hence the Big3 are probably better for living costs. As for treatment JYP seems pretty good agency to me, they have sex &amp; ethics education, everybody seems to be on good terms, they've got (or rather will have) an organic cafeteria (okay, it doesn't say a lot about treatment but I like it). And, finally, I think SM is best for management, but it's on the more strict side (I don't think they're evil tho) and, as seen by the criteria I've given, I'm looking for a more relaxed company (of course not TRULY relaxed, that's impossible on any decent company).

Anyway, what do yall think?",3,8

So I was wondering wether that was completely true for all 3 or they just reduced the amount. 
There's also people saying that you have to pay if you debut too, I assume that you'd have to pay only what they invested on the debut... Right?

And finally, I am really curious about wether there are any companies outside the Big3 that don't charge trainee fees or charge just a portion of it.

JYP, YG, SM, CUBE, FAVE, JELLYFISH and FANTAGIO.

In a bit more detail, not the general 'they train for several hours', but how it is on each company: how many hours of training per day, what classes they take (like JYP trainees get sex&amp;ethics education, others don't I believe), how strict it is, evaluations, etc.

I thought perhaps this could be useful for other people too (like those interested in auditioning for k-pop companies), so I thought I would post this here to put what I find (which, for now, isn't much BTW) and see if others can add to it, to have a more complete...Thing (resource(?)) ^_^.

Anyway, here it is (yep, it's all for now, I'm trying to find more).

CUBE: (2013-2015)

Hours: CLC's Sorn trained from 3-10 p.m (she went to an international school). Other trainees from 6-10 p.m (after school) or 1-10 p.m (no school).
So, if you don't go to school you get 9 hours of training per day, of which 4 hours are lessons and 5 practice.

Lessons:
- Fitness/Health
- Singing/Rap
- Dance
- Instruments: piano/guitar
- Language: Japanese/Chinese + English (+Korean for foreigners).
- Acting
- Speech/Good etiquette

Evaluations:
Monthly and weekly. You get missions (usually focusing on whatever is your weakness). In front of other trainees and staff.

Source: Arirang Special: CUBE Entertainment's way of training Sorn
+ Produsorn Ep.01 ( https://youtu.be/yg9IxurN3jA ).

SM: (2013-2015)

Hours: Schedule depends on your strengths and weaknesses. Usually about 2-4 hours of dance training + 2 hours of singing/rap + practice during free time= 8-10 hours if you go to school. Up to 14 if you don't.

Classes:
- Dance (choreo, sometimes learning how to design it yourself).
- Singing (music theory and just vocal training).
- Acting (mostly about situations in shows/interviews, how to act in front of camera), if you are scouted for a drama, you get different acting classes. (Not daily)
- Korean (foreigners), basic japanese/chinese. (Not daily)

Evaluations: Weekly/every 2 weeks to mark progress. You decide the concept but can consult the stylists. Also in front of other trainees and staff.

189,2018-5-24,2018,5,24,0,8lk1mi,Is JYP Entertainment really the 'nice' one?,K-PopDataGatherer,1527087698,"Out of the Big3, SM is known as the evil one, the oje that overworks idols and has many lawsuits; while JYP has a 'friendlier' image, with their sex&amp;ethics education, organic cafeteria and generally being in good terms with their artists, people (like me) find themselves thinking JYP treats people better, they're kinder and put health first (as JYP said). BUT, is it? Or am I just falling for the mediaplay of the industry?

One of the things that made me think that, is that, as I said, SM is generally pointed out as the bad one. So, when some time ago translations of pretty bad reviews on JobPlanet of the company's employees arised, people (rightfully) pointed that out. BUT if you visit that website, SM has a score of 2.5 and JYP of 2.4.
Now, I don't know korean so I don't know if their reviews are that bad, but it just made me curious.

Another thing is, even though JYP is one of the Big3, I can't find as much information about them, as from the other companies, therefore I thought perhaps I'm jumping to conclutions (JYP is nice) based on too little information.

So... I just wanted to know if you guys have information about the company, something you think proves they're not that good, or they're actually good (like, I have an idea of how much people train and what classes they take in SM and Cube but nothing about JYP)... Anyway, just wanted to know what you think (sorry I don't really know how to express myself).",8,9
