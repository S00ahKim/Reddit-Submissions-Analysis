That you wonder how nobody talks about thay thing about that idol. Here are some of mine:

Pristin V - Eunwoo girly/nice voice

CLC - Seungyeon Jumps out the most for me

Gfriend - Umji sweet voice/unique looking

Dreamcatcher - Gahyeon Her voice adds an extra aspect to each their songs

Blackpink - Ros she just puts something extra in her dance moves and voice (not that ""irritating pitch"" bit just extra effects or something) that really makes you feel the song

When I was  younger I was listening a lot kpop songs. There is one song I really want hear again but I forgot the name of it. I think it is from 2013/2014 but I am not sure.

I remember the song is sung by a solo female korean artist who are not that famous. 

She has a very powerful voice and then I remember that you see her singing in a band in the video. And then you see a man in another clip where the man is running and seems to be a kind of scared because he gets shout down a lot by a lot of shouts. In the clip with the man the sun is shining and he running around outside.

in the clip with the female singer, she is inside singing in a band and I also remember some deer horns in background on the wall lol. 

I no it is properly hard to help but I really that someone knows what I am talking about.

Thanks anyways! :)",0,1

I am Korean, and I have signed up for this site to help you guys learn Koreans through the comments.

Also, I have started a youtube channel for learning Korean, so I need everyone's support to make myself motivated on creating better contents. **2 days ago,** I made a video about learning korean with K-POP. (Winner - Really Really).

But **Very Important! (For those who ask ""is it successful to learn Korean with K-POP)**

*Please be advised learning Korean ONLY by K-POP is not desirable. I recommend using a variety of sources to learn Korean. BUT still I promise I will do my best to guide you in the right direction by using K-POP as the learning source.*

*I always hope my channel can make your learning Korean easier and faster, and I am a person who feels responsible for producing good quality video. Please have a visit, let me guide your journey to Korean!! Below is the link.*

I remember one time during a seventeen radio  interview (if someone could provide the link to it I would really appreciate it) which I came across when I just became a carat. The interviewer asked the boys (I think this must've been an earlier interview, not too far from when the boys just debuted) how long they envisioned their first kisses would be: 

(Nb - the following isn't verbatim)

Boo: about five minutes

Seok: about five seconds, because it would be awkward at first, then probably go in for a second one. Aahh, Hoshi hyung seems to really like this question. 

Soon : ... (You can hear the giddy giggles as he replies) I'd just keep going.

Another time, I think this was on AfreecaTV? When they were asking how many kids the boys wanted and S.coups mentioned about 4 I think (I think he wanted more girls too) and the members were like oh wow, are you sure you can handle that? 

SeungCheol - I can handle 12 of you, you think I can't handle 4 kids? 

I'm thinking it's in the same Video, the question is directed to Hoshi (someone correct me if I'm wrong). 

Hoshi ^An ^Intellectual : I'll just keep going/working hard. 

(When I watched these videos my korean was worse than it is now and I was a fairly new carat so I'm going wholly on what I remember from english subs - so please correct me if I'm wrong) 

Edit - 

A few others: 
- Dokyeom's predebut ""Two-teen"" instead of Twenty and Mingyu's ""I love guys."" 

(The funny thing is how Esther - the first carat that vernon was teaching english too has gone on to say ""Three-teen"" and also put ""I love guys"" in one of her videos. 

- Chenle, when he was talking how his dad asked his mom to have another kid after so long

There's also each group's unique outlook, which is deftly woven into their songs-B1A4's personal philosophy draws heavily from blood types, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realise that they're not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Kpop truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the depth of the existential catchphrase ""Ring ding dong ring ding dong ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as my genius wit unfolds itself on their phones and computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.  

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Super Junior tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ",0,1

An interview with the manager of the upcoming kpop duo.",Randummonkey,1540977348,"I was bored and wrote an Onion-style news article about [this group](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2018/10/dm-entertainment-to-debut-a-new-girl-group-sad).

&amp;nbsp;

A new entrant into the world of Kpop is attracting attention with a peculiar name for their new group. A company by the name of DM Entertainment announced plans to debut a kpop duo this winter under the name SaD"". DM Entertainment joined the industry last year with the debut of 2-member group, Limesoda. Many industry analysts and insiders expressed concern over the plethora of other groups that have already debuted in 2018. How could a small upstart hope to compete against the likes of CUBE Entertainment and their newest girl group, (G)I-dle? 

DM Entertainment has stated that they intend to use a groundbreaking social media branding strategy focusing on a unique group name. Not to be outdone by the likes of (G)I-dle, DM Entertainment concocted a name that is both shorter and slightly more confusing than the fellow rookie group. 

When asked why they would use such a name, a DM Entertainment manager responded by stating:

""It is our belief that in the age of social media, quirky names are a must. Look at Mamamoo, Momoland, and Bulletproof Boy Scouts (BTS). Of course, we needed something to stand out. So we asked ourselves what name could confuse twitter followers more than (G)I-dle. After a long and rigorous process, we landed on 'SaD' and are quite happy with the result.""

Upon being asked whether he believed the name would help on social media, the manager replied by stating:

To be honest, I also had some early concerns about the name. However, the uniqueness and brevity of the name have turned out to be a stroke of genius. My market analysts have told me that the group is already trending globally on Twitter. It turns out that people all over the world are already using #SaD. I was personally surprised to find that millions of people used our hashtag before the groups name was even announced. Now thats what I call fantastic marketing!

The company manager concluded the interview by stating that they were quite confident in SaD's potential and hoped that they would not disappoint their legions of global fans with their debut.
