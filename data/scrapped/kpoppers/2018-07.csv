47,2018-07-06,2018,7,6,15,8why5t,Do you agree with this list by Billboard?,Creepthough,1530859789,"So there's this article on Billboard.com titled [*""10 Best K-Pop Girl Groups of the Past Decade: Critic's Picks""*. ](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7865168/best-k-pop-girl-groups-decade). In the article it says ""*teams of women who have had the most impact on the K-pop industry over the past decade*"". It was published last year.

So the list goes as follows:

10. miss A

9. Apink

8. 4minute

7. f(x)

6. Kara

5. After School and subunit Orange 
Caramel

4. Brown Eyed Girls

3. Wonder Girls

2. 2NE1

1. Girl's Generation

Now i don't follow the entire kpop scene, just some artists so I can't gauge myself if this is accurate. What do you think? You can read the article here:

The group currently consists of 23 members from the USA, The Philippines, Canada, Afghanistan, and multiple other countries. Of those 23 members, about 10 are active on a daily basis. Mostly everyone in the GroupMe favors BlackPink above all other groups, but we still love plenty of other Kpop as well (Red Velvet and Twice are pretty popular amongst us). Ages in the chat range from 16-29, but we are currently only accepting 18+ members.

Do to the nature of such a diverse group of people, we have culminated a very welcoming community of open minded individuals. We dont judge each other, and we love to learn about our differences and similarities through social media and the one thing that ultimately unites us: Kpop.

We have been a community for almost a year now, and we talk on a daily basis. Recently however the group hasnt been as active, and we are looking to shake it up by adding new members. Please keep in mind that this group contains many different personalities. Because of this, our only requirement is that you are respectful and do your best to keep an open mind.

If you have any questions, feel free to comment or PM me!",1,6

I am working on a fan page/website and I hope I can get some advice from you. :)

The website is not fully finished yet but I'm uploading new content every week. (New memes, fan fiction, fan art and Korean study materials with BTS songs etc) Also, I used to teach Korean in Australia, and I thought I can make some Korean study materials with BTS content. What would you like to learn? Korean culture, dialect, idioms?

Any comments about the website are appreciated. About its layout, design, content etc. I hope this post is okay here, thanks a lot !

I think Pledis could be using P48 as a stepping stone of possibly reviving the AS brand with KaEun at the forefront and the possibility of also adding Yun-Jin also - although I do wonder why they'd need p48? I assume the popularity in Korea has died unlike the popularity internationally perhaps? 

Who have we got left in AS?
Raina, Nana, E-young and KaEun

Now I could be very wrong but I feel like this could be a fun discussion to have!

209,2018-07-28,2018,7,28,11,92iok2,Monthly K-Pop/R&amp;B Series,ohmizu,1532744732,"So I run a music database called Musictea, and I'm starting a YouTube channel for it. :D I'm starting with a monthly K-Pop/R&amp;B series, where I'll make a playlist, with a video showing the songs in that month's list.

I started with January, and I know that was a while ago, but figuring out what exactly I want this series to be and getting it all organized was very time-consuming (also there were difficulties in my personal life). At the moment I'm working to get caught up, then I plan on releasing these a month or so after their featured month (ex: I'd release July's playlist/video in September). I don't want to worry about anything trendy or charts; I want to make a quality series that would be worth watching 5 years later.

**The Playlist:**

I completely ignored charts. Basically I listened to a shitton of music, weeded out the crap, and slowly narrowed it down to what I feel are strong songs. I tried to be objective/unbiased, and include a good variety. I want to showcase everything the genre has to offer. :)

**The Video:**

This is the first video I've ever made!!! :D I would greatly appreciate feedback and constructive criticism.

The purpose of the video is, for one, they're fun to watch. :p Two, it's for people who want to see what music is out there but don't have time to listen to an entire playlist. I'm also really hoping it'll help smaller artists get more exposure.

**The Author:**

In case anyone's wondering who tf made this.. I'm a late 20s nerd, been in love with music for 17 years. I'll listen to almost anything, from K-Pop to Black Metal.

I hope you guys like this! I've worked really hard to make it. Once the K-Pop series is caught up, I'm going to start a monthly Korean rock/folk series (starting from January because I'm stubborn lol).

\---

Also, I almost have February's video finished. I'll be uploading it within a few days and I'll post it here!",0,5
