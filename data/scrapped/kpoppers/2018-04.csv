There are three restrictions:

1. Winners of any generation can't be selected for any future generation, unless it's a Quarter Quell.

2. No exact same pairs as the previous generation can be selected, although they can in a different teamup.

3. Every team should be in a different category. For instance: you can't have a second 'YG Males' team in the same generation.

All pairs submitted after the 12th pair has been selected, will automatically be put in future generations.

I will let you know as soon as possible if your pair has been approved :)",10,2,False,self,,,,,

I've seen Sixteen at least 3 times, and all of this not at the time, but I've read opinions about it from the time it was out and I find myself confused. Ignoring skill and talent, the members of Sixteen seemed vastly more ready to debut than the Produce 101 girls do in these first two episodes, and I thought most of the Sixteen members seemed nervous and obviously green. Yet, from most of the comments I've read about Sixteen when it was coming out and Twice when they debuted, they were compared unfavorably with other girl groups. Obviously there is a lot to be learned from being on a real stage and performing in front of a crowd, so who Twice are now is not comparable to who they were when they were on Sixteen, but the gap between the Sixteen girls and the Produce 101 girls seems even larger.

Were the Sixteen criticisms because they were all from JYP, or because there weren't a ton of survival shows out at the time, or something else I am missing? Maybe Produce 101 had those same criticisms and I just haven't seen them as much. I'm just looking for some perspective. I'm sure the girls get a lot better over the course of Produce 101 and I plan on watching all of it, but so far I'm just confused on what I (perhaps incorrectly) perceive as the contemporaneous reactions to the two shows.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Sorry if this is a repost of another thread.)

This question has been on my mind for a while now. BTS is a very talented group, and yes, they deserve the attention because they worked really hard for it! What I want to know is why didn't other older groups like SHINee, DB5K, and BIGBANG, receive the same amount of attention that BTS is currently getting worldwide, especially in the US? While I do know that some of these groups had shows in the US (i.e. Kcon, Wonder Girls touring with the Jonas Brothers, B.A.P. doing shows in the States), I'm looking for more reasons/opinions on the actual success of BTS. Talent aside, do you think it was better marketing and better investment? An increased interest in K-Pop over the last decade? What could have been done differently for other groups that wanted to become successful worldwide, or even if they had done a US debut? 

I became a Kpop fan a decade ago and it just amazes me at how successful BTS has been. I'm not part of the fandom, but I do support them because their success is opening more doors for groups (and solos) to go international. I'm not saying that the other groups aren't popular/successful since they have a large fanbase as well. The attention for the other groups feels more from the groups' respective fandoms/general kpop fans while the attention for BTS seems to be from their fandom, general kpop fans, and then the broader, worldwide audience.

I'm not sure if this is still a sensitive topic among IOI fans in this sub but I was wondering what you guys think of the individual and their respective group's future after the disbandment.

Personally, I think everyone who thought that some members would be a flop after IOI is wrong. I'd like to point out Mina for example, although she is presumably living under Sejeong's shadows just like all the other gugudan members, she's surprisingly doing well as a music show MC and in terms of brand reputation, her rank nowadays even beats Sejeong's. She will also star in a drama alongside a popular boy group member as I recall. This is considering how she was perceived by many as the least popular member of IOI during the course of their last promotions. WJSN's Yeonjung is doing well in her group as well, although not too much may be associated to her individual activities, it's still a relief that the name WJSN seems to have a brighter future ahead.

Meanwhile, Pristin's Nayoung and Jieqiong, even being the leader and the visual respectively, did not receive too much recognition while in IOI as compared to the recognition they got after debuting as Pristin. The group won rookie of the year, with Jieqiong being a mentor in China's Idol Producer. I think Nayoung also became a cover for a magazine not too long ago. As a group, I personally think Pristin would be most successful musically, not only because their songs are self-produced by the members, but also because their type of music is well suited to the new generation. This also goes for Weki Meki, although both their name and gugudan's throw off some new prospective listeners, Weki Meki's music is surprisingly good. I also think that the other WeMe members are interesting enough that it would not be much of a hard carry for Yoojung and Doyeon for their part, as much as Sejeong sadly does with gugudan. Doyeon and Yoojung seems to have the most stable and friendlier fanbase that does not alienate other members may it be from IOI or Weki Meki. Their individual activites are also doing well, especially Doyeon who recently collaborated with another singer as far as I remember.

As for Chungha, I think she is the most successful so far in terms of music releases. She is well-supported with good management, her songs ranks high digitally, and her activites as a radio DJ as well as being constantly invited to TV shows and such marks her current relevance. I think she will definitely reach a peak though, where we will all be in awe at how popular she's become. I think I need not go into detail on the individual success Chaeyeon and Sejeong got even after IOI, although both their respective groups are still struggling musically to be known. Both have several CFs, and a promising future for an acting career. Sejeong is still a variety cheat key, now working with Yoo Jae Suk. I still can't even believe Sejeong collaborated for a Station in SM. She is really walking the flowery path way ahead. I think gugudan has a potential to rise sometime, just with a proper song. However, DIA's name in my opinion, would be remembered, but will really struggle to become relevant in the industry as a group.

As for Sohye and Somi, I feel like Sohye's success is already pre-determined, and I don't think she needed fame that much to succeed any further. It would be an exaggeration to say that her mere existence still makes her relevant, but I also think that for some reason its really true. She will definitely not be forgotten even if she does not pursue the idol career. I still doubt Somi's career though, if JYP chooses not to debut her in an idol group soon. Although the girl is widely loved by the public and her visuals as well as talent is no joke, I just feel uncertain of her future. Nevertheless, I think she would be popular, given the proper circumstances, and I'm 90% sure she could even surpass the fame she had during IOI, something that I am still in doubt happening to the other girl's groups during the long run. More or less, I think it was better for them individually when IOI disbanded, as they were each given the promotion and spotlight simultaneously. Yeonjung, however for me, stood out more individually in IOI, albeit the controversies she faced during their promotions compared to her standing in WJSN right now.

I'm sorry for the long post and the bad english. I also want to hear the thoughts on this sub as well.

TLDR; Members post-IOI was not that tragic as everyone thought it would be, I think their future standing will make IOI look like the Avengers soon.

But then I realized that there are plenty of good people out there who also enjoy kicking back to some chill jams, so I figured this would be the best place to get suggestions for what I could add to it! Also, I have some artists on there that you may not have heard before, so I hope you give the playlist a listen too. Sorry it's on Apple Music, since I know most of y'all have Spotify, but I'm sure that all these songs can be found on Spotify so you won't miss out. So, If you have a song or two that goes with the feel of the playlist, feel free to leave a suggestion!

edit: Also, I recommend that you put the playlist on shuffle if you listen to it since there a few pockets where it's the same artist like four times in a row and I feel like it's more spicy if you get constant variety in there, but it's up to you",7,5,False,self,,,,,
