13,2018-3-3,2018,3,3,10,81l2zz,The Kpop Mullet from a fashion theory perspective.,ashortgreyroundcat,1520040938,"Im not here to convince you to love the Kpop Mullet, or even to like it in very specific cases as I do. Im just here to discuss why its 2018 and we still have the mullet in Korean fashion from a fashion history nerd perspective.  

The beginnings of the modern mullet happened in the 70s and has close ties to counter-culture movements and rock legends like David Bowies Ziggy Stardust and Patti Smith. It was a statement of sexual revolution, a switching of gender perceptions and railing against conventional beauty standards. The reason why contemporary mainstream western audiences are appalled by the mullet is largely socioeconomic. Somewhere along its journey in pop culture, the mullet went from a look shared in rock/punk/metal communities to being code for low-class and uneducated. As well as being tied to a specific point in time: 80s/90s Americana and for lack of a better term, tackiness. Basically, its an aesthetic signifier of a time and type of person that far outshadowed its countercultural origins.  


There has been a slight resurgence of the look that aims to capture its original sense of rebellion but in softer variations. Marc Jacobs sent it down his [runways in 2013](https://cameblogdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/picture-16.png) and [Rihanna](http://starcrush.com/files/2013/09/rihanna-mullet-4.jpg) sported it for a bit. Die Antwoords [Yolandas hair](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/48/19/38/4819380a095f9fb43db8c71d7346bfc8.jpg) is practically iconic and just this year we saw a mullet straight off the Gucci runway. All this brings the look back to the global spotlight, which brings me to Seoul.  


Seoul right now is having a [style boom of 90s aesthetics](https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59ea75f61b56a03954e54813/master/w_3200,c_limit/_AKS4778.jpg), largely due to the popularity of streetwear which pulls heavily from its [80s](https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_2000%2Cq_75%2Cw_2000/MTUwODgxMjU0NjA1NDY1NTQ1/15-seoul-fashion-week-street-style-spring-2018.jpg) hip hop and [90s](https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_2000%2Cq_75%2Cw_2000/MTUwODgxMjU0ODczNzY5OTI5/25-seoul-fashion-week-street-style-spring-2018.jpg) skate culture/grunge origins. Its [colorful](https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59ea75f771f7d807707514b0/master/w_3200,c_limit/_AKS5829.jpg), [casual](http://cdn.harpersbazaar.com.sg/2017/10/hbs-sfw-ss18-day-1-street-style-17-1200x800.jpg), with an emphasis on [tongue-in-cheek references](https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59e9006cee32f97c78ecb112/master/w_3200,c_limit/_AKS2802.jpg) and big statement logos. But it is also filtered through a Korean lens (i.e. [texture offset by clean minimalist cuts](https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59e652001b56a03954e546d8/master/w_3200,c_limit/_AKS8155.jpg), and a very [sarcastic sense of humor](https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59e7b2cf1b56a03954e54749/master/w_3200,c_limit/_AKS0556.jpg) to the messaging.) It could be argued that the popularity in streetwear in Korea is a combination of the global growth of luxury sportswear, the tendency of the domestic market to skew to young consumers, as well as a feeling of casual rebellion. In a space where you spend most of your youth in a school uniform streetwear becomes this easy, casual subversive element. So with the Kpop mullet (yes I define it as a specific variation in the same way that a 2-block cut is specific variation of a bowl/mushroom cut) youre pulling elements of streetwear nostalgia, punk/rocker [subversion](https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59ea75f37b212f10e9346bc3/master/w_3200,c_limit/_AKS4205.jpg), and high fashion which this mixing together is VERY on trend in Seoul and lacks the western associations of class. Its things like this that actually gives Korea a leg up in the international markets with a lot of young Korean designers being on the radar of big buyers and publications like Vogue and Selfridges.  


In closing, if you made it this far, HI! Thank you? Theres a lot more I could say to the history of the hairstyle in counter-cultures (esp. queer culture) but listen this is a Kpop reddit. Im probably stretching things pretty thin as is. I guess I just [cant get over JB?](https://imgur.com/a/Lw54W) I kid. In actuality I think if you look at the concepts in recent years theres a definite uptick in 90s styling and I dont think enough people acknowledge it as being part of a larger cultural movement.",11,38

Which member of your bias group doesn't seem to get the vocal recognition they deserve and why do you think they deserve more?

For me, it's EXID's LE.  She's one of the best female rappers in K-Pop, but most people don't realize that she's also an amazing vocalist.  I love this [short cover of Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05OMVh96v-g) she did for JUSE.  She even appeared on [King of Masked Singer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6h0yTJPSLo) and did a fantastic job.  I want, no NEED, an LE solo album at some point.  She can definitely pull it off and I'm confident that her and Sinshasong Tiger could produce a major hit if it ever happened.",58,23

The group currently consists of 23 members from the USA, The Philippines, Canada, Afghanistan, and multiple other countries. Of those 23 members, about 10 are active on a daily basis. Mostly everyone in the GroupMe favors BlackPink above all other groups, but we still love plenty of other Kpop as well (Red Velvet and Twice are pretty popular amongst us). Ages in the chat range from 16-29, but we are currently only accepting 18+ members. 

Do to the nature of such a diverse group of people, we have culminated a very welcoming community of open minded individuals. We dont judge each other, and we love to learn about our differences and similarities through social media and the one thing that ultimately unites us: Kpop. 

We have been a community for almost half a year now, and we talk on a daily basis. Recently however the group hasnt been as active, and we are looking to shake it up by adding new members. Please keep in mind that this group contains many different personalities. Because of this, our only requirement is that you are respectful and do your best to keep an open mind.

In the Acworth, Georgia area we are trying to arrange a K-pop dance cover group. In the group, we would practice choreography from k-pop and j-pop songs. Afterwards, we would record them and upload them online, and perform them at various public events (competitions, conventions, etc.). We would not only dance, but create clothing too! We would sew our outfits for video recordings and performances to match the style of the original artists, as well as the personality of our group. However, knowing how to sew is not a requirement for joining the group!

In addition to dancers to be a part of the group, were looking for an editor and a manager too! We would like an editor to capture content of the group practicing and performing, then edit it into videos that could be uploaded online! We would also like a manager to assist the group in planning events that we could participate in.

This would be an amazing opportunity to not only create art, but to also form friendships and enhance your resume! As a group, we would not only practice and perform with each other, but hang out with each other too. A bond goes a long way in increasing the quality of a groups performance. Being a part of this group would allow you to say that you had experience performing with a dance organization, filming and editing, or managing!

The presentation is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of idiomatic Korean most of the implications will go over a typical viewers head. Theres also the singers' nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their media training - their personal philosophy draws heavily from Joseon Era literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these songs, to realise that theyre not just fun - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike K-Pop truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldnt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Park Jiyeons existential catchphrase Neona jalhassaeyo, which itself is a cryptic reference to Park Chan Wook's 2005 classic ' '. Im smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the imported Swedish songwriters' genius wit unfolds itself on their computer monitors. What fools.. how I pity them. 

And yes, by the way, i DO have a JYP tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. Its for the ladies eyes only - and even then they have to demonstrate that theyre within 5 TOPIK levels of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ",1,14

(Im just envisioning an mv mashup though, not a full production.) I personally am too green (and biased) to make an iconic list, but I know many of you have been around for years. 

So, by year, nominate the most iconic song of the year. I think we should limit this to idol groups only, and we will do at least one boy and one girl group song per year. (Years may end up having more than 2 songs, we will see.)

Also please recommend what year we should start with! :) 2017 will be the final year. 

Limit nominations to the song itself, not the mv or dancing. Those would be their own evolutionary tracks I think.

I will collect nominations and if needed, make a poll for final selections. ",1,2
