Personally, I'd love it for them to debut some girls to rival BlackPink in concept and swag. A super cool, chic and girl crush group, with an emphasis on hip-hop is what I imagine. I think it would be cool for them to be advertised as BTS's little sister group and I think a lot of BTS fans would stan them too. BH definitely has the money to splash on superb training, great music, concept design and flashy music videos.

However do you think because of the natural association with BTS, there would be backlash from fans? Fangirls are notoriously possessive and could the debut of a girl group backfire for BH and the potential girls? Would they be attacked for ""stealing their Oppas"" ? Is this possibly why BH *hasn't* debuted a girl group so far?

He is close to them, but he is closest to Seulgi, who he calls his ""Butterfly"" (it was revealed that his name for Seulgi in his phone contacts is actually Butterfly).

They have shown so much chemistry and closeness that you just know they are very fond of each other. It's actually cute. You can see Seulgi on Heechul's stream while he was playing League of Legends, you can see Heechul playing games with her, even personally feeding her, and you can just notice the obvious level of comfort between the two. Heechul on a number of times has mentioned ""*I really like her eyes*"". On many occasions he has casually mentioned this.

In Idol Weekly, when the members of Red Velvet were asked to draw Heechul, we can see how they actually perceive him. The members drew him in a funny, unflattering way, which was funny.

Except for Seulgi. She drew Heechul as she sees him, handsome, lovable, charming.

The dynamics between them is adorable.

But here's my theory. I think underneath it all is a Korean drama classic: the narrative of two people unable to admit their feelings to each other.

Heechul believes that Red Velvet members see him as a big brother, a caretaker who will never break that trust by having romantic attachments to anyone. *I can never tell her how I feel.*

At the same time, Seulgi thinks that Heechul sees her only as a younger sister. *He will never look at me that way.*

And so it goes, each of them unable to express what they really think of each other, hiding their true feelings behind innocent smiles and playful laughter, never quite knowing that they are made for each other :(",9,4,False,self,,,,,

* [Hani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZvpXTc8Eg4) and [Jungkook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQB9DRyzR34&amp;t=1m22s) would be/are able to sleep anywhere, at anytime, which is both super helpful for their work and also just a generally useful life skill.

* Taemin would be able to switch between his [2008-fetus-self](https://imgur.com/a/XU040) and [his current evolution](https://imgur.com/a/r27hs). I think this would be useful for hiding in crowds, playing on playgrounds without being judged, and memes.

* NCT ([2018 version](https://imgur.com/a/IdNYw)) would be able to fit all 18 members into a very small car (a la [clown car](https://imgur.com/a/RvFW0)) which would make travel more convenient and save gas money.

I wanted to keep the team to 4 for simplicity sake, and I encourage you to write why the members that you have chosen deserve to be on your all-star roster. 

Rules: Keep it to single gendered teams and currently active k-pop idols. I understand this may just be a post about everyone listing off their biases from each group until it adds up to 4, but try to be a little objective!

My 2018 All-Star Team:

 1. Nayeon (TWICE) - Incredibly versatile vocalist, charismatic and natural leader. The backbone for this team.

 2. Seulgi (Red Velvet) - The jill-of-all-trades. Most well rounded idol on this team, basically thrives in all areas.

 3. Lisa (BLACKPINK) - I value a strong rapper when I see one (/r/hiphopheads I see you famo). Has one of the most unique flows (in both English and Korean) and serves as an incredible dancer as well. No debate here.

 4. Wendy (Red Velvet) - Phenomenal vocals. She was sort of my flex pick for a few reasons: Couldn't leave out the 6ix Goddess (forever making Toronto proud), Seulgi's other half and brings a strong international presence, alongside Lisa.

Anyway have fun with your list! There isn't any one winner all-star group as each of these idols not only bring so much to the table but these picks are YOUR picks (which comes with its own emotional attachment). Love to see all the great teams &lt;3
