First - it has a jyp sticker on the back of the label of the product container thing

Second it worked properly like it should have and connects well on the app",2,13

2. Tzuyu looks like a river gecko-iguana hybrid that was genetically modified as an embryo to have a 3 in radius cranium and 50 feet long stick arms. 

3. Nayeon is a chipmunk chimp from outer space that reversed her age to get into JYP and Sixteen and should be exposed ASAP.

4. Tzuyu looks like an emaciated Sudowoodo. 

5. Natty from Sixteen is a loser (oh wait, this is not unpopular).

6. Fuck Tzuyu

7. Fuck Tzuyu

8. Just in case you did not get my opinion, 

9. Fuck Tzuyu

(TIER LIST)
1. Momo (hot as fuck, small forehead BTW, dance on my dick)

2. Tan Jihyo (DTNA music video white dress GG my dick, leader, OP no brainer decision, also op tits)

3. Mina (JAPANESE GODDESS, shy queen, sixteen surfboard dance- nutted on my bellybutton)

4. Sana (understated leader that carries degenerate garbage team on Sixteen ep5, hot aesthetics, makes me want to shave my neckbeard and get to 300 kg so I can have a chance at her)

5. Chaeyoung (i thought she was ugly af but then she got long hair so she is now hot GG, i want to ride her like a Harley-Davidson and pull her pigtails while screaming ""IS SANA GAY"")

6. Jungyeon (badass but not hot unlucky)

7. Nayeon (this fucking ugly whore can sing but has disgusting cheekbones that make me want to thrust my cock in a nuclear coconut that will subsequently make me grow festered boils on my uncut ebola-ridden foreskin from jacking off to Tzuyu pics from this subreddit)

8. Tzuyu (she is NOT hot, refer to lizard point above)

9. Dahyun (oK. I thought she was slightly cute. On a good day. Meaning I shaved my neckbeard 2 inches to a weekly low of 50. However, then I realized that she looks like a demon from Death Note with Jared Leto Joker's disgusting crackwhore mouth, an AIDS_-ridden she-male from the most ebola ridden country in the world, and a silverback ape at the same time. Then, I realized I was tripping. So, Dahyun is last.)

GG SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS BELOW EVEN THOUGH I AM THE ONLY CORRECT OPINION-ER HERE AND YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ALL IRRELEVANT.

BYE HAVE A NICE DAY.

I made this post to give love to ships and pairings that doesn't necessarily have to be romantic, but just pure adorable friendship.


For me, I really love DubChaeng interactions. Unlike SaMo, and 2yeon who also share a similar backstory of long time trainee friends who have been through alot together, I really love the chemistry between these two. It doesn't feel like any romance at all but just two very close friends hanging out and messing around.

But you dont have to witch hunt the other group.. For example, blink once army fandoms are so toxic to one another its ridiculous.  I can say that Im Once and think BP is overrated, but i still think their music is great. It shouldnt auto lead me into getting spammed with death threats and disparaging comments about Twice. Again, I think BTS is a great group and deserves to be #1 but why do Some Armys take it too far sometimes? Why cant everyone be respectful of others opinions ",9,6

First some backstory: I'm a fairly recent fan (december 2017) and as a European who never watched kpop before that moment, i had a hard time keeping some of the members apart. I know... It's stereotypical and maybe kinda racist (?)... I quickly learned to know the members but I occasionally mistook 2 members. Especially when they changed their haircut between albums. The only member i've never had any problems with was Jeongyeon. Probably because she has had short hair for most of the videos. Nowadays, I can't even imagine not keeping them apart, and it's really strange to me that my friends can't even point to the same person twice when comparing my posters. (Or with great difficulty)

my question:
Have you experienced the same thing as me? If yes, can you still remember which members? (I can't remember who I used to confuse) Or is it just because I wasn't familiar with east-Asian people before? I recently had some trouble to distinguish Blanckpink's Jisoo and Rose from each other... But I normally have less problems now",19,18

Two years ago, this summer, [TWICE TV3](https://www.vlive.tv/video/7886?channelCode=EDBF) was released! This season covers a group vacation to Jeju Island, showcasing both pre-planned activities and spur-of-the-moment member interactions.

For some context, this trip during the Cheer Up era, so all of the background music and everyones general style is from the Cheer Up days.

Here, you can share Twice content and media from this era or just discuss this era in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* Have you been to Jeju Island? If so, what did you think? If not, would you like to go in the future?
* What do you like about Twice thats unique to this era?
* If you discovered Twice at or before the Cheer Up era, how has your opinion of the group changed since this era?
* What was your favorite moment from this season of TWICE TV?
* Which member do you feel was the most underrated during this time period?

Like so many what brought me here every day were the cute pics, funny gifs, and short video clips, and to see those now be completely wiped from the subreddit (at least as their own posts) has really taken all the joy from scrolling through this page. The mod post spoke of the large influx of new users over the past year or so and I feel like that is in large part to how the subreddit has operated in that time. I feel like we are fixing something that just wasn't broke. In 24 hours the front page wasn't even half full and I believe that will give new users the idea that this subreddit isn't as active as it truly has been for a while now. This change has also stopped one of my favorite parts of this community, seeing an old picture, gif, or video I missed and finding the source and discovering a bunch of Twice content I somehow missed. Take that short video clip of Sana spoiling What Is Love during the vlive with Momo. I've watched that vlive multiple times and never noticed that part and this video clip sent me back to the vlive to enjoy again. All in all I just find it to be way too extreme in one decision stop about 90% of the posts that were here every day and take away what brought me and many others here in the first place. This is probably the only subreddit I've spent time at every day over the last 2 years and I just hope that doesn't change. No matter what happens I recognize there is not much I can do and life will go on and I appreciate everyone that comes here every day keeping this place alive and kicking, I just felt like if i said nothing and only watched from the sidelines, i would regret it. Thanks for reading and I hope this isn't the end of the discussion.",11,14

What do you think of Twice's Japanese Discography?


Are there people that genuinely like it more than their Korean songs?

I think the general reception of it is pretty decent to negative. But then, there will be the most common argument that people bring up:

""It fits to Japanese tastes and is for the japanese audience and they clearly like it because it sells well, etc""


Alot of people seem to agree with this. But this statement honestly grinds my gears so much.


Good music is good music. There's no such thing as ""the japanese like these more because its according to their taste"".


If that is the case, then can people explain to me why their Korean releases ALWAYS do better than their Japanese singles. 


What is Love is currently charting higher than Wake Me Up despite being a Korean song, and being an older song. Likey outlasted Candy Pop and One More Time in the charts.
 
Well here is the evidence that Japanese people have almost the same taste as normal fans do. If a song is good it'll do good. Jpop or Kpop, it doesn't matter. And the fact that their Korean songs are all doing better in terms of longevity in the JP charts means that the JP public love it more than their actual JP singles. 
 

People seem to have forgotten that TT, Twice's biggest hit in the country and is still charting, was not tailored to Japan at all and was a Kpop song. 


And people like to bring up the physical sales as an argument as well when in fact, that doesn't even matter because those are purely from Twice's fandom power and not the song.


With BDZ coming out, and being a JYP produced song, I am hoping it sticks with the kpop sound and music because that's what made them big in JP in the first place and not this ""tailored for Japan nonsense""",25,22

957,2018-8-16,2018,8,16,6,97mfsh,Subreddit changes should be reverted,penguinbias,1534370003,"Hello Once, this is my take on it all:

I understand that all of us (even the mods) are striving for the same goal; a better, more user-friendly and creative subreddit where we all can show our love and appreciation for Twice but it has come to my attention that these past changes have done the opposite of that.

The activity here has gone down by a huge amount. Pre-change r/twice could easily have 30-45 uploads a day (depending on if any new Twice-related content came out or not), while the past 24 hours we've gotten around 10 something posts where as most of them are only fanart. Don't get me wrong, good fanart should in my opinion get more upvotes than a regular photo/gif due to the time and talent put into them but ever since those have taken up a large amount of the latest posts it's starting to look like r/art.

When I joined this subreddit 2 months ago it was filled with interesting content where as you could check some out, come back a couple hours later and still have a ton of new posts to catch up to. The activity these past days compared to then is, if you ask me, silly. If a new Once joined r/twice in the state that it is now, I doubt he/she would see much reason to stay here. 

Hopefully the mods see this but I suspect that they're already working on a solution to this issue. This is not meant to be rude towards anyone who promoted/contributed to these changes, it's just my opinion regarding the current state we're in. See it as constructive criticism. My suggestion would be to revert the changes and/or add a post limit to every user.

Once, feel free to discuss and say what you'd like this subreddit to become, how we could spark life into it or even a solution to the current state of it. ",145,501

965,2018-8-16,2018,8,16,13,97p35q,Constructive Dialogue for r/Twice,STONEGHOST_,1534392372,"I want to preface this by saying I harbor no ill will or anger towards the moderators.  To better our sub we must create discussion. I may disagree with the current rules but were allowed to have differences of opinion. Were all human. Except Jihyo because she is a god. Also Im on mobile so formatting might be atrocious lol. 

To start, I am u/STONEGHOST_. Ive been subbed here since Twices TT era though not entirely on this account. You could describe me as a lurker. r/Twice is one of three subreddits that are favorited for me on Reddits mobile app (just goes to show how often I lurk) and my favorite of the three. Now that you know a little bit about me, lets get to talking. 

The events taking place in this sub has ignited within me a drive to create a dialogue for the betterment of all. My hope is that through discussion, we can in the future avoid what is in my opinion a miscalculated overstep from the moderators of r/Twice. 

This is not to lay blame on anyone in particular because it is my understanding that the mods believed this is what our community wanted. 

What I want to talk about is:
- surveys and their implantation
- moderators/moderation
- new rules

Surveys

Before any changes take place, I believe a survey should be made available for the community to vote on. Reading through this weeks Weekly Discussion Thread I discovered that questions were being asked of the community through previous weekly threads by the mods as to what the Redditors of r/Twice wanted implemented. I will admit that I dont always browse the weekly threads so I wont be available to answer any questions that are being asked. The weekly discussion threads should be helpful for gathering questions that can be incorporated into surveys to ask the general audience of this sub. 

All surveys should be pinned on its own for greater exposure. Any other topics that are normally pinned should be removed. Ive seen one mod (u/This-Is-Tony) comment on how the amount of posts that can be stickied are an issue but the solution should be a no brainer: just remove one of the stickies. Whats important should always be front in center over the more casual conversations taking place in the stickies.

We should all have an equal voice in the affairs of this sub. Ive already seen some disparaging comments about how all the lurkers are coming out of the dark to whine about the new rules. Does that mean we arent allowed to display displeasure with the current state of affairs because were not vocal enough for you?

Moderators/Moderation

I almost exclusively use Reddits mobile app but I did take a glance at r/Twice on my pc to discover that there are only 6 moderators (7 including automod) that moderate this sub. 6 for almost 28,000 people. I think an increase to 10 should be considered immediately. The extra manpower would be helpful to purge all the unnecessary content and lighten the load for the current team of moderators. 

Now this next suggestion might be more extreme but there is a real world precedent. In 2015, former prime minister of the UK David Cameron set a date for a referendum about Brexit (the then hypothetical UK withdrawal from the EU) for June 2016. Cameron campaigned to remain within the EU and when the country voted to leave, he stepped down because he did not think it would be right for [him] to try to be the captain that steers [the UK] to its next destination. 

I think this line of thinking should apply to the moderators. If they do not agree with what the general population wants, they should consider stepping down to let somebody else whos more perceptive of the majority to take the reigns.  Now Im not advocating for anybodys removal but a disconnect between the mods and the community could spell disaster. We must be on the same page. As I said a paragraph up this is probably more extreme and I would hate for this to create an echo chamber thats entirely one sided. However, judging from the upvotes/downvotes, the majority of people want a return to the status quo or an alternative. Going against the community will not cultivate a happy environment. 

The New Rules

When I first read through the changes I felt rather uneasy about them. Change can be tough to adapt to but I personally felt these changes in particular were incredibly severe and rather abrupt.

The ban on General Media Posts

This one I felt was the most egregious content prohibition. I will copy some of my statement I posted in the weekly thread but I really do enjoy these posts. Life can honestly suck. Like a lot. And seeing videos, gifs and pictures has turned my mood around on many occasions. Even if its just temporary. 

One of my favorite bits of media that came from r/Twice was a video clip of Dahyun crying at what I believe to be one of their Twiceland concerts. According to the translations she said Its quite a heartless world these days. We just wanted you to smile, even for a short moment. For me thats what this sub can be and is: a wholesome escape from the problems at home and abroad. 

If the media is a problem to some then I believe a comprise is the only solution. A 1 post a day/week rule would curb the karma farmers people complain about. Force posters to link the source of the material in the comments and a date from which the media was taken. Allow reposts of media only after a 6 month period. Anything before hand gets removed. 

This Im not familiar with but is it possible to include a filter on individual subreddits? Maybe by flair? If so, its implementation could allow users who want to avoid the media posts to do just that while getting their news and discussions and vice versa. 

The ban on Low Effort Posts

Some of this I can understand, others not so much. r/Twicememes exist for memes and shitposts so I can understand having relevant posts moved to that sub. Conversely I feel having it in the main sub gives us personality and flair. I love that the community is large enough that we have all these corny inside jokes and an internal meme community.

The doodles and wallpapers I also love having. I know people complain about it currently because thats all that is in our feed but people dedicate a lot of time to drawing and creating content. I mean personally, it would take me a whole month to draw something not even half as good so I appreciate their effort. Ive even used a few wallpapers people have created so heres a belated thank you. 

The ban on Self Promotion and Non Twice Related Posts

My comments here will be similar to my comment in the weekly thread. I pretty much agree with most of this. If its not Twice related it does not belong here. Self promotions should be removed because we are not here to benefit you. The non Twice posts should be moved to the weekly threads. Rumors and other celebrity gossip are not newsworthy so that would belong more in the weekly discussion threads. 

Conclusion

Well here we are at the end. This actually consumed a good portion of my evening but I couldnt stop typing away. This has been on my mind almost nonstop since Sunday. I felt like towards the end I kind of tapered of a bit into rambling/ranting but I just want whats best. Im being selfish but I do want a return to the status quo, or at least an altered version of it. If you made it this far please feel free to add/critique any of my statements. These events show now more than ever that discussion is incredibly important for us to thrive.

TL;DR

- weekly threads should be used to source questions for surveys
- we should have surveys for major rule changes
- r/Twice could use an increase in moderators
- moderators should follow the communitys direction (basically follow the results of any survey)
- allow caps on media submissions per day/week
- allow community content (memes, wallpapers, etc)
- divert non Twice rumors, gossip to weekly threads
- remove self promotions

969,2018-8-16,2018,8,16,14,97phf9,Banning media posts is bad for this subreddit,janbay,1534396309,"TL;DR: Media posts were the most popular and the most common type of posts on this sub, therefore banning them from the main feed is silly. The comment section is not made for content, and is not a suitable replacement for the main feed.

As someone who is not interested in the megathreads and weekly discussions, i only found out about the rule changes now. I noticed how few pics and gifs were posted here in the last few days though, and it struck me as weird at the time.

I think the mods went a little bit power hungry with these changes. You must remember that this is a community forum, and it seems ironic that the mods themselves arent aware of what makes this sub great. Its extremely obvious that media posts were not only most of the content on the sub, it was also the most popular. You can see for yourself that images and gifs get hundreds of upvotes while links, discussions, news updates and so on get usually less than a hundred upvotes and rarely reach over 200 (exception being the actual MV youtube links, which are understandable. besides, they only come once every few months). It seems obvious to me that most people here are more interested in those media posts than anything else.

You could say that there are fansites or other places to get these gifs and pics but reddit is the best place to get the media content by far, where all the media is congregated in one simple forum. As someone who exclusively uses reddit on mobile, i can easily save any post i want either through downloads or by favoriting on reddit. And with the boost 3rd party client i can instantly view content from streamable and youtube and so on on the client, making it so much better. The sub is called r/twice and it should reflect the generality of that name. This sub should be for everything twice related, not just a digital newspaper. Nobody wants to go through 3 different subs, their twitter feed and a bunch of fansites to get their twice content.

You could say that media posts are still here, only in megathreads, but thats not nearly as convenient. As praised as it is, reddits reply/comment section is still that, a comment section, not where you are supposed to have content. You cant see images and gifs in the comment section, you dont have thumbnails/previews for links, you cant flair, you cant search for comments. If i remembered a particular gif of tzuyu and i want to find it again, i can just search ""tzuyu"" and id find it easily. Now id have to remember what thread i found it in.

Scrolling through and being in awe of the visuals and cringing at the cuteness is what made this sub fun to visit. Now its just a bunch of links.

Sorry if i come off too aggressive, this was sort of a mini-rant. Hopefully they revert this change ASAP. Im open for discussion and would love to hear other opinions.",5,27

It's thankless work for sure, but it keeps the sub running. I'd compare it to being a school superintendent. When schools are open, buses are on time, children are eating and learning, then the status quo is maintained. You know it's being run right yet you wouldn't think to ask why. It just is. Just because we don't say thank you doesn't mean it's not appreciated. 

/u/This-Is-Tony I hope you don't take some of these comments as a personal attack. I imagine it sucks to see that kind of backlash after taking the time to bring up these changes. [As the girls would say](https://youtu.be/1Kg4yomNEgs?t=56s)... 

/u/anthonyblues I'm glad you guys are discussing solutions but it's been three long days. The general consensus hasn't changed and some of us (including myself) have been throwing suggestions here and there. I don't know how you browse the sub outside of moderating it, but it's depressing AF not seeing the girls when I open up this sub. I've been pretty vocal about the change, and for that reason. I spent a good hour-plus on my [initial reaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/96t9fe/180813_weekly_discussion_thread/e45s0qu/) the other night. 

**If we're still trying to figure out a solution, then let us help you.**

This isn't the House of Representatives on Obamacare. We shouldn't be so divided on this, and we shouldn't have to wait for the perfect solution, because there will never be one. All we can hope for is something that's manageable. So let's jump into what works and what could be tinkered to keep the mods happy and the users happy.

---

**Event Megathreads.**

Keep. The KCON one was a good example of how it should work.

**Scheduled Discussion Threads**

Keep. I was a proponent for this. Did I complain about the lack of community? You bet I did (ironically, this change united a lot of us). Did I want something beyond the General Discussions? Sure, I was hoping for directed discussions that wouldn't get buried by media. Did I imagine that we'd go Thanos on the pics and gifs for it? Nope. And if I ever implied that in any way, then I would be wrong to have done so. 

**Changes to how the main subreddit feed operates**

And now the biggest point of contention. The allowed items all make sense. A lot of people have already stated their thoughts on prohibiting general media. I can agree with the other items under that though.

--

The loss of general media is the biggest pain point. For myself, that was the reason I would frequent this sub so much. Staying for discussions only came natural after that. For others, maybe they just wanna browse the pics and brighten up their day. For others, that can be therapeutic. I've seen more than a handful of threads where a new Once became less depressed after discovering Twice and this sub.

**So does the mod team have any intentions to revert that part of it?**

I really hope so. But I don't want to wait a week or a month or however long it might be, especially not with BDZ right around the corner. So what's a 'good solution' for the mods? If the intention is to increase discussions, then we've done that here and we've added scheduled threads. If the intention is to manage the sub's growth, then there has to be a better way other than removing everything that made this sub an enjoyable place to visit. 

---

#Let's get to these proposed amendments. 

**Limit media posts to 1 per day.**

Yes, we've complained about reposts and recycled content. A lot of that was also driven by a subset of dedicated karma farmers that have been called out repeated in the past. Some are gone, so that should alleviate some of the reports workload. The limit would ensure a steady stream of content while decreasing the mod workload. 

**Source requirement on media posts**

I like [this suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/96t9fe/180813_weekly_discussion_thread/e47jnmp/) from /u/heavyunderwear. First off, it's just a great way to discover new content - I can't recall how many times I found myself down a rabbit hole after finding where some gifs originated from. Second, I used to imagine some users may have refrained from posting their source so they can keep farming it for karma. I'm not saying this would stop it completely, but at least it would curtail some of it if more people have access to it. 

**Megathreads**

I appreciate the work some of our users have put into these. It's not how browse reddit and I usually don't revisit them after the first day or two, but it's nice to keep things organized (see: Concert megathreads). Keeping these around for the next point, which is

**Media embargo during Twice comebacks and promotions**

Put the main feed media ban only for these times. This way, megathreads can maintain visibility, and everyone can hype on the music shows, the V Lives, the variety shows, discuss the new songs/albums, and so on. Pretty much all the newest content some people have been calling for.

**Alternatively, place restrictions on media allowed during Twice comebacks and promotions**

The idea here is users can post whatever they want as long as it's directly related to that specific week or event. Let those posts stay up there for a day, and then when the next event starts, assimilate them into the megathreads. This allows both the stream of media, while making it easier for the wiki organizers to keep track and update. Then to balance that, allow something like a free-posting weekend, where people can continue post any media not related to the event during the weekend. 

**Combating reposts/similar image sets**

So I'll admit I don't know what the best answer is here and I highly encourage others to think of a solution that beneficial for everyone here.

Personally, I think we should remove that repost limit (6 months/350 upvotes). I feel all it's done is create more work for the mods. We had on average 75 new submissions per day under the previous ruleset. I don't know how many users that would be, since there were several accounts taking advantage of the 4-a-day limit. Just to use as an example, let's say it was 8 accounts that did that. And another 10 was posting 2-a-day. Which leaves maybe 20 on 1-a-day or sporadic. Implementing the 1 media post a day limit would cut the number of submissions down to about 40 a day. 

I also did a quick search for 'google compilation' - there were easily over 100k photos of the members a few months ago, probably 2-3x that amount by now. And consider we have short gifs from hundreds of hours of videos. If we're gonna see a repost once in a while, it really shouldn't be that big a deal in the grand scheme of things here.

**Recruiting more mods**

So not an amendment and more of a suggestion. I used Tesla and Moviepass as examples. Rather than cut services to fit current resources, we should be growing for expansion. Find someone to fill the time coverage so Tony doesn't have to wake up to a large mod queue. I don't know the extent of the workload there but it's probably not easy with limited manpower.  Open up recruitment. There are obviously passionate fans here, and there have several people that have expressed interest in volunteering. We wouldn't have spent all this time voicing our thoughts, complaints, and suggestions if we didn't care or if we didn't believe things could still work out. 

---

As I'm wrapping this up, I noticed there's been a couple of new threads along the same topic. That should demonstrate two things: 1) it's difficult to keep everything in one thread, as things will start to spill out as people try to make their voices heard (and cumbersome, trying to find the new post in a 300 comment thread), and 2) people still have hope for revert.

So it's not perfect, but I hope we can use this as a springboard to find a solution together and fast. If you would like me to elaborate on any points, don't hesitate to ask.

THANK YOU for those that read this. It took me yet another hour to type, so I hope it doesn't take you an hour to read.

Where do I go for my Twice pics/gifs?,luukhan,1534403757,"Since I've been dealing with KCON the past week I havent had time to read or do any survey for this subreddit. Now I come back hoping to find pics/gifs of the girls only to be looking at 5 things in the ""top"" section. Upon further investigating I see that all pics/gifs got removed and been asked to be put in a megathread. And that this subreddit had a survey and discussion about the future of this subreddit?

My question is this. Why wasn't this survey and discussion just pinned to the top so everyone can see it? Wouldn't that have made more sense and allow people who havent been on this subreddit in awhile to see what the changes were gonna be? I'm so lost and confuse by this change.

2nd question- wtf is a megathread? Is it mobile friendly? Where can I find these threads? Can mods pin them to the top so we can see them?

3rd question- is there another subreddit for the Twice pics/gifs? 

I understand that there should be more news related stuff posted and reposting can be a bit of a hassle to sort but that shouldn't mean we should just throw everything into a megathread and just be done with it. On top of that we have r/kpop to fill us in on any related Twice news. If it's a single current Twice only event then it should be pinned and place to the top.

I like seeing old pics/gifs of Twice. Since I wasnt around for their debut and me being a new Once since January, it's nice seeing their old pics/gifs.

This is just my opinion. I'm not here to bash the mods. They are just trying to maintain this subreddit the best that they can. If they feel like they need more mods than they should start asking people for help. I'll be a mod if they need me!",2,5

I was one of the very vocal people who complained that r/Twice was lacking in discussion and was only a subreddit of media dump.

The solution to that was the discussion threads, and it went pretty successful and active from that point on, and it was a very welcomed change.


However I think it also became a double-edged sword, because as time went on, people have been accustomed to it and have been using the discussion thread for, discussions. Which obviously, is what the purpose is, but this in turn significantly reduced the presence of individual text posts and discussion posts in the Twice feed, as all questions and discussions are organized into a single thread, this further making it look like that r/twice is only filled with image/gif posts.


And then now, after the discussion from a vocal set of people these past few weeks, I think most active users here were under the assumption that most r/twice users want to have more discussions and reduce the amount of photos and reposts. This turned out to be false, as it actually only was the vocal minority, and the majority of people here in the sub want their daily fix of Twice images. In hindsight it made sense, of course those who actively want discussions were the only ones who participated in discussing the state of the sub, and those who didn't would naturally not even notice it.


I now think this is a mistake and it is hurting the subreddit more than it is helping. I think if this goes on, this will eventually kill the sub and we should revert the changes as soon as possible. 


To those of us who actively want discussions, it's better to not just complain and complain, but rather, proactively create and encourage the discussions ourselves.

The only reason r/Twice became a media dump is because a lot of people don't even bother to create text posts anyway.

And there are other sites out there we active Twice discussions, like Onehallyu, Amino, and even the discord. We should learn to look for discussions in other sites, not just on reddit. I'm sorry, but we are the minority here and it makes sense for us to adjust instead of the majority.

So yes, for the sake of this sub, I want the old state back, because even I admittedly miss seeing our girls in the feed.",1,2

I don't necessarily like all of the changes, but I have to come out &amp; say that the way the sub was before was essentially meaningless.  I understand to some extent people just want to get on &amp; see some pictures/gifs/etc. &amp; clearly that is a large portion of this sub's base, but it was extremely disheartening essentially knowing for a fact that 99%+ of any individual conversation starters were never going to have a chance.  Discussion threads are not a solution to this, the first couple comments that get upvoted in them are going to take the vast majority of the conversation, anybody with an interesting take or idea that isn't there upon thread creation might as well not even bother.  


In most normal subs that I've taken part in, the karma upvote/downvote system allows for the most interesting or well thought out posts to make it to the top, but in this sub there was no filtering out good discussion from bad discussion, because neither of them made it, it's all just memes, pics, &amp; gifs.  Every solution that I've seen to this by those complaining about the changes is EXACTLY what they're complaining they shouldn't have to do.  Oh, make a Twicetalk reddit page, oh, just put it all in a discussion thread.  


What?  Put our media content in a single thread?  Go to a separate reddit page?  What is this, a dictatorship!?  Why should we have to do that?  


I'm not saying these complaints aren't legitimate, or that if people like me looking for some meaningful discussion are in the minority that we should be catered to, but it's a little tiring seeing people act like they got on this sub &amp; inside the 100s of media posts there were these super deep &amp; interesting discussions.

There have been a lot of questions lately about the direction of the subreddit over the last few days. One thing I've failed to understand is what do people want out of a discussion centred board? Like, let's face it you're not going to get any controversial opinions or negative comments when discussing on a subreddit such as this, if anything all of them will be downvoted. From my point of view the discussion on this type of subreddit will most likely end up in a circle jerk. Like what can you honestly discuss? The most discussion I've seen are MVs in which some people agree of disagree the song was not catchy or not. Or it was a bunch of questions about the event. Like, it was you either liked it or you did not like it.

I don't think you can get much from discussing a girl group that just makes songs, at the end of day it does not really amount to anything but a circle jerk or an opinion that is extremely superficial because some poeple are radicals when it comes to their fandoms.",100,341

Will JYPE ever actually listen to them?",TwiceTrash1020,1534521192,"Seeing as the mods want more discussion, I guess Ill start with a topic I bring up constantly yet get shut down because no one wants to have a genuine discussion about it.

What are your own personal opinions on JYPE continuing down the cute concept route even though the girls themselves have been wanting to go back to a girl crush image for a while now? 

I personally feel like Twice actually thrives in darker concepts more than their brighter concepts since they feel more comfortable singing and dancing when its not super bright and cheery. Say what you want but DTNA has been Twices *best performing title* since TT and it was a step in the more mature direction with cleavage showing, them dancing in heels, no aegyo what so ever, and the girls got to have a powerful dance. Fans seem to be wanting it too so why is JYPE holding back? Should they hold back? Do you see any issues if they keep with their current concept or do you see any major issues if they swap?

(Also, please actually give *good* comments besides the JYPE should let them do whatever they want sentence. Like I wanna see actual feedback since this is an actual issue that has only get more annoying the longer fans try to ignore it.)",49,46

Like I'm sure many of us are, I'm upset about the new rules. The ban on media posts was a dramatic change with little prior communication and visibility.  
I browse this subreddit at least 5 times a day, and I had no idea this was coming, or that people were opposed against media posts. There should've been a survey stickied to the top PRIOR to the changes. Also, it was a mistake that you bundled us with ""karma farmers"" when I've really only posted here a few times, each trying to be original.

Mods, we appreciate what you do and I believe that you've got the right idea in mind. However, from what we've seen so far, a big chunk of what we discuss here now are the changes to the subreddit. At least before, we'd comment about the pictures or the gifs.

You can look at the numbers of traffic, but know that some of us are only checking back to see if the changes have been reverted. I can't say the numbers confidently, but please realize that what you've done here has created a huge conflict in an otherwise happy subreddit for TWICE.",42,80

I can't possibly imagine what you guys need to discuss about 9 girls that can't be done in the comment sections of MV releases or a weekly discussion megathread. 

I enjoyed seeing cute pics of the girls bless my front page daily and checked in on why they disappeared. I still don't know how I can see the pictures again but I did see someone say i need to search ""flair:megathread"" to find them. Also previews don't exist in the comment section so I have to delete about 30 chrome tabs a day if I want to look at pics. 

Mods can correct me if I'm wrong, but there are 28k subs and I don't think I've ever seen any release or weekly thread rack up more than a few hundred comments. From that, I could deduce that a majority of subscribers are people, like me, that just want to see new releases, variety shows, fan creations, and pics of the girls. 

I'm also not against the discussion posts. You can learn some pretty cool things from looking in there. Or some insight into korean culture or opinions from people that probably hold more insight than my own opinion. I just find it difficult to understand how the 100 some odd people that are on here 24/7 get annoyed seeing pictures of the girls. Not everybody has been in this sub since sixteen, or seen every single photo of them. 

**TL;DR** pls tell me how to see the pics on mobile. pls enlighten me on what new topics you can possibly discuss in the months between comebacks. ",59,317

1054,2018-8-18,2018,8,18,10,987sl1,Lurker here. So first post time (its about the new rules),TheDanime,1534554812,"So Ive been lurking here since TT and honestly Ive been here mainly to save all the pictures that come here. Theres occasionally a scandal or whatnot that happens that Ill read because its typically the only ever discussion this subreddit ever gets other than MV opinions. But other than that, thats about it.

I should say that I follow every members respective reddit page, the Twice meme reddit and as of today TwiceMedia too. 

Now, Im not going to say that the moderators are wrong for their decisions on how they want this sub to be, they can do what they like but I wanted to share my opinion.

Unfortunately the new rules in place limit us to only news reports, discussions, questions and fan content. 

Now maybe this is a good thing because these things will be easier to find and all in one place. But on the other hand this community might not be content with just this. 

Lastly news reports, and fan content aside. Why are we limited to just discussion when we have a discussion megathread?

Note: not sure how well Ive conveyed what Im trying to say but I think you know what I mean. ",0,4

A while back, /r/DBZDokkanBattle mods did this same thing. Anyone play? Great if you have a lot of nostalgia and a slight gambling addiction. That's a sub with tons of discussion already but sometimes it'd get buried by fluff. They implemented the incredibly unpopular rule change and the sub revolted with constant ""we hate this"" posts, then attempted discussions, found there wasn't that much to discuss about a strategy game with constant news, and the sub dried up during the two-week trial period. 

Then they reverted it. And the week after that, mods thought things would be great as everyone was so thankful to have the sub back to normal.

But people weren't happy. 

""How could our mods do this to us?"" they cried. ""Who voted for them? Not me."" 

People wanted blood. 

Reparations.

Retribution.  

I tell you this story because r/twice is in a similar predicament and the timeline is the same, but sped up because constant discussion on Twice is either impossible or unhealthy. Kpop fandoms in general already border on unhealthily obsessed and /r/kpop's ""discussions"" are already the least engaged. The top posts for this week are teasers, MVs, performances, broken records, and Eric Nam buying out an Atlanta theater showing for Crazy Rich Asians (a great movie, go see it if you can)--all stuff that Twice alone can't sustain. 

So when you've had enough of the revolt, you'll think putting things back is doing the right thing and you should be rewarded for it, but no. 

The right thing was letting the sub continue to grow and be happy and the mods implementing this were the problem, not the media posts. 

tldr: The mods will be unpopular after this rule change is reverted and the sub won't go back to normal until one or all of you step down. Sorry if you hadn't thought of that. ",3,12

Like for me I'm a multi fandom listener so I'm a fan of BTS, iKON, BLACKPINK, RED VELVET, and TWICE mainly and listen to other groups as well but those are the mains. 

For me, my ult bias happens to be from TWICE which is Jihyo(praise the God) and she's recently become my ult bias because I notice her presence in variety shows being such a strong leader to a fast rising girl group. There's a myriad of others reasons as well but you get the gist. 

If you're not a multi fandom listener, what's the reason that someone from TWICE is your bias?

However, it looks like [that will not be the case](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/97x9l6/today_is_a_perfect_example_of_why_media_should_be/e4cfxr3/):

&gt;I'll be honest and say a straight up reversion is very unlikely to happen. The old format has it's own serious issues that needed to be addressed so we aren't going to go straight back to that.

&gt; Anything we decide will have to be something new again, and thats what we are talking about. At the same time it hasn't even been a week with this format yet, and its we're still going to watch how this one plays out aside from all the expected initial outcry.

I've pretty much come to terms at this point, and I love Twice too much to hold any sort of animosity towards the state of this sub. It also helps that /r/twicemedia has started to gain traction, so I'm finding a lot of joy over there. I think the very least the mods can do here is include it on the sidebar links for our users to discover more easily. Right now it seems like a lot of its media is being migrated from here, but surprisingly I'm still seeing content that I haven't seen before in my three months on this sub.

While I'm not leaving the sub (since I still like to talk about Twice), I do want to leave a message for the old sub:

Having looped it several times on the way to work, all day at work, and more on the way back from the gym, I have a pretty good feel for the song.

First off, the chorus is the most memorable (as usual with Twice). i can't help hearing the 'r' sound in bull, and the image of tzuyu's salute always comes to mind. 

However, starting off the song with the chorus made the song seem really short. They go through that three times in two minutes before Dahyun's rap, at which point I know the song is about to end.

Someone also pointed the absence of a Chaeyoung rap. She shows up in the verses at least (unlike DTNA). I hoping this means some diversification in member vocal roles - maybe prep her into my singing, or allowing Momo some rap lines.

Overall it's my favorite of the Japanese releases, which have all been very bubbly up to this point. It's not the girl crush that people wanted, but I think it still carries a strong tone and serves to test the waters in potential concept changes.",42,48

Expected initial outcry? Did you expect the vast majority to hate it? Even in the survey, that was held by u/Ushuted, where 82% were unhappy with the media post change and the incredible amount of negative comments and responses when asked about thoughts on the sub after the changes.

1084,2018-8-19,2018,8,19,10,98giwd,How about the mods and users make a compromise?,SankarshanaV,1534640617,"Hi r/twice.

Ive most been a lurker and have just posted a few pics/gifs of Twice on this sub, but I mostly came for the pictures and the Twice-related media.

But I started noticing that the number posts of gifs and pictures of Twices started to diminish from my feed, and made me wonder why it happened.

I am sure this has been the case for majority of the users, and its been because of the change in rules enforced by the mods.

The mods say that this new change in rule was brought in due to users complaints, but the mod did not show proof of it, so I cant exactly say if its true.

There has been a LOT of negativity around this sub, so its become a bit tough to visit this sub.

So how about we come to a compromise? 

My solution is this: 

Let the mods be with this new change for the next few months, until Twices next comeback, and then assess the results whether these changes have made a positive impact on the sub, or whether if it has just made this sub worse.

The mods say that these changes do work, but we need to wait for the results.

Honestly, the best thing imo is for us to come to a compromise and do as I just mentioned above. 

But in the meantime, if you want any Twice-related media, you can check out /r/twicemedia subreddit instead.

I think this is a good idea... what do you guys think?

While I do enjoy all Twice content I must admit that to me their Japanese releases thus far havent really wowed me. Except Candy Pop, it reminds me of Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. Its funny because I listened to J-pop waaaay before I ever listened to K-pop. My personal favs are Kyary, Perfume, Hatsune Miku, and Stereopony.

So its not like I dislike J-pop, I guess I just dont like the sound of Twices Japanese stuff. Only way I can describe it is it sounds off, like not genuine or true to their concept or general aesthetic. I guess thats why I like Candy Pop because it is very much a Twice song whilst Wake Me Up just doesnt in my opinion. Im hoping BDZ will get me into their Japanese releases or even simply impress me.

Regardless Ill support my girls no matter what I just happen to prefer their Korean stuff. What do you prefer? What are your fav Japanese tracks? If you do like their Japanese stuff, why? If not do you think BDZ will change your opinion?",13,26
1094,2018-8-19,2018,8,19,19,98jbma,"I think Twice's talent/skill level has become too underrated, even among Onces",zetsupetsu,1534673954,"We know the mainstream hate Twice get is the ""hurr durr talentless girls who cant sing and only know to act pretty"". And I even see some Onces actually acknowledge this by saying ""they might not be the best at singing/dancing but they work hard and deserve success!"". I know their intentions are good but its as if they themselves know that the girls lack skill. It makes me roll my eyes everytime I read something similar.


I think this myth has become too widespread that everyone just assumes so and no one would associate Twice as being a talented group at all and is all about visuals and catchy songs. And its honestly sad to see.


We have Momo, acknowledged by several people in the kpop industry to be the best female dancer this generation, but only a few fans/non fans are aware about this and is easily dismissed and buried because of the amount of hate she gets for her nasally voice and how she's ""untalented"" because she can't sing.


We have Jihyo, 10 years worth of training, one of the best performers on stage, has a heavenly voice, but even Twice's main vocal can't escape the criticism and is still considered someone who can't sing because of the ""Twice can only lip sync"" belief people have and the widespread cherry picked MR removed videos on youtube.


We have Chaeyoung, honestly the only one you could call a legitimate rapper out of the current big 3 girl groups. She's been a lyricist even before debut. She's wrote songs and composed her rap with witty lines, she has natural flow when rapping and can potentially compete in unpretty rapstar/show me the money, but nope. She isn't known for any of these things and stereotyped as a ""girl group rapper"" who couldn't rap. The cute rap lines in their title tracks isn't helping either. Other big girl groups gets praise for their ""rapping"" because they look cool and act badass while reciting verses just given to them to memorize, but none of them actually does most of what Chaeyoung does.


We have Nayeon, one of the best performers. An all-rounder who can sing, dance, act, host. Basically the true qualities of an idol. JYP labeled her their ace and trump card during pre-debut. But again, none of these are enough and Nayeon, as the face of Twice, gets the most hate and labeled as a lip-sync queen. 


Even Dahyun, the one who gets the most flack for being bad at everything- singing, dancing and rapping. Said to be the least talented Twice member. I believe some Onces even acknowledge this to be true. Where is your faith in Dubu? I doubt fans even are aware of this: Dahyun auditioned for all of the Big 3 and passed ALL three of them. That's not something just anyone can do. She just chose JYPE because they scouted her first. And being an idol is not all about raw singing or dancing prowess either. JYP specifically said in the final episode of Sixteen that she chose Dahyun not because of any of those, but because of her sheer star power.


Tzuyu is another great example. We have seen her growth over the years. She was relatively bad the first few episodes of Sixteen. But compare that to her now? She's become the most improved. There are times when the others slightly mess up when they are singing live, but for Tzuyu? when was the last time you heard her sang off key? I honestly cannot remember. She has been incredibly stable to the point that sometimes I rank her as the best singer after 3mix. 


I'd like to elaborate on other members more but I think you all know where I'm getting at here. Twice's skills are too underrated. Each member have above average to excellent skills. When you compare most girl groups to Twice, the automatic assumption is that girl group X is more talented than Twice, when in reality, I honestly think that Twice are leagues more talented than alot of girl groups out there.",90,286

I think JYP got put off USA as Wonder Girls didnt do too well (bit of promo and a supporting your). But BTS may have changed things. If they want to go for the USA market they need to hit the mainstream audience with something viral like a cover of a really popular song. The reason I like twice is that they remind me of the 90's pop acts I loved, catchy lyrics and catchy choreography. They could do a great pop cover to get the attention of the mainstream and then do an English language version of one of their songs. Or a song with simple Korean words like ganganam style.

K-pop is hard to get into from a foreign perspective alot of it is alien (group structure, names of people etc) even the term ""idol"" is new. They could do with dumbing it down again and going back to rookie days with the whole ""black swan"", ""girl crush"" personas. This is more familiar (scary spice, baby spice anyone?). 

The biggest barrier would be language, they need to all be better at English. And by better I mean more confident as I suspect they know alot but are scared to speak it. They don't have a fluent speaker to fall back on so unfortunately it would be very hard for them to promote. 

Twice are hugely attractive at the moment their songs could have huge international reach, they just need to give people a helping hand getting to know them.

please bring back media posts! I do think there needs to be a cap though as the spamming of the same pictures being posted in intervals of a couple days was an eyesore. Relevant media posts only!

Actually allow discussion BEYOND just pg-13 dialog. I know for a while if you cussed too much you were get banned or warned but most of us here arent children so I found that ridiculous. Ive never seen so many fucks, damns, and shits on this sub and its actually relieving.

With TWICELAND ZONE 2: Fantasy Park in full swing, lets look back at the first TWICELAND concert series. This tour took place in February - April 2017 and was split into 3 legs: Seoul, Bangkok, and Singapore, plus a Seoul encore leg in June 2017.

For context, [KNOCK KNOCK](https://youtu.be/8A2t_tAjMz8) was released at the beginning of this tour, so this concert series largely takes inspiration from that era. Additionally, because TWICELAND is under looser time constraints, Twice performs music from various eras and covers while also engaging with the audience.

Here, you can share Twice content and media from this era or just discuss this era in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* Have you been to a TWICELAND concert? If so, what was your experience? If not, would you like to go in the future?
* What do you like about Twice thats unique to this era?
* If you discovered Twice at or before this era, how has your opinion of the group changed since this era?
* Because TWICELAND is a concert specifically for Twice, how is TWICELAND different from other concerts or music shows?
* Where would you want Twice to go next if they had a world tour in mind?

Its a fun way to keep track of what youve seen and havent seen. 

   I feel like this would be great for Twice content for everything theyve been in like, sixteen, twice TV, different variety shows, concert videos, MVs, etc. i think itll help people find content theyve never seen before for Twice! Thoughts?",9,12

Twice's success in Korea and Japan was not possible without their ability to reach out to ""normies"" who weren't traditionally interested in kpop or girl groups. Their album sales and tour numbers were not possible without reaching out to wider audience.

All you are doing is deterring new fans from joining in and actually 'hurting' Twice's foothold in the west. You basically are hurting their chance of becoming a global star. 

More discussions will come naturally as people here learn more about Twice. If they don't, I think it's perfectly fine, there's other fan forums that have more discussions. 

Media posts aren't bad. Discussions aren't bad either. The idea behind the change that people should experience Twice in a certain, forceful way is bad. Know that by restricting media posts, you are undermining what Twice does best, which is to make people happy through their genuine smiles and passion.",0,1

Dahyun - Cheer Up no doubt. 

Jihyo - HeartShaker 

Chaeyoung - I'm going to go with short hair Chaeyoung here because she looked so cute during Signal comeback.

Jeongyeon - I would have to say this comeback, she really seems to have ditched the girl crush vibe which I like and came out of her shell more.

Mina - I liked her style for What is Love? I think bangs definitely suit her best imo.

Tzuyu - What is Love? I thought she slayed the dancing.

Momo - Likey, I thought it was really cool they give her, her own little dance bit. 

Nayeon - Knock Knock, the opening to the knock knock live performances were amazing and I still watch them to this day.",22,71

Nilo's ""Pass By"" (released in October 2017) somehow charted higher than Twice's ""What is Love?"", earlier in April this year, effectively removing their chance at a Perfect-All-Kill.

Shaun's ""Way Back Home"" beat Twice's release of ""Dance the Night Away"" in the charts, as well as beating Blackpink and Apink.

I'm mostly suspicious of Nilo, but I will give Shaun a little bit more leeway given that the song had some promotion by certain celebrities. Also it received relatively ""good reception"". However, JYP didn't want to have any of it as he requested investigation on Sajaegi chart manipulation. 

This seems to happen during Twice's comebacks, and if they're targeted again, I'll be up in arms.

For this week, as per your votes, were discussing *Stuck*!

Here, you can share Twice content and media from this era or just discuss this era in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* How well do you think this song fits Twices concept as a whole? How does this track show the evolution of Twice as an entire group?
* What do you like about Twice thats unique to this era?
* If you discovered Twice before this era, how has your opinion of the group changed since then?
* What was your favorite lyric from this song? Which lines stand out to you?
* Which member do you feel was the most underrated during this era?
* Was releasing the song on CD only a good idea in your opinion? Has an official digital release with *Summer Nights* allowed you to listen to the track more frequently?

You can vote for next weeks song via [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6EETsXQT4dr44C01rVcyQyKFSP2JN2PCnFvk5WQ2HbkI8wQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). Your votes count!

Since Twice doesn't have a ""set"" vocal/dance line (I really don't agree with how they did it in the Yang Nam Show) there's a whole lot of possibilities.

I'm in zone B (New Zealand). I got my Twiceland Opening Encore Blu-ray today but it won't play on my ps3/ps4 or xbox one. The apps load up, the disc starts spinning than it crashes back to dashboard. Any disc that normally is region coded comes up with a message saying it won't play in that zone, but this just won't load on any device. Thought Id try asking here since I doubt Im the only person who brought it in zone B. Dont have a zone A player at the moment to test, so dont want to reach out to the retailer claiming its faulty if it isnt. If someone knows a better place to ask a group of onces please let me know.",13,12

And to that lady, who held Momos waist all the way at the entrance on their bus, Shame on you. And dont even use the excuse that yall got excited because thats not gonna solve things. Heck you even bragged on SNS that you were able to touch Momos waist.

""Twice - The nicest group. Tzuyu, Sana, and Momo are especially nice. Sana is the one who starts conversations. She remembers what we've talked about before and mentions it. (eg. Oppa, you did this on the other day, right?) Tzuyu and Jihyo are the prettiest.""

One commentor stated that:

""3. [+198, -21] Wow, the reviews for Twice are always the same. The celebrities who greet every staff are only Park Bogum, Yoo Jae Suk, and Twice. A PD said he only wanted to cast idols like Twice. Journalists at a showcase said Twice was the only idols who helped the staff with stacking the chairs.""

This was posted on a verified never cafe so it is likely to be true!

""7. [+128, -2] I'm a member of the Naver cafe and that cafe is for fashion and foreign brand purchases. It's not like Pann where idol fans fight and do politics. I read the original post and the OP posted proofs.""

https://mobile.twitter.com/WonderTwice/status/1033200972875460608

Is this really how YG promotes his GGs? Im asking because it seems that everytime an article about BP is made, YG never fails to mention Twice.

Now, dont get me wrong here, this is not some fanwar type of post, but an open discussion of how YG promotes BP. Is downplaying another group really necessary? Cant he just use BPs strong points to promote them.

Comment your thoughts



I just copied the pasta my post from r kpop. Article says BP surpassed Twice in Japan etc etc, first GG to have a dome concert.



Now I havent fully translated what it says but a fellow on Twitter said that theyre not using the full capacity of the venue which is 50k but instead theyll only set the capacity to 30k.


Now may I just remind that this is not a fanwar type of post but a discussion because I think girls on both groups doesnt deserve this.



Now Im not a JPOP or Japanese culture expert but Im pretty sure that attitude and personality are given heavy importance in Japan and I think that mediaplays like this might backfire on Blackpink one day",5,11

1225,2018-8-26,2018,8,26,0,9a7obr,My brother's medical update,Sad_Accident,1535211713,"Hello, everyone. This is Sad_Accident's sister. It feels weird calling him that, but I don't know if he ever told you his real name. For the sake of his privacy, I won't either, just in case. Before his surgery, he asked me to let you know everything that was happening, and showed me how to use reddit a little. I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong, but I'm not one for social media, so I probably am. Please help me out if I need it.

Now, to get into the important stuff. We came to the hospital at 5AM on Thursday, so he could be prepped for surgery at 7AM. They said the surgery would last approximately 7 hours, but it ended up taking nearly 10. I believe he already informed you all that his brain tumor was non-cancerous, but sadly, that's only one issue resolved. He suffered from several complications that all seemed to creep up at once, including a subderal hematoma (bleeding in the skull), and an unseen abscess (a pocket of infection). At one point, we thought we lost him. He was clinically dead on the operating table for nearly ten minutes. He survived the surgery itself, but isn't doing well. He has had two blood
transfusions so far, and had to be placed in a medically induced coma until he stabilizes. He may not wake up at all. Somehow, he's still fighting, but we don't know how much time he has left.

He wrote a short message to your community the night before the surgery:

""Hey guys. There's a very good chance that by the time you read this, I won't be around anymore. I just want to take a moment to let you all know how much the last three months have meant to me. The friendships I've made here are very important to me, and I'm grateful to have met you all. I just wish we could've met in person. I also want to apologize for my actions as of late. There's no excuse for how horrible I've been. I hope you can forgive me. I'm not the best with words, so there's not really much else to say. In case I don't make it, I love you all, my friends. If I do make it, the jokbal is on me. Take it easy.""

I don't know what he did, but I have an idea. Please consider forgiving him for it. He hasn't exactly been himself at home, and I assume that negativity found it's way here as well. It just isn't who he is. By the way, what's a jokbal?

He also had a message for someone named Tony:

""I forgive you.""

I don't know what that's supposed to mean, or who Tony is, but you're forgiven, I guess.

This is all the info I have to share for now. Please keep my brother in your thoughts in this difficult time. Thank you for reading.",54,109
1226,2018-8-26,2018,8,26,0,9a7ouc,Get to know TWICE.,vanquish666,1535211830,"Since there are a lot of new fans I would like to make a post to show you and remind the humble beginnings of TWICE. And why a lot of ONCEs love them so so much.

This should be(in my opinion) watched after SIXTEEN. Since SIXTEEN is the origin story. 

I would especially recommend SIXTEEN episode 7.[Part 1](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2v7yan), [Part 2](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2v85d9).

1, [The First Vlive](https://www.vlive.tv/video/2570) - This is fun to watch, they realise what Vlive is how they can interact with fans and stuff.

2, TWICE TV - The first TWICE TV basically an introduction to the members.
 
[Prologue](https://www.vlive.tv/video/877) - Small interview right after they won SIXTEEN

[Episode 1](https://www.vlive.tv/video/878) - Nayeon and Tzuyu

[Episode 2](https://www.vlive.tv/video/879) - Sana and Mina, Also Chaeyoung teaching J-line Korean

[Episode 3](https://www.vlive.tv/video/1258) -  Chaeyoung and Momo

[Episode 4](https://www.vlive.tv/video/1259) - Weird one (love them for it), They make signature for Autograph and Dahyun, Jeongyeon, Jihyo.
  
[Episode 5](https://www.vlive.tv/video/1459) - JYP's advice to TWICE. Wont be surprised if you stan JYP after this.

[Debut vlive](https://www.vlive.tv/video/2563) - Dorm Vlive, dorm tour(small one). Emotional.

[First SHOWCASE](https://www.vlive.tv/video/2415) - Like Ooh Aah Showcase. I included this since its the first step.

[JYP Practice room Vlive](https://www.vlive.tv/video/2625) - This shows the dorkiness of TWICE and them getting more confident compared to earlier videos.

[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/49QNtXnZQS/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igshid=4eut7xjdt3gj) - First Instagram video.


There are lots more clips like Jungyeon jumping around like a child seeing a fansite coming for a picture of her and all. These are hard to find since TWICE was not that popular and JYP was a sinking ship at the time. They also went to a lot of colleges and schools and cafes to popularize themselves, which I think is a common think in Korean culture. And all starting groups do it.

My point in making this is to familiarize new ONCEs with what TWICE for hardcore fans is, when they were just 9 girls who were accomplishing their dreams. You might know from their hits but not a lot of people knows when they were small.

My goal with this post is to make you love them more.

I'm not sure how true this is, but I also heard that this was supposed to be a title track but Cheer Up made the cut.

I could only imagine what Twice are now conceptwise if Touchdown was their breakout hit instead of Cheer Up.

Either way, this song deserves more recognition.",29,36

After SIXTEEN, late summer 2015, Twice had to quickly turn around and prepare for their debut, scheduled for that October. This era is covered in the very first [Twice TV](https://www.vlive.tv/video/878), in which all members are interviewed in pairs, while the last episode is the whole group sharing a meal with their companys founder, JYP himself.

Here, you can share Twice content and media from this era or just discuss this era in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* What do you like about Twice thats unique to this era?
* What was your favorite moment from this season of TWICE TV?
* How quickly do the girls get acclimated to no longer being a trainee? Does any member(s) handle this change exceptionally well?
* What changes in character do you notice from SIXTEEN to almost officially debuting? Which member has changed, in your opinion, most from then to now?

But 3 years ago, when JYP announced the name of the girl group ""Twice"", alot were skeptical, saying it doesnt make sense, and putting twice in search engines would just result with the word twice and not correlate with them at all.  Many said the name twice wouldnt fit the image of a girl group.

1310,2018-8-30,2018,8,30,7,9bdua8,Who was the first member you learned in Twice and why?,Gordra15,1535580847,"First member I learned to differentiate was Momo, both voice and style. Likey was the first song I heard by Twice, and for WEEKS I couldn't get her little verse out of my head. I mostly ignored them and just listened to the song, but as I got further into their track list I couldn't avoid it anymore. I watched a video that had text about the member's names and ""traits"" using the Likey MV, and Momo was the one I remembered the most because of her verse. So I chose to use her as a staple, and went through their videos pointing her out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next was Nayeon, Jihyo, and Jeongyeon because I feel like they're more noticably different looking than the rest of the girls. Chaeyoung and Dahyun were the last for me to recognize, voice wise, until just recently. Singing and rapping I feel like they both sound very similar in some songs, and it's now become ""muscle memory"" for me to remember who is who just based on the words. 

&amp;#x200B;

And for those curious; entirely aside from her being the first for me to recognize, Momo is my ultimate K-Pop bias. ",51,24

I asked about if JYPE had the ""Heart Shaker"" theme in mind when approaching him, but he said that JYP didn't have a specific direction initially. They simply asked for songs for Twice's next single (which, of course, became Heart Shaker). 

He and Sean, another co-writer, simply began to develop a lot of ideas that were ""cool and fitting for Twice."" David also said that he had quite a few themes in mind, but JYPE picked up Heart Shaker ""almost immediately"" after he had sent the tracks in.

Ultimately, they wrote the track in English and Galactika adapted it a bit later. 

I thought this was pretty interesting to see the initial process behind the track. Heart Shaker is easily top three for me!",49,158

5. Three Times a Day/Oooh Ahhh
    Honestly these 2 songs change my number 5 spots all the time. Just depends on the day and how I feel that day. Three Times a Day is such a chill song to cruise to. Also Sana and Momo parts are everything. Oooh Aaah is such a great song and I always have to sing along to the breakdown.

4. Signal
    Their best music video song (if that makes sense) imo. The chorus is extremely catchy and I just love the overall feel of the song. Very bright and happy. Jjirit Jjirit Jjirit Jjirit.

3. 1 to 10
   Just like Three Times a Day very chill song you can cruise to. Theres not really much more I can say about this song. Its just a good song to listen to.

2. Going Crazy
    The beat to this song is so good. I love every part of this song. The chorus of this song is amazing. The rap part doesnt feel out of place in this one either. I also love at the end when they echo Going Cray Going Cray

1. Turtle
   Fell in love with this song when I first heard it. Its such a cute song. I get all bubbly inside when I hear it. Ba ba ba ba da ba da yay! Also Jihyo part when she says Im in love with you melted my heart!
