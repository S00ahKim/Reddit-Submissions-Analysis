12,2017-4-1,2017,4,1,18,62rpzd,[IMPORTANT] An update on the state of the subreddit,This-Is-Tony,1491038608,"Hey Once!


It's been a few weeks now since we rolled out the changes and we've been mostly happy with how things are going. We have a couple more things we want to introduce to help further improve the sub. 


The threads have been going pretty well so it's been decided that we are going to organise a few more. JYP doesnt get enough love around here so from today all member threads are going to be replaced with JYP daily threads.


We also wanted to try improve the quality of posts a bit more so now all posts, images, and gifs must directly contain or relate to JYP. 


We'd love to hear your feedback on the new direction of the sub so please share all your JYP only related comments below.

I'm looking to pre-order their album for their next comeback but..

1) Where should I pre-order it/where do you guys usually do it? (which website is the best in terms of price and quality)

2) Does pre-order literally mean you order it before it's officially released or is it within a time frame after the album is released?

Sorry for asking dumb questions, thank you in advance!!",15,14

So today I was supposed to be meeting friends with my mum in some restaurant in a shopping centre with a train station next to it. Our meeting time was 4:20 and we arrived at the train station 4 O'clock. 
Since it was so early, we decided to walk round the shopping centre for a bit. I wasn't really interested in going in the shops since we had so little time so I was rushing round just seeing what stores they had. Five floors later I saw a HMV and I just had some feeling that I'd see TWICE albums somewhere so I went inside to have a look.
As soon I walked round a corner, I saw Lane 2 albums in a display with other random albums (some were even non-KPOP) which each had their own section. I thought it was quite cool since it was quite noticeable compared to all the other stuff in the store. Even though I already have both albums already, which I preordered, I thought ""why not?"" And grabbed both of them since they were only HK$129 (around 16-17 US dollars) each.
Walking to the checkout, I notice that there's a pre order photo card set with version A in the plastic wrapping but not in Version B and since I found the albums in a display, I thought I'd check to see if there was a KPOP section in the store. After a while, I saw a 'recommended' stand with both Lane 2 albums in again. I was really surprised since a Korean album was being recommended in a foreign country, especially TWICE :). I then looked at the plastic wrapper and there was still no pre order photo cards in version B.
The time was now 4:20 and I finally found the KPOP section and I see a section dedicated to TWICE with Lane 1 and Lane 2 albums. Once again, there was no photo card set for version B so I have up TT.
As I was walking to the till, I asked my mum if she could ask the cashier if he had any in the back since I can only understand Cantonese and not speak it. The cashier then went into the back and came out with another version A photo card set so I just accepted it and was about to leave until another lady who was also working at HMV came running towards the till.
She then asked if something was wrong and then she went back to look for a version B set for me but  returned unsuccessful. Then she realised that posters came with the albums and whipped out the two that come with Lane 2 and rolled them up for me. As she kept unnecessarily apologising to us, she said she'd get us another poster so we asked how much it would be and she said that we didn't need to pay :)
As she came back to us she unrolled a Lane 1 poster (I'm not sure what it was, maybe from the pink version) which I didn't have so I was really happy.
She then explained to us that she knew this much about TWICE albums because her son is a TWICE fan and he's 15 (the same age as me ^-^)
So from HK$258 (around US$33) I got two Lane 2 albums, two Version A photo card sets and 3 posters. I guess miracles do come true so I am a very happy ONCE now :)

Photos of my HMV adventure in Hong Kong (chronologically): https://imgur.com/gallery/qrqMi

TL;DR: I was about to leave the store with two lane 2 albums and a worker gave me an extra photo card set and 3 poster for free.

But in the the guide for the fan club sign up it talks about a fan club verification procedure. I looked around and saw people were making posts in the free talk area on twice fans that had their name and i assume the verification number from interpark.

P.S.: Just out of curiosity, and since I like Orange Caramel - maybe some of you love them too, who do you think in Twice would be Lizzy and Raina? I think Jihyo would be Raina because they both have great vocal range and Lizzy, I don't know, maybe Nayeon?",8,6

559,2017-4-20,2017,4,20,1,66b595,[SIXTEEN] My impressions on the show,doingforthebling,1492617927,"So far I've watched 5 episodes and I have some critics, maybe people will get offended, especially because it happened almost 2 years ago and none of what I say would matter now anyway, but still. If it has a positive feedback I can even post the rest 5 episodes.

Episode 1

**Tzuyu**: forgetable, the singing she did was bad only a few seconds in the whole episode (still she scored 7th place in who should be in MAJOR)

**Jihyo**: Sang pretty well, dance moves were enough for the body not me still

**Momo**: Danced pretty well, but was put in minor because lacked her touch (what about Jihyo?)

**Sana** and **Somi**: unique presentations

**Mina**: JYP I love Giselles argument for putting her in minor you did ballet, it was practiced it wasnt natural unfair

**Dahyun**: Eagle dance was enough for people recognise her as the best, she is able to capture everyones attention

**Jeongyeon**: bad choice for her sax, the singing was average

Episode 2

**MAJOR**: Picked a dark/vampire theme for their shooting, imo the only one that was really into the dark/vampire vibe was Chaeyoung the rest were laughing and smiling in a unfitting way (P.S.: the photographer said Jihyo looks fat and for the rest of the shooting she was embarrassed and trying to hide in other peoples shadows, which made the photographer complain with her even more); final photo doesnt look really dark/vampire, more like high fashion-noir, the only one with the dark spirit was Chaeyoung, but her pose was bad, maybe the photographer thought their high fashion style suited the theme better.

**minor**: Tzuyu and Jeongyeon look great in the photo tests; the final photo was compromised because of Minyoung and Chaeyeon, most of the photos had to be discarded because of them.

**Individuals**: Somi was brave to pick the fish and the pose was good (even though poor fish might have died after); Eunsuh had the best outfit, hair and make up, but she didnt pass confidence; Minyoung luckily recovered because she was able to nail a gaze that seemed from real models; Jeongyeon looks like a real model; Momo was said to look like a normal person

Episode 3

Tzuyu once again raised her online votes, from 7th to 4th 

**Individuals**: Natty looks like one of those kid models, not the best one, but still; Sana  probably here is where No Sana no life started  as one of the judges said, she looks like a Sailor Moon character; Mina in her photo captured the dark/vampire concept better than the group responsible for that

**Promotion**: MINA/chaeryeong: the latter looked like one of those stores mannequins; TZUYU/jihyo: group photo saved the former, calling jihyo chubby is wrong she just have a different body structure, especially when compared to TZUYU; JUNGYEON/dahyun: the former was great in both shots, but dahyun tried to be apart from the group shot (one a side note: she was really pissed when JUNGYEON said her name)

**Eliminated**: Chaeyeon wasnt able to pass the I am a Star mission, both of her photos were bad, even though she looked completely comfortable with her battle in the first mission.

Mission 3: 1vs1 battle

nayeon/TZUYU: nayeon clearly picked her because TZUYU didnt show vocal prowess in first mission, which would make it an easy fight for her; she picked an easy song she clearly underestimates TZUYU; TZUYU didnt pick a song that suits her style, she wasnt bad singing, but the lack of sync with the rhythm was her doom. **Winner**: NAYEON

jiwon/JUNGYEON: jiwon picked a light and happy song, but she didnt look neither light nor happy; JUNGYEON has shown the most menacing and controlling presentation so far with great performance. **Winner**: JUNGYEON

dahyun/chaeryoung/SANA: dahyun showed some average dancing skills, nothing captivating; chaeryoung had a performance that looked like it came out from a MV; SANA was 50/50 she had some great moves, others were quite lame, however San E pointed out something right, Sana can grab your attention with her eyes. **Winner**: DRAW (San E  dahyun; JYP  chaeryoung; Gain  SANA)/ Second voting: 2 judges picked CHAERYOUNG (JYP  sana)

minyoung/SOMI: SOMI had a little mistake, but despite that she seemed like a pro; minyoung had the bad luck to have her voice crack in the last seconds, also she spent more time with her eyes closed than opened, bad thing. **Winner**: revealed in next episode.

Episode 4

Tzuyu again raised her internet popularity now ranking 3rd

San E praised SOMIs rapping skills. **Winner**: SOMI

eunsuh/MINA: MINA showed some excellent moves; eunsuh forgot a part of her choreography even though she was doing great. **Winner**: MINA

jihyo/CHAEYOUNG: jihyo bitch slapped the photographer from last episode with her song choice and performance; CHAEYOUNG had a lively presentation. **Winner**: JIHYO

momo/NATTY: momo looked happy dancing, she was completely natural there; NATTY tried to put emotions in her choreography, but, as Jihyo said, I dont think she was that great. **Winner**: NATTY (first winner that I disagree, JYP reason for voting NATTY was because he questioned himself if he would ever see some girl dance like that again)

PS: Here we can notice already that the rest of the members dont really care for Natty, they recognise her as a talented kid, but it seems like they ignore her.

**Eliminated**: Eunsuh, JYP said even though she has talent it seems that she doesnt want to show it (IMO it wasnt a fair choice, I think the fact that she wasnt promoted before was crucial for her elimination, dahyun in this mission should be the one eliminated).

Episode 5

Tzuyu unstoppable now ranking 2nd 

Mission 4: major B (somi, natty and jihyo) vs. minor A (momo, chaeyoung and jiwon) &amp; major A (jungyeon, nayeon, mina and chaeryoung) vs minor B (tzuyu, sana, dahyun and minyoung)

Major A worked together fine, but minor B had a lot of troubles in the beginning and they went not only with a more difficult song, but they had a better choreography and added a rap. **Winner**: Minor B (203x189 audience voting)

Major Bs choreography was okay, theyve picked a song that most people will like, however even though Jihyo is a great singer the song didnt suit her; Minor As choreography was good, it lacked a menacing touch that Jungyeon would be able to fulfill, but overall better than Major B. **Winner**: Major B (202x182) (IMO wasnt a fair choice, but since it was the crowd that picked, and strangely 8 people didnt vote, I wont complain)",35,27

569,2017-4-20,2017,4,20,11,66euv1,[SIXTEEN] My impressions on the show (part 2/2),doingforthebling,1492654496,"Episode 6

Minor A Mina was great, Nayeon and Jungyeon okay, if Chaeryoung didnt do the telephone part she would have been unnoticeable, neither the song nor the choreography helped them; Minor B choreography was simple but suited the music perfectly, Jiwon at the end was clearly out of breath the song could have been better distributed between the members, also they should have picked a song with a rap part so Chaeyoung could increase heavily with her traits, also Momos dance solo was okay at best. **Winner**: Minor A (238x144)

**Eliminated**: Momo (Just by the first presentation would be really hard to pick one of the three, but on the second one JYP was probably between Chaeyoung and Momo, and since Momo never was promoted I think it weighted on her elimination, I personally think that Chae would be a better pick, but as we already know Momo was brought back, which make sense, I dont think that bringing back Chaeyoung would be as important as bringing Momo. IMO JYP already knew at least 5 members of Twice, he was sorry that she had to leave but she and probably Jihyo were the only ones that he could pick the the group needs them card and bring them back).

The rest of the episode was a moment to relax so they went somewhere to play games.

Episode 7 

More games at the beginning, then JYP had them participate in a voting where they would choose three members that deserved to be on MAJOR, not only for their dancing or singing skills, but for their humility, integrity and honesty. 3rd place was NAYEON with 9 points switching with dahyun; 6th place was CHAYEOUNG with 7 points switching with somi; 2nd place was JUNGYEON with 12 points switching with natty. Number one was, with 21 points, Jihyo.

Mission 5: 4 groiups must gather people to go to their concert, group with most votes win.

Major A (Jihyo, Sana, Chaeyoung, Minyoung), Major B (Nayeon, Jungyeon, Tzuyu), Minor A (dahyun, jiwon, chaeryoung), Minor B (Somi, Natty, Mina)

Episode 8

Finally Tzuyu reached 1st place on polls, besides her being pretty she doesnt show her potential so Im baffled to see that she reached first place just by being pretty.

One moment that has to be share is Tzuyu boldness, the major B trio goes to Nayeons school and there Nayeon and even Jungyeon act like heey boys~~~ and Tzuyu is like Im Tzuyu, I particularly thought it was funny.

Major A was going to promote their show so they took the tube to reach even more people, wise choice; Minor B went by car, more comfortable but no promotion when they arrived there was no one there, the second place they went they ran around doing their best to promote (bonus points because they promoted in Korean, Thai, Japanese and English); Minor A used Dahyun dance from the first mission to help promote their show.

Major B: Tzuyu is so afraid that shell be criticised because of her lack of singing skills that she doesnt try to put her voice out there, especially in the parts that she is the only one singing, I think that besides that it was a great performance; Minor B: what they lack in singing at least they compensated in choreography, Somi sang the rap part, I have conflicted feelings about it, even though not as good as Chaeyoung she could be the lead rapper; Major A: Sana at first was as afraid as Tzuyu from singing, but then she got a bit better, I dare to say it was the best performance in the show so far; Minor A: Even though afraid, Jiwon sang okay, I think that the lack of confidence in her own skills would be a major turn down for JYP, if Im not mistaken Dahyun picked the song and that was the only positive thing she did for the trio, Im not sure if this is reason enough to guarantee that she isnt the worst in the trio.

Brought the most audience: Major A with 194, almost the double than the others (Minor B: 111; Minor A: 105; Major B: 93), they keep as MAJOR

2nd voting after show: next episode

Episode 9

2nd voting: 1st place Major A with 177 votes; Minor B with 120 (goes to MAJOR); Major B with 106; Minor A 98.

PS: JYP again with the gain weight thing with Jihyo saying that it slows her down, man Korean standards must be hard to live by.

**Eliminated**: Jiwon (JYP said that the passion was felt the least from her, having bad and good moments is better than being unnoticed, and that was the impression that Dahyun gave me, since her fanbase dropped online I cant see a reason why to keep her)

Jihyo after being picked for the last mission: I thought youd be picking Mina for her Visual Jungyeon points at Tzuyu, like who needs her when we got this?

Mission 6: Each group will sing a song to put their skills to test, then another song that they will both sing and dance equally.

Major: Impressed with Minas confidence in singing and Sana, Chaeyoung was okay, but as always in the rap part her natural gifts bloom, I didnt feel Minyoungs potent voice as it should but it wasnt bad, Somi did okay and what was Natty doing there?

Minor: Chaeryoung didnt seem comfortable, Dahyun has questionable rap skills, even Tzuyu showed some improvements, Nayeon, Jungyeon and Jihyo were spot-on. Overall much better than Major.

PS: I was impressed that JYP picked the Minor Team as the best one, he usually is a bad picker. It didnt take long, he said that Sana and Mina werent the best in their group, Im not saying that they were, but their development was amazing.

Round 2: next episode

Episode 10

From their meeting in the minor hostel we can see that some people are closer together than others, Somi, Minyoung and Dahyun are far apart from the rest, weirdly enough Id expect Sana next to Mina, however since Sana and Natty shared their Major positions Ive noticed that Sana acted like she was protecting Natty, maybe thats why she sat next to her.

When entering the stage, however, we can see that Somi was holding hands with Chaeyoung (we later see in Twice TV, I guess, Somi and Chae talking about how Somi got into I.O.I.).

2nd round

Major:  Minyoung voice cracked when she was doing so well, prior to Chaeyoung rap Sana had a few verses as well I think she did pretty well, Natty, once again, what were you doing there? Sana, Mina, Chaeyoung and Somi they were stars that day.

Minor: I think that in this presentation is pretty clear why Dahyun isnt suited for being a rapper, she loses her breath quite easily and cant keep up with the rhymes. All the rest was great, and since JYP knew that Momo was coming back, that was the reason he didnt pick Chaeryoung.

(Please, I feel that I might sound a bit unfair towards Dahyun with my comments for some people, if you are able to see her good traits please let me know, because other than being able to relate with the fans I dont see anything great in her)

(JYP called Somi an amateur, when compared to her unnies, I think he was extremely harsh on her for no reason)

Audience votes: Nayeon, Jungyeon, Chaeyoung, Jihyo, Dahyun, Tzuyu, Mina

Online votes: Tzuyu, Nayeon, Jungyeon, Mina, Dahyun, Sana, Chaeyoung

**Winners**: NAYEON/natty; JUNGYEON/somi; DAHYUN/minyoung; JIHYO; CHAEYOUNG; SANA; MINA; TZUYU (by the public); MOMO (JYP)

At the end I kinda understand the reason why JYP picked Dahyun, but I dont think that she was essential in the group, if I were to pick objectively Id pick Somi, however, besides Chaeyoung, it doesnt seem that she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the group, Dahyun didnt pass this impression as well, but for marketing and fan meeting probably Dahyun would be a differential. So, yeah, I understand in the economic pov why he would pick her.

The Momo controversy is kinda stupid, she was needed in the group, the best dancer, Chaeryoung wouldnt be picked because even though she developed her confidence she still doesnt trust herself completely, unlike Momo, she overestimates herself, just check the first interview are you afraid of someone here? No. When it comes to dancing I am the best, maybe thats why she was eliminated, she wasnt humble, now that I think, maybe thats why JYP picked her, 2 months thinking about humility is better than nothing.

Tzuyus controversy, hmmm, if only she had the same charisma that Dahyun has she would be the ultimate visual idol and JYP would pick her right in the place, but she lacks that charisma, but people still love her because she is pretty, JYP would be stupid to give up on her.

Thanks for reading, lets keep cheering our girls!",19,24
570,2017-4-20,2017,4,20,12,66f4t5,Why people on this sub hate Natty?,manbeer0071995,1492657723,"I became a fan of Twice after 16 and did not watch the show. but as a Thai, see someone comment that Natty beat Momo in 1V1 because of her age and just JYP like Natty more really upset me.
I may don't know much about dancing but I'm pretty sure if JYP like Natty and choose her to be the winner in the 1V1 VS Momo, is it because he saw something in Natty and not just because of her age. if you want to trust someone in training the trainee to become an idol, it's JYP.
and in the end, he still chooses MoMo to debut as a member of Twice. because he knew MoMo will fit well in Twice. that's how good JYP is, you guys should trust him for what he did.


P.S. I love all the Twice members and Natty and Somi and the others too, they are all friend when they were trainees.

P.S. 2 I hope you guys understand what I'm trying to explain. I'm sorry if I'm misspelled English is not my first language.",23,0

Edit: wow. Did not expect this many people to enter. I'll have fun reading your random comments 

Edit2: Turns out I have to start my day early tomorrow so I'm going to have to end the entries now (9:20pm PST). I will generate a random number then manually scroll through all the entries to see who is the closest (should have thought of a better method earlier but oh wells).

I discovered Twice in early February, and it came after some things in my personal life had kind of hit the fan and I was struggling emotionally. Some time passed and things look to be on the up thankfully. In the meantime, I discovered Twice and learned who they were and I fell in love instantly. In this same time, I've become somewhat of a happier person and I have to say how much I love each one of these girls. It sounds so stupid to say, taking in the fact that they don't know of my existence- but their music, their personalities, their antics with one another, and them being themselves make me feel positive about things. The funny thing is, is that I was actually a K-pop fan once before, which I explain [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/5s6992/how_was_your_week_onces/dde4tkg/) in my very first comment here. Which I should also mention, I love this community because it's become like family to me and I look forward to coming on here every day seeing what's new. It's become one of the places I check each morning before I head out to class and it's been a great time interacting with other ONCE and talking about the group we all love.

Back to Twice though... no group has drawn me in and made me a fan as easily and quickly as Twice. Each member brings something to the group that would be missing if they weren't there. From my bias Momo, to the clumsy but adorable/sexy Sana, to leader-nim Jihyo. Black swan Mina, Tofu Tofu Dahyun, and the 'No-Jam' bros of Chaeng and Jungyeon. And not to forget fake maknae Nayeon and real maknae Tzuyu. They all have a special place in my heart and I don't foresee a time in the near future of that changing. &lt;3

This may be a big long mess of words but I hope I explained what Twice means to me. How about you? :)",30,40

It seems that you have to add your name and JYP fans username to confirm your reservation.

Go to http://ticket.interpark.com/Global/Cancel/TPBookedList.asp

Click on the ONCE 1st Generation Fan Club then scroll down to the bottom and on the ""Seat no."" table there's a button called ""Enter/Modify Your Details"" 

Click that and this window should pop up: http://i.imgur.com/uFjfrlU.png

VIP Ticketholder Benefit Winners and a full list of merchandise have just been put up on One Production's Facebook page and can be accessed [here](https://www.facebook.com/pg/OneProductionSingapore/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1017452621688554)

**IMPORTANT THINGS:**

1. Merchandise booth opens at 1pm

2. Group Photo-taking will be held on 28th April **FRIDAY**. Registration will be held from 5 to 6.45pm, photo ops commence at 7pm. Remember to bring your ticket for verification.

3. Autograph posters will be distributed to winners on the concert day itself. Poster collection will be held from 4-6.30pm. Remember to bring a poster tube of some sort to store your poster or it'll be hell trying to keep it from harm during the concert.

4. Bring/buy a bottle of water. I'm not sure how strict the venue is on this (it's listed that outside food and drinks aren't allowed, but many venues close an eye to bottled water). I'd bring store-bought mineral water in case they decide to confiscate it, and also to show that the bottle doesn't contain shady substances.",68,57

735,2017-4-25,2017,4,25,2,67ajoc,[Instructions] How to get *some TWICE songs in Spotify.,chrismsenpai,1493054978," This post is for people who want TWICE songs on their spotify playlists or whatever so please no hate. Also if you just download TWICE songs through youtube converter, or some other methods, that's cool too. I am aware of easier ways of doing this, but this is just a cool little way for the people who use spotify.


 *As said in the title, not all TWICE songs are available with this method, just the mv's and Lane 2.


Works for both Apple and Android


 **TL;DR**: Through a third party app (TunnelBear) and changing your VPN to Japan and then changing your spotify location to Japan and then finally, searching up TWICE and adding them to your spotify playlist.


Instructions: 


1.) Download TunnelBear (says on the app that it's free); sign up, confirm in your email


2.) Open TunnelBear, activate it, then change your VPN to Japan (haven't tried it out with different countries so if one country has all the songs, post it in the comments and let others know)


3.) This next step may require you to have the english version of spotify web open for reference since it will change your language to Japanese. Go to spotify WEB, log in, and change your location to Japan (Japan should be the second option), then save


4.) Open spotify app and log out and in and search up TWICE and then voila. *Some TWICE songs for you to add to your kpop playlist.


5.) You can then deactivate tunnelbear but do not revert back your location in spotify as it will remove the TWICE songs, but you can change your VPN back to where you live.


Disclaimer: Some worries I have with this method is that somehow, someway this might increase your phone bill but there's a 1% chance of that happening. It probably doesn't but I'm a very worrisome fellow. If anyone needs a video instruction, let me know, I'll hook you up myself.",15,23

I've just received my lightstick well over a week ago but I can't seem to get it to connect to my phone. More specifically my lightstick won't connect to the app itself(I can go to bluetooth settings and find 'TWICE LIGHT STICK' and it flashes blue when i attempt to connect it there), and will always give me the error message no matter how many times i try to connect it. 


I've dug around and the closest fix i can find is a comment by u/choayeon in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/5gr98z/candy_bong_is_rejecting_pairing_by_bluetooth_need/), but it still didn't work :( Please help me out, i am currently considering whether i should buy a new candy bong entirely",4,16

Please help,Jynch,1493481209,"Hey guys, I know I am already too late in registering for a slot in the official fanclub but can any veterans (people who joined Korean fanclubs/Kpop veterans) tell me if Kpop groups usually reopen their registration often or rarely?  

I really really wanted to apply for a slot but due to some circumstances in life I didn't come up with the money quick enough to secure a slot and I am so disheartened that I missed out.  

After TWICE's concert held in Singapore today, I felt so much more horrible for missing out because today I really fell in love with the whole group.  

Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated!",5,16

Then later on he was talking about how he went to Malaysia then Hong Kong (I think? could be the other way around) then I knew this dude was from reddit because I remember seeing a post like that from this sub.

I asked if he knew reddit and turns out he did. So if you're that dude and sees this post, sup man! Twiceland was totally worth every penny even though the merchandise was sold out and the only thing they had was the candy bong.

Also found out we were both Dahyun biases so I kinda died inside when she waved and stared at us. (She probably saw the cam as I was recording lol)",15,48

TWICELAND WAS FREAKING AMAZING! After two long months of waiting, we've finally got to see our queens live in action. And while it was most certainly an amazing concert, it was still lacking. Lacking in that Jihyo was unable to dance due to her injury. I've always known that Dahyun was funny, but she proved herself once again last night by imitating the translator that was translating her speech. Needless to say, her expression was on point. The girl is God sent, I swear. This concert also solidified my bias as OT9 asdfghjkl! 


My fellow SG Onces who attended the concert as well, please do share your experiences / your favorite part of the concert / what killed you / etc, not just so we can fangirl / fanboy over it but to share it with the Onces who couldn't get to watch them. I figured it would be nice for them to at least read about it!
