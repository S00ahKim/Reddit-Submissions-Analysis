50,2017-11-2,2017,11,2,0,7a46lk,Twice - heart shaker speculation thread,MajorIvan88,1509549102,"Since there wasn't one I thought I would make a thread.
After the end of likey MV, there is, as we all know a small snippet of an unfamiliar instrumental playing. And throughout the video, there are references to ""heart shaker"". So speculation time: Is that the next comeback single? 
It's just like in MV for TT, where we got the hear the intro to Knock Knock. TT's Video came out on the 20th of October 2016 while Knock Knock's Video came out on the 15th of February 2017 so about 4 months later.
The Japanese ~~TT MV~~ *got a reference to One More Time. That one came out on the 20th of June 2017 while One More Time Video came out on 5th of October 2017 so again 4 months apart.

So if we follow this specific pattern, it's likely that the next comeback single will be in March.

I know that what I'm saying is maybe nothing new, and Korean Onces have this probably all figured out.
But what are you guys thought on it?

BTW Like Ohh Ahhh to Cheer up was 6 months apart and had no tease. Same with cheer up to TT which was also 6 months apart with no tease, the only ""tease"" was for Touchdown.

*It wasn't in the actual JP MV but in this [TWICE#TWICESPOT MOVIE](https://youtu.be/bEzD_uSVG7k?t=51s).

289,2017-11-6,2017,11,6,2,7aytaw,Hi everyone! I'm new to this sub and I was wondering what are some good variety shows or other programs that include Twice (with eng subs) that I can watch?,Doctor-Swoosh,1509902110,"Little background, I was really big into kpop around 2009 or 2010. Almost entirely SNSD and Super Junior. Owned every SNSD album up to TTS, watched every variety show that I could, just generally a big fan of both them and kpop. 

Life started picking up during 2012 and I was only able to keep up with big releases by SNSD and SuJu every few months when I'd get curious, but I didn't have as much time to spend watching hours of variety shows between school, work, and my SOs over the years. However, I've been finding time lately and the huge kpop fan in me is finding its way back out!

I started looking into new groups that didn't exist before. I found groups like AOA, IOI, and Red Velvet whose songs I really enjoyed. Then I stumbled upon Twice and the next thing I knew these 9 girls had made me as big a fan of kpop as I was in 2009! 

I've listened to their music a lot, and now I'm finding myself wanting for more content, and what better way to satisfy that than watching some variety shows? I know I could spend a few minutes on google and find something to watch but I'd rather ask the fans themselves what their favorite programs including Twice are!

Thank you for the help in advance, and I'm very happy to be joining another kpop community after so many years!",23,34

I absolutely adore Twice and their members, but there's something about Tzuyu that doesn't sit right with me. She's VERY reserved and her smiles look a bit forced sometimes. And besides her smile, she really doesn't bring much to the table expression wise. I just watched their debut MV and there it felt like she had so much more character and was actually enjoying herself, she was making funny faces and looked very happy. Then I was wondering if it might have something to so with the scandal? I don't follow Twice that closely to know, so I'm asking you ONCE's: did you notice her acting different after the scandal? Is it when she became so reserved or has she always been like that? And I'm fully aware that she's still very young and maybe just needs time to warm up more to the spotlight.

There are re-sellers on eBay and whatnot that have opened albums and rearranged it so that you can buy a member specific album (i.e. get all three photocards of one member, get the album that has the member's name on it, of course with two other members, etc.) but these are obviously opened albums. Wasn't sure if it was better to ""play the game"" and buy a random version for more fun or buy an opened pack, for a bit more money (~$10 more or so), to get a member specific one of your bias. What did you guys do, how did you decide which version to get?

Also inb4 people come in saying they bought all the versions, too poor for that :'( I've unfortunately spent too much money buying SNSD stuff a few years back and figured I shouldn't go down that same road with Twice....so it's either a random album, or maybe getting a Sana on on eBay :P But they're obviously opened so it's like well having the album sealed and closed would be nice, and if I never open it I can always pretend I got the Sana album haha",5,14

1. Momo is an amazing dancer and she's probably my 3rd favorite dancer but she is a really weak singer. 

2. I don't enjoy the references to their songs when they're on trips sometimes. You can have it as background music but like carefree travelers episode 46, the random boat dance that happened with their songs playing was really weird. I wished they could just relax as good friends rather than hear the song they've probably heard thousands of times. 

3. Signal was terrible. It's my opinion so try not to rage at me for it, but as great as the promotion period for signal was, that song is probably near the bottom for me in terms of all their songs including b-sides. 

4. Jihyo would be an awesome lead vocalist. I feel like as a main vocalist, it doesn't suit her as I feel like her vocals are more suited into supporting. Collabs with other artists show this, she's a great singer but I feel like she'd shine more as a lead vocalist. 

Edit: Try not to downvote responses guys, let's be civil. They're all just opinions, try to have a conversation if you disagree. ",189,40

Sana: Cheer Up (blonde Sana rules)

473,2017-11-9,2017,11,9,6,7borja,What would Twice's spirit animals or Patronus Charms be?,Im_Currently_High,1510178378,"Lets have some fun /r/Twice and decide our girls' spirit animals! This should be based mostly on their personality, but looks can effect it as well. Think about it like a [Patronus](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Patronus_Charm) from Harry Potter!

Here are my choices:

- Sana = [Shiba](https://myfirstshiba.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AdobeStock_138130286_smaller.jpg): This is the most obvious and I feel like there is no point even debating it. Not only does she look like a Shiba, but she [acts like one too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99odjBcyIMk) If you want, ill let you argue that Sanaconda is a malicious snake when she enters her [flirtatious attack mode](https://gfycat.com/YearlyVeneratedAmericanindianhorse), but other than that, shes our little Shiba for sure.

- Mina = [Penguin](http://images2.onionstatic.com/clickhole/2076/original/600.jpg): This is pretty widely accepted as well. Like a penguin, mina is adorble but a tad awkward at times (mostly because shes shy). But she even [dances](https://i.imgur.com/ge5JwlD.gifv) like a penguin.

- Dahyun = [Otter](http://weknowyourdreams.com/images/otter/otter-03.jpg): Unfortunately tofu isnt a sentient animal... So I had to come up with something else. I think Otter works for Dahyun though. Like Otters, Dahyun is very silly and playful. I also see a bit of a physical resemblance since they both have those adorable chubby cheeks. 

- Nayeon = [Bunny](http://www.cuded.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/28-Bunny-Picture.jpg): So I struggled with this one a bit, although its also pretty widely accepted. Obviously Nayeon looks exactly like a bunny, so it works in that aspect, but does she act like one? Only kind of... I feel like rabbits can be a bit shy, which is why I think we may want to decide on another animal for her. Perhaps a more outgoing rodent, like a [ferret](https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/PETCO/153044-left-1)! But she definitely doesn't look like a ferret... Maybe a [Sugar Glider](https://fthmb.tqn.com/VunRS5qePdGxESV2LDiG9Ow3SNM=/2121x1414/filters:no_upscale\(\):fill\(transparent,1\)/Sugar-glider-GettyImages-514744702-58cade423df78c3c4fdf6cbc.jpg) or even a [squirrel](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/04/25/istock-115796521_wide-2f8afeb04be5bf8290f13dd1a5a9e107f63ee2fd.jpg?s=1400)? Idk... I'll let you guys decide.

- Momo = [Capuchin Monkey](https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/sites/default/files/styles/750w_585h/public/2016-09/capuchin-monkey-baby.jpg?itok=z83njSkD): Like a Capuchin, Momo has a lot of energy and is constantly moving or dancing around. She also kinda [screams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8hXF35ixxY) like one too. Finally Momo has a sort of flatter face that is similar to that of a Capuchin, so I see some physical similarities as well. 

- Chaeyoung = [Lion](http://www.africa-wildlife-detective.com/images/lion-cub-800a.jpg): This is yet another commonly referenced one since Chae looks like a lion cub. However I think it matches her personality just fine. Lions are strong beautiful animals. Chaeyoung may not be a big and mighty gal, but she certainly has a strong personality. However Lions can also be playful and fun under the right circumstance, just like our ChaeBae. 

- Jeongyeon = [Ocelot](http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/2016-09/animals_hero_ocelot.jpg): ""Why an Ocelot?"" is what you may ask. Why? WHY?! Because Ocelots are classy as fuck. And Jeongyeon exudes class. On top of this, Jeongyeon is rather quiet and tends to keep to herself. Similarly, the Ocelot is a solitary animal.  

- Tzuyu = [Fox](http://onebigphoto.com/uploads/2013/12/red-fox-in-snow.jpg): Foxes are majestic and quite often considered ""tricksters"". What would be better for our radiant and [evil maknae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVpGZSpchCc) Tzuyu. Similarly to Jeongyeon, Tzuyu can be rather shy at times as well. Like Jeongyeon's Ocelot, a fox is also a solitary animal that lives a life on its own.  

- Jihyo = [Koala](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Koala_climbing_tree.jpg): Twice's Leader needs a spirit animal that reflects her maternal and loving personality. Koala's are marsupials, which means that they carry their young in a pouch. Jihyo is always loving her other members and protecting them, just like a mother Koala would do. I also see somewhat of a physical resemblance between the two... Although I cant necessarily put my finger on why...

Anyway, those are my choices! Let me know if you agree or disagree! What animals would you give our girls?

No strict criteria but must have 13 songs to match the amount in Twicetagram and you must choose which song you would like to be the title track. 

My choices include:

- TT (Title. The song that got me into the group, plus it was an amazing MV and concept)

- Ice Cream/Melting (Nayeon )

- Candy Boy

- Headphone (Jihyos part near the end, gave me chills when I first heard it)

- Look at Me (Every Chae part)

- Jelly Jelly

- Likey

- One in a Million (The lyrics. I find them really meaningful and uplifting, especially when going through a rough time)

- Eye Eye Eyes (First time members contributed to a song, really catchy)

- Missing U

- 24/7

- Love Line

- Someone like Me (One of my favorite b-sides of all time. Really laid back and imo an excellent song to end an album)

I found it exceptionally difficult to choose which songs because there are so many I love, especially those in Twicetagram. That said I tried not to pick all their title tracks because other songs deserve to shine as well. Hope you guys appreciate my selection! 

Edit: thanks to everybody who responded, loved reading what songs you thought would make the ultimate Twice album. ",6,18

I just wanted to speak my mind about their latest album. It seems like the name of the game is ""random"". Everything is random, the photobook, photocards, stickers, CD...

Really don't like the idea of buying multiple albums just to have a chance to get a full set. It's basically gambling, like loot boxes, but at the end if you're stuck with dupes it's hard to get rid of them.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely like Twice, I would be more than happy to pay a premium for something like a ""complete"" edition that includes everything, but as it stands it seems that JYP will be doing more ""Random"" stuff for future Twice albums.",3,13

597,2017-11-11,2017,11,11,14,7c6s6i,I finished watching Sixteen today. Here are some of my thoughts on it.,zechrom,1510379706,"I'm a fairly new Twice fan. I started getting interested in Twice during the ""One More Time"" Promotions. Going into Sixteen, I didn't know what to expect; I knew of Twice's final lineup, but I didn't realize how much Sixteen would change my view on the members.

I haven't really watched survival shows outside of a few clips of Produce 101 Season 2, so watching a show like this was interesting.


I'm proud of the members for getting into Twice to begin with. There were some times that I thought Sixteen was brutal. I cried like a baby when Momo got eliminated. It was really heartwrenching, especially when Sana and Mina were crushed about the idea of the three of them not being able to debut together.


On a happier note, I'd like to say that Chaeyoung was the member that really stood out to me during Sixteen. She was the member that consistently impressed me. There were many times when I went, ""Wow, Chaeyoung's really good!"" When I started watching Twice videos, I just knew Chaeyoung as one of the rappers, and that was it. However, now I think Chaeyoung is one of my favourites. Seriously, she's amazing.


On the flip side, I was really shocked about Dahyun during Sixteen. I really liked Dahyun to begin with, but I felt as Sixteen went on, Dahyun's performances became a little lackluster. She seems to excel more on a variety aspect (if that makes sense? I don't really know how to explain it).That said, Dahyun still remains my bias wrecker in Twice, because to me, she has a lot of charisma and charm. I'm really glad to have seen her progression in rapping and dancing.


Overall,  while I don't think that watching Sixteen is essential to the ""Twice"" experience, it certainly made me learn about and appreciate the members a whole lot more. I just wish that my heart didn't hurt so much while watching.

Hello again ONCE! Welcome to the first round of the *Twicetagram* Survivor series! 
For those of you who are new to Survivor  each day, well be voting off a song to be eliminated from the game until were left with just one song, which will be considered the winner!

[The last survivor ended with Signal beating Someone Like Me to be the winning song on the Signal album!](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/6i7yl9/twice_survivor_signal_winner_and_wrapup/)

Twice's first full studio *Twicetagram* has been out for just over a week so it might be a little early to start but I've been getting impatient. Because its a full album and has more songs than usual this survivor should last a few days longer than usual.

I've seen a trend in the last few survivors I've done that the numbers are dropping, I'm not sure if this is because people have lost interest or if it was just a coincidence. Because of this it would really mean a lot if everyone could give this first post an upvote so that as many people as possible can get involved this time (because if people miss the first one they might not want to take part in the other rounds).

One slight change this time around is the time of posting, because I have a new part time job that requires me to work late nights on the weekend I'll be posting slightly earlier on in the day, which shouldn't be a problem as long as the post initially gets some attention.

Without further ado, let us begin!

**RULES:**

* Threads will be posted between 1-5 GMT, give or take. 

* Voting will last approximately 24 hours per poll.

* You are voting for a track to be ***eliminated***. Do not vote for your favorite.

Momo - Like Ooh Ahh: Dance break, bulls, flexible as hell. 

Sana - Cheer up: Anime Sana is best Sana. 

Jihyo - TT/Likey: Honestly, her in a white dress staring at the camera made me realize how beautiful she really is. Leader nim is gorgeous. And...well I don't really need to explain this for likey right?

Jeongyeon: - Likey: My favorite hair of hers. THE VISUALS!!

Nayeon: Likey: That beginning part with her on a bike was amazing visually and vocally. 

Chaeyoung: TT/Knock Knock: Mermaid Chae! But closet chae was cute as hell.

Dahyun: TT/Likey: Visually, Bunny Dubu was really funny. Vocally, her rap part in likey was one of the best parts in the whole song. 

Mina: TT/Knock Knock: I've never seen a more beautiful pirate in my life. But at the same time, ""hey...hey"" really got to me. 

Tzuyu: Like Ooh Ahh: Literally, speechless for how gorgeous she is.

If you're interested in learning Korean from beginners level to advanced, leave a comment here (or dm me on twitter @shipmyselfki9 ).
I don't know much about these kind of stuff but someone suggested making a chat group in Line or similar apps, if anyone knows how to handle these stuff and you plan on being active in it then please tell me so(^w^).

(Thought Twice about it, and I'll be sharing the link to whoever needs it by private message here or dm on twitter, for the sake of safety).

Also, note that if the chatting group is made, it will be for helping each other out with whatever questions/doubts they have related to Korea and Twice only.

Sorry that this is a day late, I had a small family emergency come up yesterday and didn't get a chance to post!

In [Round Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/7cpc34/twice_survivor_twicetagram_round_three/) eliminated song was **Rollin** with 27.2% of the votes. There was only a single vote between Rollin and the second most voted song. I know a lot of ONCE are split about it - some love it and some hate it - so some will be sad to see it leave so soon.

However, Twicetagram is full of bops and some arguably title track material. In your opinion, if Likey wasnt included in Twicetagram at all, what would be the best title track for the album? Of course choices are songs from Twicetagram only.

Personally, I think Rollin has great title track potential. It definitely is a bop (at least for me) and point moves can definitely be integrated in this song. Its different from TWICEs sound though so I dont know if others would agree with me.

Edit: On re-listen, I actually think FFW would do good too.

Looking forward to everyones answers.",17,16

But every Idol or most of them get whitewashed into a very unnatural looking colour except for Dahyun. Even though Tzuyu is tan she appears as very pale in music videos / photoshoots. And during their V Lives they use whitening bright filters. I don't blame the girls for it they are still Idols afterall. I think it is just funny how they want to be pale like Western people but Western people love getting tanned. What is your opinion about it ? I love dahyuns and tzuyu natural skin color because beauty does not depend on ones skin color,25,2

We created a LINE GROUP CHAT with the goal of helping fellow ONCEs to start learning (or improve preexisting) Korean. Upon noticing there was a increase in number of ONCEs aspiring to learn, we figured making this group chat would be helpful, and thats how the idea for TWICELANDs capital, ONCELAND, was born.

Requirements:

-Be a ONCE. (ONCELAND is for ONCEs only). 

-Be active. (You dont have to be on 24/7, but participate daily if you can. With learning Korean as your goal, being dedicated to and having the desire to learn is a must).

 -Understand English. (all material will be posted in English/Korean, so knowing a decent amount of English is strongly recommended).

Rules:

-Dont post off-topic content (Only TWICE and Korean Language content is allowed).

-Dont be rude, and respect everyone. (We dont want this environment to be a hostile one. Be respectful towards everyone no matter their age, gender or level of Korean. Learning is not a competition here, so dont try to show off or degrade other members either. Since we are here to help each other, not to compare to each other.) *Disrespect on grounds of gender, age, or level of Korean will not be tolerated.

If the idea of this group seems at all appealing to you, you can certainly reach out to either me or /u/qwertsqwert if you have any questions.

How to join?
Send a message here or in Line (our Id's are the same here and in LINE) answering these questions and adding whatever you want to it:

-What is your goal after joining the group?

-What is the reason you're joining the group?

-Do you have time or are you really interested in learning Korean?

-Are you an ONCE? 

TL;DR - Theres a LINE group chat called ONCELAND that we made, with about 40 members thus far, focused on learning and improving your Korean knowledge, run by SubMiChaeng and /u/qwertsqwert, created specially for ONCEs. Read the rules first. If youre interested in joining us, feel free to PM SubMiChaeng or /u/qwertsqwert for invitation.

1138,2017-11-22,2017,11,22,19,7eq285,My thoughts on the Likey era,zetsupetsu,1511347341,"With JYP announcing that their Inkigayo apperance this week will be their last performance and goodbye stage, I like to express my thoughts:


**The good:**

Likey as a song is one of my favorite Twice title tracks, and Twicetagram album has full of great quality music. The MV was gorgeous, the girls during live stages looked absolutely beautiful. This is probably their best era visual wise since all of them looked great this time.


**The bad:**

I am extremely disappointed with the way JYP handled the promotions. They should get a new PR/Marketing team with how unsatisfying the promotions were. First off, this is the girls' first full album. It's supposed to be a big deal. But JYP is treating it like just another comeback. There wasn't enough time to generate hype among the general public because they only started releasing teasers a week before actual release. And the decision to release it at 6pm instead of the usual 12am might've affected their initial charting as well, it's not their fault, but releasing an upbeat and happy song right after an important person's death is really unfortunate timing. Korea just wasn't in the mood for happy songs that day. As for album promotions, why do they not have a B-side song performance? This is their first full album ffs. Not just an EP or mini. There were a lot of songs that would have been interesting to see live but not even one song was promoted. And then we have the album itself. Who came up with this album design? A plain colored cover without any photo of the group in the cover. And then we have photobook with not 9 members but only 3? I wouldn't mind having the covers individual or photocards individual, but to the extent of limiting even the booklets to three members so you are forced to buy more albums to get ot9 is too extreme.


**TLDR:**

Loved the song, loved the MV, loved the b-sides.
Hated the marketing and promotions, hated the album cover.",9,23

Before I reveal the results I'd like to thank everyone for taking part, it has been a really fun survivor (especially thanks to the late triple-elimination. Also thanks to the few people that left comments in the surveys thanking me for making these - it's nice to know other people enjoy them.

The Muses and their fields are listed below.  Source for this is: https://owlcation.com/humanities/The-Muses-The-Nine-Muses-Goddesses-of-Greek-Mythology

Calliope - Muse of Epic Poetry

Clio - Muse of History

Erato - Muse of Lyric Poetry

Euterpe - Muse of Music

Melpomene - Muse of Tragedy

Polyhymnia - Muse of Sacred Poetry, Sacred Hymn, and Eloquence

Terpsichore - Muse of Dance and the Dramatic Chorus

Thalia - Muse of Comedy and Idyllic Poetry

Urania - Muse of Astronomy and Astronomical Writings

Now, there may be some Muses who might not necessarily fit very well with any of the Twice members, such as Urania and Clio, but for the others there's most likely a good fit for each.  What do you guys think?",7,32

1434,2017-11-30,2017,11,30,16,7gkleg,"So who else here have been ""holding the fort""?",zetsupetsu,1512026130,"I can't believe the amount of hate our girls are getting. I've been all over SNS defending the girls with everything I got.

Twitter is the most toxic by far. And I hate how they also began to flood Twice's intagram with hate comments. Some of us onces had to step up and counter it with good, positive comments. We all know the girls handle their own instagram acount so I hope they don't let the hate comments get to them when they read it.

What baffles me is that they are claiming that they got ""robbed"" of SOTY and their faves deserve the award. All because they won the votes. Like do they even realize that Korea doesn't revolve just around kpop? Signal is significantly more popular than any of their faves songs. SOTY is about what has appealed to the masses. Korea as a whole. Not the kpop fandom. Signal may be hated among the kpop fandom, but if they get out of ther bubble, they'll realize how much of an impact it actually had in the public. Everyone and their dogs were dancing to it. Everyone knows the point choreography of the dance. Everyone is doing the jirit jirit. It appeals to the children, the parents, students and even old folks. Questioning Signal's legitimacy because of its low votes is like questioning Cheer Up's legitimacy as well. Cheer Up in voting last year was also really really low, like 15th place, that's lower than Signal. But nobody questioned it because its impact in Korea was undeniable. The same case could be said to Signal here. I'm pretty sure even their faves has danced to Signal at one point.


We Onces are alone as a fandom. Boy group stans hates us. Girl group stans are jealous of us. But I think this is like any other day tbh. Twice has always been hated on but we onces stood by their side. 

I will never go tired of defending these girls.",25,52

Like some people have told me that this initial craze is normal, but Ive never felt this way for anyone/group that I didnt personally know.
