I am a relative newcomer, but from what I read Jihyo wrote it while seriously allowing herself to shine in this song. When Dahyun goes Hey Boy.. Listen.. I Want.. Your Love.. You Know then Jihyo comes in and the beat comes back after her Oh Baby  . It just gives you a feeling. 

Seriously just makes you want to brush off any issues you have and get it going. My god I just have it on repeat. This could have been a title track. Am just on a Twice high or do you all agree?

Ive recently been jamming to La La La when Nayeon says  with emphasis on the L and then Tzuyu next verse says it like mai-go its amazing. I guess I just enjoy the little things. 

Nice to have differences in the inflections and personalities they show on b-side. As if its more free to experiment than the COMEBACK TITLE TRACK that many only focus on and JYP would be more strict on (I feel - maybe wrong). With some of those non-title songs I feel like the girls shine potentially even more.

There are several - I would without a doubt say - could be title tracks. All while written mostly by Twice members. Really special people here. Very fun to watch.

66,2019-3-4,2019,3,4,2,aww7b9,How much do you relate to your bias? What similarities (or differences) drew you to them the most?,Drocar75,1551634296,"I've been noticing alot in my biases in groups that, they don't necessarily act like each other or even act like me, but I'm still drawn to them the most. It's a mix of them being both really similar and really different from me. It's someone I can relate to, but I'm still able to be surprised by some of their actions or words or just enjoy their goofiness. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example: Momo and I share lots of qualities, like enjoying food and getting too touchy with our friends, and overall being the one that gets teased the most. I feel like we're both much more mature than we lead people to believe, but don't try and force that out (though I suppose this sentence is a bit of me forcing it out, isn't it?)

However; Momo also can dance like crazy (I have the coordination of an upside-down cow), she's a bit shy at times, but is overall pretty confident with herself and her abilities (I am very self-deprecating). She can be a bit naive or lack common sense, but does it adorably and with a strange amount of understanding (understanding that she is not doing it right) and it almost ends as a joke (while less often than her, whenever I have one of these moments I just end up getting super embarrassed and awkwardly dissolving the situation, which makes things worse).

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus question: Who do you think you would **legitimately** get along with best in the group? Even though I love Momo and her being my friend would be incredible and fantastic, I feel like I would get along with Jihyo or Mina much better. ",31,30

I personally love the ""twice concept"", it's a genre of their own :p. But a change isn't bad now imho because I have seen my friends getting bored of their same routine ( i know, my friends are shit).

I wanted to let you all know that I am planning on starting a podcast that is centered around two of my ULT groups: BTS and Twice. It's going to be called The Army/Once Podcast. I plan to release weekly just talking about what happens with both groups (Upcoming comebacks, new releases, news etc). Also some episodes I will be talking about new comeback for other groups as well (TxT/Itzy, other groups as well).

&amp;#x200B;

Fair warning, I and just a recent Once (last August) and recent KPOP fan as well (2 years), So I don't have EXTENSIVE knowledge of certain things, BUT I am hoping that through this Podcast I can learn much more about KPOP and the culture around it. And honestly, that is the reason I am starting this. Not only so I can talk about my fav KPOP groups with fans, but also to learn more myself!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to beg you all to listen, it's truly up to you guys! I hope that when it does get released you all listen! And give me feedback haha!

&amp;#x200B;

I would also love to start having people on to talk to as well. So when i get things rolling, if you'd like to be involved as a guest, please let me know! :)

97,2019-3-5,2019,3,5,12,axgc85,TWICE Fun Facts,Drocar75,1551755756,"Exactly as the title says; just fun little facts about TWICE. This can be something they said in an interview, or just something you've noticed about their mannerisms. At least in my area, ""fun facts"" are stuff that are kind of unknown and irrelevant but interesting to find out. Also, this might be fun for some of the newer ONCEs to learn a bit about their favorites. Feel free to add anything in the comments. I'll start off by putting three for each member. 

\***Note: Some of these might be a bit old and thus outdated/members have changed. I'm picking these up primarily through threads and articles, admittedly not paying much attention to the dates.**

**Nayeon**

&amp;#x200B;

When asked ""Who would you date if you were a boy?"" she said Momo - I'm not entirely sure WHEN this was, but more recently it seems like her and Momo have been spending lots of time together and they both love doing vLives together. Nayeon even went to Japan during their vacation so they could go to Disney/Universal together. I'm not trying to say this is a dating thing, but more so that it's really cute seeing how close they are with each other. 

Somewhat related to the above; On a vlive a while back she said that she wanted to visit Disneyland and go on the Harry Potter train ride; although at the time she said she'd take Sana or Jeongyeon. 

**Jeongyeon**

Her poodle's name ""Nanan"" comes from the fact that, when she was young, she loved Nana from the Teletubbies (the yellow one) so much that she would introduce herself of ""Nanan-ie"" to people. She has another dog, a Pomeranian, named Bbosongie

Jeongyeon actually failed her first audition at JYP. She auditioned a second time, also trying out with SM Entertainment; she received a spot at both companies, but chose JYP. All I could find on why was she say (basically) ""I never thought of debuting with another company other than JYP.""

**Momo**

Momo doesn't know how to ride a bicycle. - Okay I don't know how common it is due to cultures and such but I find this adorable.

Momo started dancing at 3 years old. The whole reason she even wanted to dance was so she could be just like her older sister, Hana. Both of them auditioned for JYP, but only Momo got invited to join. Regardless, Hana still has her own dance gig and often will cover TWICE songs (the choreographies) on Instagram. 

She told a story of when she was younger (I think like 5 or 6?) she got pushed and hit her head really hard on a wall, causing her to bleed alot. She attributes this accident to damaging her intelligence, and even said she was pretty good at speaking English for a Japanese girl her age.

BONUS: [In this video](https://youtu.be/dgAX__IxiPo?t=769) (Ask in a Box for ""What is Love?""), one of the questions asked Jihyo which member needed the most care. Jihyo, and every other member, instantly pointed to Momo. Nayeon comments ""She's not hard, she's just slow"". I can't find it, but Jeongyeon said somewhere that she actually likes taking care of Momo. (Momo often showers at night and will go to sleep with her hair still wet, and Jeongyeon will dry it for her. If this isn't some next level friendship I don't know what is).

**Sana**

One time (probably more than once) Sana got yelled at during her trainee years for sneaking food into the dorms. She pretended she couldn't understand them and started rattling off in Japanese. 

She's the only member of the group that does not have a brother or sister. 

She used to have her own twitter account: [**https://twitter.com/Sanapomu**](https://twitter.com/Sanapomu)**.** It's been literally over 7 years since the last post, but honestly if you look through the translations this is 100% what I would expect 14-16 year old Sana to tweet out. [https://twitter.com/\_tzumato/status/771600381289730048?lang=en](https://twitter.com/_tzumato/status/771600381289730048?lang=en) \- This particular tweet got lots of traction when TWICE was gaining popularity (NOTE: It was ""found out"" that her tweet was percentages given to her by some website, and it wasn't just her randomly tweeting it out. This shouldn't be looked into too deeply).

**Jihyo**

Jihyo's real name is actually Jisoo (Park Jisoo), but she didn't get it legally changed until after Sixteen. As a result, early on in their career Nayeon and Jeongyeon (who trained with Jihyo the longest) would occasionally call her Jisoo still.

Jihyo's role as a leader in the group was voted by the members, not chosen by JYP or anyone else at the company. (Jeongyeon came in second during the voting).

She loves searching the internet and reading web-comics before going to bed (Supposedly she's admitted to lurking around on Twitter but I couldn't find anything on this nor do I really know if she looks at K-Pop stuff or just celebrity pages).

**Mina**

Mina said that she has lots of mood swings, but likes trying to stay optimistic. - Lots of people assume this attributes to her more introverted, homebody nature.

She hates carnival rides. While she isn't afraid of heights - the speed and drops really scare her. [She screamed when she was forced into it](https://youtu.be/lJt2R_VHeII?t=126) (Also in this video - Momo hates both heights AND carnival rides.)

Mina was actually born in the United States - San Antonio, Texas. Both of her parents are Japanese and she moved to back to Japan not too long after turning 3, but her family was there for her father's work when she was born. This is why TWICE often jokes about her being their US Resident (which, legally, she is), but she left too early before ever learning much English. Similarly, this is why (even though she didn't learn much), she has the best English pronunciation in the group.

**Dahyun**

Dahyun auditioned for SM, JYP, and YG - and got in to all 3. She chose JYP, though I wasn't able to find out why.

She cannot and will not watch scary movies (right there with you Dubu). 

She used to be very active in her church group at a young age - She confirmed herself to be Christian.

**Chaeyoung**

She has the most credits for songwriting in TWICE. Not only has she wrote/co-wrote the most songs for the group, she also wrote a majority of her raps both in Sixteen and in their special performances (like [Daring Woman](https://youtu.be/Cnex1TJzqAc?t=78) and [Greedy](https://youtu.be/e2MW0_0apc4?t=91)). Fun fact about ME: Her rap in Daring Woman is my favorite of hers.

Chaeyoung really likes basketball (A WOMAN AFTER MY OWN HEART)

She said that if idol life didn't work for her, she would've been an art student in college. [She even drew some cover art](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71olqkvUrPL._SX522_.jpg) for a special edition of their Page Two album. 

**Tzuyu**

She comes from a very successful family, her mother is a shareholder in a hospital and owns several cafes in Taiwan. Tzuyu seems to have followed in those footsteps, sort of; while nothing official in terms of numbers has been released (and rightfully so, I think), it's speculated that Tzuyu earns the most of the members and its likely primarily due to her looks. She earns lots of money through modelling, commercials, etc. that goes directly to her. What she does with the money, I'm not sure. (Also, while not specifically from her - [there's a voting system in Korea ""myloveidol"", they donate 500,000 won to a charity organization in the name of the artist who gets voted #1](https://en-gb.facebook.com/TWICEONCELAND/posts/tzuyu-gotten-1-on-myloveidol-charity-angel-event-again-for-january-2019they-will/1954967224811120/). There has been a total of 6 million WON donated on TWICE's behalf - 5.5M of that was from Tzuyu).

The members have said she's generally really quiet and inactive in their group chat, until she goes home and visits her dog Gucci - where she literally sends photos of her dog and how good he is doing.

She finds winter ""scary"" because she gets cold very easily - she prefers spring and summer. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some bonus facts that isn't necessarily attributed to a single member:

Sana and Momo were both accepted into JYP at the same time and even traveled from Japan to Korea together. They dormed together as trainees and Sana said on a vLive that she cannot remember a single time the two of them fought, even back then. 

Mina and Dahyun are attributed to be the smartest/best in school of all the members. Even though she's clumsy and a bit ditzy, Sana's knack for learning languages and picking up on cultural differences show that she's smarter than people assume (or, at the very least, just excels in this particular zone). 

TWICE was originally supposed to be 7 members at the end of Sixteen - Jihyo, Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung. Tzuyu was added in as the audience vote, and JYP himself personally brought Momo back from elimination to join. While it's impossible to think of the group without the two of them now, at the time there was lots of backlash for them allowing eliminated members to debut.

TWICE all lives in the same dorm/house. The maknaes (Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu) share one room, Jeongyeon and Momo share the smallest room, and Jihyo, Nayeon, Mina, and Sana share the largest room. They've recently moved dorms and there's a possibility this living arrangement has changed slightly (though I do know that Jeongyeon and Momo still share a room). 

Half of them have really weird sleeping habits. The members voted the large room (even those who sleep in it) as the room with the worst habits. Nayeon sleeps with her eyes open and often laughs and sings in her sleep, Jihyo will pick up her phone and have conversations, and Sana will lightly sleepwalk. Momo will stretch out and often sleeps with her eyes open as well. Tzuyu, while rare, will speak small words while sleeping. Dahyun, Chaeyoung, Jeongyeon, and Mina don't really do much - though Dahyun is the heaviest sleeper and Chaeyoung sleeps the most.",37,122

Continuing [u/HeavvyUnderwear](https://www.reddit.com/u/HeavvyUnderwear)'s work a year ago, I put together 20 questions for the 2019 annual global Once census! This will allow us to gain a better understanding of the Once community, and also maybe even provide some insight into Twice's international marketing strategy (would be a miracle if I could get this data onto JYP's desk lol). The survey will run for a whole month until Twice's comeback in April, and two lucky participants will be chosen for a free copy of Twice's next comeback album!

Please share this survey will all your Once friends and let me know in the comments if there's any questions or suggestions to the census :) Thank you all for your time!

So my question involves Nayeon who I know had a different color in the Likey M/V but since then I dont recall her changing it much. 

So do you think Nayeon will do any drastic hair color changes in the future? Example is when Jeongyeon went with the blue color last year for ""What is Love"" comeback.
if so what color would you want to see?",4,17

Im asking June specifically because my school is having a trip to Japan. Im really interested in going but the only thing holding me back is if Twice decides to tour the US in that time, I would rather stay in the US and attend their concert. The trip is going to cost at least $5k so its not something I can back out of if I change my mind. 

Stray Kids is having a tour in May and they announced the tour at the end of January, so if Twice were to tour here we would have heard from them by now right? 

I know for a lot of people, it seems dumb to ask this but seeing Twice is definitely outweighs a trip to Japan with my school. ",15,21

203,2019-3-8,2019,3,8,10,aykjb4,What are your favorite title track performances?,CuteTent,1552008918,"With the upcoming dome tour in Japan, I thought it would be a good opportunity to revisit and relive some of your favorite title track performances. What makes the performance your favorite could be any aspect: the atmosphere, the context, the choreography, the vocals, etc. Here are my favorites:

* **[Like OOH-AHH](https://streamable.com/h491t)**: In the [last episode of Twice TV2](https://www.vlive.tv/video/4318), Twice made a surprise visit to the elementary school of a young fan. This was a couple months after Twice's debut, so it's really cool to see how far they've come and how much they've improved. After their performance, Twice reflected on how they became singers who can make someone's dream come true as well as making one of their own dreams come true. Overall, a really heartwarming performance.

* **[Cheer Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3o_jC6sObE)**: From [the beginner's guide to Twice shows](https://i.imgur.com/rYJStQC.jpg), it mentioned how Twice's performance at Akaraka solidified them as the nation's girl group; this performance is genuine proof. The sheer amount of people singing along is absolutely incredible, especially during the chorus.

* **[TT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZDkexx0k-0)**: I didn't really have a clear favorite in mind for TT, so the first thing I thought of was their performance for the Once Halloween Fan Meeting. Doing TT in their Halloween costumes must have been a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys come up with for TT!

* **[Knock Knock](https://www.vlive.tv/video/30627)**: I love [Twice TV5 in Switzerland](https://www.vlive.tv/video/30824), so this one was easy. I like how they pieced the different performances from the different locations in the episodes into one video. There was even a [fan cam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWp0sohKVS0) of one of their performances and that was really surreal to see. On a side note, it must have been tiring doing the choreography at such high altitudes. Overall, the only flaw with this performance is that Jihyo wasn't there. :(

* **[Signal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zloCYR3IZ0)**: The first thing that came to mind was their performance to the [Signal remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBv0H3s12pc). Signal is already their most unique title track, so performing to a remix makes it even more fun. It's just cool to see something different.

* **[Likey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoLvhh89law)**: This performance is a lot of fun, and it's something I wish Twice would do again. Seeing Momo letting her swag shine and [MC Rail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mRAkNDd7XQ) making an appearance is always a good time. Chaeyoung did great during the dance break too.

* **[Heart Shaker](https://www.vlive.tv/video/51910)**: Similar to TT, I didn't have a clear favorite in mind for Heart Shaker, so I just put up one of their performances during their V LIVE. Show me what you guys got. :)

* **[What is Love?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU5ENDfKXOY)**: Hands down my favorite title track. There are so many performances I can link for this one, but I'll just go with the one I saw most recently. Their performance at the MAMA Fans' Choice in Japan is awesome because it incorporates some of the elements from the music video (someone putting headphones onto Mina, Momo and Tzuyu's La La Land choreography, etc.) into the performance. Jihyo and Nayeon's vocals at the end too... oh mercy me.

* **[Dance the Night Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YM3KOk5Avw)**: I remember watching a stream for the KCON LA concert and feeling a moment of bliss when Twice finally came on. I became a fan sometime after their Dance the Night Away comeback, so actually going to KCON LA wasn't even on my mind. I would go in a heartbeat if it was today though. This performance just reminds me of summer, and I kind of miss the long summer nights.

* **[BDZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90UPbrSvTj0)**: No clear favorite for BDZ either. I love the salute in the chorus though; I always have to do it too :)

* **[Yes or Yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSVo6At6-us&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=28)**: Yes or Yes was the first Korean comeback that I was a part of, and honestly, it was a really exciting time. I remember watching all of the teasers and getting more excited with each one. I also recall watching the music video in the middle of the night when it first released and thinking, ""Holy shit, this is it."" Their performance on Knowing Bros isn't a full performance, but it sums up my feelings of how I felt leading up to the release of Yes or Yes. The high-powered choreography during the chorus just gets you going and the way they had to stop just leaves you wanting more.

221,2019-3-8,2019,3,8,18,ayoiav,190308 TWICE Throwback Thread,qwertsqwert,1552038660," In todays thread, well reminisce on Twices journey leading up to now and how they have evolved over time.

Recently, Twice's second Japanese album, #TWICE2, was released and it has been met with amazing sales numbers and public reception. However, it was their first Japanese album, #TWICE, that allowed the group to formally introduce themselves to their Japanese audience.

\#TWICE was released in summer 2017 and contained Japanese versions of each of their title tracks, until Signal.

Here, you can share Twice content and media from this era or just discuss this era in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* What are your favorite songs from #TWICE? Why are they your favorites?
* Do you think #TWICE2 would have been as well received had #TWICE not released at all? Why or why not?

240,2019-3-9,2019,3,9,2,aysxmj,Missed oppurtunity regarding Mina's gaming.,zetsupetsu,1552066516,"I feel like JYP division 3 is seriously missing out on a huge oppurtunity to promote Mina and Twice as a whole.

Mina streaming games would likely be extremely popular, especially with PUBG where the members imply she's really good at and I'm sure lots of people would love to see that.


I think the 2015 Sudden Attack endorsement has made division 3 hesitant to stream other games and its did more harm than good in hindsight.

In their head they might be thinking its better to not stream games so other potential sponsors might endorse them like Sudden Attack and Elsword did and this mentality is what is ultimately stopping them from thinking outside the box.


Mina streaming and playing games would be really popular imo, and is a missed oppurtunity on their part.",22,61

I myself honestly cannot believe I need to ask/start this kind of discussion but here it goes. I don't know if it's just me but I watched a bunch of their recent V-LIVES including the ones post-2018 and even the past promotion V-LIVES and noticed a bit of a pattern here and there. I felt like the older members often interrupts the younger members when talking, often Tzuyu(NOT INTENTIONALLY, I KNOW), I noticed this when Tzuyu wants to say something. Here's the thing, I noticed this because I keep replaying their videos and watch every small details of it like their laughs, name callings, awkward pauses, etcetera. I could link the timestamps but you guys would think I am just over thinking and weird. The thing that bothered me is that most of the time the person that got interrupted doesn't get the chance to repeat what she's saying. I am watching the re:memVer V-LIVE earlier when I closed it halfway through when Tzuyu got interrupted for the third time because Jihyo and Jeongyeon were non-stop talking and suddenly interrupts. I don't know man but if you watched the clip closely, you know will know the feeling of the awkward moment if let's say you were there and you saw the person gets interrupted and the conversation continues without asking her to repeat. Props to Dahyun though for being a good listener and acknowledge someone who wants to say something. 

Not really sure myself. Maybe I am just overthinking. I know elders value the opinions of the younger ones and there's even a video of Tzuyu's honesty and Nayeon and Momo following here honest advise but I just felt weird noticing these things.",20,0

Then I realized Twice is kinda in the same boat where they have so many hit songs and b sides that there's always going to be some songs they don't play.


So that being said, I was bored at work and decided to make my own personal perfect Twice set. Going off their last few concerts, the standard seems to be 20-22 songs not including special stages/covers. 

Opener:

 1. DTNA


No particular order: 
2. Like Oh Ah

3. Cheer Up

4. Signal

5. BDZ (JPN)

6. Heart Shaker

7. Sunset

8. Young and Wild

9. What is Love

10. Headphones On

11. Candy Boy

12. Jelly Jelly

13. One More Time

14. Wake Me Up

15. Sweet Talker

16. I Want You Back



Slow Songs:
17. Turtle

18. One in a Million

19. Stay By my Side



Encore:

20. TT

21. Yes or Yes

22. What is Love (acoustic)


Just Missing The Cut:

Knock Knock

Ho

Look at Me

Touchdown

Loveline

Stuck

The Best Thing I Ever Did",10,21

A few weeks ago I posted on here asking about everyones favorite Twice outfits to put into Funko Pops. 

My Girlfriend finished up classes this semester, and is starting to work on them! I figured I would update all you wonderful people. 

She is practicing with illustrator now, (she is super new to Digital Art but excited to learn more) and I think it came out awesome. :)

Here it is:[LOA Momo complete](https://imgur.com/gallery/kGNWUaR)

I am very proud of her. She is super shy about posting stuff, but she is becoming more outgoing which is awesome to see.  I surprised her with all the nice things you said on the last post, and it really motivated her and made her smile.

Hope you all enjoy the picture, and She will get to working on more soon(She just did a quick drawing of Funko Pop Lisa from BP too). If you want, Check out her other stuff! (sorry if that counts as promoting, I will delete that if you want mods) 

Have a great day/night everyone, and thank you for being so nice and welcoming to both me and my GF.

I know there's ""unhelpful"" in the title, but they arent suppposed to literally be unhelpful but a decent introduction to Twice as a whole.


There's one that outright states that 9 of them are gay. I know its meant to be a joke but newcomers, especially those unfamiliar with kpop, will take this the wrong way and actually think they are gay. I already saw a few people who thought this was the case because this is their first introduction to Twice.


There's one that states some information that didnt even need to be mentioned, like Mnet evil editing Nayeon, Momo eating only ice for a week during their training, etc. These are things they will learn as soon as they get to know more about Twice not on their first exposure to them and knowing about it early on might put them off rather than make them more interested.


Calling the girls as 3mix, J-Line, School Meal Club, without properly telling what any of these means, is making them even more confused than helping.


Not to mention most of the clips theyre using for each member does not give justice to some members at all. Its like they only put relevant clips for their favorite members and then just put random clips on the rest.


To be honest I find most of them to be triggering and I havent found the best video that can introduce each member well.",11,0

A Twitter poll was held with over 820 participants where they comment their bias and their sexuality and here are the results.


1. Chaeyoung - 148

2. Jihyo - 109

5. Dahyun - 90

6. Jeongyeon - 89

7. Mina - 70

8. Nayeon - 65

9. Tzuyu - 40



Chaeyoung, while being the most popular, also has the most bisexual and lesbian fans which makes up 85% of her total votes.


Momo and Jihyo are the most popular among straight people.

TWICE's dome tour is happening soon and I was lucky in the ticket lottery. I will attend the concert in Osaka this Wednesday.  I'm of course super hyped! 

I haven't visited a TWICE concert before. This will be also my first K-Pop concert and my first music concert in Japan ever. So I was wondering if there are any good tips to enjoy a Twice concert in the best way possible from people with prior experience. 

I know already:

\- Photos and videos are strictly forbidden (I don't want to risk it)

\- Sitting concert (no standing area)

\- They will sell merchandise before the concert

&amp;#x200B;

Some questions I have:

\- Are there any other pre-concert events? Meetups? 

\- Post-concert events?

\- Can I take pictures at the venue before the concert?

\- Should I enter as early as possible if I want to buy merchandise?

\- Can I bring bag pack? Water? Food? 

\- Any (Japanese) fan chant I should know?

\- Etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm grateful for any good tip! Thanks in advance :)

In the years since their debut, I think it's clear how each member has a unique and distinct personality that they are known for. For instance, Sana is super sweet but a clumsy aegyo queen. Or Mina tends to be quieter and more introverted than the others. Of course, humans being humans, we rarely exist is just one mode like that.

As such, my question is simply this - Which members bring out different sides of each other that we otherwise rarely get to see?",13,31

I'm looking for an episode that had TWICE eating at a Korean restaurant. I'm thinking around 2015-2016, prior to Cheer Up era. There were a couple of memorable scenes. 

* Tzuyu was talking to a spoon as if it was a mirror, and asking it ""Who's the fairest of them all?"" to which Nayeon, who was sitting next to her, would reply ""Nayeon!"". 
* Momo ate 2-3 bowls of rice and was still eating the remains of a stew. 
* Nayeon and Momo were role-playing some overdramatic scene where Nayeon ""died"". They stopped role-playing when one member asked ""Who wants chocolate?"" and they both responded ""ME!"". 

I tried looking through a bunch of TWICE episodes but couldn't find it. I hope someone knows which episode I'm talking about haha. Thanks in advance!",3,12

653,2019-3-22,2019,3,22,0,b3rvdf,[FAN ACCOUNT] #Dreamday tour Osaka Day 1 190320,Lemontea22,1553182128,"Okay, below is my review of the #Dreamday tour in Osaka, Day 1.

Set list is as per the image. I will make references to individual songs so here's the ****SPOILER ALERT**** https://i.imgur.com/dyXfJ6E.jpg

**Before the concert**

I arrived at Kyocera Dome at around 12pm (concert starts at 5:30pm) and having picked up some pre-order goods already, my goal was to buy a few Lovelys. Naturally, I ended up with a photobook; wristband and two Lovelys. Having been to only one Kpop event before (the Australia KCON), I must applaud on how well the goods stall was ran by the organisers. Lots of staff and logistically speaking, very smooth. It was packed as the time approached 3pm so I am not sure if there was enough merchandises for everyone. Pretty crazy considering there were pre-orders available. 

The amount of cards/Hi-Touches/banners available around the block is impressive and thank you to all the fanclub admins for providing free signs. Managed to get a Sana, a Mina and a Dahyun sign and I did see a few more others floating around as well.

**The actual performance**

The main event. I will write this in dot points as otherwise this becomes a 2000 word essay.

- The opening VCR showed the girls in a press conference for the tour. When it gets to Mina's turn, there is a flash back to their Japan debut.
- Mina being the main is a theme throughout the night. It is her home turf after all and she really shone throughout the night.

To put some perspective on the venue, there is the stage at one end of the stadium, and a center area in the middle of the stadium, with audience on the other three ends of the stadium and more seats within the stadium (called Arena seats).

- The show started with *One More Time* in the center area, and I think the energy and the adrenaline of seeing Twice in person took over, as I felt that the performance was so impressive.

- Next was *Luv Me*. I am not familiar with the song so I would like to note how cool it was for the Candy Bongs to synchronise throughout the concert, providing images like this. http://i.imgur.com/Q0CUMft.jpg

- *Like Ooh Aah* came after. The debut debut song - the Momo dancebreak is even more impressive in person as it is on Youtube.

- First talk session. Introduction from each member and by my very rough estimate from the amount of cheers, Mina was the most popular, followed by Tzuyu and then Sana/Momo. Lots of love for the other members too of course.

- *Brand New Girl* is next. The children sitting in front of me loved the song, and I do find it quite impressive how Twice attracted audiences from all age groups to the show - from 8 year old kids to 35 year old office worker to a 75 year old grandmother amongst the people I saw.

- *SIGNAL* followed. Jirit Jirit was the loudest fan chant I had heard to that point.

- First VCR acted as a prelude to *Candy Pop*, with the girls dancing alongside their animated counterparts. Can never ignore the resemblance between JYP and Brock in the MV.

- The *TT* remix was on point and considering the popularity of the song in Japan, it's no surprise that the fanchant for *yamete, yamete* was SUPER loud.

- *Wake Me Up* followed and I believe this is when the moving stage is utilised. To dance on an elevated, moving stage...impressive and definitely a joy to behold watching it in person.

- *Cheer Up* is a classic and SHY SHY SHY is a cult classic. 

- *Pink Lemonade* and *I want you back* was accompanied by the girls in moving carts. Great opportunity to wave to the girls and ~~in delusion~~ get a wave/heart back

- *What is Love* Japanese version is a bit higher but the fanchants works just as well (*I wanna know*). I must admit I was impressed by how well the girls sang live.

- The next VCR acted as a prelude for *BDZ* and the gigantic ~~Godzilla~~ Lovely that held the girls. How they convinced Momo and Dahyun to get on the stage, I would never know. BDZ surprisingly works well as a hype song and Tzuyu's line at the start...oof (in a good way)

- I wasn't familiar with the Japanese B-sides, but *Sweet Talker*'s inclusion was surprising considering it is a Korean-only release. I do like the song a lot.

- The same surprise factor applied to *The Best Thing I Ever Did*, not a song I listened to when it came out but worked great during the concert.

- The main singles follows, with *Heartshaker*; *Knock Knock*; *Likey* and *Dance The Night Away*. I was blown away and don't really have any words to describe except please, go watch them live in person if you can. The energy transmitted across throughout the performances is not easy but they do it so well.

- Another VCR follows, I believe this is the one where they did the photoshoot for the tour. Lots of Oohs and Aahs as there were zoom ins to each member. The girls sitting next to me were quiet throughout the show, but even they had muttered a few wows and oohs when Tzuyu came up on the screen.

- *Be As One* followed. I think I was going to cry until Jeongyeon cracked her voice. Thanks, Jeongers.

- *Wishing* followed and once again, I was impressed by how stable Jihyo was. Her stage presence is no joke.

- Closing comments followed.  Dahyun being Dahyun was great at getting the crowd started. Mina and Sana were obviously more emotional as it is their home turf. Seeing as it was Day 1 of the tour, I think the general feeling was more one of excitement than sadness.

- A Japanese song medley followed and *Yes or Yes* served as the perfect ending.

Other misc notes:

- The crowd was the loudest for Mina - always. 

- Cannot reiterate how terrific Twice performed live. Seeing them in person is really something else.

- I thought the setlist was great. All the hit songs were covered and there weren't many lulls in the show.

Can't wait for the hi-touch on Sunday!",28,85

666,2019-3-22,2019,3,22,12,b400db,190322 TWICE Throwback Thread,qwertsqwert,1553224771," In todays thread, well reminisce on Twices journey leading up to now and how they have evolved over time.

 As Twice's first Japan Dome Tour is now in full swing, let us look back at the group's first Japan Arena Tour, held in October 2018 to promote the release of BDZ [(Spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/album/3Bi7hl11zYHpw6uE6gAtSs?si=b-uouRX3SUGIWrKJIW_K_g), their first official Japanese album.

For some context, the only Japanese album before the BDZ era was #TWICE, consisting of Japanese versions of Korean title tracks from 2015\~2017. After this era, the group started to release music videos ([One More Time](https://youtu.be/HuoOEry-Yc4), [Candy Pop](https://youtu.be/wQ_POfToaVY), [Wake Me Up](https://youtu.be/DdLYSziSXII)) and accompanying EPs of songs to be included on the BDZ album throughout late 2017 and 2018 in between Korean eras, culminating with the [BDZ M/V](https://youtu.be/CMNahhgR_ss) release in mid August 2018 and the full album release in September 2018. This album consists entirely of songs that are written specifically in Japanese rather than adapted to Japanese from Korean.

Unofficial fancams of this tour are available across video streaming platforms.

Following this tour, Twice would later release the BDZ repackage (December 2018) and #TWICE2 (March 2019) albums, each available in physical form as well as across Korean and international audio streaming platforms. Both of these releases were met with stellar sales numbers and chart statistics, and the 2018 Arena Tour played a critical role in allowing Twice to directly access and formally introduce themselves to their J-ONCE audience.

Here, you can share Twice content and media from this era or just discuss this era in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* Were you able to attend one of the performances of this tour? If so, what was your experience like?
* What are your favorite songs from BDZ? Why are they your favorites?
* Where would you like to see Twice go on tour next?

Last year Sana and Jihyo get along really well too.


Which members do you think will get really close this year?

Is it going to be Sana jumping to a new member again? Or a new pair this time?

&amp;#x200B;

I've only been a ONCE for about 2 months now. Got a lot to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if it may be hard, but I wish to get an answer to my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Where can I buy Candy Bong? (either online, or stores in the Philippines, specifically Metro Manila)
2. Why is the Candy Bong sold out? Was it a limited-time thing? I'm really curious why most stores don't offer it anymore.
3. When will the Candy Bong be released again? I want to be prepared and have my money.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't have to be specifically the lightstick, it could just be stores that sell just TWICE merch in general, but I'd appreciate it if you just give me stores that sell the lightstick aswell as the other merchandise.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope my question gets answered soon!

&amp;#x200B;

p.s. I know that Candy Bong is sold out at most places but I just want to know which are the stores so I can be ready once Candy Bong v2 comes out.

&amp;#x200B;

p.p.s. I haven't seen a post like this so I decided to post because I'm genuinely curious.

&amp;#x200B;

p.p.p.s. I have no idea how the flairs work so please excuse if I put in the wrong flair.",16,13

884,2019-3-28,2019,3,28,12,b6dpf1,[FAN ACCOUNT] #Dreamday Hi-Touch Day Experience 190324,Lemontea22,1553742593,"Following on from the concert ([you can read about my experience here](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/b3rvdf/fan_account_dreamday_tour_osaka_day_1_190320/)\]), my mind quickly moved to the Hi-Touch session, as there were a few things I needed to do on the day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Before**

&amp;#x200B;

I arrived at INTEX Osaka at around 10:30am and having heard news that the goods line was in pandemonium mode, I decided to dip my feet into trading Hi-Touch cards. Going into the day I had a Mina and a Momo Hi-Touch card, and as a Sana bias getting one of her cards was my highest priority.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who spoke conversational Japanese at best, writing what I wanted to trade/receive on a piece of paper was the best method. As you can imagine, several hundreds of people looking to trade cards meant that the entrance of INTEX looked a bit like a Sunday market, except money isn't the common form of accepted currency here.

&amp;#x200B;

Fellow ONCEs were all very friendly and it was actually quite a fun experience to trade. Seeing other ONCEs yell out in joy when they traded for the card they wanted, and then doing the same myself, was a great feeling to experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up with Sana, Dahyun and Jihyo. [Tickets here](https://imgur.com/a/TGr56qo)

&amp;#x200B;

Then came the boring part: waiting. To get into the Hi-Touch line, it involved waiting to enter the ticket exchange venue; waiting for the actual ticket exchange and then waiting for the Hi-Touch (the girls were on their break when I entered) which actually took 3 hours. I have to applaud the Japanese ONCEs for being so respectful and patient throughout the entire process. My legs were crying by the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

But when the venue staff announced that the girls had finished their break, there was only one thing on my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

*""Ah, so this is what I waited so long for""*

&amp;#x200B;

**The actual Hi-Touch**

&amp;#x200B;

I went in planning to say   (manaso pangawoyo or nice to meet you) and yup, it took me two attempts to determine that it was too long for a maximum three second hi-touch - lesson learnt.

&amp;#x200B;

Anything beyond two sentences is just additional creative writing on my part, so here's my summary:

&amp;#x200B;

* Dahyun: Dubu dubu is real, her skin is really pale. Replied with a soft ""haiii"" which was enough to melt my heart.

&amp;#x200B;

* Jihyo: She was energetic with that leader smirk/smile on, which was great news. She didn't get the memo to clap softly though :P

&amp;#x200B;

* Sana: My bias. Unfortunately I was in the worst position possible by entering after a child and before a die-hard fan (Seriously, this guy was wearing an all purple (Sana's colour) robe and held a fan with her name on it), both requiring some additional attention. She looked like an anime character and basically radiated some special aura.

&amp;#x200B;

All three was wearing the black #Dreamday shirt and yes, looked incredible in person despite the fatigue.

&amp;#x200B;

**After**

&amp;#x200B;

The merchandise line was short at the end of the day, so it was easy to purchase goods. Of course, some goods have sold out so going early does have its perks! I ended up with the Tokyo/Nagoya towels and two #TWICE2 tote bags.

&amp;#x200B;

I did manage to see Mina's mum on the way out of the Hi-Touch venue, and she was very gracious and accommodating to photo requests. I heard that Momo's dad was there as well.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, it was a great end to my #Dreamday tour. I'll now go back to support the girls from the land down under!",4,27

1061,2019-3-31,2019,3,31,13,b7k3ze,An Opinion about the Next Comeback,trinichristian,1554008124,"  

Hi all. Im not sure if this is the right place for me to post this, but I felt like it was something I wanted to get off my chest, and see if there was anyone else who felt this way

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Im still pretty new to this fandom, and I guess that this is going to be my first comeback (since Ive come to understand that The Best Thing I Ever Did wasnt a real comeback), and Ive been enjoying diving into the community, reading here, r/kpop, soompi and a bunch of other places. Its been a lot of fun so far, but there is one thing that keeps coming up that kinda bothers me. Pretty much everywhere I go, everyone wants Twice to do a sexy concept for their next comeback, and I gotta ask: am I the only one that thinks that thats a bad idea?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now dont get me wrong. Theres nothing wrong or bad with a sexy concept, and if the members want to do that, then by all means they should. But, personally, I feel that that concept is like beating a dead horse. Everyone is talking about being sexy and breaking barriers and being different, but they all end up just being the same. And it isnt just Kpop, its pop music in general. You could pretty much pick any western female artist or group, and youd find that theyre centered around being sexy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that drew me to Kpop and Twice in particular is that they were doing something that I had never seen before. Regular pop music is great and all, and it makes up a significant part of my music library, but sometimes you need something a little different. Even if they move away from the cute concept, there are lots of other concepts they can try that havent been done to death already.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Again, dont get me wrong. No matter what this next comeback is, sexy or not, you can be 100% sure that I will be listening to it on a loop.  But I feel like Twice is far too unique and ahead in the game to be doing such an old and oversaturated concept. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL-DR: I feel like Twice is too unique to be doing a concept that has already been beaten to death. ",16,31

I cant even walk .1km without my legs feeling jellyish. If I die, please let TWICE know theyve made a huge difference in my life. Theyve spread positivity, humour and everything for the past 2 years of me stanning them. I really want to go to their concert this year if they are coming to Singapore, so since last year I worked hard to get my school bursery. I got the $350 and ready to spend and go to their concert. I cant go to school now cuz I cant even walk a distance without feeling jellyish. If I die, I just want twice to acknowledge my existence,

Idk if Im exaggerating anything, probably in a few days Ill be better but if I do die in the Low circumstance, ily twice, thanks for giving me happiness when there were none. Thanks for letting me acknowledge the loss of someone and moving forward with it. Thanks for being my love.
