Luckily, not that many people were in the offices today, so I decided to just stream TT and DTNA in the background while working. I decided to do a small analysis on the views of these two music videos throughout the day to see how the numbers look in comparison to the beginning of the day. 

**[Here is the link to the data and graph](https://imgur.com/a/9mdOl8R)**.

It may not be a sophisticated research, but nonetheless, I figured fellow ONCEs may appreciate this. I checked the views as often as I can, but consistency was difficult as I also had to work on a few things.

TT's views at 3:10 PM EST: **392,601,811**

TT's views at 9:16 PM EST: **392,690,219**.

The view count for ""TT"" grew **88,408** over a 6 hour span. As you can see in [this graph](https://imgur.com/YxHsuWZv), it gradually increases in the rate of views as the night goes on. It's a positive sign for our goal of this MV hitting 400 million! 

The ""Dance the Night Away"" MV is still relatively young, and it's a consistent growth as seen in [its graph](https://imgur.com/M4EZIIt). 

I really don't like when people spam to stream TT, but I hope this provides some reasoning to do so. There's a good amount of consistency when it comes to it, so when you can, please keep streaming!",2,3

The part of the Vlive is from 26:40-27:00. I was wondering if we as a fandom could somehow find a way to make this happen. Chris as far as I could find only has a Instagram and I dont think spamming his accounts would be the best way to go about it. I know that he is represented by CAA or Creative Artists Agency so maybe it would be effective to ask them. I was wondering what you guys thought would be the best way to achieve this for Jihyo?

&amp;nbsp;

I wanted to create a topic for the next days (in theory, it needs 14 days but I guess it will be something like 12) because we can't be lazy about the stream of TT for the 400 million views. I didn't want to specify that in the title but the Blink really wants this record, that's a fact.  
And for me, they're a little more effective than us with several accounts on Twitter that gather like 850K followers. I saw more tutorials coming from them like you can see when the Army community promotes the streaming. When I made the researchs, that was impressive.

&amp;nbsp;

All we have to remember is that the record is important and we have to work for it. The method is secondary, the record is what the people will remember.  
I will post what I do and you can propose your own method. I've read different ones in 3 fanbase : Army / Once / Blink. Maybe I'm wrong on some points because nobody really knows what to do but that seems ok. Anyway, tell me what you think if you do something else.  

- Playlist + sign in : make a good playlist with disorder between the M/V of TT.  
After it's finished, clear your web browser and lauch the playlist again. Between TT, I've put this : 1/ 2 or 3 teasers of different channels 2/ an entire M/V 3/ A M/V + a teaser. Everything except TT is from a different channel.  
- [manual streaming + sign out](https://imgur.com/a/eGOuV4m) : in fact, the first image comes from an other fanbase but I modified it. That's what I was doing 2 days ago. Before cleaning my browser cache and do it again, I launched a different M/V and I let the add.  
I like this method, it's something I try to do every days. It's probably the best thing to do and you can do it with different devices.

65,2018-9-4,2018,9,4,6,9cpmqb,180903 TWICE Throwback Thread,qwertsqwert,1536011799," In todays thread, well reminisce on Twices journey leading up to now. Each week well look back at what Twice was like as a group and how they have evolved over time.

One year ago, our very own God Jihyo performed her Serenade (Melody Project)! Melody projects do not come very frequently, so they are always very well received.

This melody project features quite a few songs, but the most prominent performance is that of [TT with a jazz arrangement foundation](https://www.vlive.tv/video/40222?channelCode=EDBF).

Here, you can share Twice content and media from this event or just discuss this era in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* What are your thoughts on this melody project? How well does the production value play to and amplify Jihyos strengths as a vocalist?
* What are your thoughts on melody projects in general? Should Twice produce more of these? Who would you like to see doing a melody project next?

86,2018-9-5,2018,9,5,1,9cx4lp,TT Lyrics Breakdown/Analysis,misterkampfer,1536077886,"Hello ONCE,

i was streaming TT to reach 400m goal and realized i've never thought about lyrics. it's a nice song with catchy tune, cute and captivating point dance. TT move and dance spread like a plague and made TWICE really popular. many people see TT as Twice's Gee. anyway, if you take lyrics alone and think about it, it's actually a sad song and i've found real life references to members(intentionally or unintentionally). i wanna talk about them. 

Disclaimer: this post is only my opinion.

________________________________

the girl in the TT has platonic feelings against her baby. she doesn't mention any names or gender. actually i assume singer is ""the girl"" because TWICE singing the song.

she doesn't even know him personally, she is just imagining talking with him. she is very desperate. 

she is want to first to talk but it's just all in her head. she doesn't have the courage. 

she feels like she is about to cry and she can't even recognize herself about this situation. 

at [1:27](https://youtu.be/ePpPVE-GGJw?t=1m27s) chorus starts and Nayeon says

""Think Im all grown up now

Im free to make my own choices, but why

Why cant I have it my way""

i think it's an unintentional real life reference. we all know how nayeon is the fake maknae but she is really caring and unnie to other members. she is there to comfort them first. she is the first one hugging a member when [she cries and asks ""why?""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeeOJUbJ7QE). she even comforted yeri after jonghyun's suicide. ""why can't I have it my way"" is a reference to idol life. they are mature but they still follow the company. also ""the girl"" in the song can't get what she wants and act freely. 

at [1:57](https://youtu.be/ePpPVE-GGJw?t=1m57s) jeongyeon says

""You say Im ridiculous,

That I dont live up to my looks

Doesnt cheer me up at all ba-ba-ba-baby""

this is also another real life reference to jeongyeon's situation in the group. she had short hair until the DTNA. she was given a tomboy/girlcrush/hard image. i think she is the most motherly and feminine figure in the group. caring all members, being really tidy, comforting them. she acts like crazy and she likes to troll sometimes but she is much much more than that. she is different what she looks like. notice the only ""boy"" character in the MV is hers. also pinocchio looks like just a wooden puppet but he is actually alive inside. it's another reference to ""you say i don't live up to my looks"".

after jeongyeon, jihyo follows and says 

""Im going crazy in all this mess

Why do I feel hungry?

I eat all day and am still hungry""

we all know jihyo had weight issues at sixteen and she tried to lost weight till signal. she stressed out and starting binge eating when she was a traniee. this is also another real life reference. ""the girl"" in the song has eating disorder because of her problems.

she wants to ask her crush if he knows what's inside her head. but she still doesn't have courage to sad. she is sad.

_____________________________________

anyway, these were my thoughts about the song. you may say ""dude, you are overanalyzing the song"". i know but i just wanted to share. what's your thoughts about TT?

also don't forget to stream. we all need dahyun's double eyelids.

I know Tzuyu is very humble but it's actually insane she still goes to school (probably only when she legally has to). Let's dare to imagine what it's like to have her in your class. How would you concentrate on maths if Tzuyu showed up?? 

Do you think she is one of the most famous idols to attend school?

152,2018-9-9,2018,9,9,14,9easab,TWICE positions,rikkuperson,1536471498,"I have a habit of checking KProfiles whenever i see a new group just to familiarize myself with the group and learn their roles. I also have a very bad habit of checking Twices profile even though I know these sites arent all -that- accurate and tend to put what they believe over what is official from the agency or whatever. 


However, this got me thinking about how the girls have improved and how, maybe, if at all, their positions in the group have changed and I think it would be an interesting thing to discuss on what TWICE has improved on and maybe even things they still need to work on. Below Ill list each member and what kProfiles believes their position to be. 


Jihyo: Leader and Main Vocal. 


Nayeon: Lead Vocal, Lead Dancer, Center. 


Jeongyeon: Lead Vocal. 


Momo: Main Dancer, Vocalist, Rapper. 


Sana: Vocalist. 


Mina: Main Dancer, Vocalist. 


Dahyun: Lead Rapper, Vocalist. 


Chaeyoung: Main Rapper, Vocalist. 


Tzuyu: Lead Dancer, Vocalist, Maknae, Visual. 



In my personal opinion, I find it rather odd Sana isnt a lead dancer since thats what she auditioned off of and what she spent the majority of Sixteen promoting herself as? Also, I feel like Jihyo has more than proven herself to be part of the dance line. Obviously, this source isnt exactly the most accurate but Im really interested in hearing your opinions! 


Disclaimer because, unfortunately. I feel like there needs to be one: respect each others opinions and try not to tear down the girls if you dont think they fit the position theyve been given. Constructive criticism is one thing, bashing is another. Mods, if this doesnt quite fit the sub or has been done before I do apologize! ",31,35

Sana's and Momo's 2012 audition date as a possible example.,__einmal__,1536497193,"I am trying to figure out the timeline of Sana of Momo's departure to Korea. There is a lot of contradictory information out there.  
So we know they were invited to a JYP Global audition in Japan. Many sites mention 13th of April 2012 as the date they passed the audition.  
I couldn't find any info on such an audition taking place in early 2012, however I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP-84Zcsq-Q) which says an audition took place in Osaka on November 19th 2011. This also nicely lines up with the story that after Sana passed the audition she took her mother to a 2PM concert, and in fact [2PM had a concert tour in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2PM_concert_tours) just a few weeks later between the 3rd and the 21st of December 2011. With concerts in Osaka on 5th and 6th of December. So I assume the often mentioned date of the audition on 13th of April 2012 was actually the date Momo and Sana arrived in Korea (since I remember they mentioned that they arrived in April 2012).    
However, what does not really line up are Sana's old twitter accounts .They overlap with this period and as I understand she nowhere mentions the audition, the concert or the preparation to leave for Korea. But of course that doesn't mean much, she wasn't really that active on twitter and usually tweeted very mundane things.    
https://twitter.com/sanapomu   
22/08/2010-11/12/2012  [translated](https://twitter.com/_tzumato/status/767908017211793408)    
https://twitter.com/sa7pom   
29/12/2012-16/03/2012   
  
Just wondering what you guys think about it? Do you have more information, maybe you know how the JYP audition process works?  
  
I am actually pretty annoyed by all that contradictory and often false information on all those profile pages. Like I noticed a lot of 'fun facts about Sana' just come from Sana's old twitter. Like on September 10th 2010 when she was 13 she tweeted: ""Thunder is so scary"". And now on profile pages it says: Fun Fact: Sana is scared of thunder. Same for ""Sana likes yoghurt"".    
Or when it comes to contradictory facts this one is a good example. On some sites it says Sana was born in ""Tennji-ku, Osaka, Japan in the small village of Guri."" This doesn't make sense, since Tennji is one of the wards of Osaka and one of the most densely populated places in the world, it's for example home of Japan's highest building. I also couldn't find any place called Guri in the region. It's also a pain to find the real source of such a piece of information.      
    
I would really like if we could build some fact based member profiles on the wiki of this sub. With proper sources of all the information. I work in academic research and for me any claim which is not backed up with a proper source is basically worthless information.   
    
I would also love to hear if you guys found more widely spread 'facts' which are actually BS or nothing but rumors.  ",11,37

&amp;#x200B;

So Japanese names are weird in a way that they have more than one reading, which makes knowing how to read it difficult because sometimes different pronunciation of the same character change the meaning.

Momo's name's written in Hiragana, so that's fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Sana's name is "" ,"" where   can be read as ""sa"" in Kan'on, but the readings of  are ""ge,"" ""ka,"" and ""natsu.""

Mina's name is just the character for ""south:"" , but the readings for  are ""nan,"" ""dan,"" ""na,"" and ""minami.""

IMO: Nayeon usually has many lines because her voice is high pitched and it is not hard for her to reach higher levels because of this, also this is why she has the first line, because her voice is smooth.this is why i belive the best of her when she is behind another smooth voice like mina's in likey, or before a strong voice like jihyo's. That's why she is getting fewer lines, because everyone is improving and occupating spots where before only she could use.

This is an example, i really like this subject but hardly see anyone taking technically about the use of their voices:c",17,45

No Sana No Life

Your just too beautiful

You light me with your presence

Just like the sun does the sky

You so bright even at night

Like the moon light

Your face is a work of art

No Sana No Life

I get excited when watching you

I just want to listen to you 

Because I'm at my happiest when I see you

What is it that you got

It's something, I just want to hold 

And never let go

No Sana No Life

Where you think your going

Don't go too far, or stay too long

Because when your gone

It's like a piece of my heart is gone

[Spris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO5dxPBfPAU) - I think this commercial perfectly embodies Twice and their team dynamic. It made me all emotional and soft the first time and seen it and it still does.

[First Pocari Sweat CF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRu-Ehf4EyM) - While there are many good Pocari sweat CFs like the winter one and their latest summer one, their first one really stood out to me as the most memorable and impactful.

* Do you have a favorite Japanese MV? What makes it your favorite?
*  Do you have a favorite Japanese B-side? What makes it your favorite?
* How well do you think Twice manages their time between Korean and Japanese promotions?
* Would you say Twices Japanese sound is distinct from their Korean sound? What sets these two sounds apart?
* Do you think it was a logical choice for Twice to branch out specifically into the Japanese audience? Why or why not?

This is dedicated to 

 

Tzuyu a 16 year old girl who was put in as a filler just to replace a dropout from SIXTEEN.

Tzuyu someone that was given only seconds of screen time in SIXTEEN at the beginning.

Tzuyu someone that people started to notice even in the limited screen-time she got.

Tzuyu someone who was almost a write-off from SIXTEEN. Since she was a filler and was not destined to debut at first as TWICE.

Tzuyu who got popular everywhere Taiwan, Korea everywhere.

Tzuyu who captivated audience with her performance.

Tzuyu someone became so popular that she was indispensable.

Tzuyu the member who had one of the most haters even before debut.

Tzuyu who haters said she is only popular since Chinese cheated even though evidence is against it.

Tzuyu who haters said is only popular because of her beauty.

Tzuyu who in episode 7 of SIXTEEN showed she had substance inside also.

Tzuyu someone who said she rather be known for her skills rather than her beauty.

Tzuyu someone who was attacked by Cnetz for holding a flag that was given to her.

Tzuyu who was caught in fight between Ch and Taiwan.

Tzuyu who was threatened by physical attacks to her if she appears in public ever, still she appeared.

Tzuyu whose face was cut from most broadcasts and CFs and lost CF due to something that was not even her fault.

Tzuyu who had to apologize for something that was not even her fault.

Tzuyu who must have felt pain for being targeted, not only her but also TWICE and JYP and South Korea and Taiwan.

Tzuyu who was used as a pawn for progression of political agenda.

Tzuyu who in spite of all that had the courage to smile.

Tzuyu in spite of all that was and is the shoulder to cry on for her unnies.

Tzuyu someone who is a rock but also warm and soft.

Tzuyu someone who never gives up and always works hard to prove every hater wrong.

Tzuyu someone who Nayeon said along with Momo is the role model of the group.

Tzuyu someone who tries to handle everything herself before even troubling others.

Tzuyu someone who can't ever convey her emotions correctly because she is lost in translation, or she just can't.

Tzuyu someone who overflows with emotion but cant convey properly.

Tzuyu someone who is the least understood.

Tzuyu someone who trended all across Japan for appearing 2 seconds on TV and saying ""Hai"".(proving haters wrong yet again)

Tzuyu whose constant improvements is almost unbelievably impressive.

Tzuyu who doesn't act any different just to please someone else.

Tzuyu who haters say has a boring personality.

Tzuyu who has an extremely genuine personality which doesn't change for others entertainment.

Tzuyu someone who always gives it her best at all times.

Tzuyu who must be so happy of TWICE's growth but has yet to perform in her Home.

Tzuyu someone who must have at least wished to perform in front of her home crowd. But cant.

Tzuyu someone who is still attacked by haters outside and inside the ONCE fandom.

Tzuyu who wears affordable clothes despite being rich.

Tzuyu who continuously improves and even though she has achieved every goal she has ever said in every interview but still wants to improve.

Tzuyu who depsite being younger than me has taught me more than I thought possible.

Tzuyu who always says hard work never betrays.

Watching Be as One made me think Tzuyu might also have a dream of performing in Taiwan. That happens or not, I want Tzuyu to be happy and healthy for ever and always. I am happy that I found out about Tzuyu even if it is as late as it is. Treasure the baby that is Tzuyu who is also mature at the same time. I love you and will support you always.",11,137

217,2018-9-12,2018,9,12,15,9f5bwo,Be as ONE Voices and Video,TDarkAngel,1536734080,"After ugly crying for about 15 minutes I could finally start thinking again.
I really liked this one, the voices are managed in a soft tone as expected from a ""thank you"" song, nothing went out of the ordinary at first glance. But 

Let me mention first what i think Dahyun did well. GODAMN EVERYTHING. This slow paced song fits her well, her voice has this particular intonation that, softly sung,feels like i can touch her emotions. An example of this may be that she was the one that had to sing the las part of Good Night, but was changed for Sana because she couldn't stop laughing. The way she sang her parts and how well she transitions from other members voices (more later) really surprised me.

I want to say mina and JG but...well...their voices are made for this so, because I believe they took the spotlight, will just say that MINA OMFG YOU ARE SO GOOD and the power of JG voice made their voices the pillars of this song.

Momo needed more parts, the song wasn't tha thigh pitched and her voice could've been present in more parts.

Even tough JH is my ultimate extreme bias (XD) I wouldn't be mad if she had less lines, same for NY. They both used their parts at its fullest, dont get me wrong, the high pitched voice of NY and the power and control of JH gave a lot ofpersonality to the song, but Maby some lines should have been handed to other members. I have this problem with the delivery of the Be as ONE line, sorry NY stans if you disagree, i dont want to be rude :c but I feel other members could have done better. Even tough I really cried because of the song.

I feel the transition between each voice is perfect, the Dahyun-tzuyu/JG was one of my favourites with the softness of DH to the spowerfull but sweet tones of TZ and JG and then transitioning to the calm and sweet momo/sana to then, in the final verses hitting us with the power of god (JH) was just absolutely devastating for my heart.

I love how they used JH to be the change of rythm when in the second part it goes from JG (instead of mina) to JH (intead of NY) and then she lowers the intensity to start with the dH(soft)-TZ(strong and the high note)-and then JH(powerfull) to again spike in intensity and slap us in the face to give the bridge queen my heart and my tears because she gave intensity even in her soft voice and gave the final part to NY AND JH, perfection.

The images are great, for  me the TT in the tokyo tower made me cry back then and now it does it again. I'm sure everyone has good memories of the group and this song is perfect to remember that we are all part of this fandom even if the images are from Japan, it has this oportunity to shoow great moments off each member and make us smile, and it does it in a way hardly any song can compare. I like this more than one in a million.

If you differ with anything of want to add something, please tell me, i want to hear the voice of all of us. Thanks

P.S. I like every song on this album. This is just how I would rank them. 

1. L.O.V.E - I can't quite explain it, but this song just ""wow-ed"" me more than any of the others.  

2. Be as ONE - I have the (from what seems to be relatively unpopular) opinion that this is better than One in a Million. 

3. BDZ - My favorite of the Japanese title tracks that Twice has put out. Its just... fun.

4. Candy Pop - More like Candy BOP amirite? 

5. Wishing - The obligatory acoustic song, gives me some Melting/Someone Like Me vibes and I dig that.

6. I Want You Back - I know this is hit or miss with people but I really love this. I think it's a mixture of their English singing plus the fact that I love Jackson 5.

7. Wake Me Up - I liked this WAY more on my second listen. 

8. One More Time - The MV for this is the only thing that pushes it ahead of Brand New Girl. Otherwise I would place them at the same spot.

9. Brand New Girl - The song is catchy and cute, which is pretty par for the course with Twice. My 12 year old sister adores this song.

10. Say It Again - Really the only song that, while really good, kind of underwhelmed me. I'm sure as I listen to it more I'll begin to have more appreciation for it. ",12,25

299,2018-9-16,2018,9,16,8,9g5v7r,What happens after TT?,Glissando365,1537052943,"I've been streaming TT again as we approach 400M and it's reminded me how open-ended the MV ending is. 

What happens to kids at the end of the video? Do Twice ever escape the house? I know Knock Knock was supposed to be the follow up but it ended up being mostly a prequel for showing how Twice's spirits became locked in the haunted house. We still don't know for sure who was knocking (those slowass knocks are definitely not those of nine panicked girls), if the kids answer the door, or what happens after the door is opened. 

Are there any fan theories (personal or widely accepted) out there as to how it ends? 

Personally, the main ballroom in What is Love reminds me of the main room in TT, so I've headcannoned that KK Twice get back into the house after the knocking, but such a significant amount of time has passed (just look at how the house degraded), the girls cannot rejoin with their spirits aka TT Twice. They can't leave without their spirits obviously so they're still stuck in the house. In WIL though, TT Twice spirits have taken to impersonating characters on TV, and that's why Twice all obsess over the TV: because that's the only way they can pretend to live their lives. 

There's still a lot of holes in that theory though so I'm wondering what other Once think?",19,45

What's your favorite part about this track? For me, it's the production. Black Eyed Pilseung definitely knew what they were doing when making this track. The chord progression, instrumentation, and general feel of the song all fit Twice really well, and Twice's vocals and visuals bring this track to new heights.

 What's your favorite part about this track? For me, it's how Twice used TT to slingshot themselves to extreme success. Twice was already popular after Cheer Up, and to continue this momentum, they had to release a catchy and unforgettable follow up track. They definitely accomplished that goal with TT, and it's one of my favorite tracks in all of music to this day.

326,2018-9-17,2018,9,17,17,9giiji,Twice Korean MV views in the past 3 months,PolarizedLenses,1537172472,"In celebration of TT reaching 400 million views on Youtube, I wanted to show what I've been working on for the past three months. Every couple of days, I would record the number of Youtube views each MV would have on a spreadsheet. The data was occasionally taken straight from Youtube, but I would mainly get the numbers from [the Twice Kworb page.](https://kworb.net/youtube/artist/twice.html) I do this not only because I am obsessed with Twice, but because I LOVE visualizing data. (Shout out to r/dataisbeautiful)

[Imgur link to the main graph.](https://imgur.com/dZHqd4w)

Provided it only takes five minutes to update the spreadsheet, I plan on doing this for at least a year. Unless another big milestone is reached before then (such as Candy Pop reaching 100M), I'm planning on doing another post like this once I have six months of data.

*As an aside, I live in UTC-8 aka US Pacific Time. The days I report may be off from other sources by a day.*

Although I can track on a day-by-day(ish) basis, Kworb can easily supply weekly and monthly numbers since the videos were released. [Here is a graph of views since the release of Like OOH-AHH.](https://imgur.com/WwiD2VB)

These are the average daily views for each MV in certain time spans.

Song | Past 6 days | Past 15 days | Past month
----|-----------|------------|----------
Dance the Night Away | 647,992 | 637,758 | 610,015
TT | 628,721 | 490,545 | 397,099
Likey | 468,001 | 401,876 | 351,488
What is Love? | 456,292 | 411,490 | 394,184
Heart Shaker | 234,968 | 225,460 | 230,937
Like OOH-AHH | 219,637 | 198,471 | 186,735
Cheer Up | 216,271 | 189,375 | 165,576
Signal | 140,791 | 122,874 | 110,625
Knock Knock | 112,766 | 116,949 | 115,740
Merry &amp; Happy | 17,223 | 15,407 | 15,937

Clearly there has been a drastic increase in the daily views as TT approached 400M. [Here is a graph of the views for TT alone.](https://imgur.com/nNbFbSF) The line is a linear regression of the data which helps smooth out the weekly fluctuations. From this model, I have long approximated the date that TT would reach 400M as 20 Sep 2018 (which was the estimate Kworb and many others were saying). As you can see, there was a very sharp increase in the past couple of days. **Do you attribute this increase to these dedicated Once streamers? But if they really have been streaming for at least longer than the past week, why can't we see significant increases over the whole past 3 months?** ([Also look at the graph of views since LOA;](https://imgur.com/WwiD2VB) one could argue that there is *some* increase in views since July 2018 i.e. streamers have been doing it since *right before* I started taking the data.)

Although reaching 400M is an amazing milestone, there have been many other interesting events that have happened in the past 3 months.

Date | Event
----|-----
27-6-18 | Heart Shaker surpasses Knock Knock as Twice's 5th most viewed MV
11-7-18 | Heart Shaker reaches 200M views (achieved in 212 days)
5-8-18 | Like surpasses Cheer Up as Twice's 2nd most viewed MV
5-8-18 | ALSO Knock Knock reaches 200M views (achieved in 532 days)
22-8-18 | What is Love? surpasses Signal as Twice's 7th most viewed MV
6-9-18 | Dance the Night Away reaches 100M views (achieved in 59 days)
15-9-18 | Likey reaches 300M views, their second MV to do so (achieved in 320 days)
16-9-18 | TT reaches 400M views (achieved in 693 days)

Likey is Twice's second most-viewed MV, a title which was long held by Cheer Up. Many (myself included) believe that Cheer Up was their hit that catapulted them as a top-tier girl group. But the popularity of Likey is undeniable. **Which song do you think has had a bigger impact on Twice's popularity? Which song do you like more?**

Here is one strange observation. Other than Dance the Night Away and What is Love?, each MV has a good linear approximation within this 3 month time frame. The one notable exception is Like OOH-AHH. [Here is a graph of the views for Like OOH-AHH.](https://imgur.com/iHkEcMT) Trend lines are given to data before 29 July and after. This is about a month after the release of Dance the Night Away and two weeks before the release of BDZ. The change in rate can also be seen [in the graph since LOA](https://imgur.com/WwiD2VB). **What do you think is the cause of this increase?**


I'm not one compare the success of one group to another, but I did want to give comparisons between Twice and Blackpink because maybe some of you would like to have that information. (Aside: I also really like Blackpink; the vocal and obnoxious portion of Blinks should not be taken as representative of the entire fandom) [Here is a graph of views with three Blackpink songs included.](https://imgur.com/aoqcEbo) I noticed Boombayah got an odd, sharp increase in view rate for the months of June and July but it has since seemed to go away. This is probably due to the release of DDU-DU DDU-DU.

[Here is a link to the imgur album containing all graphs mentioned in this post.](https://imgur.com/a/JtDiW4c) I have bolded all the questions, and honestly would like some discussion about what I brought up. But, be free to discuss anything else that may be relevant to any of the information I have compiled.

With the release of this album, we have a better sense of the direction in which Twice wants to head with their sound regarding production for a Japanese audience. With the context of the album as a whole, lets look back at Twices other Japanese releases.

The songs on this album that have MVs are: [BDZ](https://youtu.be/CMNahhgR_ss), [One More Time](https://youtu.be/HuoOEry-Yc4), [Candy Pop](https://youtu.be/wQ_POfToaVY), [Wake Me Up](https://youtu.be/DdLYSziSXII), [Brand New Girl](https://youtu.be/r1CMjQ0QJ1E), and [I Want You Back](https://youtu.be/X3H-4crGD6k).

Here, you can share Twice content and media from these eras or just discuss them in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* Do you have a favorite Japanese MV? What makes it your favorite?
* Do you have a favorite Japanese B-side? What makes it your favorite?
* How well do you think Twice manages their time between Korean and Japanese promotions?
* Would you say Twices Japanese sound is distinct from their Korean sound? What sets these two sounds apart?
* Do you think it was a logical choice for Twice to branch out specifically into the Japanese audience? Why or why not?

For Twice's first week sales of their Japanese discography, BDZ ranks [second to last](https://twitter.com/TWICE_Charts/status/1041630601063931904).  This may be due to the fact that BDZ is more expensive than the singles (ex. [3000 yen for BDZ](https://web.archive.org/web/20180917134335/http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/WPCL-12914), [1204 yen for Wake Me Up](https://web.archive.org/web/20180917134432/http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/WPCL-12871)).

1. Candy Pop  271,612 (Single)
2. Wake Me Up  269,464 (Single)
3. One More Time  205,595 (Single)
4. BDZ  181,003 (Album)
5. #TWICE  136,157 (Album)

&amp;nbsp;

**Going gold, poising for platinum**

Because the BDZ album sold more than 100,000 copies, it is [eligible to receive a gold certification](http://www.riaj.or.jp/f/data/cert/gd.html) from the Recording Industry Association of Japan.  What's more is that it was [reported earlier this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/9ffgsm/bdz_album_has_264000_preorders_aims_for_platinum/) that the album had 264,000 pre-orders, which could lead it to be eligible for an RIAJ platinum certification (250,000 albums sold).  A platinum certification for BDZ would make it Twice's sixth Japanese release to receive the award.

I was wondering what else is in their fitness/diet routine? My GF and I are trying to get healthier, and since we both enjoy Twice... we are looking for any motivation we can get. :)  
 We are still new to the fandom so I figured I would call upon the knowledgable people to help us out. Any interviews, videos, etc to help us out that would be awesome. :)

AS A NOTE: This is just my opinion. If someone in your top 5 doesnt appear in mine, theres no hate. I dont dislike any of the girls, nor you, even if they dont appear in this list. The downside to having a Top 5 when there are 9 girls means some of them have to be left out. I'd love to hear yours too &lt;3

**Songs:** 

1. Ho!
2. Heart Shaker
3. L.O.V.E
4. Turtle
5. Likey

**Choreos:**

1. What Is Love?
2. Like Ooh-Ahh
3. Likey
4. TT
5. Cheer Up

**Dancers:**

1. Momo
2. Mina
3. Sana (I honestly think Sana is actually better than Mina more often than not at the group choreography, but not nearly as good in general, if that makes sense)
4. Tzuyu
5. Jihyo (Similar, I think that Jihyo's highs can put her in top 3, but she's rather inconsistent and overall sits below Tzuyu, who is much more consistent)

**Singers:**

1. Jihyo
2. Nayeon
3. Jeongyeon
4. Mina
5. Tzuyu

**Rappers:**

1. Chaeyoung
2. Dahyun
3. Momo
4. Nayeon

(Honestly I cant remember another one of the members that has rapped  maybe Sana?)

**Visuals:**

1. Tzuyu
2. Sana
3. Nayeon
4. Jihyo
5. Momo (Im biased here please dont hate me)

**Biases:**

1. Momo (My ultimate K-Pop bias)
2. Tzuyu
3. Nayeon
4. Mina
5. Chaeyoung

**Ships:**

1. SaiDa  Sana/Dahyun (Really who doesnt have this as #1?)
2. NaMo  Nayeon/Momo
3. MiTzu  Mina/Tzuyu
4. 2Yeon  Nayeon/Jeongyeon
5. SaMo  Sana/Momo (Almost exclusively for the Vlive where someone said they looked like a couple and the two of them went on about it for several minutes).",33,38

We always thought that its unlikely JYP would let Twice tour outside of asia, given the financial risk, but with day6, i think this debunks it.

Twice is more popular than day6 by quite a margin, so if JYP managed to give day6 a world tour, there's no doubt Twice will get one too.",19,16

**Track List**

1. BDZ
1. One More Time
1. Candy Pop
1. L.O.V.E
1. Wishing
1. Say It Again
1. Wake Me Up
1. Brand New Girl
1. Be As One
1. I Want You Back

---

Of the new tracks, I'd probably rank them:

Say it again &gt; LOVE &gt; BDZ &gt; Be as One &gt; Wishing

I'll talk about just the first two.

**Say It Again** was my favorite on first listen, and still is. The chorus sold me right away. I found it interesting that people were putting it at [the top of their list or at the bottom](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/9fi53g/twice_bdz_songs_ranked_opinion/). Maybe it's the sound - I think it's bordering on electropop (though I wish they had gone harder on the bass). I don't think it's one they can sing live comfortably, so I'm hoping for some sweet remixes out of this track. 

**L.O.V.E** is just a fun song. Nice marching beat, twangy (piano?) sound, and infectious chorus. I find myself thinking out 'L-O-V-E soda-wap, 24/7 pumping heart' more often than I'd care to admit.",8,24

What are the chances she is going to become the future CEO or Private Ditector of JYPE? I know other artists like JinYoung from Got7 expressed their interest to handle JYP in the future too, and now with JYP having a baby but that will be a while.


I think Jihyo is the most qualified, especially with how long she's been loyal to the company, and I'd imagine after 10 years after Twice's successful run, I'd think she's going to be in a perfect position to have a high position in JYPE if ever she decides to quit the idol life.",18,6

476,2018-9-24,2018,9,24,21,9ihff3,180924 TWICE Throwback Thread,qwertsqwert,1537791524," In todays thread, well reminisce on Twices journey leading up to now. Each week well look back at what Twice was like as a group and how they have evolved over time.

Happy birthday Nayeon!! As the oldest in the group, there is a special charm about her that has helped Twice as a whole develop into who they are today.

Here, you can share Nayeon content and media or just discuss Nayeon in general! And here are some discussion questions if you dont know where to start:

* Whats your favorite Nayeon moment?
* What elements of Nayeons personality have helped to make Twice what they are today?
* If Nayeon is your bias, what about her convinced you to make her your bias? If she is not, has she ever bias wrecked you?

490,2018-9-25,2018,9,25,22,9is68s,"My review of every TWICE album, track by track!",yungixa,1537882561,"Feel free to do your own version in the comments! Gonna briefly go over every TWICE release, though the only JP album I'll be looking at is BDZ. The following is my opinion and my opinion alone, feel free to disagree.

I will be using repackages as the final version for the albums, so for example I'll be rating Summer Nights rather than WIL. 

* **THE STORY BEGINS**

1. **Like OOH-AHH** - Solid track overall, somewhat overly sugary but as a first title track I can't really knock it. 

2. **Do it again** - This songs fucking wild. The beat's really weird and the vocal performance from the members is pretty off kilter.

3. **Going Crazy** - Everyone likes this song; the beat's good, the lyrics are decent, it's catchy and has one of the best outro's out of TWICE's discography. 

4. **Truth** - Bit of an odd track. Mina shines on this one, though the mixing feels off

5. **Candy Boy** - Don't ever want to hear this again. Seems like it's going for the same vibe as Do it again but without like, any of the polish. Rap break is pretty good but other than that this song is pretty awful.

6. **Like a fool** - Nice closer, pretty basic song structure but the performances are good enough and it has enough charm to stay interesting. 

6/10 

FAV TRACKS: Going Crazy, Like OOH-AHH, Do it again 

LEAST FAV TRACK: Candy Boy

* **PAGE TWO**

1. **CHEER UP** - The verses are really nice but the chorus on this song is way overblown. Vocals in the chorus are off and the pronunciation of ""cheer"" is a tad awkward (though that's not really the members fault). Decent track. 

2. **Precious Love** - Has a nice enough beat but it veers off into mediocrity about a minute in. The song is just too long and it changes so little, it's kind of nauseating 

3. **Touchdown** - Love this song! Hard to explain why I like the counting down part of this so much but I do. 

4. **Tuk Tok** - Mixed well, the chorus is catchy, the funky beat is killer and every member shines. Hard to knock this song 

5. **Woohoo** - Nice follow up to the previous two tracks, continues the funk feeling the album had going nicely. 

6. **Headphones on** - The sparse beat and the bass-line is actually really nice. Chaeyoung kills the rap break 

7/10 

FAV TRACKS: Woohoo, Touchdown, Headphones on, Tuk Tok 

LEAST FAV TRACK: Precious Love 

* **TWICEcoaster : LANE 2 **

1. **KNOCK KNOCK** - Used to dislike this song but it's grown real hard. The ""knock knock on my door"" is a tad repetitive but the rest of the chorus and the unique verses propel this song up the list. 

2. **Ice Cream** - Soft and sultry. The little beat changes and tempo switch ups throughout the song give it a nice kick as well. 

3. **TT** - Honestly up there as the GOAT Twice song. Woozy, addictive instrumental, catchy chorus and standout verses (Chaeyoung and Mina especially) create a beautifully atmospheric track

4. **1 TO 10** - Synth leads are reminiscent of TT, but the drum pattern and claps give it more kick, even though the song itself is relatively slow. Solid track

5. **PONYTAIL** - I.. what? This album had a sound going for a second, until the guitars kicked in on this. Not really complaining, since the track is pretty nice, and the song structure is interesting. Just not sure why it's on this album, would've fit much better on PAGE TWO

6. **Jelly Jelly** - There's a lot of pep to this thing. Has hints of PONYTAIL in the instrumentation, but at the same time has the sound of the rest of the album. Pretty decent across the board. Lyrics are pretty dumb but I can ignore that. Chaeyoung delivers once again 

7. **PIT-A-PAT** - It won't leave my head. It's so good. That pre chorus gives me life

8. **NEXT PAGE** - This song changes sound like 5 times in the first half alone, but at the same time stays pretty cohesive. Pretty excellent, Tzuyu in particular sounds amazing

9. **ONE IN A MILLION** - You gotta be in the right mood for this song given it's a ballad, but as a track to go to sleep too it's real nice. Jeongyeon kills it 

9/10

FAV TRACKS - TT, 1 TO 10, NEXT PAGE, PIT-A-PAT, KNOCK KNOCK, ICE CREAM, ONE IN A MILLION 

LEAST FAV TRACK - JELLY JELLY

* **SIGNAL**

1. **SIGNAL** - It's hard to call TWICE title tracks bad, because they're decently catchy, and so is this track, but overall it's pretty awful. The beat drones on and on and even Dahyun couldn't save it with her rap break. The chorus is nauseating 

2. **THREE TIMES A DAY** - Bob Marley is shaking. The beat is so good, the flows the girls use and the lyrics make this one of TWICE's best B-sides of all time. The fake-out before the actual chorus is amazing. 

3. **ONLY YOU** - The song starts great to begin with and then the way it flows into the rap break... fuck yeah. Could argue that the song is a bit same-y but it's too captivating for that really to be an issue

4. **HOLD MY TIGHT** - Poppy and cute. If you think TWICE, this is probably the type of sound you'd think of. That is until Jeongyeon waltzes in and crushes that chorus holy shit. Signal proving that only listening to TWICE title tracks is a disservice to ones self 

5. **EYE EYE EYES** - Rhythmically interesting, the beat is shrill and fast paced, and Nayeon does a great Nayeon chorus as usual. Not a lot to complain about here. 

6. **SOMEONE LIKE ME** - Slow and refreshing for this album. The reverb laced ad-libs and the soft cadence used throughout create a very pillowy vibe that I like a lot. 

8/10 

FAV TRACKS: THREE TIMES A DAY, ONLY YOU, EYE EYE EYES, HOLD ME TIGHT, SOMEONE LIKE ME 

LEAST FAV TRACK: SIGNAL 

* **MERRY AND HAPPY**

1. **Heart Shaker** - Bubbly and catchy. Sung with a lot of passion and the rap line inserts throughout the song add character. 

2. **Merry &amp; Happy** - A bit too ""this is a Christmas song"" for my tastes, but it's sweet enough. 

3. **LIKEY** - That bass-line and those synths tho. This is probably TWICE at their catchiest, with Sana's colourful chorus and the greatest rap break out of every TWICE period. Dubu dab reigns supreme

4. **TURTLE** - Easy on the ears, summery beat, and cutesy lyrics. Reminds me a lot of THREE TIMES A DAY in a way, with the easygoing flow

5. **MISSING U** - It's alright. The chorus is great but the verses are pretty bland and lack of lot of the signature TWICE character. 

6. **WOW** - Oh my god. The way the phrases are extended in the pre-chorus, the changing, funky glitch-pop beat and stuttered vocals are all so, so good. 

7. **FFW** - Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't. Depends on the mood, sometimes the song can get a little un-interesting. Chorus is the highlight though. Also, ""I see the future in your eyes"" LMAO

8. **DING DONG** - What the hell is going on. The opening of this song is so weird but the verses match the chorus about half-way through, making it really enjoyable to listen too. 

9. **24/7** - Not sure why Chaeyoung wants the girls to get 'em up, but I'm pretty sure they can't do that. The song has this synth that doesn't resolve for like 30 seconds which is really annoying, but aside from that the performance is really nice. 

10. **LOOK AT ME** - The beat is as sexy as Sana. Sounds like a trap-infused Perfume, and rap line kills it as usual. 

11. **ROLLIN'** - 90's grooves and tight flows, quickly interrupted by a swelling Perfume-style chorus about 45 seconds in. What the fuck? There's like, no warning for when the synths start swelling but it oddly works?

12. **LOVE LINE** - Autotune adds a nice touch to this track. Chorus is a completely different vibe to what the first verse suggests though, which seems to be a theme across this whole album.

13. **DON'T GIVE UP** - Sounds like a Chainsmokers song, but with an actual soul. The effects on the vocals is a bit awkward and the chorus while a nice change of pace leads a bit to be desired. Rap line never miss. 

14. **YOU IN MY HEART** - Sounds like the end credits to an anime. Continuously builds throughout the track and the chorus has a lot of passion in it. A stand out on this album 

15. **JALJAYO GOOD NIGHT** - Sleepy! Not as much heart as ONE IN A MILLION but it does the job for what it is 

8/10 

FAV TRACKS: Heart Shaker, LIKEY, WOW, TURTLE, DING DONG, 24/7, LOOK AT ME, ROLLIN', YOU IN MY HEART, LOOK AT ME 

LEAST FAV TRACK: MERRY &amp; HAPPY

* **SUMMER NIGHTS**

1. **Dance The Night Away** - It's alright. Was nice the first couple listens but it's gotten a little stale, the beat just isn't that interesting and the brass is very tinny. Dahyun's part is cute and Momo has nice a nice verse. 

2. **CHILLAX** - Didn't like this as much as everyone else did at first but it's grown on me. Hard to deny the ""chill and relax"" refrain and the simple beat. 

3. **Shot thru the heart** - Best new song on this re-package, keeps you moving throughout with the drum pattern and J-Pop like synths. 

4. **What is Love?** - I wanna know! Dahyun and Chaeng have a great rap break here, and the charismatic chorus and emotionally driven verses make this a top 3 title track. 

5. **SWEET TALKER** - A little uninteresting and the repetition really hurts on this one. Feels like a Walmart brand HO!. 

6. **HO!** - Jihyo does her thing over a funky beat. That is all.

7. **DEJA VU**  - Sounds like a stripped back Red Flavor. It's aight, picks up in the second half with these exciting drum patterns and that random ass dubstep drop. 

8. **SAY YES** - Slow TWICE is almost always a hit. Feels like you're at the beach, which is weird since this was also on the original What is Love album. 

9. **STUCK** - Up there with their best B-sides. That guitar and the emotional swell of the instrumental are so inspiring. The flows are super tight on this one as well. 

7/10 

FAV TRACKS: What is Love?, STUCK, HO!, SAY YES, Shot thru the heart

LEAST FAV TRACK: SWEET TALKER 

* **BDZ** 

1. BDZ - LIKE A BULLDOZEEERRRRR. Tzuyu goes off on this chorus. Super playful song, as good as their Korean releases. 

2. One More Time - Sugary J-Pop. A tad par for the course in the genre but it's pretty inoffensive. 

3. Candy Pop - This song annoys me, to put it simply. The chorus is disorienting and Nayeon is singing in way too high of a pitch. 

4. L.O.V.E - Somewhat glitchy, sounds like a Meg song. Can't knock it, has been growing on me lately with the charming chorus 

5. Wishing - Guitar on this song is great. The vocals feel a bit flat but they pick up at random points in the song, so it ends up pretty good 

6. Say it again - RAVE RAVE RAVE RAVE RAVE RAVE 

7. Wake Me Up - Feel like I'm the only person who actually likes this song, Mina kills it and the driving instrumental is sick 

8. BRAND NEW GIRL - Lyrics seem odd and the song is bog standard. Like it a lot more now than I did previously but it's still just okay. Maybe in the future I'll appreciate it more 

9. Be as ONE - Holds just as much emotional weight as ONE IN A MILLION, if not more so. Whoever produced this knows how to hit the heart strings. 

10. I WANT YOU BACK - While the lyrics are a bit hard to decipher sometimes, so much so at points that I'm questioning whether the lyrics I already know are actually the right ones, I can't knock it. It has way crisper production than the original Jackson 5 song and you can't help but move your feet. Really really love this track. 

6/10 

FAV TRACKS: BDZ, I WANT YOU BACK, Be as ONE, Say it again, Wake Me Up

LEAST FAV TRACK: Candy Pop

Some creative liberties were taken in best adapting the pop-punk percussive spirit of Jelly Jelly into piano, so accents and staccato are everywhere. Sorry about that. I included the vocal part for reference and, if you want, you can definitely swap out the piano right hand and play the vocal part instead if you want an easier time. Although it's not full-length, all the parts to play the full length song should be included, so just mix and match as necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

To help navigate, the sheet is structured as follows:

Chorus 1 (A), Verse/Pre-Chorus (B), Chorus 2 (C), Bridge (D).
