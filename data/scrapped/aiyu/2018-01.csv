We've had a few discussion posts, and there's more to follow. For now, I was thinking it would be great to have a little friendly competition. That means - ART CONTEST!

Now, before you write yourself off, ""Man I'm a horrible artist"" I use the term ""art"" quite liberally. What do you think is art? Could be a piano cover, a vocal cover, a meme, even! And of course traditional drawings or digital paintings of IU are also welcome. And yes, really, anything IU related is acceptable. So get your MS paint ready, start cutting out pictures of IU in photoshop, or pull out your dusty old art tablet.

The DEADLINE, and when the voting thread will be posted, is IN ONE MONTH.
The date will be February 23rd, 2/23/18.
I'll give it to you straight, the only prize you get for winning is my eternal admiration and that of the subreddit. I'd do a banner contest or something so we could admire everyone's work, but idk who the mods are and I'm too lazy to find out!

Myself, and the good folk of discord (Join here: https://discord.gg/zy3ycug) will be competing as well!

Above all, have fun and be open. Remember, anything from your worst memes, to poems, short stories, art, music covers, anything!

tl;dr 
Art competition, anything IU related is viable. Deadline is 2/23/18
Good luck!",0,6
