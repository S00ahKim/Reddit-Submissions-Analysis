I'll go first:

For starters, the book is essentially about a child who goes through suffering and finds comfort in a relationship with a tree. There is a lot more to it than that obviously, but the point is, Zeze is a very relatable character (hence the success of the book). Anyone who has ever experienced some form of suffering (aka everyone on earth) can relate in some way to Zeze's struggles. Even if they have never literally been beaten to within an inch of their life, they can still understand and relate to his struggles in the context of the difficulties they have experienced in their own lives.

A big part of the artistry in this song comes from the abstraction of Zeze's struggle to something very different and much less obviously challenging.

My hypothesis is:

    Zeze = IU, the Tree = Korean public/fans

I thought this was an interesting and fitting perspective for reading the lyrics. The song becomes a commentary on social expectations of young women in the kpop industry, or, more generally, the public eye.

 Some explanation of this view:

* The first verse sounds like adults enjoying watching a child play. Like a grandmother watching kids at the park. It has a very innocent and happy/calm feel to it. I think this verse could represent the initial fascination that the public had in IU in her early days as a young idol.
* ""Singing of colors and sights in your ticklish voice"" -- ticklish voice immediately brings IU to mind for me while colors and sights makes me think of an older person listening to a child who is still joyfully fascinated by the world.
* In the chorus we have the public inviting IU onto the path to fame where they will support her.
* ""Climb up the tree, take the youngest leaf, take the only flower"" -- The public offer her the chance to 'climb to the top' of the industry where they will support her and she will have access to the finer things in life.
* ""Don't fool around, don't hurt the tree, bad bad"" -- sounds like a metaphor for the negative effects idols face when caught up in things like dating 'scandals.' Of course, you could go more abstract with it and just say anything that the fans don't like, but considering this is IU I think the dating connection is probably relevant. 
* The second verse sounds like the public opinion of her starts to shift a little. She is still viewed as innocent and childlike, but people are starting to suspect that her innocence may be an act which hides her true self.
* ""You've got sunshine over your head, but the glimpse of your inside is covered in dark clouds""
* The second chorus in this context implies the willingness of the public to continue to support her, despite the doubts that have arisen. But, they again warn her ""don't hurt the tree.""
* The bridge gets interesting in that it sounds like the public have developed wild expectations and an infatuation for her. Every line in this part feels like it would come from a 'stan' who feels entitled to her attention. This mentality of 'I made you, now you owe me' from the public. She is now feeling controlled and restricted by her career and reliance on fans.
* ""I wait for you here every day, come get it all (take it x3)"" -- Overly devoted and entitled fans have become demanding and now are giving her orders on how to behave and how she should live her life. 
* The lyrics of the final chorus are the same, but the context is now different. She isn't a wide-eyed child anymore. She is an adult who wants to make her own decisions and live life her own way, but the fans are still pushing her toward the same old goal of innocence, purity and fame.


What I think is the coolest part of this possible interpretation is the fact that she is taking on the role of the public and sings to herself. There is just something very artistic and interesting in that to me.

Anway, I'd love to read other interpretations of this song and see what else we can find.

**Note1:** to me, people complaining about Zeze's *""sexualization""* sound like a kid walking by the [statue of david](http://www.enkivillage.com/s/upload/images/2014/11/95bc52306050233ce5694a3a58f98c10.jpg) and complaining about him not wearing pants...

From the drama The Producers, to Leon on Infinity Challenge, to the album CHAT-SHIRE. 2015s Woman of the Year is IU.**

Wah, its an honour! This year has been a really hectic year.

**How was it? Although its still a bit too early to look back at 2015.**

Those were the days. Thats what someone told me recently. I agree with that. Later on in life, when I look back at all this, Ill think to myself, Those were the days The age of 23 can be seen as the early or mid-twenties, but anyway, you could still insist that its the end of the early-twenties. It really seems like the end of the early-twenties. As a 23-year-old, I think this year was more special than usual. I get the feeling a lot that Im really alive. The things I did turned out well too.

**To be specific, when did you feel like youre alive?**

When Im imagining, coming up with ideas, drawing up plans, I feel the most excited. This year, since the start of the year I had ideas and plans about doing a drama and acting. At a good timing, I was casted for The Producers, which was well-received. Also, whenever I finish a project, I feel a sense of emptiness. Just when I was feeling that way, Infinity Challenge came along. It was a really hectic and busy period and I had a good time. Then I thought, Ah, at this rate, this year is going to just pass by, lets do a spurt at the last minute. So I released my CHAT-SHIRE album. Just like that, I had a fulfilling year. Ive never done anything I didnt want to. I feel much better now that Ive done the things I wanted to do.

**Do you feel that your acting is starting to change as well?**

Thats not something I felt while watching my recent dramas, but rather, when I look back at those I acted in previously, I think to myself, Wah, I was really inexperienced then. For The Producers, it was a drama crafted based on my own life story, so it turned out to be quite natural. They werent emotions that were totally foreign to me and there were parts that I went, Oh, I felt that way too. So it was interesting and there were many parts I could identify with. I felt great that I received a lot of compliments. I was really happy.

**During your promotions, youre filled with schedules then they empty out again, so I think youll keep having this feeling of emptiness. How do you deal with these ups and downs? Do you just let go entirely and leave it, or do you get out there and do something?**

When I feel empty, I quickly think of my next step. I dont think thats a good method, but its the easiest way to get out from that state.

**Why dont you think its a good method?**
 
Theres a reason for all kinds of emotions, right? I think we need to give ourselves some time to focus more and embrace those emotions. Being like I cant take this, I want to do another crazy schedule right away, in the end it wont be good for my health.

**You need enough time to digest those emotions too. Anyway, if you keep it all in, at some point in time, theyll come gushing to you all at once.**

That was the case for me last year. I released many online tracks, but didnt have any promotions. So I had a lot of alone time and a lot of time to reflect. All my feelings from promoting for the past 7 years came to me at once. I felt really empty and tired.

**How did you get over it then?**

I just spent it like that. I felt lost and since I didnt have schedules, I didnt have the chance to hint at the fact that IU is feeling really empty and gloomy right now. Fans who dont follow me very closely wouldnt have noticed. Compared to that, this year my blood was flowing really quickly and I was really excited. Thats why I felt this is the feeling of being alive.

**Through this album, I think we finally get to meet  (the real) IU. Many people say that, IU is singer with emotions more matured than her age right? If the Flower Bookmark allowed that side of you to be exposed, I think in the CHAT-SHIRE album, you were just being IU.**

Its probably since I wrote the lyrics right? Flower Bookmark was an album that I tried hard to understand the lyrics of classic songs and recorded them in my own voice. In this album, the words I wrote precede my voice, so I think it was much more realistic in giving people the feeling, So the girl called IU is this sort of girl.

**Does it feel different when you sing the songs you wrote the lyrics to?**

I dont think theres a big difference. When I write lyrics, I just write, but this is totally different from singing the song. Just because they are lyrics I wrote, it doesnt make the song easier to sing. Sometimes it makes the song harder instead. There are times when I wrote a line of something I really wanted to say, but the pronunciation makes it more difficult. During those moments, its difficult for me to come to a consensus with myself. If I change it to another sentence, its different from what Im thinking, so lets go ahead with this. Thats from the perspective of lyricist IU. But the singer IU feels this way. But the pronunciation here is awkward and it doesnt sound nice when you sing it out. Thats when I feel ambivalent.

**There are some lyrics I like. In Twenty-three, I never wrote even a single line of lies, as well as Can I be on the top of your head? The lyrics in Knees as well. Even if I lightly fall asleep from the touch of your hands / let me stay in that position for a moment / Ill sleep really deeply. The part joheun songil (touch of your hands) sounds really pleasant to the years. It seems like a song about forever not being able to return to the days that one felt harmless and secure.**

Its true that we cant return to those days. Even if you bring the person to you and lie on her lap now, its no longer like before. Those knees are not what is important, but those days, as you start to miss everything about it.

**Which period of time comes to your mind?**

Its about the days when I was really young. As Knees is a song about insomnia. A time when I didnt have to worry about not being able to fall asleep. Isnt falling asleep something natural? Just like the sun setting and moon appearing, a time when I didnt have to worry at all. Isnt that a time we want to return to? Being able to fall asleep the moment we close our eyes. I thought of my grandmas lap when I wrote this song. My grandma was beautiful and healthy and I could lie on her lap anytime, but I cant turn back time.

**Do you have sleepless nights?**

I do. But Ive gotten through them.

**Are you able to enjoy those nights?**

It would be a lie to go so far (as to say I enjoy those sleepless nights). 

**How many hours do you sleep a day?**

It differs a lot from day to day. On days that Im really tired, I just sleep. But usually, to fall asleep, I have to try hard to do so. It feels unfair that I have to try hard to go to sleep. Sleeping is something were born to be able to do. When were hungry, we eat, when were full we put down our spoon. I was born with this sort of basic human abilities. These are basic items I was born with. But as I grew up, like a fool, I seem to have lost these, my basic items. Usually you develop these basic items into real items in life, yet I even lose my basic items. Seeing myself trying hard to find those basic items for myself again, I seem like a fool and I feel frustrated. Thats a song I wrote on a day I felt really frustrated.

**Looking back, at the age of 23, I was struggling with and trying to find my own identity. How about I ask you What kind of person is 23-year-old IU? with a straight face?**

Everytime I get this question, I seem to answer it differently. To me, Im no different from any other person. Theres nothing special about me. Im not someone who holds steadfast to my values or beliefs in life. Depending on the situation, in the turn of a hand, Im the kind of person to turn everything inside out. Its hard to describe myself in a word. Since I might change in the next minute. Yes, Im this sort of person.

**Why do you think people keep saying that youre mature? To be rich with emotions and to be mature are two different things, but people tend to mix them up. If youre rich with emotions, your range of understanding is wider and its common to be described as mature. Have you ever felt curious about that?**

I just go, Ah, I see. I dont see myself as a mature person. Some parts of me are more developed than others, but some parts of me havent developed fully yet. Each of us are different in some ways, but when people go, oh, shes rather mature, thats because that part of me they have in mind is more developed. Thats what I think.

**Dont you get annoyed when people describe you as something youre not?**

It would be a lie if I say I dont feel that way at all, but graudally, I dont feel that way so much anymore. My way of thinking has changed. Could it be considered a misunderstanding? I mean, If the person sees me that way, then let it be. I listen to what people say at both extreme ends. I guess thats the same for other celebrities. Since theres only one of me and so many people perceiving me in different ways.

**Have you ever heard someone say such things to you directly (describing you as something youre not)?**

Someone told me that he/she likes me. Reason being Im clever in the way I behave. Because Im clever and shrewd. The person likes me because Im shrewd. Then someone else would say they like me. Reason being I dont think too deeply and just say what I think. Then someone would say they dont like me. Because Im shrewd and manipulative. Then someone else would say they dont like me because Im dumb. So actually theres no way for good and bad points to be in sync. I have no choice but to simply acknowledge that all of that seems to be me. If I want everyone to like me, how should I behave? Thats impossible, isnt it?

**Have you perhaps read your past interviews before?**

If I happen to come across past interviews, sometimes they feel really strange and unfamiliar to me. Oh, I thought that way? So Im always careful about what I say in interviews. Thats the way it was when it was recorded then, but a few days later, I might think completely differently. Leaving a record can be a scary thing.

**In 2010, you did an interview with GQ magazine at the age of 18. We asked you then, When do you feel at ease?**

Haha I dont remember.

**You replied then, Well, maybe if I go past the age of 20?**

Thats right! Haha. Thats really, ah, thats funny. Gosh, I said I would feel more at ease when I go past the age of 20? Gosh, I was such a kid.. Thats how I felt then. Wah.

**The last question was, Are you going to stick only to stage (performances)? and you replied then, Ah, I thought of something else. The dark blue sky when the sun sets and just before it turns completely dark. The night sky at around 8:30pm these days. When I see that, my heart opens widely. Thats how acoustic music feels to me too.**

Thats really similar. Im still like that.

**Wed like to ask you a bit more. What do you do to be able to have time for that? Because to be able to watch the sky at a time we like best, theres usually some effort required.**
 
These days, time flies without me knowing I think thats for the best. I have a stronger feeling of boredom than others. Im the kind thats desensitised to stimulation. Be it something dangerous, something physically dangerous too, Im not very sensitive to it. Even circumstances whereby its obvious Im going to get into an accident, or when Im going to get injured, the people around me would be really shocked, but I would be less shocked. So Ive never felt Thats super fun! I dont have any hobby either.

**Its unexpected that you dont have a hobby.**

Most of the time, the day feels really long to me. Gosh, I slept in and woke up at 1pm, Ive done this and that now, but its not even 3pm yet Ive often spent my days like that. But sometimes, without me knowing, a whole 6 hours can just pass by. I feel really good then. I really love times like that.

**What were you doing that time passed by so quickly?**

Usually when Im composing songs, time passes by so quickly. When Im focused, it seems time just passes by quickly. But theres not many things that I love doing as much as the level of focus I give them. I really dont havea hobby, haha. I thought I would have one as I grew older. I thought I would have one once I passed the age of 20, but I dont seem to have one.

**Isnt a hobby something you do to get rid of stress? Even things like going for walks.**

It doesnt really accumulate much though. I see it as both a positive and negative thing about me. It just vanishes right away. The bad, the good and my memories too.

**Do you still write in your diary? Daily?**

I started writing since my 2nd year in middle school, so its my 9th year I think? If I dont write in my diary, I feel really uncomfortable. Even if its one thing, I feel that I need to leave proof of my existence each day so that I can sleep peacefully. While writing my diary, I think without my knowing, I get rid of some of that stress too. I write about all sorts of stuff. I write about my dreams, I swear, and even doodle meaninglessly.

**Do you remember what you wrote about yesterday?**

Yesterday? I remember the one the day before yesterday, hold on. What did I write about? Um Hold on.

**Due to the Zeze controversy, theres been a lot of talk right? How do you feel seeing the many awful things they say and sometimes the deep and lengthy things they write?**

Lots of thoughts came to mind. I saw a lot and thought a lot as well. Theres always been criticism and swear words that are unrelated to the issue, so Ill leave that part aside, but I saw some posts that were amazingly logical. Within that, there were both criticisms and replies in defence. Seeing the discussions arising from this song, the many opinions about it and the topic of the discussion gradually widening in scope, honestly, I felt grateful. Amidst the noise judging me as a person, to the people who were calmly focusing on the issue at hand and politely voicing their thoughts about it, whether they were criticisms or replies in defence, no matter what, Im thankful for that. Thankful and startled and thought it was really cool. Being at the centre of it all, I was starting to feel a bit awkward/embarrassed. When interpreting a song, you dont want to come to a conclusion that that is correct and this is wrong. To me, my freedom is important, so to maintain that, I think I should allow others to have their freedom to interpret. Just like before I released the album, I still like this song. If someone doesnt like me as a person just because of the lyrics in Zeze, Ill wholly accept that. Since that persons interpretation and that persons feelings clearly exist. But its not good to draw conclusions about me being paedophilic. I think theres a need to separate ones interpretation of a song and their criticism towards a person.

**Arent you just like Zeze (in the story)? Based on what you said just now, as youre shrewd and clever, youre loved and hated, as youre insensitive and act before you think, youre loved and hated; the talk about 23-year-old IU seems to go back and forth.**
 
Some people feel that way, but some people feel, I dont know as well. No one has the right to tell someone else that their way of thinking is wrong, since you cant force anyone to interpret things in just one way. I cant impose or block my thoughts from others either. Thats what I think.

**When did we argue over the lyrics? We have fun dissecting the lyrics, whats supposed to mean what.**

I didnt expect myself to touch on this topic during todays interview. Thats something I keep struggling with. I keep talking to people too. Those whom I feel have always been right in their judgement, saying things like, Heres what I think, but if Im wrong, please tell me so.

**What kind of advice do they give you then?**

Like what I said, there are some people who would tell me what they think, while some would feel that anyway Im dealing with dangerous stuff. I keep thinking this way. If I do get the chance to talk about this, Ill entrust it to the freedom for interpretation. Since the freedom for interpretation is important to the person and to me as well.

**No matter what you say, youll have antis. Since therell always be misunderstandings.**

Leaving behind the talk about liking me, disliking me, liking the song, disliking the song, this is the right way to think, thats the wrong way to think, there have been people who were hurt by the topic itself this time. To those people, rather than explaining my intentions and the parts they misunderstood, I would just like to apologise.

**Its tiring right?**

Strength is something like this to me. When you want it, you dont have it and when you dont want it, you have it again. We just need to live on no matter what. So I dont worry too much about lacking strength. When I have strength, anyway the state of being strong is more tiring. But when you lack strength, theres nothing youre able to do. Some people say it cant be helped if you lack the strength, but if you have a lot of strength and its not the kind of strength you want, youll be in even more agony. 

**If someone were to give you a gift of 5 days?**

No matter how I spend it, 5 days wont mean much.

**Then how would you spend it?**

I want to fall into a deep sleep.

**Throughout the 5 days?**
 
A really deep sleep. When I wake up, Ill go, Uwah, my mind is clear and I feel so energetic like Im reborn! I think it would be great to go into a deep sleep for 5 days.

**Ill ask you again then, how was 2015 for you?**

Good times when I reflect back. They really were.
