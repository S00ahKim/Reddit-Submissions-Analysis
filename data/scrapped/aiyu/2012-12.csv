10,2012-12-22,2012,12,22,14,159nxt,Favorite IU Live Performances?,6months23days,1356153370,"I've been watching some of IU's live performances lately and can't get enough. :)  Especially ones with no backing vocals and her guitar/live bands, really lets her voice shine. Two of my favorites:

[IU - Don't like her, Remocon (2012.10.17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSPhzjSSAyo)

[IU - I'd Do It All Again, KBS Sketchbook (2011.03.11)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV5TwP-Sgwc)

Doesn't hurt that they're recorded so well either. Now if only she would perform some of her lesser know songs. (4am, A Stray Puppy etc.)

Have any in particular you like? Or any that were really impressive?",7,18
