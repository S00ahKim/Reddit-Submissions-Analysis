Found it on Amazon Japan, but no english subtitles and probably can't ship to US.

There are two versions on YesAsia(Set 1), (Set 2), not sure what the difference is. Both are $240 so I don't think it's split.

Is there somewhere else I can try? I've already bought a DVD set from a local store, nowhere around here carries blu-ray.

Thanks for any help!",0,1
