3,2014-9-18,2014,9,18,2,2gobpb,IU acted in bedevilled 2010?!?!?!,lelonglelong,1410973396,"This morning i googled iu and under Movies and TV shows was a movie titled 'Bedevilled 2010'. WHAT. IU APPEARED IN A MOVIE AND I DIDNT WATCH IT? AND HOW IS IT THAT I ONLY KNOW ABOUT THIS NOW. This cannot be. Well the movie poster itself was questionable but i was like, heck it. google cant be wrong.... right? So like any other uaena, i watched the movie. Halfway through there was no appearance of IU and no indication of such. On top of that, the movie wasn't the kind of movie an idol will star in. So i skipped to the credits and realised there is a child actress in the show named Lee Jieun. ahhhh. it all made sense now. it was quite a good movie so i finished it. is there any way of correcting google of this mistake?

tldr: google thinks that child actress named Lee Jieun in 'Bedevilled 2010' is IU. anyway to correct google?",2,0
