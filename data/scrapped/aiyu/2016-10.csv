18,2016-10-29,2016,10,29,22,5a0dpd,/r/Aiyu subreddit changes!,zephr0x,1477746802,"Hello everyone,

As of 29/10/16 i'm officialy a mod of /r/aiyu.
being on this subreddit regularly it felt really outdated and not as active as it potentially can be.

So i decide to request for mod and make this sub active again! I already changed the subreddit look and i hope you will like it as it is something completely different from what it was..
Also any feedback will be appreciated!

So now going to the real thing...

To make this sub active again i need so suggestions what you all want. now its all over the place and random. Personally i was thinking about making theme weeks ( fancam week, Picture week, cover week etc....) maybe even do it per day so each day will be posted with something? Please do comment bellow for any suggestions ideas anyhing is welcome. On another note i can do some daily/weekly post if you guys want.

Also be free to post anything IU updates on so twitter instagram or just a small news item just to get things going.

If you have any questions please comment below or join the discord chat https://discord.gg/HHRpEdC",6,24
