As you guys probably have some idea of, the K-Pop song contest voting is already underway, and looking at the brackets, VERY EARLY competition to IU is present even in this first and second round:

1st Round:

IU vs Hello Venus, BEAST, Ailee and Secret

2nd Round:

IU vs 2x SNSD and 2x PSY

While I do not doubt that IU can win in the 1st Round, getting a win vs SNSD is the best chance for IU to progress to later rounds, especially given that SNSD's songs are their stronger ones. Every End of the Day just deserves to go down to Gangnam Style; while Mia, well, it depends if it wins against Fiction.

Before anyone accuses me of starting crazy conspiracy theories about ""plagiarism"" (lol), let me say that I'm not. I just thought it was interesting is all. Here's a side by side comparison:
