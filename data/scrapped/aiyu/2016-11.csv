Hello everyone, I recently suggested to start theme weeks so we can bring this sub more life!

-----

**What exactly does this mean?** 

In short, 

every week we will have a different theme to post. Every subscriber to this sub can submit their theme related content. After 14 days we will check the most upvoted post from that week and that user gets 1 point on the leaderboard. Altough you can't really win something i'm sure that it will be fun and useful for the subreddit and maybe even for your IU collection!

**Theme week starts every 2 weeks on Sunday**

I will make a new post after the 7 days with the anouncement of the new theme , also it will then provide the winner of the week and the leaderboard standings.

*Note: all other content may still be posted and is approved, only the post that will meet the requirements will be be used for the theme week*

-------------------------
list for now:

**Picture week** (favourite IU picture) ~~[7/11/16 to 14/11/16]~~

**Video week** (favourite IU video: varietyshow cuts, dramacuts, practice video etc..)

**Gif week** (favourite  IU Gif)

**Performance week** (favourite performance video | no fancam  )

**cover week** ( favourite Cover done by IU or her songs covered)

**Fancam week** (favourite fancam)

**MV week** (favourite Music Video)

**side track week** (favourite non title track song)

The tracks i'm wondering are:

Sorry if I sound dumb, but I'd really appreciate the help :)

this can can be anything from old songs, covers, remix, acoustic, or dance.
However no fancams as we have a special theme week for that.

So just to be clear make sure its not a recording by a fan it needs to be legit camera production.!
