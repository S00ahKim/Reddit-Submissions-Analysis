Original Caption Trans ""Firstly, please excuse me for uploading this post all of a sudden. The dogs: Chams and Tun-Tun of a close brother of mine are currently missing. Coming from the heart of a present dog owner, as well as having experiences of owning a dog back when I was little, it dosent sit well in my heart, hence ive figured that I must find a way to help him out. I will have this post up until the dogs have successfully been found. Id greatly appreciate anyone who would kindly let me know if you happen to chance upon or have any information about them. I apologise once again for asking such a favour from you.""

Revised Caption Trans ""Teunteun, on the left, is currently found and Chams is still missing. Please share the post so that more people can see. I will delete the post when it's found.""
&gt;The post with the original caption was deleted and replaced with the linked post. They both are the same picture, they just have different captions.

Picture Translation ""Charms (French Bulldog) Tun-Tun (Beagle Mix) 
Place last seen : Sinsa Riverside Hotel (Seoul) 
Date and Time : 2nd July 2017 (Around 9pm~12AM) 
Im currently looking for them. If you have any informatiom regarding the dogs or have seen them, please contact me at 010-9058-9342 
Please do not tear down this leaflet until the dogs have been found. 
I kindly ask this favour from you.""

Yixing made a Weibo post encouraging people to [help out](https://twitter.com/XingPark/status/881489411027984386). One day after that, the Hunan Youth League (which he is a promotional ambassador for) posted on its official Weibo account that Yixing donated 100K RMB via their Foundation with the online bank transfer receipt.

Baekhyun's long hair also provided a new look for him that was not limited to hair color changes. Note: I have been listening to their music for years but only recently have I really 'stalked' them so I'm not sure if they have tried different/weird hairstyles before.

Successfully promoting something means embracing the whole concept of it and I think the pictures they've showed us so far didn't fail in doing so. The clothes matched with the hair, the colors that were used felt right for the setting, etc.

Also, they're idols! I'm sure they can rock anything! From dreads to long hair, even mohawk or buzz cut. Supporting the decision of their managers or their hairstylists means supporting EXO as well.

But IDK I'm just a guy who likes music.

~~(Totally unrelated to EXO but) Why Does The Title Automatically Capitalize The First Letter Of Every Word?~~ Edit: It's a trick! Thanks u/Turquoise-Turmoil for clarifying that :)

Author Description:

&gt; Oh Semi is sent into FBI witness protection after filming a crime of notorious gang leader Luhan, but it hasnt stopped said boss from tracking her across countries to prevent her from testifying against him.  After the latest and most terrifying assassination attempt, Seoul PD suggests an arranged marriage between Semi and jailed gangster Xiumin, Lu Han's blood brother, as a last resort.

&gt; Apparently family are off-limits in the Blood Brother Code.  It would mean Luhan cant kill her.

If you are new to EXO but ESPECIALLY new to kpop, you're going to need this list.  And for the old farts like myself: if I forget or misrepresent a term, please remind me and I'll add it here:

* *Kpop*: also spelled k-pop, short for Korean pop music
* *Stan*: a combination of ""stalk"" and ""fan.""  It's basically used as noun like ""fan"" and verb like ""following.""  EX: I stan EXO.  I am an EXO stan. [More Info on stan word history]( https://www.bustle.com/articles/94986-what-does-stan-mean-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slang-term)
* *Bias*: your favorite group or person.  EX: My bias is Kai.
* *Era*: refers to the timeframe of a group's album and its promotions.  Each era is usually named after the promotional single or the album name.  EX: This EX'ACT era has barely begun and we already have so many new fandom jokes thanks to EXOmentary.
* *Line*: Refers to a group of people that have the same role/position in the band, or similar interests, styles, traits, etc.  One person can be in multiple lines.  In EXO, ""official"" Lines are Dancer-Line (Lay, Kai, &amp; Sehun, &amp; sometimes Xiu is included), Vocal-Line (Baek, Chen, Soo, &amp; SuhoLayXiu are sometimes included [would Kai be in it now too?]), and Rapper-Line (Yeol, Sehun, &amp; XiuKai are sometimes included).  There's also the unofficial ones: ""Kim Bros"" Line (XiuSuhoChenKai, for all having the same surname Kim), ""Beagle Line"" (BaekChenYeol, all born in '92 and are known as the loudest members), ""Chingu Line"" (Beagles plus Soo, since in Korean Culture they would all be same age/class grade), ""Maknae Line"" (now just KaiSehun, but used to include Tao; the youngest members)
* *Leader*: position in which someone leads the group.  Usually acts as the liaison between group members and management, speaks on behalf of the group, looks after members, etc.  In EXO, Suho used to be leader of EXO-K and Kris was EXO-M's leader, but since Kris's departure Suho is now the leader of the entire group.
* *Visual*: usually the ""face"" of the group, the one management wants to to recognize as representing the group's main appeals.  Think like what Justin Timberlake was for NSYNC.  Visuals are usually promoted first and with emphasis.  Since EXO is a performance based group, in the beginning Kai was the visual of EXO-K (because of his dancing and unique looks), and Luhan used to be the visual for EXO-M (same reasons).  Now, Kai is visual for entire group.
* *Maknae*: literally means ""youngest.""  Sehun is the maknae of EXO overall and EXO-K.  Tao used to be maknae of EXO-M.
* *Aegyo*: basically means ""cuteness.""  When requesting someone to do aegyo, it means they want a person to act adorable.
* *OT12, OT11, OT10, OT9*: refers to the number of members, or to the time when they were that number of members. For EXO, OT12 is the original 12 man line up.  OT11 refers to the group when Kris left.  OT10 was the group post-Luhan.  OT9 is after Tao left, and is the current official member tally. EX: It's so great seeing OT9 perform with no injuries!
* *EXO-L*: the official fanclub name, but it's also used to refer to someone who loves/follows EXO. EX: I am an EXO-L.
* *EXOtic*: the term EXO fans referred to themselves as before the official fanclub EXO-L was formed.  EX: I've been in this fandom so long I called myself an EXOtic!
* *Aeris/Eris*: a cute way of pronouncing L, from ""EXO-L."" Term coined for EXO-L and used mostly by Baekhyun.

##The Group EXO

EXO (short for ""exoplanet"") was originally founded in 2011, but formally debuted to the public with their EP (mini album) and promotional track MAMA on April 8, 2012.  Their original concept was aliens from another world (YEP YOU DIDN'T MISREAD THAT), who were guardians of the Tree of Life (I AM DEAD SERIOUS).  Each member has his own symbol and superpower associated with them (I AM NOT EVEN KIDDING AT ALL), and the ""MAMA"" lore has evolved and updates itself with each new comeback, leading to many fan theories and questions on the greater EXO story (WE ARE TRASH AND WE ACCEPT THIS).  

IRL, the group originally consisted of 12 members split into two subgroups meant to promote in different countries and languages: EXO-K (short for Korean) in South Korea, and EXO-M (short for Mandarin) in China.  Consisting of 8 Korean members and 4 Chinese members, at first this seems impossible to learn who is who, seeing as how there are so many of them.  But don't worry: you may start today as ""They look like clones, this is impossible!"", but one day you will be like *sees very blurry image of a member's hand* ""OMG Baekhyun, MUST YOUR HANDS BE SO BEAUTIFUL???""

Three members (Kris, Luhan, &amp; Tao) permanently left the group, filing lawsuits against EXO's management company SM Entertainment and are currently promoting solo activities in China.  Nine members remain since June 2015, and promote together for EXO activities, especially album releases.  As of the beginning of this month, EXO-K and M subgroups do not exist anymore, since now all nine members sing and perform in both Korean and Chinese.

##Our Subreddit /r/EXO aka RULES

**If you are only going to be COMMENTING**, the main thing you need to know is our sub's [General Code of Conduct](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_general_code_of_conduct), which is essentially summed up as don't be a dick.  Also, we are an OT12 forum, meaning no hating on any member, past or present.  Criticism is fine (dislike of someones actions), but hating (dislike of the person themselves) will earn you a ban.  If you are only here for one member, awesome, that's great!  Bring more attention and love for that member.  However, don't put down someone else to make your own bias shine.

**If you are going to be POSTING**, there's a bit more involved...

##Where to Buy the Album

Mind you, you can buy an physical album from numerous retailers, but only the ones listed below guarantee that the sale will count towards the Korean Gaon/Hanteo Charts, which factor into the relevant Korean awards and records:

* [YesAsia](http://www.yesasia.com/us/1060861261-0-0-0-en/list.html)
* [KpopTown](http://kpoptown.com/539-cd-dvd)
* [kpopmart](http://kpopmart.com/category.php?id_category=157)
* [KTown4U](http://www.ktown4u.com/eventsub?eve_no=22933&amp;biz_no=228#)
* [Korean Mall](https://koreanmall.com/app/planning/views/268/458)
* [Kpop Plus](http://kpopplus.com/32_exo)

If you wish to buy digitally from retailers based outside South Korea (like iTunes &amp; Google Play), your purchase will NOT count towards the Korean Gaon/Hanteo charts, only your country's charts ([Source](https://onehallyu.com/topic/330894-does-buying-page-two-on-itunes-count-to-sales/)).  You should be able to digitally buy (and stream) from a SK based one and have it count towards Gaon/Hanteo, but most of these distributors are in Korean, no English websites.  This is the main reason why most i-fans buy a physical instead of digital, especially during comeback season.  Digital retailers listed below that count towards the Gaon/Hanteo (all Korean):

* [Bugs](http://music.bugs.co.kr/artist/80155940?wl_ref=list_tr_10_search)
* [Melon](http://www.melon.com/search/total/index.htm?q=EXO&amp;section=&amp;searchGnbYn=Y&amp;ipath=srch_form)

##Why Lay Isnt Promoting with EXO (&amp; Why its Not Lays or SMs Fault)

Im only adding this section because even now after many weeks, there still seems to be a ton of misinformation all over the web on why Lay isnt in this comeback, and people blaming Lay and SM for it.  To be fair, a lot of this is nuanced and only obvious if ones paying attention to international news beyond kpop. To set the record straight, heres all the info we know and what we can accurately infer from observing the powers that be.  Special thanks to L-ia &amp; Lay stans on EXOcord for the write up.

&gt; **LAY'S SITUATION**: As we all know, Lay is unable to take part in EXO's upcoming comeback. Official statements have told us he is unable to take part because of his Chinese schedules, but political tensions between China and Korea over THAAD have severely limited his Korean activities since February.

&gt; **WHAT IS THAAD?**: THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, is an anti-missile system intended to protect South Korea from North Korea. China states it opposes THAAD due to its ability to track and spy the Chinese military.

&gt; **HOW DOES THIS AFFECT LAY?**: Unfortunately, it means he's stuck between in a rock and a hard place. If he promotes with EXO in Korea, he angers his Chinese fans, is seen as a traitor to his home by the Chinese general public, and his career in China would be nonexistent. This also will greatly affect EXO's career in China if he is labeled this way. If he promotes solo in China, EXO fans see him as a traitor to EXO.

&gt; **HOW COME NCT'S/SEVENTEEN'S/etc CHINA LINE ARE ABLE TO PROMOTE IN KOREA?**: Lay has a significant foothold in the Chinese market that SM has been trying to break into for years, and in addition to that he currently holds an ambassador position from his home province. Other idols simply do not have the status that Lay has in China. Additionally, SM wants him promoting in China if he cant be with EXO in SK (because SM gains a percentage of all his studios profits).

&gt; **BUT I SAW LAY IN KOREA FOR 2 DAYS**: Yes, he was in Korea in late June, during which it was announced that he would not participate in the comeback. We assume that he had attended meetings with SM on how to proceed with his schedules in the light of THAAD. SM can't foresee when political tensions will fade, so this decision had to be made.

I hope that clears up the major confusion surrounding all of this.  With all of that said, if anyone starts asking again about Lay, or accusing him of being disloyal or leaving EXO without any good evidence, I advise you all to direct that person to this post (which will stay stickied on the sub for the next several weeks).  I understand why many people would be nervous and scared about Lays future with EXO, since some of this seems to look like what happened right before Tao left.  

Please keep an eye open on the bigger picture: SK has an Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to protect themselves in defense of an attack from North Korea.  China feels that it challenges their interests in the area.  As a part of their South Korean boycott to enact economic pressure on SK, they enacted a Hallyu ban on SK. And while the new SK president is against THAAD it is a delicate political situation involving not just South Korea, but several major world powers (China, the United States of America, Russia, Japan), so at this time we just need to be patient.

OKAY, I think I hit everything important.  We are as ready for comeback as we can be which is not at all HAHAHA! ^hold ^^me

&gt;NOTE:

&gt;  is a common emoticon to express shock/surprise, its supposedly resembles a facial expression. 

&gt;The Korean term   (abbrev  in short for As expected (note the first consonant) 

&gt;EXOs hangul name also begins with  :  (note the first consonant) 

&gt; is the hangul equivalent of the sound L in english, hence  would mean EXO-L!

206,2017-7-24,2017,7,24,1,6p27fz,Casual Convo #127 + an Encore of A Newbies' Guide to EXO &amp; our Subreddit!,anigym6,1500827274,"**HELLO EVERYBODY!**

For all the new subscribers coming in for The War/Ko Ko Bop comeback, WELCOME TO /r/EXO!  We are so excited for you all to be here and freaking out about our favorite boys in kpop!  

Some of you may be longtime kpop/EXO stans just discovering our corner of Reddit.  Some of you may have no idea what ""stan"" even is cause you are completely new to kpop and EXO.  Either way, this post is a general overview of Kpop, EXO, and our subreddit.

##Kpop/EXO General Terminology

If you are new to EXO but ESPECIALLY new to kpop, you're going to need this list.  And for the old farts like myself: if I forget or misrepresent a term, please remind me and I'll add it here:

* *Kpop*: also spelled k-pop, short for Korean pop music
* *Stan*: a combination of ""stalk"" and ""fan.""  It's basically used as noun like ""fan"" and verb like ""following.""  EX: I stan EXO.  I am an EXO stan. [More Info on stan word history]( https://www.bustle.com/articles/94986-what-does-stan-mean-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slang-term)
* *Bias*: your favorite group or person.  EX: My bias is Kai.
* *Era*: refers to the timeframe of a group's album and its promotions.  Each era is usually named after the promotional single or the album name.  EX: This EX'ACT era has barely begun and we already have so many new fandom jokes thanks to EXOmentary.
* *Line*: Refers to a group of people that have the same role/position in the band, or similar interests, styles, traits, etc.  One person can be in multiple lines.  In EXO, ""official"" Lines are Dancer-Line (Lay, Kai, &amp; Sehun, &amp; sometimes Xiu is included), Vocal-Line (Baek, Chen, Soo, &amp; SuhoLayXiu are sometimes included [would Kai be in it now too?]), and Rapper-Line (Yeol, Sehun, &amp; XiuKai are sometimes included).  There's also the unofficial ones: ""Kim Bros"" Line (XiuSuhoChenKai, for all having the same surname Kim), ""Beagle Line"" (BaekChenYeol, all born in '92 and are known as the loudest members), ""Chingu Line"" (Beagles plus Soo, since in Korean Culture they would all be same age/class grade), ""Maknae Line"" (now just KaiSehun, but used to include Tao; the youngest members)
* *Leader*: position in which someone leads the group.  Usually acts as the liaison between group members and management, speaks on behalf of the group, looks after members, etc.  In EXO, Suho used to be leader of EXO-K and Kris was EXO-M's leader, but since Kris's departure Suho is now the leader of the entire group.
* *Visual*: usually the ""face"" of the group, the one management wants to to recognize as representing the group's main appeals.  Think like what Justin Timberlake was for NSYNC.  Visuals are usually promoted first and with emphasis.  Since EXO is a performance based group, in the beginning Kai was the visual of EXO-K (because of his dancing and unique looks), and Luhan used to be the visual for EXO-M (same reasons).  Now, Kai is visual for entire group.
* *Maknae*: literally means ""youngest.""  Sehun is the maknae of EXO overall and EXO-K.  Tao used to be maknae of EXO-M.
* *Aegyo*: basically means ""cuteness.""  When requesting someone to do aegyo, it means they want a person to act adorable.
* *OT12, OT11, OT10, OT9*: refers to the number of members, or to the time when they were that number of members. For EXO, OT12 is the original 12 man line up.  OT11 refers to the group when Kris left.  OT10 was the group post-Luhan.  OT9 is after Tao left, and is the current official member tally. EX: It's so great seeing OT9 perform with no injuries!
* *EXO-L*: the official fanclub name, but it's also used to refer to someone who loves/follows EXO. EX: I am an EXO-L.
* *EXOtic*: the term EXO fans referred to themselves as before the official fanclub EXO-L was formed.  EX: I've been in this fandom so long I called myself an EXOtic!
* *Aeris/Eris*: a cute way of pronouncing L, from ""EXO-L."" Term coined for EXO-L and used mostly by Baekhyun.

##The Group EXO

EXO (short for ""exoplanet"") was originally founded in 2011, but formally debuted to the public with their EP (mini album) and promotional track MAMA on April 8, 2012.  Their original concept was aliens from another world (YEP YOU DIDN'T MISREAD THAT), who were guardians of the Tree of Life (I AM DEAD SERIOUS).  Each member has his own symbol and superpower associated with them (I AM NOT EVEN KIDDING AT ALL), and the ""MAMA"" lore has evolved and updates itself with each new comeback, leading to many fan theories and questions on the greater EXO story (WE ARE TRASH AND WE ACCEPT THIS).  

IRL, the group originally consisted of 12 members split into two subgroups meant to promote in different countries and languages: EXO-K (short for Korean) in South Korea, and EXO-M (short for Mandarin) in China.  Consisting of 8 Korean members and 4 Chinese members, at first this seems impossible to learn who is who, seeing as how there are so many of them.  But don't worry: you may start today as ""They look like clones, this is impossible!"", but one day you will be like *sees very blurry image of a member's hand* ""OMG Baekhyun, MUST YOUR HANDS BE SO BEAUTIFUL???""

Please click on a name below to read more in depth information about each member like birth names, group position, age, personalities, fandom jokes/shenanigans, etc:

Three members (Kris, Luhan, &amp; Tao) permanently left the group, filing lawsuits against EXO's management company SM Entertainment and are currently promoting solo activities in China.  Nine members remain since June 2015, and promote together for EXO activities, especially album releases.  As of the beginning of this month, EXO-K and M subgroups do not exist anymore, since now all nine members sing and perform in both Korean and Chinese.

Now that's just the basics of the group.  Want to read, watch, and listen to more?  Below are some handy links to get a better understanding of who EXO is.  Links below are ALWAYS listed in the sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section, and in our WIKI (linked in the main header navigation):

###[Discography](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/discography)

EXO's entire musical body of work.  Contains all group, subgroup, subunit, OST, collab, and solo music work ever done by any EXO member, and official links to listen and purchase.

###[Video Starter Kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/starter-kit)

The bread and butter of every EXO-L, this is /r/EXO's MUST WATCH video list if you want to get to know the boys and be in on fandom inside jokes.  Contains all EXO Music Videos, EXO's Showtime (their 12 episode reality show, and easiest way to learn who is who), two Weekly Idol episodes (Korean talk show for idols), and four Happy Camp episodes (Chinese talk/game show for celebrities).

###[Extended Video Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/videos)

Constantly being updated by the mods, this is for those who need more after the Starter Kit.  While it doesn't contain EVERY EXO video ever, it certainly has hours upon hours of content ranging from MVs &amp; Teasers, Live Performances, Variety shows, Radio shows, Interview, Acting/Dramas, Commercials/Advertisements, and Photoshoots.  If you see a broken link or know of something not on the list and you have English subbed video links, please message the mods so we may add it!

###[EXO's Extended Schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/schedule)

Pretty self-explanatory, me thinks.

##Our Subreddit /r/EXO aka RULES

**If you are only going to be COMMENTING**, the main thing you need to know is our sub's [General Code of Conduct](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_general_code_of_conduct), which is essentially summed up as be respectful and remember that you are talking to other people around the world.  Also, we are an OT12 forum, meaning no hating on any member, past or present.  Criticism is fine (dislike of someones actions), but hating (dislike of the person themselves) will earn you a ban.  If you are only here for one member, awesome, that's great!  Bring more attention and love for that member.  However, don't put down someone else to make your own bias shine.

**If you are going to be POSTING**, there's a bit more involved...

Read the full, elaborated rules [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules).  Failure to follow our rules leads to mod messages, post/comment removal, and in the worst-case scenario you getting banned.  The summary of the rules is below, which is ALWAYS listed in our sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section.

NOTE: IF AT ANY POINT YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE RULES, INFORMATION, OR NEED CLARIFICATION, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MESSAGE THE MODS!  We are always happy to help you figure this sub out.  We know it's not easy for first timers and we'd rather you message us before you post/comment than after:  

* Only post content related to or about EXO, both current and former members.  If you are posting about anything else besides that, it goes in our weekly Casual Conversation threads.
* Old/past videos, pictures, etc (For Life era &amp; older) goes ONLY into either Throwback Thursday threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* Fanworks (fanart, fan videos/edits, fanfiction, fan music/dance covers, memes, crack, etc) goes ONLY into either Fandom Friday threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* Buying, selling, and/or trading merch goes ONLY into Galaxy Bazaar threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* [Follow our post title guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_post_title_formats).  Failure to do so leads to your post being removed and a mod messaging you on how to format correctly.  You are welcome to repost with correct titling.  
* [Use link flairs to tag your posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_post_flairs).  The mods will message you to remind you if it's not flaired.  If your post is not flaired within the first 24 hours we will remove it.  If your second unflaired post is not flaired in the next 12 hours, it will be removed.  After that, the mods will just remove your unflaired posts on sight.
* Do not spam, troll, or solicit.  We work on a 3 strike system for breaking this rule.  First two offenses earn you mod message warnings; third earns a permanent ban.
* No hating current or former members.  Depending on the severity of the offense, this can get you a warning or a ban.

ONCE AGAIN: IF AT ANY POINT YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE ABOVE RULES, INFORMATION, OR NEED CLARIFICATION, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MESSAGE THE MODS!  We are always happy to help you out!

Promos for ""Ko Ko Bop!"" continues!  We have 4 wins so far!  

**Quick Titling Change**

If a performance has flashing lights we would like post titles to have """" in the [PERFORMANCE/] as a heads up in case someone is sensitive to it. You can add the info about the lights as a comment too if you forget to add it in the title!  We had this request from subscribers and would like to make everyone comfortable!
