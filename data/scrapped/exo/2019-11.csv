0,2019-11-1,2019,11,1,11,dpy3p8,how will exo's future look like &amp; to all D.O stans: acting or exo or a solo album or all of that?,boxqlilac,1572574848,"exo:

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think it's likely that exo will go the path similar to SUJU stick together as best as possible? Or do you think someone will leave like it happened to SNSD/Infinite/B1A4 etc to pursue acting or a solo career/just leave sm.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ask this question because for me as D.O stan I think his choices depend on exo's path and exo's future .. TL;DR: I don't know if I even want them to continue releasing albums/touring year after year.. They've been doing this for years.. I want the boys to rest and do what they couldn't do due to their busy idol lifestyle... I mean i am excited to see new content soon, I guess they should make the best of it as long as the contract is going..? \*no offense\*..Also it depends on how their songs will do in the future. But so far I guess they actually have good chances to even advance into the US market if maybe still in the future they'll have the chance to collaborate with a western artist.. But then there's the enlistment...so maybe no?

&amp;#x200B;

D.O:

I admire how he endured it for many years to do both acting and singing and I wonder if it's good if he will continue to do both..I don't want to spread rumors..but some fans have said on other sites that they think he might be tired of the idol life..which he actually stated himself in jyp party people..and sometimes watching exo, I think as ""a veteran idol"" one might feel tired and not interested in doing aegyo and all the stuff that rookie idols all must do... Following d.o since overdose era, I think one day it's just enough..

&amp;#x200B;

But seeing how exo will all enlist one by one, I think as a group they may not be too busy so D.O could peacefully continue acting and stay with exo.. I don't doubt though that he might one day think about joining an acting company.. But I believe in exo's strong friendship and considering their past, I can't imagine D.O leaving exo/sm one day? But we never know.. It surely would make me sad... 

&amp;#x200B;

And then there's his talent in singing..I think his vocals have so much more potential.. Hearing him belting out sorts of notes and singing exo songs in a different way at concert videos, even seeing him rapping in one song makes me think he could easily also choose a solo career and release some rnb album and do music like dean/zion t/crush or am I too bold to say that?

&amp;#x200B;

In the end I think he wouldn't want to quit acting..his potential now after swing kids and 100 days prince is just too strong and too wasteful to not to continue pursuing..

&amp;#x200B;

I just want our dear kyungsoo to be able to live a quieter life away from the busy idol life and be more of himself which I think as I saw from behind the scene videos he really can do as actor rather as idol...

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean after the military he could:

&amp;#x200B;

1) continue as before and maybe HOPEFULLY one day soon release a solo album on the side just like baekhyun and chen...

&amp;#x200B;

Or 

&amp;#x200B;

2) if the exo contract expires... I don't know I wouldn't doubt as I said that he actually would only choose acting in the end but.. We all don't wanna lose OT8... With exo I don't think it's only business relations like some kpop groups proved to be(???) ... A fans perception might be far away from reality though I guess..",20,3

And i pray that does not happen to exo or anyone unless they are guilty. But I really want to know this. And i know we all are waiting for the exo comeback and i dont know want to kill all your happy bubble.You guys know the recent happening in monsta x wonho and shownu. They are being bought out into the public for their mistakes. Wonho for his past and debt and shownu for his affair with a married woman without his knowledge of her being married. And the girl han so hee is the one giving juicy informations. I didnt even know this girl but later i came to know she has dragged many idols....all male idols. From popular boy groups. And exo is at the top of the chain . And this was before the monsta x comeback too. Will this girl pull this kind of stunt with exo too?? Is she able too?? More importantly does any exo member have any past?? Or even if she did, will exo be strong enough to withstand it?? I know exo had scandals before, but those are dating and members leaving which are completely on the innocent side. I just watched a kpop channel kermy talking about this and i realised quite how dangerous she is. She knows all the inside information and somehow like i said is always targeting boy groups.  Not that she should target girl groups. By the way i am neither defending nor attacking wonho and shownu. I dont bias monstax , so i dont know them. So what do you guys think??",12,0

In the last round, you voted out your least fave stages from each concert series. Now you must vote for your faves for each series from what is left\~ Good luck!

**How to Play:**

1. If you haven't seen EXO's concerts, it's time for you to cancel all your plans this week &amp; weekend and watch them!
2. When you watch, keep in mind the stages you think were the best, brought the most energy and just blew you away! Don't just think of it as ""Oh, I love this song so its automatically my fave stage!"", watch ALL the stages because a lot of the time EXO Stages can change your outlook on the song, especially where its placed in the concert!
3. Go vote out those stages you listed from above! I am being extra nice this week and giving you a full week to answer this round because I know its more effort to rewatch (or watch for the first time!). ***You have until next Tuesday, November 19 to vote!***
4. Come back NEXT Tuesday to see what r/EXO's top songs for EACH concert is!

Because I am EXTRA EXTRA EXTRA nice, I will link you the concerts here below for you to rewatch ;)

Ps. EXO Planet #5 was not included in this as the tour is not complete, nor are there are any DVD version's out here that are accessible to everyone - so it wouldn't be fair to ask people to vote on a concert that they most likely haven't seen :)

**Please only vote once, this is just a game, it is all for fun, there are no true answers here.**

[Dancing King with Yoo Jaesuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EiNsoTc9kk)! It's just so fun and the beat and art of the video really just get me so excited and happy it's such a great mood picker upper!

And then another super great song is [Drop That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CfyWokByn8)! How can you not just jump when they're just yelling out ""JUMP JUMP JUMP"" and jumping around the stage too and all the rock guitar??? Yes PLEASE???

To commemorate our favourite long-legged idol, here are some of the things Chanyeol has done in the last year\~



I first want to congratulate him on his new studio [NNG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR4vlBiZ4Ua8Uzm9z91Qn1g)! He is always super proud of all his babies and we know how much of his heart he puts into all his projects, so please support him!

I love that Chanyeol was able to go out with [Dynamic Duo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw5d1csgy7I) and perform at a club without any worries. His happiness absolutely shines through!

Chanyeols amazing Vogue 'Holding Sunshine' Volumes [one](https://imgur.com/a/y89Cl09) and [two](https://imgur.com/a/zli6veA) (my personal favourites)

When Chanyeol went to the Tommy Hilfiger event and looked like the [cutest baby ever](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/6a/18/196a18e6362c2a95d55164ca8b3aa25b.jpg) dressed up in a blue jean jacket and blue jeans. When he went to Prada's [SS19 event](https://media.cleo.com.sg/2019/04/chanyeol-prada-singapore-interview-3.jpg) in Singapore. His [airport](https://66.media.tumblr.com/29f34547770cf5a89b8b760aac117148/tumblr_pqo86iPExt1riav2to1_1280.jpg) fashion and how he looked when he showed up at Versace's brand event in Hong Kong was [stunning](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8DtZUYVsAEd37J?format=jpg&amp;name=small) ([and adorable](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5W6LgvXoAcd6EV?format=jpg&amp;name=small)!)  
Of course Prada can't let him go, inviting him to their [pop up shop](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EJpiUkOXYAI-WbG?format=jpg&amp;name=small) and throwing us super cute [finger hearts](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EJZmckkWoAAnZrC?format=jpg&amp;name=small)\~

Chanyeol was also chosen to be the face of the perfume brand 'Acqua Di Parma' for their perfume 'Mirto Di Panarea' and her he is looking all sorts of [handsome](https://twitter.com/EXOGlobal/status/1194517094299140096?s=20) at their SIGNATURE of the SUN VIP PARTY - Acqua Di Parma Fansign Event!

Last but not least I want to quickly congratulate Chanyeol on winning 'Most Popular Male Singer' and 'Most Popular Overseas Singer'at the 2019 Tencent Music Entertainment Awards 2019!



Happy birthday Chanyeol! I hope this year has been great for you and wishing you continuous success and health!

# About Song Showdown

Every week for the next little bit we will be revisiting all of the EXO members discographies in a showdown to discover [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO/)'s Top 5 songs for each Solo, Subunit and Full Group. Every Tuesday we will be voting out our LEAST fave songs and on Fridays we will be voting for our faves.

If you have any suggestions on new games, or rounds that would work for Song Showdown, please let me know below\~

# Ko Ko Bop vs. Power Results

This was a tough one for me in particular, because I felt like I loved how much EXO enjoyed performing Power more but I think the choreo for KKB is ""technically"" better. Lets see what you all thought.... 

|QUESTION|1st Place|2nd Place|
|:-|:-|:-|
| Which title track is your fave?|Ko Ko Bop (70%)|Power (30%)|
|Which music video did you enjoy more?|Power (52%)|Ko Ko Bop (48%)|
|Which song has better Choreography?|Ko Ko Bop (74%)|Power (26%)|
|Which title track is overall stronger?|Ko Ko Bop (74%)|Power (26%)|

# Play this Round: Monster vs. Lucky one

Lets do some super quick rounds\~ This vote will close on Friday, meaning it is only ONE round. BUT for this particular round, the winner will go on to go against Lotto this Friday\~ Be sure to post performances etc below in the comments to fight for your fave track!

**Please only vote once, this is just a game, it is all for fun, there are no true answers here.**
