The Census is still going! We will be leaving it up for another week if you haven't had the chance to take it yet. It is a bit long, so give yourself a bit of time to do it. Once you get past the mandatory questions you will reach a question allowing you to skip the rest of the sections such as concert and acting related sections or to continue on. Note: these sections still aren't mandatory even if you only want to answer a few questions here &amp; there. Once the census is closed, we will release all the information in a nice document for you guys to all review. We look forward to hearing from you!

* what do you want to see included on their album?
* what concept do you want them to take on?
* what activities/shows/variety do you want to see them do?

I'm super duper happy and over the moon right now because I'm planning on attending Exo's LA show in April. I've never been to a kpop concert before and this will be my first one, so I wanted to get all your opinions! 

I know that the floor is GA. The venue seems pretty large though, and I guess I'm nervous that either a) I won't be able to see Exo from behind people and b) people will be really aggressive. Does anyone have experience on the floor? Was it too crazy? Or was it worth it? 

Otherwise, I guess I'd consider getting the closest seated ticket I can get. I want to get as close as I can, but also be comfortable. 

Any opinions and advice are most welcome!!! 

(P.S. Anyone know where I can buy a V2 lightstick? They're sold out on like...every website ever...I'm so emo because I /really/ want one for the show but I can't seem to find one right now. Do y'all think this will be sold at the show? :/)",26,14

81,2017-2-16,2017,2,16,10,5ubt7e,Any noona EXO-Ls (25+) in the house?,maplecookie1127,1487208796,"Hi everyone, I decided to get back on Reddit for k-pop purposes. Also because I would like to meet more EXO-Ls in my age range. I know you're out there! I'm 33 from Ontario, Canada.

EXO has been my bias group since 2013, a few months before XOXO came out. I didn't like them at first. I thought ""Mama"" was superfluous, indulgent, and above all cheesy. But that Kai though... his eyes, his moves, all burned into my soul. Once I heard ""History"" it was game over. To this day, it's still my favourite EXO song.

After getting to know the guys, Chanyeol chose me. I am his. I would lay down in traffic for that kid. Lay was my EXO-M bias (because I come form a time it was OKAY to have two biases in EXO) and I still love him dearly to this day. In the k-drama of my life, Chanyeol is the good looking, aloof love interest, and Lay is that wonderful, supportive, sweet second lead. Damn.

I run an EXO fan club and it's my pride and joy. It's hard to balance my free time, real life, and k-pop, but I am sure my fellow noonas will understand this. My boyfriend is pretty tolerant of my k-pop love, as has been hearing about it for 4 years now. He thinks the music is pretty good, but it's really not his thing at all. He doesn't say much about the fact I have bias wallpapers on every device, but I'm sure he thought it was odd I had a thing for young Asian men all of a sudden. He did once accuse me once of being too obsessed so I do my best to keep my k-poppery to myself on a secondary Twitter, Tumblr, etc. What do your partners think?

Nice to meet you all :)",54,31

We have about 26 new subscribers join us this week!  We've almost made it to 3000!  With the census finished will have the results out to all the subbies soon!  Thank you in advance to everyone who participated!

If you are one of those new subscribers, and wondering what the purpose of this post is, Casual Convo is for a general discussion on just about anything (EXO, Kpop, life).  It's also the place to post questions or neat EXO finds, or show of some of your fandom talent (when they don't warrant their own post)!  So if you're new, or if you have something you'd like to share - this is the place!

The dark blue sand grains shift in one half of the hourglass and a single grain falls to the bottom bulb. *You have two months to live.* Yifan realizes with a jolt that this is an indicator of his life.
