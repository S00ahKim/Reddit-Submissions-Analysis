27,2017-9-4,2017,9,4,23,6y0s2n,Casual Convo #133 + A Newbies' Guide to EXO &amp; our Subreddit!,anigym6,1504536992,"**HELLO EVERYBODY!**

For all the new subscribers coming in for The War: The Power of Music comeback, WELCOME TO /r/EXO!  We are so excited for you all to be here and freaking out about our favorite boys in kpop!  

Some of you may be longtime kpop/EXO stans just discovering our corner of Reddit.  Some of you may have no idea what ""stan"" even is cause you are completely new to kpop and EXO.  Either way, this post is a general overview of Kpop, EXO, and our subreddit.

##Kpop/EXO General Terminology

If you are new to EXO but ESPECIALLY new to kpop, you're going to need this list.  And for the old farts like myself: if I forget or misrepresent a term, please remind me and I'll add it here:

* *Kpop*: also spelled k-pop, short for Korean pop music
* *Stan*: a combination of ""stalk"" and ""fan.""  It's basically used as noun like ""fan"" and verb like ""following.""  EX: I stan EXO.  I am an EXO stan. [More Info on stan word history]( https://www.bustle.com/articles/94986-what-does-stan-mean-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slang-term)
* *Bias*: your favorite group or person.  EX: My bias is Kai.
* *Era*: refers to the timeframe of a group's album and its promotions.  Each era is usually named after the promotional single or the album name.  EX: This EX'ACT era has barely begun and we already have so many new fandom jokes thanks to EXOmentary.
* *Line*: Refers to a group of people that have the same role/position in the band, or similar interests, styles, traits, etc.  One person can be in multiple lines.  In EXO, ""official"" Lines are Dancer-Line (Lay, Kai, &amp; Sehun, &amp; sometimes Xiu is included), Vocal-Line (Baek, Chen, Soo, &amp; SuhoLayXiu are sometimes included [would Kai be in it now too?]), and Rapper-Line (Yeol, Sehun, &amp; XiuKai are sometimes included).  There's also the unofficial ones: ""Kim Bros"" Line (XiuSuhoChenKai, for all having the same surname Kim), ""Beagle Line"" (BaekChenYeol, all born in '92 and are known as the loudest members), ""Chingu Line"" (Beagles plus Soo, since in Korean Culture they would all be same age/class grade), ""Maknae Line"" (now just KaiSehun, but used to include Tao; the youngest members)
* *Leader*: position in which someone leads the group.  Usually acts as the liaison between group members and management, speaks on behalf of the group, looks after members, etc.  In EXO, Suho used to be leader of EXO-K and Kris was EXO-M's leader, but since Kris's departure Suho is now the leader of the entire group.
* *Visual*: usually the ""face"" of the group, the one management wants to to recognize as representing the group's main appeals.  Think like what Justin Timberlake was for NSYNC.  Visuals are usually promoted first and with emphasis.  Since EXO is a performance based group, in the beginning Kai was the visual of EXO-K (because of his dancing and unique looks), and Luhan used to be the visual for EXO-M (same reasons).  Now, Kai is visual for entire group.
* *Maknae*: literally means ""youngest.""  Sehun is the maknae of EXO overall and EXO-K.  Tao used to be maknae of EXO-M.
* *Aegyo*: basically means ""cuteness.""  When requesting someone to do aegyo, it means they want a person to act adorable.
* *OT12, OT11, OT10, OT9*: refers to the number of members, or to the time when they were that number of members. For EXO, OT12 is the original 12 man line up.  OT11 refers to the group when Kris left.  OT10 was the group post-Luhan.  OT9 is after Tao left, and is the current official member tally. EX: It's so great seeing OT9 perform with no injuries!
* *EXO-L*: the official fanclub name, but it's also used to refer to someone who loves/follows EXO. EX: I am an EXO-L.
* *EXOtic*: the term EXO fans referred to themselves as before the official fanclub EXO-L was formed.  EX: I've been in this fandom so long I called myself an EXOtic!
* *Aeris/Eris*: a cute way of pronouncing L, from ""EXO-L."" Term coined for EXO-L and used mostly by Baekhyun.

##The Group EXO

EXO (short for ""exoplanet"") was originally founded in 2011, but formally debuted to the public with their EP (mini album) and promotional track MAMA on April 8, 2012.  Their original concept was aliens from another world (YEP YOU DIDN'T MISREAD THAT), who were guardians of the Tree of Life (I AM DEAD SERIOUS).  Each member has his own symbol and superpower associated with them (I AM NOT EVEN KIDDING AT ALL), and the ""MAMA"" lore has evolved and updates itself with each new comeback, leading to many fan theories and questions on the greater EXO story (WE ARE TRASH AND WE ACCEPT THIS).  

IRL, the group originally consisted of 12 members split into two subgroups meant to promote in different countries and languages: EXO-K (short for Korean) in South Korea, and EXO-M (short for Mandarin) in China.  Consisting of 8 Korean members and 4 Chinese members, at first this seems impossible to learn who is who, seeing as how there are so many of them.  But don't worry: you may start today as ""They look like clones, this is impossible!"", but one day you will be like *sees very blurry image of a member's hand* ""OMG Baekhyun, MUST YOUR HANDS BE SO BEAUTIFUL???""

Please click on a name below to read more in depth information about each member like birth names, group position, age, personalities, fandom jokes/shenanigans, etc:

Three members (Kris, Luhan, &amp; Tao) permanently left the group, filing lawsuits against EXO's management company SM Entertainment and are currently promoting solo activities in China.  Nine members remain since June 2015, and promote together for EXO activities, especially album releases.  As of the beginning of the Ko Ko Bop promotions, EXO-K and M subgroups do not exist anymore, since now all nine members sing and perform in both Korean and Chinese.

Now that's just the basics of the group.  Want to read, watch, and listen to more?  Below are some handy links to get a better understanding of who EXO is.  Links below are ALWAYS listed in the sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section, and in our WIKI (linked in the main header navigation):

###[Discography](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/discography)

EXO's entire musical body of work.  Contains all group, subgroup, subunit, OST, collab, and solo music work ever done by any EXO member, and official links to listen and purchase.

###[Video Starter Kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/starter-kit)

The bread and butter of every EXO-L, this is /r/EXO's MUST WATCH video list if you want to get to know the boys and be in on fandom inside jokes.  Contains all EXO Music Videos, EXO's Showtime (their 12 episode reality show, and easiest way to learn who is who), two Weekly Idol episodes (Korean talk show for idols), and four Happy Camp episodes (Chinese talk/game show for celebrities).

###[Extended Video Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/videos)

Constantly being updated by the mods, this is for those who need more after the Starter Kit.  While it doesn't contain EVERY EXO video ever, it certainly has hours upon hours of content ranging from MVs &amp; Teasers, Live Performances, Variety shows, Radio shows, Interview, Acting/Dramas, Commercials/Advertisements, and Photoshoots.  If you see a broken link or know of something not on the list and you have English subbed video links, please message the mods so we may add it!

###[EXO's Extended Schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/schedule)

Pretty self-explanatory, me thinks.

##Our Subreddit /r/EXO aka RULES

**If you are only going to be COMMENTING**, the main thing you need to know is our sub's [General Code of Conduct](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_general_code_of_conduct), which is essentially summed up as be respectful and remember that you are talking to other people around the world.  Also, we are an OT12 forum, meaning no hating on any member, past or present.  Criticism is fine (dislike of someones actions), but hating (dislike of the person themselves) will earn you a ban.  If you are only here for one member, awesome, that's great!  Bring more attention and love for that member.  However, don't put down someone else to make your own bias shine.

**If you are going to be POSTING**, there's a bit more involved...

Read the full, elaborated rules [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules).  Failure to follow our rules leads to mod messages, post/comment removal, and in the worst-case scenario you getting banned.  The summary of the rules is below, which is ALWAYS listed in our sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section.

NOTE: IF AT ANY POINT YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE RULES, INFORMATION, OR NEED CLARIFICATION, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MESSAGE THE MODS!  We are always happy to help you figure this sub out.  We know it's not easy for first timers and we'd rather you message us before you post/comment than after:  

* Only post content related to or about EXO, both current and former members.  If you are posting about anything else besides that, it goes in our weekly Casual Conversation threads.
* Old/past videos, pictures, etc (For Life era &amp; older) goes ONLY into either Throwback Thursday threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* Fanworks (fanart, fan videos/edits, fanfiction, fan music/dance covers, memes, crack, etc) goes ONLY into either Fandom Friday threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* Buying, selling, and/or trading merch goes ONLY into Galaxy Bazaar threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* [Follow our post title guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_post_title_formats).  Failure to do so leads to your post being removed and a mod messaging you on how to format correctly.  You are welcome to repost with correct titling.  
* [Use link flairs to tag your posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_post_flairs).  The mods will message you to remind you if it's not flaired.  If your post is not flaired within the first 24 hours we will remove it.  If your second unflaired post is not flaired in the next 12 hours, it will be removed.  After that, the mods will just remove your unflaired posts on sight.
* Do not spam, troll, or solicit.  We work on a 3 strike system for breaking this rule.  First two offenses earn you mod message warnings; third earns a permanent ban.
* No hating current or former members.  Depending on the severity of the offense, this can get you a warning or a ban.

ONCE AGAIN: IF AT ANY POINT YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE ABOVE RULES, INFORMATION, OR NEED CLARIFICATION, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MESSAGE THE MODS!  We are always happy to help you out!

Author Description:

&gt; EXO is a unit of 9 superpowered individuals that was established by the Sanctity Mission (SM). SM, comparable to the UN of today, is a coalition of approximately 8 planets that vowed to work together to prevent threats against all of them (these 8 are formerly called League of Planets, or just the League). Each of EXOs 9 members comes from 9 different planets, the 8 of the league and the 9th one being Earth.

&gt; The mission of EXO is to patrol the boundaries of the League of Planets, protect from outsider and insider threat, and to report to the SM council. We begin our journey with EXO just having received a transmission from their member Yixing, who acts as their representative in the SM, that they need to prepare themselves for a very strong threat.

&gt; This is a LIVE fic set (actively releasing small chapters, characters accepting Q&amp;A based on current storyline, texts &amp; personality updates, etc.) in a universe in which EXO has powers and is in the process of attempting to save the world, with a few side gigs.

71,2017-9-11,2017,9,11,2,6z9p84,Casual Convo #134 + An Encore of A Newbies' Guide to EXO &amp; our Subreddit!,anigym6,1505065865,"**HELLO EVERYBODY!**

For all the new subscribers coming in for The War: The Power of Music comeback, WELCOME TO /r/EXO!  We are so excited for you all to be here and freaking out about our favorite boys in kpop!  

Some of you may be longtime kpop/EXO stans just discovering our corner of Reddit.  Some of you may have no idea what ""stan"" even is cause you are completely new to kpop and EXO.  Either way, this post is a general overview of Kpop, EXO, and our subreddit.

##Kpop/EXO General Terminology

If you are new to EXO but ESPECIALLY new to kpop, you're going to need this list.  And for the old farts like myself: if I forget or misrepresent a term, please remind me and I'll add it here:

* *Kpop*: also spelled k-pop, short for Korean pop music
* *Stan*: a combination of ""stalk"" and ""fan.""  It's basically used as noun like ""fan"" and verb like ""following.""  EX: I stan EXO.  I am an EXO stan. [More Info on stan word history]( https://www.bustle.com/articles/94986-what-does-stan-mean-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slang-term)
* *Bias*: your favorite group or person.  EX: My bias is Kai.
* *Era*: refers to the timeframe of a group's album and its promotions.  Each era is usually named after the promotional single or the album name.  EX: This EX'ACT era has barely begun and we already have so many new fandom jokes thanks to EXOmentary.
* *Line*: Refers to a group of people that have the same role/position in the band, or similar interests, styles, traits, etc.  One person can be in multiple lines.  In EXO, ""official"" Lines are Dancer-Line (Lay, Kai, &amp; Sehun, &amp; sometimes Xiu is included), Vocal-Line (Baek, Chen, Soo, &amp; SuhoLayXiu are sometimes included [would Kai be in it now too?]), and Rapper-Line (Yeol, Sehun, &amp; XiuKai are sometimes included).  There's also the unofficial ones: ""Kim Bros"" Line (XiuSuhoChenKai, for all having the same surname Kim), ""Beagle Line"" (BaekChenYeol, all born in '92 and are known as the loudest members), ""Chingu Line"" (Beagles plus Soo, since in Korean Culture they would all be same age/class grade), ""Maknae Line"" (now just KaiSehun, but used to include Tao; the youngest members)
* *Leader*: position in which someone leads the group.  Usually acts as the liaison between group members and management, speaks on behalf of the group, looks after members, etc.  In EXO, Suho used to be leader of EXO-K and Kris was EXO-M's leader, but since Kris's departure Suho is now the leader of the entire group.
* *Visual*: usually the ""face"" of the group, the one management wants to to recognize as representing the group's main appeals.  Think like what Justin Timberlake was for NSYNC.  Visuals are usually promoted first and with emphasis.  Since EXO is a performance based group, in the beginning Kai was the visual of EXO-K (because of his dancing and unique looks), and Luhan used to be the visual for EXO-M (same reasons).  Now, Kai is visual for entire group.
* *Maknae*: literally means ""youngest.""  Sehun is the maknae of EXO overall and EXO-K.  Tao used to be maknae of EXO-M.
* *Aegyo*: basically means ""cuteness.""  When requesting someone to do aegyo, it means they want a person to act adorable.
* *OT12, OT11, OT10, OT9*: refers to the number of members, or to the time when they were that number of members. For EXO, OT12 is the original 12 man line up.  OT11 refers to the group when Kris left.  OT10 was the group post-Luhan.  OT9 is after Tao left, and is the current official member tally. EX: It's so great seeing OT9 perform with no injuries!
* *EXO-L*: the official fanclub name, but it's also used to refer to someone who loves/follows EXO. EX: I am an EXO-L.
* *EXOtic*: the term EXO fans referred to themselves as before the official fanclub EXO-L was formed.  EX: I've been in this fandom so long I called myself an EXOtic!
* *Aeris/Eris*: a cute way of pronouncing L, from ""EXO-L."" Term coined for EXO-L and used mostly by Baekhyun.

##The Group EXO

EXO (short for ""exoplanet"") was originally founded in 2011, but formally debuted to the public with their EP (mini album) and promotional track MAMA on April 8, 2012.  Their original concept was aliens from another world (YEP YOU DIDN'T MISREAD THAT), who were guardians of the Tree of Life (I AM DEAD SERIOUS).  Each member has his own symbol and superpower associated with them (I AM NOT EVEN KIDDING AT ALL), and the ""MAMA"" lore has evolved and updates itself with each new comeback, leading to many fan theories and questions on the greater EXO story (WE ARE TRASH AND WE ACCEPT THIS).  

IRL, the group originally consisted of 12 members split into two subgroups meant to promote in different countries and languages: EXO-K (short for Korean) in South Korea, and EXO-M (short for Mandarin) in China.  Consisting of 8 Korean members and 4 Chinese members, at first this seems impossible to learn who is who, seeing as how there are so many of them.  But don't worry: you may start today as ""They look like clones, this is impossible!"", but one day you will be like *sees very blurry image of a member's hand* ""OMG Baekhyun, MUST YOUR HANDS BE SO BEAUTIFUL???""

Please click on a name below to read more in depth information about each member like birth names, group position, age, personalities, fandom jokes/shenanigans, etc:

Three members (Kris, Luhan, &amp; Tao) permanently left the group, filing lawsuits against EXO's management company SM Entertainment and are currently promoting solo activities in China.  Nine members remain since June 2015, and promote together for EXO activities, especially album releases.  As of the beginning of the Ko Ko Bop promotions, EXO-K and M subgroups do not exist anymore, since now all nine members sing and perform in both Korean and Chinese.

Now that's just the basics of the group.  Want to read, watch, and listen to more?  Below are some handy links to get a better understanding of who EXO is.  Links below are ALWAYS listed in the sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section, and in our WIKI (linked in the main header navigation):

###[Discography](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/discography)

EXO's entire musical body of work.  Contains all group, subgroup, subunit, OST, collab, and solo music work ever done by any EXO member, and official links to listen and purchase.

###[Video Starter Kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/starter-kit)

The bread and butter of every EXO-L, this is /r/EXO's MUST WATCH video list if you want to get to know the boys and be in on fandom inside jokes.  Contains all EXO Music Videos, EXO's Showtime (their 12 episode reality show, and easiest way to learn who is who), two Weekly Idol episodes (Korean talk show for idols), and four Happy Camp episodes (Chinese talk/game show for celebrities).

###[Extended Video Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/videos)

Constantly being updated by the mods, this is for those who need more after the Starter Kit.  While it doesn't contain EVERY EXO video ever, it certainly has hours upon hours of content ranging from MVs &amp; Teasers, Live Performances, Variety shows, Radio shows, Interview, Acting/Dramas, Commercials/Advertisements, and Photoshoots.  If you see a broken link or know of something not on the list and you have English subbed video links, please message the mods so we may add it!

###[EXO's Extended Schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/schedule)

Pretty self-explanatory, me thinks.

##Our Subreddit /r/EXO aka RULES

**If you are only going to be COMMENTING**, the main thing you need to know is our sub's [General Code of Conduct](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_general_code_of_conduct), which is essentially summed up as be respectful and remember that you are talking to other people around the world.  Also, we are an OT12 forum, meaning no hating on any member, past or present.  Criticism is fine (dislike of someones actions), but hating (dislike of the person themselves) will earn you a ban.  If you are only here for one member, awesome, that's great!  Bring more attention and love for that member.  However, don't put down someone else to make your own bias shine.

**If you are going to be POSTING**, there's a bit more involved...

Read the full, elaborated rules [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules).  Failure to follow our rules leads to mod messages, post/comment removal, and in the worst-case scenario you getting banned.  The summary of the rules is below, which is ALWAYS listed in our sidebar's ""ABOUT"" section.

NOTE: IF AT ANY POINT YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE RULES, INFORMATION, OR NEED CLARIFICATION, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MESSAGE THE MODS!  We are always happy to help you figure this sub out.  We know it's not easy for first timers and we'd rather you message us before you post/comment than after:  

* Only post content related to or about EXO, both current and former members.  If you are posting about anything else besides that, it goes in our weekly Casual Conversation threads.
* Old/past videos, pictures, etc (For Life era &amp; older) goes ONLY into either Throwback Thursday threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* Fanworks (fanart, fan videos/edits, fanfiction, fan music/dance covers, memes, crack, etc) goes ONLY into either Fandom Friday threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* Buying, selling, and/or trading merch goes ONLY into Galaxy Bazaar threads or Casual Convo threads; do not make a new post.
* [Follow our post title guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_post_title_formats).  Failure to do so leads to your post being removed and a mod messaging you on how to format correctly.  You are welcome to repost with correct titling.  
* [Use link flairs to tag your posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/wiki/rules#wiki_post_flairs).  The mods will message you to remind you if it's not flaired.  If your post is not flaired within the first 24 hours we will remove it.  If your second unflaired post is not flaired in the next 12 hours, it will be removed.  After that, the mods will just remove your unflaired posts on sight.
* Do not spam, troll, or solicit.  We work on a 3 strike system for breaking this rule.  First two offenses earn you mod message warnings; third earns a permanent ban.
* No hating current or former members.  Depending on the severity of the offense, this can get you a warning or a ban.

ONCE AGAIN: IF AT ANY POINT YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE ABOVE RULES, INFORMATION, OR NEED CLARIFICATION, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MESSAGE THE MODS!  We are always happy to help you out!
