0,2019-1-1,2019,1,1,9,abd3mw,2019 EXO-L Birthday Project Discussion/Feedback,99101004,1546302410,"As we greet the new year, the staff from r/EXO &amp; our discord server have looked back at the amazing donations we made in 2018 &amp; decided that we would like to continue our project into 2019. We started in March of 2018 and over the year together we donated a total of $3040 to 6 different organizations around the world. 

This year we are planning to do things a bit differently:

1. We will be hosting a 1 YEAR LONG fundraiser for the organization, [One Tree Planted](https://onetreeplanted.org).
2. The staff will be hosting giveaways for EXO Fan Artist Commissions for those who donate (This means we will be giving away 12 fan artist commissions in total, 1 for every birthday).

**Why did you pick One Tree Planted?** [For Chens Birthday in 2018,](https://onetreeplanted.giv.sh/fundraisers/fnd_e8f0594fa769cbce) we donated to this organization and we fell in love with the initiative and work that they are doing all over the world. To make it simple: They plant 1 tree for every $1 that you donate.  

**I will donate less if we are only donating to ONE charity.** In order to keep you interested, for every member birthday we will be changing the area in the world that we will be donating to. One Tree Planted plants trees ALL over the world! For example, for D.Os birthday we can donate the trees to California and for Chens birthday we can donate the trees to Vietnam. 

**I dont want my money to sit for 1 Year!** One Tree Planted actually gives us the ability to host the fundraiser right on their website, meaning as soon as you donate money it goes directly to them rather than having anyone on our staff be a middle person. 

**Why arent you giving away albums anymore?** We would like our project to benefit EXO-L as a community too. Therefore we think that giving away commissions to your favourite EXO-L Fan Artists will have more of an impact on peoples lives than giving away another album that you probably already have.

# We really would like to hear your feedback on this before we launch this project within the next week, so please comment below or message the mods :) ",2,1

Some other songs where I love the ad libs are [Twenty-Four](https://youtu.be/Vt6v634wIJM) and [Diamond](https://youtu.be/vGWA1ikLPRI).

i'm a US seller and I have some limited edition EXO items from their 5th Anniversary merchandise that was released in Korea.  Please stop by my shop on depop! depop.com/ughkirsten

To celebrate the fantastic year by our lil actor Soo\~, lets go through some of the amazing things he has done in the last year!

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

When Kyungsoo STUNNED us all during these photoshoots in [High Cut Kor](https://twitter.com/EXOXOXOID/status/1070096163221594113) and [Allure](https://twitter.com/allurekorea/status/1066930527536467968) magazine.

When he won the '[Popularity Award](https://twitter.com/EXOGlobal/status/1048154856790380544) at the BUIL Film Festival\~  
The animated movie he was in was also shown in [China](https://twitter.com/intexolteam/status/1017016872259055616) and it won the Best Animated Feature Film Award at China's [Silk Road Film](https://twitter.com/EXOGlobal/status/1051848773989588997) (first ever in Korean Film).

'Along With The Gods 2' has reached 10 million movie goers in just 14 days. [It is the first franchise to have 10 million tickets sold in each movie.](https://twitter.com/EXOnaverTrans/status/1029289554174308353)  It also [surpassed 13 million views](https://twitter.com/SEHUNBUBS/status/953118041046368257) as of 16 January, landing them 4th place in the most watched movie in korea, surpassing ""Monster""  


Kyungsoo sang '[First Snow](https://twitter.com/weareoneEXO/status/1066092987619266561)' and gave EXO-Ls the SWEETEST VIDEO TO EVER BE CREATED on the first 2018 snowfall in Korea and I kid you not when you fall more in love with him once you see it.  aw soo singing soft

He won the Best New Male Actor award for his role in 'Along with the Gods'

&amp;#x200B;

D.O. was the lead male actor in the drama 100 Days Husband where it has done exceptionally well, even reaching a peak [16.7%](https://twitter.com/intexolteam/status/1057412967749181440) viewership. He even he taught the rest of the cast [the choreography to 'Growl'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1_pma9bK-M&amp;feature=youtu.be) after it surpassed 10% viewership.

He is in the movie Swing Kids where he practiced tap dancing, learning a North Korean accent and somehow attending a million showcases. Swing Kids was ranked [\#3 in Top 15 Korean Films of 2018](https://twitter.com/intexolteam/status/1077174570975547392)

We cant forget this BRILLIANT tap dancing performance at one of the [Swing Kids Showcases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8_QYjzdSxI&amp;ab_channel=DOMENT) (I love only one main dancer).

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

He puts everything he has into being an idol and an actor that he excels exceptionally in both. I am proud to call myself a fan of EXO's D.O. and actor Do Kyungsoo. Share your happy birthday messages to our Squishy Soo!

Each and every year he surpasses expectations (his and our own), lets take a look at just a few things he has done to take our breath away!

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

In February he stunned us all when he took [solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgW1kv82Ku4) stage at the PyeongChang [Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkIsg_RzPlA&amp;ab_channel=MORPHEUS)! He looked absolutely breathtaking, and the happiness that radiated from him when he came off stage makes us feel even more ridiculously proud.

Kai was in a Japanese drama called [Spring Has Come](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31617b5935b9fee02cff04767afb68b4/tumblr_ozvet4ngaB1riav2to1_1280.jpg) as the male lead!

He (along with Suho and Baekhyun) attended the Commemorative Medal Ceremony to congratulate EXO for being quadruple million sellers and we couldnt help but awe when the announcer said [EXO-Ls](https://twitter.com/LayIsMyBae_/status/1080773746804379648) find me a sweeter boy.

Kai was casted in the drama [Miracle We Met](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/59/fc/ad/59fcad4fb66383312dd973191919c0e4.jpg), and oh boy if you have not seen this God (quite literally), I implore you too.

Our fashion genius went to Paris for the [Gucci 2018 Cruise Collection Show](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1002313112995786752) (where everyone had promptly lost their collective minds)

Gucci King also went to [Guccis Hyundai Department Store Renewal](https://66.media.tumblr.com/98f4863f8318f7d004c4a399832260cc/tumblr_ph2bx1IFnw1vnak7xo1_1280.jpg) and to top it all off in September he came back to Paris for their [Spring/Summer 2019 Collection](https://66.media.tumblr.com/de8a79d9328d957d8e619e95f46ff1be/tumblr_pfws5dsBIj1vnak7xo1_1280.jpg)

And to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-VX60sGRjo&amp;ab_channel=Mr.Destiny) from Kai's fansite jonginnet (Mr. Destiny) for being posted on social media and reaching 1 million views and going viral in South Korea. Proud of our trending dancing bear!

&amp;#x200B;

My first song was 'Mama', but I didn't really *hear* EXO until 2016, when 'Monster' was out. 

BUT I would totally have to say that CBX were the ones that got me listening more EXO. I rejoined the Kpop fandom literally 2 weeks before the first CBX album came out and when I heard and saw the styling of 'Hey Mama!' I fell in love, I had to get to know this group better. What kind of music does the whole group make? Who are the rest of the people they know? Who's that guy with the red hair (Baekhyun hehe)? I've got to say I owe my EXO love thanks to CBX releasing that album, that song was such a great way to get me back into Kpop\~ It's kinda funny how my first song was 'Mama', but it was like CBX was yelling at me 'Hey Mama!' for me to come back haha and now I have an entire hours worth of amazing songs from EXO to listen to forever\~

&amp;#x200B;

So what song got you into EXO? It doesn't have to be solely an EXO song (aka my story above) it can be a solo, a cover, anything, let me hear your story!!",176,1
