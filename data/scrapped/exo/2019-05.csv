To celebrate our baby panda's birthday, let's post birthday wishes and favourite Tao memories below!



&amp;#x200B;

***A YEAR OF CHARITY WORK***

Tao had an amazing year in so many different areas of the entertainment industry but most importantly I want to share the amazing initiatives &amp; charities he was involved in this past year:

Our loving panda became [the special ambassador](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DtKfY6dX4AAwbCE?format=jpg&amp;name=orig) for the charity plan [""Care For Future""](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1068143333178888192) by the China Education Development Foundation. They work hard to ensure children's safety and to prevent them from going missing and being bullied. You can [watch an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Nb5OEWGSY&amp;feature=youtu.be) he did after the event talking about why he thinks this plan is very important.

Not only did he focus on children's safety, but he also joined Tencent's charity campaign to [spread awareness &amp; help children who have Autism.](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1037283706677784576)

He also joined [Kering's ""Women in Motion""](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1007258616049516544) plan which focuses on the under-representation of women in cinema, both on &amp; off the screen. Tao felt so strongly about this, he flew out to the Cannes International Film Festival to [join in on panels](https://www.facebook.com/keringgroup/videos/1385109784967903/) in support of this plan. [You can watch his interview about the project here\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4mxHsjJfbY&amp;feature=youtu.be)

***A YEAR OF BRAND ENDORSEMENTS***

We all know how much Tao loves to shop. This year he added several big names to his list of brand endorsements. All worth checking out because damn, he makes all of them look amazing:

* [YSL Saint Laurent](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/989864669853569024): yes, this is when he said he would buy his girlfriend a WHOLE set of [YSL lipsticks as a gift](https://twitter.com/ztaor/status/1012230650378645504))
* [EVISU](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1024475489295974401): We love a brand that [spoils our panda!](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1041286249451929600)
* [KFC:](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1002372018816217088) which gave us [vampire Tao](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1052387693395697664) at Halloween time.
* [Sephora:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdX_nv_nmAs) I really loved [this moment](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1035466249830973440) of him explaining what 'Beauty is Freedom' means to him.
* [Sketchers:](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1034271152279932929) Name me a man that looks better in an [all green track suit while wearing sketchers](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1034271152279932929)??

***A YEAR OF MUSIC***

Tao released a lot of music in the past year which led him to win two awards at the China Music Awards. In his awards acceptance speech, he talks about how he has grown as an artist now and realizes that R&amp;B and ballads *^((hello exo style call back here, eeeeeee))* are what he is most suited to &amp; enjoys. Be sure to check out his new tracks from the past year: [Once Beautiful](https://open.spotify.com/track/6wIvrGxXqfliUqL5OK0qga?si=vLnj_PxUT5GURXPZIsyRzw), [Single](https://open.spotify.com/track/75yAi9tvheC4UMfMsUMIRo?si=SQ1vIdMqSwWhn8vV4a8sTw), [Breaking Up But Not Splitting Up,](https://open.spotify.com/track/4M6O2Eu68dkEsxNOAHPZpx?si=7tH_KUekQoOpeKwp1ZWVxQ) [King of China,](https://open.spotify.com/track/6DOI4qvH1qmXZXWWPTcDbu?si=be8GqJDJSbib0_qw66A4iA) [Stay Open (with Diplo &amp; M),](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJq3WwxdcXI) [Silently](https://open.spotify.com/track/68KxkgqpjJwmNVAf3uRZyM?si=ReSrGymLSSC9MLiVyB9A8g) &amp; [Misunderstand](https://open.spotify.com/track/76FCccX2cOPTqakN4SANxH?si=amhK6ITyRSSa3xTdW6C10A)\~

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

What an amazing &amp; busy year Tao had and I didn't even cover half of it! It's been so lovely to see him so often and being open about so much. On behalf of the mod team here, we are wishing Tao an amazing year in 2019 and we can't wait to see what it will bring\~

I just got into EXO in the Tempo era, so I want to learn more about what I missed, in particular EXO-M - their friendships, the dynamics between the members and such. Can you recommend the best videos for this?",8,28

To celebrate his birthday, we have compiled a few great moments from the past year for Baekhyun\~ Feel free to leave all your birthday wishes and favourite Baekhyun memories below! 

 

 

&amp;#x200B;

***A year of new things!*** 

Baekhyun changed things up this year and started working on some new projects outside of the entertainment industry! Last year on his birthday he announced that he would be launching his own unisex clothing brand, Priv Alliance! 

The brand has been an amazing success and new lines have crashed the site multiple times ;) Oh the power of Baekhyun! He even took the time to fly out to LA to attend a new line launching presentation, and has modeled for each of the lines. We are so proud of you Byun! 

Not only has he been dabbling into the fashion industry, but also the gaming industry! We know how much our kyoong loves playing video games\~ He is now on his 3rd season of SM Super League where he streams &amp; plays video games with fans!  

Its so nice to see him out there interacting with fans as much as he can. He even opened up a Twitter account in the past year so he could talk to us more and regularly comes on instagram live to sing for us\~ 

&amp;#x200B;

***A year of music\~***

Well he may not have released more than [his collab with Loco this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RduG3VkgnrU&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN), Baekhyun has done lots for us in terms of giving us new music to listen to\~ 

He kicked off SM Station's new concert series where he put on a small fanmeet/mini concert for eries and sang [Take You Home](https://youtu.be/Pl16xHzys-I) &amp; Paul Kim's ['Rain'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5VwKFOuzsM). 

He showed us two new sides for solo music this year. First he dabbled into a more hip hop/rap focused song for [Ringa Ringa Ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08tGBKabcEE) on CBX's Japanese album, Magic; He said he was super nervous about doing this song since it is nothing like what he normally does! Than later that year he exposed a new super sexy side at The EyXiOn\[dot\] with his [solo song 'Psycho'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3O7NbXOYnk) that I am pretty sure is an all around fan fave now\~ *^(Come on SM let me fave a studio version!!!!)* 

 

 

&amp;#x200B;

What a super great year for Baekhyun\~ I am so happy to see him spending more time trying to get close and talk with exo-l and trying so many new genres of music! On behalf of the mod team here, Happy Birthday Baekhyun! We hope your year is as successful as the last and you continue to try new things.

I put up a listing on eBay recently for the EXO The War/KOKOBOP 4th album all 8 members posters. My ex got them awhile back through YesAsia when the album first came out. The poster tube is unopened because I didn't want them to get ruined! I've been in the middle of cleaning my place and realized I don't have room for it. 

As a fellow EXO-L and general kpop fan, I wanted to see if I could reach out to other EXO-Ls who would be interested in buying the posters to own or give to a friend rather than for reselling purposes which is why I'm posting about this on Reddit. I'm selling all 8 at once because they're all in the poster tube. The running price on eBay for a single poster from this album is currently $9.99, so I'm selling all 8 for $65 ($3 shipping).

If you have any questions about it, please let me know by responding to this! Thanks, guys!",5,7

99,2019-5-14,2019,5,14,2,bo6onc,Xiuweet Time Fan Account,greengoddess,1557769587,"A bit of background that may be useful- Im US based, Ive never attended any Exo event, nor attended any kpop related event, and Im obviously a huge Xiumin fan.

&amp;#x200B;

The tickets for Xiuweet Time were sold through Yes24 for 66,000krw or about $58 and required you to have a Korean phone number which I do not have. Pre-selling of tickets were only for Exo-L Ace members. As mentioned, I have zero experience in the fiercely competitive world of kpop ticket acquisition, so I had to do a lot of research.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 1:** I found different websites that help foreigners purchase things from Korea including concert/event tickets. I contacted Koreanbuddy and he said itll be impossible because of how strict they are with verifying identity. Gowonderfully was more willing to help. They were going to try to get me the ticket once it goes on sale on Yes24 and if that failed, they would look for 3rd party sellers. Gowonderfully is a time based service so I was paying them by the minute.

**Option 2:** The SM Global Package- if youre not familiar with this, this is only for overseas fans. Purchasing the package required an Exo-L Ace membership. The package for this event came with 2 nights stay at a hotel, goodies, a translation receiver, and the ticket to the event. You can choose between an economy package or a deluxe package, standing or seating ticket, and single or a twin.

Though I wasnt guaranteed to get a package- I decided to bite the bullet and get the Ace membership which cost $68.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ticket Sale Day:**

The tickets for the SM Global Package went on sale at 3pm KST which was 11pm for me. I got on the page, chose exactly what I wanted, got to the next page to enter my info, I was about to pay, AND it sold out. This was all in like 17 seconds from when it went live.

Thankfully, the kpop gods were on my side that day and I somehow managed to get the deluxe single package with the seating ticket- cost $699.

[Global Package options](https://i.redd.it/8no6k1gkl0y21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The global package also allows you to pre-order official merchandise. I got the mirror and the calendar. The calendar ends on December 2020- when Xiumin gets discharged. I wanted to pre-order the anorak too but it sold out so fast. Luckily, SM is selling Xiuweet Time merch online now because they received so many messages requesting them. I ordered a few more things and merch from Baekhyuns birthday. Dont ask me how much I spent in total. I spent way more than I shouldve.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fan Meet:**

The night I arrived in Seoul, there was already a long line to pick up the ticket at the hotel lobby. The deluxe package stay was at the Imperial Palace hotel. The ticket was drawn at random, but the deluxe package guaranteed good seats. They also handed out the souvenirs for the global package which were a handkerchief, folder, and a mouse pad?- I dont know what its for. The SM staff all spoke at least 2 languages, I was pretty impressed.

On the day of the event, we met at the lobby around 2:30pm. The bus brought us to the venue and we tested out our translation receivers. It had 3 channels- Chinese, Japanese, and English. This was such a huge plus. I wouldve been happy just being there and not understanding anything. This made it so worth the money! We were brought in the stadium before anyone else. As we went in, we were given a Xiuweet Time transparent photocard and a phone holder thingy (I have no clue what they are called). SM is very strict about taking pictures. Cameras were not allowed in the venue and there were several people that were escorted out in the middle of the show with SLRs. If you were caught taking a picture with your phone, they tell you to put it down or the staff actually comes up to you and asks you to delete the picture.

&amp;#x200B;

[View from my seat](https://i.redd.it/35o2iqrbm0y21.jpg)

Xiumins friends that were on his Vlive show were there. They took up 2 rows in the center seating section. They all wore blue and white varsity jackets. While waiting for Xiumin they played Exo songs. They dimmed the light and played Moonlight- the crowd sang along so loud and waved their lightsticks. It was so pretty. Ill never forget the image.

Xiumin started the show by singing You are the One and debuting his gray hair. Gosh. This boy is so cute and smol. After that, was his 1st ment with Chen as the MC. He called Chen his part-timer. They played a boardgame that he had to finish in under 30 minutes or he gets a punishment which was a 10 minute live broadcast. He didnt manage to finish the game on time. He never did a live broadcast after that, but I think theyll release a special vlive thing or something.

While Xiumin was getting ready for his next performance, Chen kept talking to the crowd. He said he was on his way to the venue and saw so many people dressed in blue. He thought it was for the baseball game that was also that day, but then he realized it was for Xiumin. He called the manager to cancel his outfit and he wore blue instead. He even showed us his yellow belt because the dress code was blue with hints of yellow. The audience kept asking him to sing, but he said he wouldnt because it was Xiumins event and not his. Chen is such a natural at hosting. He can talk and talk- as expected.

Xiumin performed the Exo medley which was amazing. I dont even know how he had time to rehearse that while doing the CBX concerts in such a short amount of time. He was so sweaty after the performances. He even said he almost died. He also performed You, the Imagine Dragons song, Shake, and Beyond. After the last performance, he was taking the picture with the audience while we held up our sign.

And thats when Exo walks in. Everyone expected Chen to be there and maybe Suho, but all of them?? So many phones were out to take pictures- security couldnt even stop people at this point. Can I just say how much I love Kyungsoo? He is so precious.

Baekhyun took the lead in talking and he really tried to keep the mood light. Xiumin seemed fine at first- Suho, Baekhyun, and Chen gave their messages and he was smiling. Even before Kai started, Xiumin said I cant look you in the eyes. Kais message was so sweet and heartfelt. When Xiumin started crying- oh gosh my heart. He didnt just tear up either, he was literally sobbing. The audience was sobbing. I honestly didnt expect him to cry. Sehun gave his message and Xiumin was still crying. Kyungsoo was very Kyungsoo and said Aigoo- hes not leaving the country and gave Xiumin a hug. Baekhyun asked Xiumin to say something after Exos messages and he said he couldnt. He was really trying his hardest to stop crying. Baekhyun insisted and told him he had to. Xiumin tearfully said wait for me. There are good fancams of this moment. Watch it if you havent yet. Ive probably seen them a million times over.

After the rest of Exo left the stage, Xiumin asked us to forget that he cried and not tell anyone. He said he doesnt know if he can do his encore stage, but he will if we called out for him. He performed Dont Go to close the show.

&amp;#x200B;

I had an amazing time. Xiumin gave 100% and went above and beyond. It was everything I hoped for and more. I can't believe I got to see all of them. To me, the SM Global Package was worth the money. The whole event was convenient because they took care of the transportation, the merchandise, translation, and a lot of other things. I also met fellow Exo-Ls from all over the world. I dont have real life friends thats into Exo- it was nice being surrounded by people with the similar interest and to be able to talk about it. Ill be back in Seoul in 2021 when Xiumin is back for an Exo concert!!

Ask me anything- related or not!

As per usual, we're going to be talking about some of the amazing things Suho has done over the last year that were phenomenal 

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

Let us all start with the best thing since sliced bread, JUNMYEON OPENING UP HIS INSTAGRAM TO EXO-LS!

On December 4th 2018 he posted his very first picture of the diamond '[Love Shot](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq-IikXhdLL/)' album cover! To announce his debut on instagram he went on [Instagram live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENm-rA1KG3w&amp;feature=youtu.be) where he was in the practice room with some of the other members. It was very very very very very VERY cute and very exo :')

He proceeded to slowly migrate from the EXO-L fansite page over onto Instagram to show us his [fashionista self](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt1Jfk0A8uc/). Matching [with walls](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsLwQQ6BgUI/), whatever catches his [artistic eye](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuTreSWhiff/), even posting a short cover like [this one](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrvFgwlBJ0W/) before Christmas. Let's not forget posting selcas with his members for their [birthdays](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwJYoXfBrn5/), supporting them with [whatever schedule they have](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw2GrV2hdlM/), and of course showing his love and support for [EXO](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwPqA6PB1Ks/).

But the CUTEST thing is Junmyeon knowing that we compare him to a little bunny, and making his instagram name [KimJunCotton](https://www.instagram.com/kimjuncotton/). Cotton for a bunny's cotton tail but also cotton meaning myeon in Korean (yes I am crying and you CAN prove it)

&amp;#x200B;

At the time Junmyeon was still performing in the musical 'The Man Who Laughs' as Gwynplaine and had the members coming to support him! If there is one video to watch if you haven't seen any clips of the musical, I recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJV3spgBBZ8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=MYEON8%EC%A4%80%ED%8C%94%EC%9D%B4) one. I was awestruck and floored by this entire video.

He even went to the [Yegreen Musical Awards](https://66.media.tumblr.com/26c63a9fb5d957e221801066e6fdc4b5/tumblr_phuqxzgDGn1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg) and won the [Popularity Award](https://twitter.com/BUNNYMYE0N/status/1059472789889933312)! He was very proud and of course, so were we!

&amp;#x200B;

Let's briefly discuss some of my favourite things that Suho has done over the last couple of months; when he attended the MiuMiu Special Event and looked like [this](https://scontent.fymy1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/51794191_2103080366474388_6925460161494515712_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fymy1-2.fna&amp;oh=72cac839de38a353e21d1f41539e0276&amp;oe=5D9BFA97), and did this with [bvlgari](https://www.instagram.com/p/Buqc8rph0Kq/). Took a literal tumble down our hearts while doing finger guns when he went to the [airport](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e666ca9f590b98f1148c100dd0bec4c/tumblr_pj3i59hNOK1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg) (exo were [very impressed](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/236311672325799946/513900945084514307/DsVNiXrUUAAlEyO.png)) and made our dreams come true when he wore [this hat](https://twitter.com/weareoneEXO/status/1061268086597111808) at the DMUMT fansign.



&amp;#x200B;

I want to mention one more thing before I leave the birthday messages and your favourite things he has done throughout the year in the comments for you all to talk about!

During the DMUMT fansign when an EXO-L told him about this term """", Suho said he saw it but did not know what it meant, so the fan said EXO-Ls gave it the meaning ""the **happiness** that Suho always gives"". Since opening his instagram he has put it in his bio and it has made me very emotionally happy since then.

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

So a very happy birthday to the man who works nonstop for himself, his group, his brothers and his family. A leader who works endlessly to make everyone happy and EXO-Ls happier! Leave your well wishes to our leader below and tell me about your favourite things that he has done\~",6,69

Today I wanted to start a series of discussions. I know we all love fancams. *Who doesn't right?!*

I am sure you have more than one favourite from each era, but I wanted to challenge you. 

**What is your favourite fancam from the** [**Monster**](https://img.kpopmap.com/2016/06/exo-monster-perf.jpg) **era? Must only be one.** ***~~I know I'm evil~~***

I think it is no surprise that my favourite fancam is a [Chanyeol focus by my queen SAB: Spunky Action, Baby aka @chanyeolit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFlMECEmjg0) Everything about it makes it my favourite. The colours, the look!!! probably a fave look for Yeol during this era. It also brings back so many good memories from the Monster era and freaking out about everything with my fellow exo-ls. 

**Which song/era would you guys like to discuss next?** 

**I'd really love to keep making this a bi-weekly thread :)**",24,27
