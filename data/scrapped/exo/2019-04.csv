This thread is the place on the subreddit where you can discuss anything you like! Tell us what is going on in your life or what you are loving in the world of KPOP &amp; EXO lately. The universe is the limit.

**Here are some highlights from** [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO) **from the past week:**

* We closed[Xiumin's birthday project and ended with a total of 715 trees donated](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/b5rit9/exocord_and_rexos_xiumin_birthday_charity_project/) to help rebuild forests in British Columbia, Canada!
* [Xiumin posted on the LYSN app for his birthday\~](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/b5s421/190327_xiumin_lysn_fansite_update_to_my_butterfly/) We're all now Butterfly EXO-L's
* [Heart 4 U Episodes](https://channels.vlive.tv/DE441D/home)! If you haven't seen them, you definitely should! Get a glimpse into Xiumin's life and just giggle and cry over how amazing and cute he is! 
* Tao released ['Once Beautiful'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKXLjB3Fm4U) and wow it is so soft, ballad Taaaao 
* Suho and Kai went to the EXO's Ladder Celebratory Press Conference and [took pics with some lobsters](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D26B-N5U0AAidAw.jpg)...
* [It was Lay Studio's 4th Anniversary!](https://twitter.com/layshands/status/1112380834626064384)
* Multiple EXO members had photoshoots and videos drop this week for various magazines:
   * [Chanyeol for 'Art in Paris' Naver x Dispatch](https://imgur.com/a/wJxwsbn)
   * [Xiumin for Harper's Bazaar Korea April 2019](https://imgur.com/a/NAEGmhE) 
   * [Suho for W Korea Video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BviUDfng5yB/)

&amp;#x200B;

**And of course.... Chen's debut is this week (basically today in Korea) and the MV dropped earlier!** 

* The ['Beautiful Goodbye' MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrOrlhjIYVk), which is basically the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Also, you need to watch it with the lyrics FOR SURE
* [A LIVE busking!](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/b5y4bn/chen_to_have_surprise_busking_event_chens_april/) Now, before you riot and go ""OMG SM SUCKS WHERE IS THE PROMOTION"" hear me out. This totally sounds like something Chen would want to do. Can you just imagine what that'd be like? Chen's voice resonating throughout the crowd and especially now that we've heard the song, can you just imagine all the tears??? How amazing it would be on a spring night to be swaying to Chen's amazing vocals? Yeah. Picture that before you get your pitchforks! 
* Comeback stages yay yay yay! KBS Cool FM, Song of Hope, Music Bank, Music Core, and Inki\~

So everyone, what is going on in your lives? What were some of your fave things that came out last week? What are you looking forward to the most next? Excited to hear from everyone, hope you had a fantastic weekend!",5,12

Look how fond [Baekhyun](https://66.media.tumblr.com/61c850987b88d02e890ce03f9606c392/tumblr_p8329h4CXw1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg), [Xiumin](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b823bb5a7f87654dca1b29faac221663/tumblr_p832a2WVqy1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg) and [Chen](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e7f82af318d9c9ccec37ea0d93422c7/tumblr_p832a9suVJ1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg) look? Sehun is the [absolute](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ba7b3df9192725a6990e542f78eb224/tumblr_p7rdiht9TN1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg) [cutest](https://66.media.tumblr.com/895cd5be52206b9287b9ab5115b5a8d7/tumblr_p7rdipvalh1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg)!

Our loving Hun also went to support our leader, Suho, at his [musical](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5a8e28087072051e10385bde91631d4/tumblr_pcvv0wpCPq1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg)... He was undoubtedly really happy to see Sehun and was quoted saying: Thank you to our maknae Sehunnie who came to see me today! Love you! We are one loyalty.

His loyalty knows no bounds, look how cute he is supporting our Chen's solo album [debut](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D3j_LLwWsAkiBfu.jpg) with D.O.!

How happy his costars were when they were at the press-conference for '[Dokgo Rewind](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MvRuOd8dJu4mShYiBPxww6Fs2jKrAZ8H)' (we can all [relate](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f7273d91b5189a69da516f257c294683/tumblr_pnlassIoXG1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg))

&amp;#x200B;

Let's talk about how Sehun dominated fashion this year with his attendance at the [Louis Vuitton 2019 Cruise Collection Show](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1002312960901971968) (yes he did [THAT](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7248379b1fd923cb18d401978ef6c5cc/tumblr_p9t26xbGsd1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg)), did so many beautiful covers for magazines and collaborated such as [Figaro](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D1XujnCUwAAieqT.jpg) and [Cosmo China](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D1_aZ7wUgAAEKvS.jpg). Even becoming the face of [Ermenegildo Zegna](https://twitter.com/OhSehunGlobal/status/1042371470079549441)!

&amp;#x200B;

Let's not forget to mention the HUGE success he had with the Station X 0 song with Chanyeol called '[We Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EgY4Arwv9E&amp;t=0s)'! Especially at how fun he had performing it on stage for us at [Elyxion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6ZgdURif0)! We need more!

&amp;#x200B;

A happy Sehun is a happy EXO, Baekhyun was more than happy to have Sehun on to play SM SUPER CELEB with him, even taking the cutest [polaroids](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9718edad08d37a4fc6f4b21d4d8d531/tumblr_peo40gT5s51qhmxnlo2_r1_1280.jpg)! [Please](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bdd71572c54d70e23770d9e37e034fd6/tumblr_pgeaeuS96Q1qhmxnlo4_r1_1280.jpg) keep them [coming](https://66.media.tumblr.com/357639af3b88f76054cf71fa5f89633f/tumblr_pewgzfwCLh1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg)!! (and getting the best [selfies](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b40b5c6583249d95e3ce3681df51bb7b/tumblr_penfqpf1NT1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg), need more [proof](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd52181c021520102b4748d2495f8f50/tumblr_pev5wywfND1qhmxnlo2_r1_1280.jpg)?). 



Thank you to our Hun for always being the best maknae EXO could have! We are eager to see what this year brings you and will support you indefinitely! Leave your well birthday wishes for [our cutest](https://twitter.com/412code/status/1097430905080098816)!",5,39

Can people update me on what they think are the most important things that have happened in the last 2 years, including member activities and memes and jokes that I might have missed? I sort of caught up on how Yixing isn't really involved w/ Exo that much anymore but any other news would be really appreciated.

140,2019-4-19,2019,4,19,9,besx32,Year In Review: What are your favourite Luhan Moments?,99101004,1555633640,"Happy birthday to our shining deer Luhan!! *^((well tomorrow, I may be a few several hours early ;) ))* 

To celebrate our [favourite colonel's birthday](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d8/d7/60/d8d76047e12ee2ecdb75f34545b30461.gif), let's go over some of the things he has done in the past year!

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

***A YEAR OF MUSIC***

Our deer focused a ton on music in the past year including holding his 2nd tour around China called ['RE:X'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNjresIt8gQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) where he took over a month off of everything to focus on [practicing every single day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyEWxBSbxPU) for it. How amazingly beautiful is his [yellow ocean?](https://twitter.com/luhansbody/status/1060947781676756992) His concerts were a massive success to say the least!

Prior to his concert series, he released the most beautiful ballad called ['The Moment'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKUlv923aHc) in the world for his fans. If you haven't heard it, be sure to go listen to it now\~

For his new years eve performance, he teamed up and trained with dance crew, [Kinjaz'](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsG3uRCBpPz/) to perform a breath taking dance focused stage\~ They later put out a [dance practice ver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb3H9VQuv_E) that will blow your mind.

Recently Lu released a new digital album called ['-volume.1'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFL2ev2pUNM) that sold [1 million copies in China in the first 45 seconds](http://fyeahluhan.tumblr.com/post/184197328565/20190415-luhan-studio-weibo-update-1-the) of presale being released! In the first 7 hours, the album had over 2 million presales in China\~ The album was later certified that day with diamond certification and has become the singer with the highest number of diamond albums on the QQ music platform and also topped the best-selling list on QQ music.  As expected of our record-breaking deer!

***A YEAR OF TRAVEL***

It is definitely not unknown that Luhan has a massive fear of flying and heights. This year he proved us all wrong and went on a long (for Lu) trip to Europe.

He started off by attending [SIHH 2019 with Audemars Piguet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDXnls4trxw) as their [brand ambassador](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ba36fcdb03f41c5d4268d789b0bb964/tumblr_pl98dxmvUb1ralgblo8_1280.jpg). [Seriously, can he get anymore handsome?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeCYfSkgyyU)

And of course, what is a trip to Europe to Lu without a [visit to a ManU game](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs2QZj_AH47/) where he [sat in the stands](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs1Etc_gZ4P/) and [cheered his heart out.](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6c0e98277ab94ec2e27a6034be5e2f7/tumblr_plrqriTV341ralgblo5_1280.jpg) During his visit, he was [awarded the title 'Red Devil Messenger'](http://fyeahluhan.tumblr.com/post/182476065145/20190201-luhan-weibo-update-reposted-1-2-3) for the charity work in soccer that he does in China as a ManU fan. He also got to attend practices with the team and take [Selfies](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d874bebc09742d7a2d4051def56af89/tumblr_pljdzs8g9f1ralgblo4_r1_1280.jpg) with different [team members\~](https://66.media.tumblr.com/667440a123492a424c42861b1643929d/tumblr_pljdzs8g9f1ralgblo3_r1_1280.jpg) [(what a fanboy!)](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b5dcbb78d4af4c9a9b6356346be07b6/tumblr_pljdzs8g9f1ralgblo2_r1_1280.jpg)

After his trip was done, he released a [short documentary series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBa9s1ROaKo&amp;list=PLALFiaYCl28XGqTNa-FpUeQG86WXF8Yhs) about his time in Europe -- Including his manager talking about how Tao &amp; Kris offered support to luhan when he was afraid to fly. They talk about how Tao actually spent the night and took him to the airport to help calm his nerves. We love EXO-M brothers!

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

Thank you Luhan for doing so much for your fans in the past year\~ It's been so lovely seeing you do things that make you happy! We are so excited to see what the next year will bring!

Did you all have a good week? I mentioned last week about how we hit 10k+ subbies, a***re people interested in us hosting another census?*** 

**Here are some highlights from** [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO) **from the past week:**

* We have opened up a new [introduction thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/bdpl8s/rexo_exol_introduction_thread_7/) that you can all go introduce yourself in -- even if you introduced yourself before, go introduce yourself to the new subbies\~
* [We wrapped up our tree donations for Sehun and Luhan's birthday!](https://onetreeplanted.giv.sh/fundraisers/fnd_93693cd093a12383) Thank you so much to everyone who participated this time around\~ We will be continuing our year-long charity project but we have decided to hold our fundraiser for Tao/Baekhyun/Suho *^((May Birthdays!))* in July instead. We are doing this because we have had so many back to back birthdays lately and we want to give people time to get excited about the project again. :) 
* Luhan had a busy week -- [his birthday](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/besx32/year_in_review_what_are_your_favourite_luhan/) and he released two new songs, [Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNl7jcno35g) &amp; [Imitation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNtNLkDBe88) \-- both will be released internationally ""soon"" but we have linked some youtube rips for those who are interested\~ 
* [Suho's Singles Magazine Scans came out\~](https://twitter.com/poco_a_poco_J/status/1119526433435467776) Of course he is looking as stunning as always!
* [Discussion of the week: EXO as characters in a Disney Remake!](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/bf84i0/exo_as_characters_in_a_disney_remake/) A hilarious thread that I never would have thought of, head on over there to give your thoughts!
* [Chen released a handwritten music video for his song Beautiful Goodbye\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxST4WC2awY&amp;feature=youtu.be) SM is feeding us so well?
* [Kris had his first concerts for his tour in China!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdjiJ3azJyM) ([KrisHunLip has been uploading fancams](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6SgnWQ-vliDYCfsCAunjA/videos) etc that you can check out on their youtube channel!) He also released a hilariously cute song called [Big Bowl Thick Noodle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCVwziYMq1E&amp;feature=youtu.be).

Did you all have a good week? And more importantly, if you watched Game of Thrones, OH MY GOD, what did you think!?

We have hit over 10k subbies, I can't believe it still\~ [Be sure to visit our Introduction thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/bdpl8s/rexo_exol_introduction_thread_7/) to chat with the newbies (or if you have been here for a while and never introduced yourself!)

**Here are some highlights from** [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO) **from the past week &amp; things that are upcoming:**

* CBX is wrapping up their Magical Circus tour tonight in Kobe! TT We will try to post a little gathering of translations and things afterwards to post\~ 
* [Tao won the 'Asian Influential Power Male Singer' &amp; 'Versatile Artist Of The Year' at the China Music Awards](https://twitter.com/BaiduTaoBar/status/1122155849802117120)! As expected of our king. Be sure to click the link to see his speech (yes it has subs on it!!)
* [Kai is going to be on a new variety show about Soccer!](https://twitter.com/exo_schedules/status/1121662244331249665) They will begin filming this week in London\~
* [Chen released a new cover on Youtube.](https://youtu.be/vPYGuMgOmd0) Bring your tissues with you!
* [Chanyeol's first solo station 'SSFW' came out last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-wDvImWXtA), what did you think about it? Was there a version of the song you liked the best?
* [Lay started filming a new season of Go Fighting,](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5ObUm-U4AAi3Yw?format=jpg&amp;name=orig) and of course he was looking absolutely [ADORABLE](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5ObIGLUEAAWZX-?format=jpg&amp;name=orig) the entire time.
* It's Tao's birthday this week! [If you have been following along on our birthday project:](https://onetreeplanted.giv.sh/fundraisers/fnd_93693cd093a12383) We will be continuing our year-long charity project but we have decided to hold our fundraiser for Tao/Baekhyun/Suho *(May Birthdays!)* in July instead. We are doing this because we have had so many back to back birthdays lately and we want to give people time to get excited about the project again. :)
