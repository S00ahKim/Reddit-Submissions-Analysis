22,exo,t5_2tvxy,2017-5-5,2017,5,5,19,69dzb2,self.exo,170504 Kris talks about respecting and understanding hip hop culture,https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/69dzb2/170504_kris_talks_about_respecting_and/,brunchingermany,1493981909,"Recently, iQiyis new show The Rap of China  held a press conference to give us a better understanding of the program. Buying the rights from South Koreas Show Me the Money, the show is to follow a similar concept in showcasing the countrys hidden rap talents. There are four producers on the show: Kris Wu, Wilber Pan, A-Yue (also known as Chang Chen-yue) and MC Hotdog.

Kris Wu sat down for an interview with Sina and touches upon some interesting points. We have translated the interview which discusses views on the show, hip hop, and what he hopes to achieve.

**Sina:** This time you are participating in the contest style program as a producer and it requires strong professionalism. Did you feel uneasy before coming [on the show]?

**Kris:** No, because Ive always been doing hip hop music so I have an understanding about the cultural background, including hip hops current direction and Chinas current situation regarding hip hop. Like I just said, Chinas current hip hop music type is 70-80% trap. Ive also heard a lot more new school type music, not just rap. I also hope to bring the program more different forms of expression. I have a lot of confidence in this [topic].

**Sina:** Do you have a lot of confidence in taking on the role of a producer too?

**Kris:** I think, this time, each producer (Wilber Pan, A-Yue, MC Hotdog) has a different expertise. I also have my own advantage. Its more about how we can all work hard together to bring Chinese hip hop music some new blood. So, its not really a thing I can do on my own, it needs the hard work of everyone.

**Sina:** Some netizens believe that the producers are considered more mainstream and wouldnt be able to truly represent the voices of underground hip hop, what do you think of this issue?

**Kris:** Firstly, I think depending on what kind of circle you are in, you will be affected by that circle, this is definite. Out of our three producer teams, the ones that are considered more underground are our teachers, MC Hotdog and A-Yue. Wilber and myself are considered to be working more in the public eye, doing more mainstream things. But personally, Ive always wanted to use different ways to make hip hop music more mainstream and allow the mainstream audience to accept hip hop, so Ive been trying to find a bridge like this. How I can combine the melodies that the general public likes with hip hop but not lose the foundation of hip hop is something Ive always been trying to do.

So like the question you just asked, I think its because of the different environments. If I was in the underground music circle, my musical style and the lyrics I write may be different from the music that Ive been releasing because I wouldnt need to cater to the general public at all. But because Im currently in a more mainstream environment, my goal is to allow more people to access and enjoy this type of music. So, when Im making my music I will consider the feelings of the general audience more.

**Sina:** So the music youre currently making does try to cater to the public?

**Kris:** Right, because I think in order to make a music genre, including its culture, universal and broaden its boundaries, you need the public to expand their understanding. So how do you get the publics appetite? You need to take a familiar melody and put it in something new that youve created. After theyve listened to it, theyll think ah, it sounds quite familiar, it sounds quite beautiful, but it doesnt sound like the ballads I usually listen to and has a lot more beats to it. That way, it might be easier for them to accept, that is my method.

**Sina:** The attitude that hip hop lyrics present is the essence of this type of genre. For example, are there any topics that inspired you and made you want to express yourself?

**Kris:** I dont actually have anything I really want to express right now, Im quite well, right now. (laughs) You may be referring to the more rebellious attitude, to to me, I dont wish to write music that way. This is indeed the image that people have toward this genre.  They think that it needs to give a fierce hit, but its actually not like that always. There are a lot of hip hop songs that cover different types of normal situations like walking on the streets, walking on grass, when by the sea (simple feelings like that). Its not something thats definite. The type youre referring to is more of the gangsta rap type from back in the day, thats one type but not everything is like that.

**Sina:** Have you ever asked the production team why they asked you to become a producer? And what is the main reason this program attracted you?

**Kris:** Ive never asked about the reason why they chose me. I believe they must have heard my music, that makes the most sense. I also didnt really promote myself.

As for my decision, I did have a lot to consider about doing this reality show. I really think that its a pretty good platform to promote hip hop culture. If you want something to do well, one persons hard work is not enough. You need more fresh blood mixed together to push the entire market forward and attract a lot more music producers to do hip hop music.

Perhaps some music producers will say, The ballads I make earn more money and sell better. I have needs everywhere and hip hop has such a small audience. I dont know where I can find investors so how could I maintain a living? But now, we want to use this way to allow more people get into it and create more demand for it. This way, it will make the market consider it. So, I think, although I cant say [the program] will definitely be successful, since no one really knows, it is definitely a good start.

**Sina:** You mentioned earlier that you are trying to mix hip hop with current popular music to make it easier for the public to accept the genre, so when youre choosing contestants will you be more likely to choose the ones that have a more mainstream feel? So for example, the contestants that are less likable, you wouldnt consider them?

**Kris:** Ive been thinking about this issue too. I dont have a good answer right now, it would probably depend on the contestants performance. Of course, I will go toward the ones that I think are more well rounded. The ones that have possibility of becoming popular will get plus points. But if your style is very underground yet you performed very well and if youre very good and have a lot of talent, Ill think since you can handle this you must be able to handle other things too. You will have potential (I would consider that).

**Sina:** A lot of hip hop contests overseas have a battle segment, both sides will diss each other, are you worried about being dissed by a contestant?

**Kris:** No, if youre better than me you can diss me. But if youre not better than me, dont diss me.

**Sina:** The three producer teams will definitely have some moments of conflict, have you thought about how to handle that?

**Kris:** I have never thought that wed have conflict.

**Sina:** What about if all three teams want one contestant?

**Kris:** Ah, then it would depend on who the contestant picks. If everyone chooses the same contestant, itll be up to the contestant.

**Sina:** Earlier, A-Yue and MC Hotdog said theyre strict producers, even straight up said losers go home early type of words. What about you? Will you go the powerful route of giving criticism or very gentle?

**Kris:** Im definitely going to be very strict. When it comes to music, you must be very strict in order to pick the truly best contestant. But I think my attitude will be kinder, I might not say much.. (laughs).

**Sina:** Do you remember when was the first time you listened to hip hop?

**Kris:** When I was around 10 years old. At the time, I was overseas and I liked to play basketball. Basketball is also a sport that is dominated by black people and hip hop comes from American black culture.

The mainstream breakthrough of hip hop started in America in the 90s, that was considered its golden age. Back then, I was still very young and in 2000 I stared to pay a lot of attention to it and really liked it. When I played basketball, I heard a lot of hip hop. When I watched basketball, they always played hip hop, so I really grew interest in the culture. At the time, I would bring around an mp3 player and it would be pretty much filled with hip hop music.

**Sina:** Who did you listen to the most in the beginning? Did you have any special crazy fan moments?

**Kris:** The most obvious (that Id imitate) is hip hop style clothing. At the time, Id wear baggy clothes because it was really popular to wear oversized pants and t-shirts, the really big ones. As for music, Id listen to the ones everyone at the time was pretty familiar with, like 50 cent.

**Sina:** Are there any hip hop works that influence your personal musical style a lot?

**Kris:** Every year its different. Every year, there are new musical styles that come out. Hip hop is actually changing really quickly- whats popular today may be changed into something else tomorrow. It will always be changing.

**Sina:** So would you say the risk in doing this type of music is pretty big? You said hip hop is frequently changing, so you could be eliminated easily.

**Kris:** Yes, a little. Hip hop and EDM types of music change faster than ballads. Ballads will always be based on the melody, when a song depends on whether the melody sounds good or not, the changes in the music wont be much. But hip hop and EDMs changes in element are greater.

**Sina:** Nowadays, a lot of youngsters like hip hop, what do you think needs to be prepared in order to enter the hip hop circle? Or, what should they do?

**Kris:** First, I think you need to understand the cultural background and find a hip hop artist that you like. You need an idol, every person needs someone to learn from in order to grow. I think this is very important. I think right now were missing a platform, missing a method to allow them to join and express. This is also another reason why I came on this show. Before, the contest shows mainly focused on finding singers, people who sang well or are good looking, but The Rap of China is different. Its entirely based on your musical talents and only focus on hip hop. You cant get through with just singing love songs here, but if you sing well youll get extra points, definitely.

**Sina:** Do you think the way you dress is important when it comes to hip hop? Most people would start from copying the fashion, right?

**Kris:** Its okay. But I feel like if you want to dress that way you should understand why you are dressed that way. For example, why do I wear such baggy pants? Why do I wear my pants at my crotch and expose half my ass? You need to understand the origin. A lot of hip hop fashion is baggy because back then the people were very poor and could only wear their parents hand-me-downs. So their clothes would be really big, they wear them from their youth until they get older.*** Why do they wear do-rags? Why do they style their hair like that? This is a culture, they need to understand the culture before they start dressing that way. Although, it is your freedom if you want to wear it without understanding the culture, but if you dont understand it I think youre missing the significance.

*** = This is referenced in Killer Mikes song Thats Life

*We wear our fuckin pants big*

*Because our mothers were too poor to buy our size*

*So they had to buy two or three sizes up*

*Call it what it is n----: poverty*

*Its fuckin poverty*

Author Description:

&gt; CBX, a hidden agency which runs by ex-detective that disbanded a year ago. With the revival, Baekhyun leads two other comrades; Jongdae and Minseok, along with their own unique expertise to solve impossible tasks, including the governments and politics. They have guns, but not to murder. They choose justice, but theyre not with the police. They have technologies, but only to reveal the dark truth. The agency is made only for one goal, and that is; the revolution. 

&gt; *Caliber. Beguile. Expedite. Thats our preceptions.*
