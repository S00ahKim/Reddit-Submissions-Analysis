EXO made an appearance on JYP's ""Party People""!  I can't wait for a full subbed episode to be able to watch the whole thing (instead of just clips!)

There's a Chuseok special for ""It's Dangerous Outside the Covers"" starring Xiumin this week!

And we'll be finishing off the week with our dear Unicorn's birthday and arrival of his ""second child""!

Happy Chuseok and Mid-Autumn Festival to those of you who are celebrating!

65,2017-10-30,2017,10,30,4,79imme,r/EXO Needs A Few Good EXO-Ls.... To Be Our New Moderators!,perfectnamja,1509306212,"Hello!!!


As the title says above, we are looking for **at least** two EXO-Ls for our moderation team! 

Below is our list of qualities we want in a moderator who we will be working closely with.

**You MUST:**

* Be subscribed to /r/EXO
* Active on /r/EXO
* Knowledgeable of our current rules, *but* is very willing and interested in taking on rule development (and redesign) in the near future.
* Team player
* LOVE EXO, both former and current members! We are an OT12 sub, therefore you need to be supportive and respectful of all of the guys.

And although not necessary, these next skills would be a tremendous help in the improvement and reliability of our sub. Please do not be deterred by the following list. These are NOT requirements, and will in no way lean against you in the decision to become a mod.

* People in the eastern hemisphere that will increase mod availability when other mods aren't normally around
* Language skills (Speaks/reads Korean, Mandarin and/or Japanese)
* Web design and coding experience, particularly CSS (if you've got Reddit code experience, even better)
* An interest in maintaining our wiki - especially managing the Extended Video Masterlist.

So, if you've got everything on our must list and are interested, message the mods (or comment below) and let us know what you can bring to the /r/EXO table! This post will be up and open for 2 weeks (until November 12). One of us will message you back to schedule a live chat via discord with you.

Also, for those not interested in the position but would still like to leave feedback or suggest improvements on our sub, go ahead and comment below your thoughts! After all... YOU are necessary to the growth and activity of this sub. YOUR input in major issues is always a good thing, and more opinions are always better.
