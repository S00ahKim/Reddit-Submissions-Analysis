Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #170!

Its been yet another busy summer week for EXO! As the temperature rises, so do our spirits~ Kris threw down another [ridiculously nice photoshoot](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8vg194/kris_wu_gq_china_july_2018_issue/) for GQ while Luhan was...well, he was letting you know that the deer [be everywhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8vkl3y/luhan_x_troyboi_lu_remix/) with a fresssssh new remix of Lu! Lay has been making us all [cry on Instagram](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8uzmwk/180630_lay_instagram_update_i_am_truly_grateful/) and is now back in SK for unknown reasons! EXO-L gave him a very warm welcome and trended a [hashtag](https://twitter.com/morningpassages/status/1013716969495908352) to let him know how much wed missed him being in the same vicinity as the rest of the boys.

Speaking of, we just wrapped up the annual EXO-L Japan fanmeets, a classic time full of games, silliness, and our beloved boys doing extremely stupid things. Catch up [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8v3b79/180629180701_icymi_exol_japan_fan_club_adventure/) All other news updates can be checked out at the latest [ICYMI](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8utusn/18062329_icymi_exo_weekly_news_updates/) :) 

I wanted to give a special note to CBX, alongside SNSD Yoona, to be appointed [Honorary Safety Ambassadors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kec8VwiiUoA) by the South Korean government! Its a tremendous honor for our boys to be recognized this way and we are all very proud~

As a final note, mark your calendars for Friday at 10PM EST for our catch-up of CBX's Reality Show! For those of you who haven't been able to watch CBX's reality show yet or are only a few episodes in, we will watch all subbed episodes starting with Episode 1! Join us for some [fun with CBX](https://pa1.narvii.com/6393/58124a51b0d7556c7b0094dd508c48e4d39d7856_hq.gif! 

Dont forget, our [2018 Census](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8tnvqg/rexos_2018_census/) closes this Sunday at 10pm EST! Please help us make our community better with feedback, as well as thinking very very deeply about your EXO preferences~

13,2018-7-3,2018,7,3,22,8vs2n9,Do you have a favourite photo of your bias?,mochismyeon,1530623454,"We all have one, you cannot deny. There is ONE photo you see every once in awhile that makes your heart thump and you smile for absolutely no reason (but if I'm being real, thats every picture I see of them smiling). 

If you are not into the social media/fandom side of EXO outside of the reddit community, you probably do not see the absolutely INCREDIBLE photos fansites take of our favourite boys. I can guarantee that a fansite is the one who captured this favourite moment and bringing my point back around, if you aren't on Twitter or our discord server you might miss a lot of these photos. 
These fansites are also the reason why we have video's from concerts, fanmeets, etc!

One of my favourite fancams is from the CBX Fansign from a Xiumin fansite (who does by the name of [SCHNEE](https://twitter.com/SCHNEE326)), the video she uploaded is so absolutely cute and super adorable, [Xiumin is truly a curious kitty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91w_tfPoOOU&amp;ab_channel=SCHNEE%EC%8A%88%EB%84%A4)



Here are only /some/ of my favourite photos from the boys, I will leave that to all of you~ but I will include a list of my favourite fansites for each member!

And to our OT9 fansites on twitter: [Blue Spring](https://twitter.com/BlueSpring_xo) and [Serendipity](https://twitter.com/EXO_Serendipity)



For our boys in China a lot of them have their fansites over on Weibo, which is harder to access than twitter so I recommend joining our [exo discord server](https://discord.gg/tD8U5VP) to be able to see so many pictures and more! 

While these are only a couple of my favourite fansites and their photos, tell me in the comments who you most look forward to seeing preview pictures of after an event! 

So please~ share your favourite picture of the boys, what are some of your favourite fancams, tell me who you shed a tear for when you find previews that look exactly like hq pictures (candy crush I'm looking at you)!",24,16

45,2018-7-7,2018,7,7,5,8wnerl,Do you think that EXO's winter releases would do better if they weren't marketed as Christmas/Winter releases?,VallasC,1530908803,"I got to thinking about this because there are other groups who do really well with two mini albums or one full, one repack, and one mini. Generally EXO's Winter Releases do pretty awful when it comes to Music Video views and overall attention from the public and the fandom. Lightsaber is literally a STAR WARS collaboration and still pretty much no love.

I think this is because these tracks and these stages are all presented as filler inbetween main comebacks. When I think ""When was the last EXO comeback"" I pretty much never think of Japanese releases, and only sometimes view the Winter albums as *real* comebacks.

The really interesting part of this is that we know a lot of the tracks on these albums are throwaways. The producers never see EXO and go on dozens of writing camps. They're sending tracks to the management which are deciding where they should go and when. Songs like Twenty Four and Been Through were clearly not written to be Christmasy at all, and a lot of these songs are only really winter themed due to lyrics.

If Lightsaber was seen and promoted as an official comeback, there's no reason it wouldn't have millions of more views. It also sucks that these Music Videos are generally shot well but are very slow and story based. 

It's just very odd to think about, because there wouldn't really need to be much more work on SM's end, just a change in style and attitude. Sing For You and Lightsaber both got music videos, if Lightsaber was full length (which we know it was shot to be full length and then edited down) and there was choreographing mixed in throughout the song in typical kpop fashion there would definitely be much more demand for those tracks.

Also, I totally get what they're doing by having these Christmas albums, and that people enjoy the winter and holiday aspect of these albums, but I'm just curious what you all think from a pure sales and demand perspective.",10,6

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #171!

I blinked and now it's July...anyone else [streaming?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4T43PncyQc) EXO have gotten off to a fun start this month with [ElyXiOn in Kuala Lumpur](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8ww5dy/180707_icymi_the_e%E2%84%93yxion_at_kuala_lumpur_master/)! Check our wonderful [ICYMI](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1015644645227761664) moment for more photos and updates of our smiling boys\~ I know they had a ton of fun with all of the [Malaysian EXO-L](https://78.media.tumblr.com/a6ee7c53fba0358720472bd92fa5c057/tumblr_inline_nr081qAWfA1smae63_400.gif)! Anyone else counting down to the Dot concert? [I'm curious](https://78.media.tumblr.com/84ca3bb5709a1d28f79344db856d367f/tumblr_inline_nswkigmIvM1sfg2yf_500.gif) about what special stages we might get to see there...

Thank you so much if you were able to take the time to participate in our annual census! If you weren't able to, no worries at all\~ We decided to not design the census results this year in order to make changes more quickly and show you the results faster. Below you will find some new changes that we are making to subreddit based on census feedback and a summary of the results from the census. If you have any questions/comments etc about the changes, please feel free to dm the mods or send us a comment below!

# [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO) Rule Updates + General Changes

Based on feedback we received from the census and speaking to some of the subscribers from the sub, we have decided to make the following changes to the subreddit:

* **Fan Made Posts** that include, covers, mash ups, fan art, video edits and reaction videos do not have to be put in a weekly thread anymore. You can post them individually using the new flair **FAN MADE.** If you are posting fanmade work made by someone else, please make sure you are linking to the ORIGINAL post and to credit them in the title of the post.. For example [""D.O. Monster Fan Art by ItalianSoda""](https://twitter.com/theitaliansoda/status/1011700591167492098)  If you have any questions about this, please ask in the comments below!

1. **Reaction Videos:** Reaction videos are now allowed on the sub, but the mods have done some research and decided that if you are posting a reaction video, you may only post OTHERs reaction videos and not your own. Posting your own reaction videos will be marked as Solicitation/Self Promotion of Goods+Services.
2. **Fan Fiction:** You are now allowed to post Fan Fiction on the subreddit. Please do NOT post any strict smut or porn without plot. This will be removed immediately. If you are going to post fan fiction, you need to post these a [text post and fill out the following format ](http://prntscr.com/k437vd)when posting in description:

&gt;**Title:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Rating:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pairing:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Genre/AU:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Trigger Warnings:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Length:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Description:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Link:**

* **Social Media Updates:** Social Media posts + EXO-L Fansite updates will be under the flair **OFFICIAL SNS.** Please make sure to only post once a day for updates for each member - For Example: When Kai posts 4 separate instagram updates, they should all go in one post called ""180708 Kai Instagram Updates"". If he posts more after you have already posted, you have the option to either remove the post and repost or post the other updates in the comments\~ This new rule is to help declutter the sub of so many social media updates that flood the feed.
* **Group Watches:** We are bringing back our Weekly Group watches every Friday at 10PM EST. The theme/schedule of the group watch will be posted earlier that day with a link to where the watch will be taking place.
* **ICYMI Threads:** We will be doing more of these! We will still be posting weekly news ones, as well as threads for events, airport dates &amp; more. Please feel free to make these yourselves and also reply in the comments with favourite moments etc or more HQ photos that come out afterwards!
* **Fan cam Flair:** We have added the fan cam flair and encourage people to share new fancams that come out from your favourite fansites! Please title these with the following format: **YYMMDD Member - Song Name @ Event** for example: [180707 D.O. - Growl @ Elyxion in Malaysia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v48FXh_7-vo&amp;t=0s)
* **Photo Collections:** Our Discord Server, EXOcord, works very hard to collect all the photos of the members for different events. We are now going to allow them to post these collections on the sub for you all to enjoy and download as well. Please title these with the following format: **YYMMDD Member - Event Name \[#ofPhotos\]** for example: [170503 Xiumin - Girls Awards \[88P, 40GIFS\]](http://goo.gl/yMj5d7) All photo collections need to be more than 5 Photos in total and should be uploaded to either IMGUR or Google Drive/Photos.
* [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO) **EXO-L Introduction Thread:** Can you believe we hit 6k subbies already!? We are so happy to hear this. In order to hopefully help subbies feel a little less nervous about posting and commenting, we are creating a bi-monthly thread posted on the 15th that will be pinned to the top of the subreddit! This thread will be designed for people who are new (or lurkers!) to introduce themselves and tell us about who their bias' are etc.
* **Personal User Flairs:** Unfortunately, to help with the migration over to the new reddit layouts, we had to lose our pretty logo user flairs. If you use the new reddit, you will see now that there is [pretty coloured flairs with member names.](http://prntscr.com/k4358c) You can change these member names as you please and use the colours for cute sayings etc, or switch the colours around!

**Note From The Mods:** The thing that struck us the most is that we totally agree with you all when you pointed out about how you all miss the interaction that was on the sub before. The mods feel like as a result of strict rules that were put in place a long time ago and the creation of our [discord chat server,](https://discord.gg/tD8U5VP) we have noticed dwindling interaction, comments and posting on the sub in general. We really have been trying hard to up that by creating new threads, discussions and more for you all to participate in and we really hope that the new more laid back rules will encourage people to participate more in the subreddit and bring back a lot more discussion. If you have more ideas on things we can change, please let us know! We want to see this subreddit booming again with EXO-L who don't just lurk. That being said, a lot of you said you are lurkers but you want more EXO-L interaction - Please be sure to use the Casual Convos and discussions to talk more &lt;3 !

However, once I actually became a fan, I started meeting schoolmates who liked Kpop (I assumed they all knew of EXO) and they had more friends who liked Kpop and the chain went on and on. I started noticing the picture of Baekhyun taped on a locker that I wouldn't even have noticed before lol. There's a Korean club and an annual cultural event where at least one group performed only Kpop (and always included an EXO song!) I found OT12 EXO on pillows while out and about in Japantown and there were booths selling EXO and other Kpop merch at a street fair. I'd say Kpop is definitely well known in the teen community in my city and thus EXO isn't a foreign name. I hope they'll hold a concert here one day :)  


So how well known is EXO in your community? Have you maybe done something to make them more well-known around you?

Personally, I've stuck with my bias. 

And I've probably wrote this in so many posts already but I'll always type it out and it'll never get old haha. I saw Scarlet Heart (Baekhyun's drama) and he got me back into Kpop and I discovered his group is Exo! I remember when they debuted, I had literally watched MAMA and dropped out of Kpop probably a couple of weeks later since school was ending and I got busy and all of my Kpop friends had already graduated. I'm so happy he brought me back because I've had the best year of my life! (I'm almost hitting my 2 year mark!)

**HOWEVER**

There was a phase where Xiumin was *really* wrecking me. Like I thought I was about to switch biases, every time Jamie (our lovely owner) posted a picture of him or sent me some gifs I think I died a little inside, he is just so attractive and it's crazy how he can just completely capture your heart. And then there's .... D.O.. oh boy. He's also another one to just absolutely kill me and it hurts SO MUCH.

**BUT** 

Baekhyun has prevailed and risen to ultimate bias, how about you?",39,21

Hello everyone! Joyce here, and welcome to r/EXOs CC #172!

I'd like to open the post up by asking everyone to check their heart rates: are we all good and accounted for? Because after the first two ElyXiOn \[dot\] concerts, I'm honestly not sure mine is doing so well. You can get caught up on Days [1](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1017640294207008768) and [2](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1018180578019962880) here, and I'll update with the third after the weekend is fully done! Between all the spicy solos and adorable photos, I'm not sure I'm ready to say goodbye to ElyXiOn Era yet. Which stage is everyone's favorite? Are we all [going crazy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxdIjxSwRdM)

EXO is officially now the first non-royal figure to ever be projected onto the Burj Khalifa, which is the world's tallest building! It's truly an honor that we have our fanbases to thank. Even the [boys](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlOBHqol-qi/?taken-by=weareone.exo) have seen the news themselves! How exciting!!! 

Make sure to follow [Lay](https://twitter.com/LAY_zhang_) over on Twitter at his new official account! Word around the block is that if you tweet him ""#balance"" three times in a row, he'll RT you. Don't quote or blame me if he doesn't, though.

As a final note, I just wanted to alert everyone to the 2018 Census results as well as new sub changes! We have adjusted our rules regarding our submission titles, allowed content, flair system, and more! [Please give it a quick skim](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/8x750o/rexo_census_results_rule_updates_general_changes/) so we can all begin sharing and talking a lot more about the thing that makes us the happiest: our wonderful boys\~

Please introduce yourself down below if you're reading this but haven't ever commented here\~ ;)

How is everyones week going? 

Thank you for reading,

I think that if I had to pick, I would my favourites would be a toss up between Xiubaek's Battle Scene and Chanyeol's song Hand. I think the battle scene didn't get a lot of attention because no fancams could capture it in the way that gave it justice, but finally seeing it in [HQ from the elyxion in japan](https://streamable.com/51j2d) concert made me really realize how great it was. I really liked to see XiuBaek being able to show off their dancing skills in a different way and this was the perfect way to do it I think. Chanyeol's song Hand was just so emotional and I am so happy that he was able to perform his own music for us. ",11,20

Did they film this while they were still ot11/ot12 and just cut Kris and/or Luhan and hide them with camera angles and stuff??

Than I immediately went ok, any of them seriously??????? Lets be real here, I will happily get stuck on a deserted island with any member or all members. But for fun discussion's sake I guess I will pick: 

* D.O: We will need someone who I know will get creative and figure out how to take care of us. Kyungsoo seems like the type of person who would take charge, fix any problems, make sure we were eating etc. He would be the first to figure out shelter and food. 
* Baekhyun: We need comedic relief but I also will need someone who will also cry with me about being stranded on an island probably without our phones. Plus, having him there to sing is like an extra added bonus.
* Xiumin: Ok I know its not a big surprise I picked Xiu, but I originally wrote down Chen because I need someone who will be positive throughout it all, but as I typed out my response for Chen, I immediately remembered how Xiumin made it his life goal to kill a moth that got into the house on It's Dangerous Outside the Blankets. So Xiumin will be protection from anything that could come and try to hurt us, ie. bugs. 

Well there you have it.. now it's your turn.. ***If youre stuck on a deserted island, which three EXO members would you want there with you?*** ",37,13

If you somehow do not know of this legendary card, [this is it and it has changed my life for the better](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DSDCLBUUIAAeOgi.jpg). ~~I've honestly looked around and I can't buy this pc anywhere and it is only slightly (horribly) disappointing :(~~

It is honestly so sosos cute and such a Kyungsoo thing to do he's just a big ball of squish ^I ^cry

All the memes that came out of this photocard.. [are nothing short](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DSS4bVxVwAAni9A.jpg) of pure [legendary memes](https://pm1.narvii.com/6692/211347bee79b08a5f17ace3a020d3300b0d9725a_hq.jpg)

A close second is Chen's Blooming Day [photocard](https://78.media.tumblr.com/8217a599d5655b4175cfa000dc751720/tumblr_p70ow41U6s1v88r1oo5_r3_1280.jpg) - with the green shirt and earring and I don't know what has me so obsessed with that photocard but IT IS SO GREAT AND IT ALSO A CARD I NEED TO HAVE IN MY LIFE! I call it my Bowling Dae card ~

I don't know how the boys continuously take such good pictures, but overall I think The War had some of my personal favourites for every single member. Such pretty pretty cards~



I could in all honestly continue naming my favorite photocards but (if I don't see Xiumin hugging a teddy bear or Suho beret I'll be so very sad) I want to hear your favorites! Any reason why you like a certain photocard the most?",15,17
