7,2019-9-3,2019,9,3,0,cyq762,What are your experiences as an older EXO-L?,blazingkrystal,1567437087,"I am an older EXO-L. I just turned 40 in July. I have been listening to EXO for about 2 years-ish. (I'm old, I don't remember exact dates LOL) EXO has brought a lot of joy into my life. I hear their music and want to dance and I don't care if anyone is watching. I hear their ballads and want to sing at the top of my lungs... poorly. My daughter (15yo) also loves EXO and they are something we can bond over. She heard me playing them one day and then I showed her an MV and it was all over. She fell in love! 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently working out more and I love being able to hop on the tread mill and run to the beat of Monster or Overdose and lift weights to Power. Yeah, that last bit is silly but I don't care, I love it and it works for me. I love collecting their albums and having them displayed on my wall (protected in plastic for sure). I also have the Photo Cards (also protected) on display. because, how can you not? 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that is hard though, is realizing that the general fanbase is much younger than me. That was a rough one for me to get over. I looked and looked to find people out of their 20's who also liked EXO just like me, and it has been tough. Not that I dont want to talk to the younger EXO fans, I love them too, they are the bulk of what keeps EXO going. But I wanted to know that I was legit, not the only person over the age of 30 that thought EXO was just AMAZING. When I tell people I love EXO or K-Pop in general I get the ""aren't you a little old for that"" look.... And I don't care anymore! I like what I like!

&amp;#x200B;

So tell me your stories!!! Tell me what it has been like for you as an older EXO-L. Who is your Bias? What is your favorite Song/Album? What kinds of joy has EXO brought to your life? I would love to chat with every one of you! OLDER EXO-Ls ARE AMAZING TOO!!",84,38

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: It's not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# r/EXO's [Sub Banner Design Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/cwoyit/rexos_sub_banner_design_challenge/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

We are looking for a new design for the Fall [r/EXO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXO/) Sub Banner and have decided it would be fun to see what types of banners you would like to see on the subreddit. We would love for our community to feel involved in the decisions we make so...

**If you are a graphic designer, artist or just like to put pictures together** and want to take a stab at making a banner for the subreddit, than this challenge is for you! We will be leaving the submissions open for just over 2 weeks and than we will be posting them all up for a vote on which banner the subbies like best\~

**If you aren't any of these things or don't have time to participate this round,** but have ideas or examples of exo (or non-exo) designs and things you like, comment below so people who are participating know what others like! You can help guide us and give us inspiration\~

Guidelines:

* **Must be Group focused or Type-based:** Try not to make it subunit or solo themed as this will be our general banner for Fall.
   * Photos: It doesn't need to include OT12, but it should contain at least all of korea-line and lay (if you can, we understand there are not a lot of recent photos of them all together).
   * We will also accept [EXO logo](https://i.imgur.com/YMI44zs.jpg) or Lyric based banners that are more designed with only type - You can do this as long as it does not include ANY photos of the members. For example, Don't do a lyric based banner and ONLY show a photo of D.O. - If it includes photos, it must contain all the members. Here is [Another example](https://i.imgur.com/taoOxdX.jpg).
* **Must be the following size:** 1920px x 192px in .jpg or .png format
* **Submit to:** [rexomods@gmail.com](mailto:rexomods@gmail.com) by Sunday, September 15th at 11:59pm

**Examples of past banners:**

# Last but not least, a new moderator has joined us!

HI! My name is Vickie (Blazingkrystal). I have been a fan of EXO for about 2 years now and my bias is Xiumin. I am currently building my album collection, so if you have any suggestions of your favorite album versions, I would love to hear them.  I am enjoying learning  all the things about EXO I missed out on before becoming a fan. That being said, I am in charge of getting all of our Master Lists whipped into shape, so visit them often!!! Let us know if any links are broken or missing so we can make the Master Lists the one stop hub for all your visual EXO needs!!! I look forward to talking with all of you and helping out any other way I can!!!

*Welcome to the team Vickie! :)*

**Before we start:** I want to bring up that I have noticed in the time stamps some fishy looking voting for particular group members and it has happened the past few rounds in particular. ***Please remember that currently we are trusting that you are only voting ONCE.*** I would hate to have to change these polls to you guys having to sign to ensure you are only voting ONCE.

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and **GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!)** from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. ***Leave your bias' behind*** (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# [Last Weeks Results: Monster Era](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/d0pgcs/game_time_which_member_owned_the_monster_era/)

# Play This Week:

Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled the Tempo era!
* If you have some time, use the comment section below to try to sway people to vote for the member you think was the best. Post old fancams, performances, photos, gifs etc reminding people of all the things that went down for that member during this era. These comments are super helpful because they can sway people to vote differently!!
* **On Friday evening (EST),** I will post a follow up round with the ***TOP 3 members*** who were voted as the best for this concept. We will hold **another vote** for the final results to be posted the following Tuesday.
* Remember, this is just a game, there is really no correct answer, it's all just for fun.

**Before we start:** I want to bring up that I have noticed in the time stamps some fishy looking voting for particular group members and it has happened the past few rounds in particular. ***Please remember that currently we are trusting that you are only voting ONCE.*** I would hate to have to change these polls to you guys having to sign to ensure you are only voting ONCE.

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and **GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!)** from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. ***Leave your bias' behind*** (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# 'Tempo' Round 1 Winners

We have had our first top 4 move on as Suho &amp; Chanyeol tied for the #3 spot!!

# Play Round 2

Below is a reminder of the rules:

* Please vote only **ONCE** using the google form below for the member you think ruled the Tempo era!

# Voting Time!

For those who didn't participate, its now time for you to vote for which one you like the best\~ Voting will be closed on Saturday, September 21. Below you will find a link to vote as well as the guidelines that were given for the challenge:

&gt;**Must be Group focused or Type-based:** Try not to make it subunit or solo themed as this will be our general banner for Fall.  
&gt;  
&gt;Photos: It doesn't need to include OT12, but it should contain at least all of korea-line and lay (if you can, we understand there are not a lot of recent photos of them all together).  
&gt;  
&gt;We will also accept [EXO logo](https://i.imgur.com/YMI44zs.jpg) or Lyric based banners that are more designed with only type - You can do this as long as it does not include ANY photos of the members. For example, Don't do a lyric based banner and ONLY show a photo of D.O. - If it includes photos, it must contain all the members. Here is [Another example](https://i.imgur.com/taoOxdX.jpg).

You can see all the banners in the voting link, or if you would like to view them larger, [you can look through this imgur album here.](https://imgur.com/a/Rq4ljeE)

As per usual, let's go over some of the great thing our vocal king has done since his last birthday\~

His first album, 'April, And A Flower' sold 185,489 copies in its first month and has over 200k to date! To promote his first ever solo album album, he went on the street and did some busking (and was totally surprised by the number of people that went to see him. Chen, how are you surprised in any way!?   
Some of Chens 1st mini album 'April, and a flower' proceeds were donated to [SM and UNICEF](https://www.reddit.com/r/exo/comments/b8jpul/some_of_chens_1st_mini_album_april_and_a_flower/) ""Smile For U"" [campaign as well](https://em.wattpad.com/e96a2577c0c3de98aadaa15b07413cdfe9f6717e/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f38435751736550685f54567953513d3d2d3235302e313538653438623461306538623036343435373439373631353336312e676966?s=fit&amp;w=720&amp;h=720)\~ 

All the videos he posted as we were waiting for his album. His own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5vXjgHeenPq0lTSokouxdA) where he posts covers and his way to interact directly with fans. This collaboration with [Onestar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RycTW2hJ87E) which is all kinds of BRILLIANT.  
He even sang '[Cherry Blossom Love Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRKjr8H_jxg)' which was an OST for D.O.'s show '100 Days My Husband' and nothing could sound sweeter /swoon/.   


He MC'ed for Xiumin's fanmeet, and for Baekhyun's debut showcase. ~~Xiumin also MC'ed for Chen's debut showcase~~ ([EXO-CBX RISE FOREVER](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c602cf721262a7850050cf5a9f601e8/tumblr_p6wudtFMkq1x4d0b6o1_500.gif)) 

Chen sponsored a food truck to support those who are about to take the college entrance test ( / korean sat). [The banner reads](https://twitter.com/sberryeol/status/1062301245510164480) ""3rd years (high school) fighting, let's eat spicy grilled chicken and ace the sat"".

His features are so unique especially his full lips which is mostly a feminine trait , but he works it. And also his skin tone.

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

Next week we will be starting something new\~ Probably something not member competitive since it seems some people can't not just vote for their bias  

# About This Game

We are looking at each of the EXO era's (randomly) and playing a fun voting game on which member from EXO owned that era. I'm talking like, take 10 minutes and GO BACK to old performances (not just the MV!) from this era, and remember who stood out to you the most. Leave your bias' behind (I AM SERIOUS!) and be honest who had the WHOLE package.

A few things to think about when trying to decide: Its not ONLY about who had the best styling/aesthetics, a massive factor is deciding who took that particular song and just gave it his ALL and really really really shined in during this concept.

# 'Overdose' Round One Ranks

We did things differently this time around since back in the OVERDOSE days, things were much more split. The top 2 from each sub-group will move on to the next round\~

**EXO-K**

|**Kai**|**1st Place**|**37%**|

|Chanyeol|4th Place|13%|
|Suho|5th Place|10.9%|
|Sehun|6th Place|6.5%|

KAI _ door

.
Choreographed by yours truly @mihawkback
Performed by my big boy @zkdlin
.
This performance is very meaningful to both me and Kai. We had very limited time to create this piece while we were on tour and the situation was pretty bad. However, as you guys watch this, we did it again. Its already over a decade since I trained Kai for the first time when he was only 15. Weve been created so many performance together for the past years like deep breath and I see you etc. but this one..means quite a lot to me.
Ive been suffering from creating new things for the artists as time goes by and recently, it just ended up to the peak and I felt so pressured by no one but myself.
This performance door is named by me. I want myself and Kai to get over the past and move further together. I want us to break the limit that we are facing now. I hope this performance would lead us to the new world. I just want to open the door and move on.
Thank you for watching.
.
And Thanks to everyone who helped us for this one.
.
This is THE door, and its open.",2,6
