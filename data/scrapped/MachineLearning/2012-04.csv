In short, I am wondering how much confidence to have in the results of nested cross-validation after noticing some weird results.

I have a small amount of data (~115 examples), so I am using nested, leave-one-out cross-validation to come up with an estimate of accuracy and to do parameter selection for the RBF kernel. 

Now, I have developed a set of 128 different ways to generate feature vectors, and I'd like to pick the one that will give me the best performance. To do so, I test each of the 128 different methods using the nested cross-validation approach.

The results are a bit puzzling. The majority of the feature generators produce accuracy that is around chance, or reasonably close to it. My best results have accuracy of around 70%, which is pretty good for the data being classified. A typical confusion matrix for such cases looks like:

     ( 36 18 )
     ( 14 47 )

where the (i,j) entry is the number of examples that are actually class i but were classified as class j.

This is all well and good. My problem is that there are some choices of features which produce accuracy near 20%. For example, this is a confusion matrix from one of these cases:

    (  1 53 )
    ( 42 19 )


This poses a problem, because I could just use this choice of features and flip the classification and get ~83% accuracy!

So this worries me. Is it just that the classifier is performing at chance, and that I have so few examples that performing at 20% is just bad luck? This would also mean that my ""good"" results of ~70% accuracy may also be due to luck. Or is there another explanation, perhaps, for obtaining a confusion matrix that is almost entirely off-diagonal?

Also: is there a better measure than accuracy to judge the performance of the classifier? I am currently using the parameters which give the best accuracy in classifying the training set in cross-validation, but it occurs to me that there may be other, better measures (ROC curve, etc...). 

Thanks!

I was taught to always start with Naive Bayes (if it has any hope of being decent) and then move on from there so that's why I have not tried anything more complex like LDA or sLDA etc.

I have a bunch of web pages (3500) to train a classifier for determining safe for work content vs NSFW. I have parsed them into text/unigrams, removed punctuation, stop words, words that only appear once etc. and initially used all of unigrams (37500)  as features in a Naive Bayes model. About 65% of the examples are safe for work (negative) and 35% are not safe for work (positive). Each data point is 0 or 1: 1 if the feature appears in the document, 0 else. Then I use the chi-squared feature extraction method to rank features in order of usefulness. Using 5, ..., 2000 features in steps of 5, I used 10-fold cross validation on Naive Bayes to attempt to find the best number of features to use. Unfortunately, the lowest false negative rate I can achieve is 40%, whereas the false positive rate is only 10%.

In this case, a false negative is much much worse as I am classifying pages as safe for work or NSFW. I also tried upweighting the NSFW examples so that based on weights, 50% of the data is safe and 50% is not safe but this did not help.

Hi, so I'm trying to learn how to use Orange with python to do data comparisons, and machine learning to make educated predictions and would be grateful if i could be pointed into the right direction for what I wanted to do. 

So to begin with, i'm trying to compare 2 sets of data, and see if one affects the other. For example, if i had the following data sets:

A = [1,2,3,2,1] 

B = [2,5,8,1,3] 

C = [10,14,16,14,10]

Is there some kind of analysis that could be done, where Orange could figure out that A and C are similar, as they increase and decrease at the same points? I'm hoping to be able to identify that C is closer to A than B in that regard, and then, say if C had another value given, be able to predict what the new value in A was.

I'm currently still following the tutorials found on the Orange site , but, I feel like i still may not know how to approach my problem at the end.
If anyone knows how to go about this, do you think you could point out some functions or classes I should be looking into?

Would it be better to do this with something other than Orange? such as PyBrain or PyML?",13,20,False,self,,,,,

One such that in most supervised learning approaches you'd be more concerned with minimizing bias rather than variance.

However in this problem the relatively low dimensionality is somewhat deceptive because the variables have very complex high dimensional interactions. I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about:

Suppose you were looking at randomly sampled points in chess games between evenly matches players. The data you had was which pieces each player had lost and you wanted to predict whether the game would ultimately end up in win/lose/draw.

Your feature space in this case is 30 0/1 variables: 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 queen, (no king because if he's missing the game's over) multiplied by 2 sides. Assume that you have access to hundreds of millions of independent data points (you can always run AI-AI games and sample new positions).

The idiosyncrasies of the interactions here runs far deeper than standard linear/quadratic variable interactions, for example:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Early game when a lot of material's on the board knights tend to be better than bishops. When there's not much material bishops tend to be better.

* If a player is missing a few pawns from ranks far away from each other that's not as bad as a cluster of pawns missing which opens up a hole in his defense.

* At the end of the game if the other side has two bishops, but the difference between having one bishop and no bishop is the difference between a guaranteed draw and win.

* A queen is about equal to two rooks early game, but becomes much less powerful late game.

* The difference of one side having 1 pawn and the other side having no pawns is far more than the difference between having 7 pawns and 8 pawns (because of the chance to convert the pawn to another piece).

As you can see there are endless variations of how the variables can interact. Many of the interactions go along an early/late game dimension. I.e. fewer material more material interactions, which basically involve some derived metric from the underlying 30 variables (more pieces that are captured off the board the ""later game"" it is, so a rough approximation might just be a sum of the 30 0/1 variables).

This makes it very challenging because it's almost like you need a combined supervised-unsupervised learning process that can discover interesting projections of the variables to interact on (i.e. discover the early/late game metric and start interacting other variables on it). Then plug those into a supervised method. This brings me to the various approaches that I'm considering:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Boosted trees: The problem is the underlying weak learners don't have any chance to capture any of the interesting structure in the feature space. For trees to work they need to have many nodes to discover the complex interactions, and boosting tends not to do well with deep trees.

* Random forests: This has a better chance of working. But I would have to use very deep trees to capture the interaction, and even though random forest does pretty well with deep trees I've never heard of trees 20+ levels deep which is what you would need to discover some of the early/late game interactions. (At least you would need to go 20+ deep if you were splitting nodes based on single variables).

* SVMs: This seems somewhat appealing. I'm not too experienced with SVMs, have much more experience with trees. But from what I understand they have a good reputation from capturing non-parametric interactions like these. My only concern here is that a Gaussian kernel wouldn't work here. But again I'm inexperienced so any input on this in particular would be greatly appreciated.

* Logistic regression: This one I have to throw out right away because the problem is so non-linear, and I would have to include 32! interactions (an interaction for every possible piece).

* Neural nets: I'm always somewhat skeptical of these, but the universal function feature does seem to be what I'm looking for here. It would have to be high layer though, and even though the data set's large, with ANNs over fitting is always a problem IMO. Maybe bagging many-layered ANNs here might be a good approach, but I've never heard of anyone doing this so I'm not sure if there are good arguments not to.

* Manifold learning: This is the most ""far out"" approach, but it seems like the only thing that has the direct capability of recovering what I want, i.e. low-material high-material variable projection. Of course I don't know how exactly to translate an unsupervised method into a supervised problem...

Anyway this problem has me tied up in knots. So any interesting approaches or good advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

There must be a cool way to do this. Any ideas? TIA",7,3,False,self,,,,,

I have an implementation done, but I'm not sure it's working correctly.

I'll describe what I've done and hopefully somone can point out if I've made any mistakes.

* The BM machine model is a set of binary units in which each unit is connected to every other unit via a weighted connection.

* First, we train the machine on a training set of examples to determine the weights of the connections.

* This learning phase can be divided into two parts - one is the empirical correlation between the units of the examples in the training set and one is the correlation between these units according to some probability model.

* At the end of learning, the probability correlation is subtracted from the empirical correlation and the resulting correlation is the weights for our BM.

* We can then set our neurons to an input and run the activation model on them to recieve an output.

I realise as I type this that my understanding of the topic is really very fuzzy. Here's a few questions : 

Having trained the machine on a set of examples, what should be the output when providing it with one of those examples as input? Will you always recieve that example back or will you occasionally get one of the other examples or even nonsense patterns?

I've found several RBM implementations online. How does a Restricted Boltzmann Machine differ from one with no hidden units? I'd like to be able to edit a RBM into what I've described so that I can make sure my implementation works the way it should.

During class I began to wonder if it was always possible to extract a pattern no matter how complex the data was, and what the underlying mathematics that governs this was.

For example, lets say you have a ranking system and ranks are based on various attributes. If there are hundreds of attributes, and each one has an unknown weighting, as well as an unknown contribution to the weighting of OTHER attributes, is it possible to extract any reasonable pattern? 

In this particular case, even if we have infinite training data will it be exponential time complexity trying to figure out the how the value of one attribute changes another? Does this make it unfeasible to extract a pattern?

Being new to the field, my terminology is probably wrong so Ill use an example.

If we have a training data it will be of the form:

rank, attribute A, attribute B, C, D, ... (assuming the number of attributes is in the hundreds)

It's known that each attribute does not contribute equally to the rank. It's known that the value of an attribute can possibly change the contribution of OTHER attributes to the final rank. So if attribute A is high for some data, then attribute B, C and D contribute significantly more, but perhaps attribute H, K, W attribute less.
