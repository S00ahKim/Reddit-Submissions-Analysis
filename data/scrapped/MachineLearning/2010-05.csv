For instance if you have an ensemble of decision tree classifiers, then you can find the confidence value by majority voting. 

Now, I have an ensemble of decision trees, i want to do sampling on the classified instances for active learning. But majority voting (in active learning this is called QBC) doesn't yield good results (actually it worsens). I want to try a different technique, probably smt like density based approaches will do OK. 

My main question is: 

Is it reasonable to think that the most confident classified example are the ones that are closest to the centroid of the cluster constituted by the classifier? If yes what is the mathematical reasoning behind that? If you have other suggestions please don't hesitate to share your ideas here.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

My current desktop has fewer cores than my laptop, 1 and 2 respectively, so I'm overdue for an upgrade.

I don't need a new monitor or any of that stuff.  Other than doing my ML research I would be doing a little bit of home audio recording and tv watching on it... and of course redditting :)

I've got 3 Convential PCI cards that I need from my current setup (ATI Radeon HD 3650, M-Audio Delta 66, and a Haupaugge TV card).  Oh and I'd be dual booting Linux and Windows 7, i.e. already have a license.

Motherboard, chip set recommendations please.

4 core or 6?

I'm contemplating a smallish SSD to complement my current HDD.

I use R, so 16G RAM seems appropriate.",3,0,False,self,,,,,
