I've been excited by online learning recently, i.e. algorithms where examples are processed one by one and only some aggregates are kept in memory. 

For example, the just open-sourced [Vowpal Wabbit](http://hunch.net/~vw/) or Leon Bottou's [svmsgd](http://leon.bottou.org/projects/sgd). These are both linear classifiers, Leon also has an online CRF implementation. 

Does anyone know of any online clustering algorithms? It seems a SVM can do clustering using an appropriate kernel? ",7,9
