I was watching a specific course on Topological Data Analysis from Anthony Bak of Ayasdi, and at several occasions he used the term ""lenses"" to describe a statistical, mathematical or even computational ""device"" through which one can query the raw data to learn something about it. He gave several examples such as the mean, the variance, PCA, etc. on page 102 of his slides http://topology.cs.wisc.edu/Bak.pdf .

I already thought of something similar in the specific field of clustering, but this is the first time I see someone naming all these objects as such. Do you know other names than ""lenses"" for this? Is there any more formal approach of this idea -- taking raw data and projecting it on some subspace to look for specific material, or even writing data mining tools as composition of these ""lenses""?

Thanks!

E: I'm not talking about TDA, which is awesome and which I'm already studying. My question is precisely about the formalization of looking to the data through ""lenses"".",4,4

I have some sequential sales data (monthly aggregation) for a set of products and stores, for which I have features for both the products and stores, and some features representing the time.

I tried several validation schemes, but the one that worked generally well with random forests was sequential validation.
With this same setup, using random forests, validation error is quite correlated with test error (for most of the error metrics), and I can select a model based on validation that performs reasonably well on the test set.

With neural nets, validation error seems almost uncorrelated (spearman correlation of error metrics on validation set vs test set ~=0.1-0.2 vs 0.7-0.8 with random forests) with test error, and although I can select models that seem to have comparable performance to the random forests, I can never select the best ones, which pretty consistently outperform the random forests.

I am not sure how to fix or work around this issue. Could be due to the fact that the neural output is more variable than random forests? Seems like a bug? I guess part of this is due the non-stationary data distribution... Any insights appreciated, I can give more details on the architecture if needed.

It recently launched to the public at www.flaredown.com after a lengthy private beta.

The goal is to use the data the Flaredown gathers to identify patterns and correlations that might help patients of these hard-to-treat illnesses. For example:

- Does X treatment affect Y symptom positively/negatively/not at all?

- Are there subsets within our current diagnoses that could more accurately represent symptoms and predict effective treatments?

- Can we reliably predict what triggers a flare for a given user or all users with a certain condition?

- Could we recommend treatments effectively, based on similarity of users rather than specific symptoms? (like Netflix recommendations for treatments) 

- Can we quantify a patients level of disease activity based on their self-reported symptoms? How different is it from our existing measures?

We're starting to accrue a real body of data by now and I want to share it with data scientists, researchers, or anyone interested in questions like the ones above. To start, I could use advice on how to format the data for this kind of use. But after that I really want to dig in and start analyzing what we've got.

Due to data cleaning, dropped documents and added documents, I find it rather difficult to keep track. Also, if I'm not 100% sure I got the two orders right, I have to start over.

I've been searching for ways to generalise a classifier but haven't had much luck with Google so hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. 


All classifiers I've seen &amp; used so far try to predict a class from a finite list. Eg if predicting what car someone will buy, the target variable would be a list of car names {car1, car2, car3,...,carN}. If the available cars (in this case) changes then the model has to be rebuilt with the new list. If a new car is added, then initially there will be very few/no observations and the retrained model is unlikely to predict that car will be purchased. Not ideal. 


I've been thinking that rather than predict which car, it might be possible to predict the cars features, eg engine size, number of seats etc, then the car prediction would be the car with the most similar features. If new cars are introduced (or old ones no longer available) that wouldn't matter. Thus far I've thought of 2 approaches.


First is to build a model predicting each feature of the target, then return the car with the smallest average distance to each target feature. Eg, 1 model for fuel economy, 1 for number of seats etc. This approach would work for features that are both continuous and categorical, eg fuel economy and car colour but seems quite inelegant, especially as the target space grows. Also, I've tried to run this approach in R, all with various errors. 


The second is to binarise my target's features, creating a large feature matrix as my target variable. For example if a car could have a combination of the following features:
    number of cylinders in {4,6,8} 
    number of seats in {2,5}. 
If carN had 6 cylinders and 2 seats it would be represented as [0,1,0,0,1]. In saying that, if binarising is unnecessary that'd also be cool, eg [6,2]. I've built some models using a binarised matrix as my target in Python using Keras on Theano, but should also work with the models present in scikit. This approach also has the issue of the target matrix growing quickly as the feature space grows. It also can't handle continuous variables unless they are first turned into groups.


My questions are:
1. Is this approach valid? Ie, are there any gaping pitfalls I've missed?
2. If valid, does anybody know of other/better ways to generalise the target variable?
3. Are there alternate methods?
4. Am I trying to bite off more that I can chew?

Any papers, blogs, tutorials, repos etc would all be much appreciated. Thanks (&amp; sorry for such a long post).",3,1

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4v65q6/ml_data_processing_pipeline/

Some claim that 80% of the effort in data engineering is spent on dealing with the ""plumbering"" while the rest is spent in building the actual machine learning models. Data engineering starts with identifying the right data sources. Data sources can be databases, third party APIs, HTML documents which needs to be scrapped and so on. Acquiring data from databases is a straight forward job, while acquiring data from third party APIs and scrapping may come with its own complexities. Once we manage to acquire the data, the next job is to clean it so that it can be used to train ML models.

I didn't find tools yet that would help to organize these ""plumbering"" tasks efficiently and readably, so I am building a Python pipeline at work. 

It is loosely inspired by:

- http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/07/21/approaching-almost-any-machine-learning-problem-abhishek-thakur/

- https://github.com/unnati-xyz/fifthel-2016-workshop

If there would be a support from the community, I can persuade my boss to open-source this pipeline.

**The main features are following:**

1) Organize data scraping/transforming tasks in a DAG (directed acyclic graph), so that it handles dependencies between the tasks that can be distributed on multiple workers (right now I'm deciding between Airflow/Luigi. Probably Airflow).

The most common operations in handling data are:

- mapping data from various sources to a tabular format (X, Y) used to learn ML models

- (stratified) splitting of data to train/test/validation

- preprocessing of data (low pass filtering, binning, etc.)

- extracting features (PCA, SVD, etc.)

2) Organize chaotic experimenting with training models. Experimental code can get quite messy after a while, so it should be organized well. Do you want to try different settings for models? Try different preprocessing of the data? Find out which features are the most important? This pipeline can help you with that by providing a common structure.

3) Integration with TensorFlow / TensorBoard. The entire pipeline can be exported into a model that can be run completely separately from the pipeline, to provide an API / integrate into other applications. 

4) Create data resitories that contain cleaned data / features directly used to train models and can be shared with coworkers / other people seamlessly.

5) Support for Jupyter notebooks in various stages of the pipeline. Don't worry about data preprocessing, just get nice (X,Y) data in your notebook and play with it with your favorite tools.

6) CLI interface that sets up the whole environment automatically and runs the scripts with appropriate sources of data.

7) Outsource model training to 3rd party computational resources - cloud (AWS), custom computational grids, etc.


**Take a look at the pipeline visualisation:**

- https://postimg.org/image/l1mrgeb5t/

**Things I'm considering:**

A) Support other ML frameworks other than TF? Maybe they could be contained within DAG, but exporting will be more of a pain.

I'm trying to create a model similar in certain ways to Microsoft's TrueSkill. I've been trying to understand the update equations shown in [their paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/NIPS2006_0688.pdf), and I'm having some difficulties.

Now I've derived the first two rows of update equations shown in Table 1, but I can't get very far on the third in which x is a linear combination of y. I'm not sure if I'll even be able to ask the right questions, but maybe someone can provide some insight.

So as I understand it, the sum-product algorithm says:

     [; m_{f\rightarrow x} = \int ... \int I(x = a^T y) \prod_i m_{y_i\rightarrow f} dy_1...dy_n ;]

I'm not sure how the identity function really fits here. Is it supposed to be treated like some kind of delta function which removes all of the integrals in a sense? If so is I actually a probability density function which is infinite when the equality is satisfied and 0 elsewhere?

Alternatively is it really the identity function, and that basically just forces the integration to be performed only where the equality is satisfied. If that is the case how exactly are the multiple integrals dealt with?

Once the integrals are sorted I take it that each message can be treated like a Gaussian, and so the product is just a matter of doing the algebra to find the result. 

I'm really not sure if I'm on the right track so any guidance will be much appreciated. For instance am I right in thinking that the integrals should disappear before I have to deal with the product or is that mistaken? Thanks very much

E=1/N i cross_entropy(xi,yi) +  j k l (w_j,k,l)**2

where the first term is the cross entropy over classes (averaged over the size of the training set) and the second term is the sum of squared weights involved in the network (w_j,k,l is the weight from k-th unit in j-th layer to l-th unit in (j+1)-th layer), and  is a regularization strength parameter.

My question is: won't the number of layers and units affect the scale of the regularization term ? Therefore, wouldn't it make more sense to normalize the second term by the number of weights (i.e., replacing  / (Nlayers * Nunits * Nunits) for ).

Unfortunately, I've not found any reference about this. I've just found in Bengio's paper [1] (weight decay subsection) that they recommend to scale according to the number of mini-batches in each epoch (which I do not really see the reason why).

Here's how it works:

1. You need to finish a quest, which has several sub quests as requirements

2. The quests take you all over the game world, and many can be done concurrently, so it's possible to optimize your path.

3. Quests require certain items, of which you can only carry 28 at a time.

4. Efficient questing is done using teleportation, some which is only unlocked after finishing searching quests.

5. Each location is some map distance from other locations, which is further complicated by the ability to teleport, eg location A is 1000 game tiles from location B, but only 100 game tiles from location B via teleport T.

6. Quests have dependencies, so even though you could technically just do a ""breadth first search"" from the starting area, completing pieces as you come across them, you can't always do this (location A may have 3 quests you can work on concurrently, but only if you have all the required subquests completed).

My idea for determining optimum order:

1. Start by building a graph of all the locations that are important in all quests, and labelling at that location what items are needed.

2. Do some sort of dependency resolution on the current progress of all quests in the local area to determine subtasks from started quests that you can complete in any given area. (as done in [apt-get?](https://people.debian.org/~dburrows/model.pdf))

3. Give a penalty to the overall cost of supplies; eg you could complete all quests 1 by 1 by using exclusively teleportation, but you would lose out if there were other quests in the area that you could work on with that same teleport.

4. Find ways to prune the decision tree, eg while doing certain quests you can't leave the quest area so you should limit the algorithm's ability to suggest doing so.

Thoughts? It seems almost intractable to figure out the *best* order in which to do things, but there may be a ""more optimal"" solution than the ones people have worked out by hand:

Would I be able to reliably use the graphics card when it is calculating? ie can I still smoothly interact with my linux GUI if my monitor is attached to the card that is calculating. In my past experience, mining cryptocurrency will cause the GUI to become very very unresponsive even if I tone down the utilization.

I developed a web service to evaluate your abstracts based on its content via machine learning. My benchmark shows the square root of predicted IF and the square root of real IF have a correlation coefficient of 0.66.  
Ideally you can evaluate your abstract many time (it's fast ) and do manual ""gradient decent"" to optimize your abstract to maximize its potential impact factor and get published on good journal :-)

Multinomial logistic regression does something similar but only has parameters for the first K-1 classes, taking advantage of the fact that the resulting probabilities must sum to 1.

Let me explain better what I mean, let us stick to reddit to begin with as a source of content but of course the source can be the whole web in general. My problem is the following, when I browse reddit I'm subscribed to a set of subreddits which essentially limits what content is available to me. If there was a post outside what I subscribe which would be of interest to me it is quite unlikely that I will discover it.

I would love to have a feature which would discover such posts for me and I would even be ok with a somewhat high false positive rate in the beginning when it is learning. A UI where I'm presented with posts and I can swipe right/left (up/down vote) after studying them would be nice for example.

I see two approaches to this problem. First, collaborative filtering where the content a user sees is based on the votes of other users. This approach has a bootstrap problem though since new posts need to be evaluated by someone before they can be recommended. Second, a deep learning approach where a network is trained on my preferences. However, here the problem is that it is probably too expensive to have a neural network for every user on the server-side (perhaps many users could be aggregated into a single network?). In my case I would be happy to do that learning on the client side though if the outcome is more efficient content discovery.

So my question is, does there anything like this exist and what are the main obstacles if I wanted to do it on the client side for example?",3,1

In analyzing the data I got from the training I performed I realized something that I find kind of weird: the reconstruction accuracy of the autoencoder layers and the final classification accuracy don't really seem to be positively correlated. The first layer's is, slightly, the rest aren't or are even negatively correlated. That would seem to suggest that improving the autoencoder's performance would have no impact or even a negative impact on the classification performance. Is this normal or does it indicate that I've done something wrong? For the last layer I can kind of understand why it would be negatively correlated: as the reconstruction error of the previous layers is already bad increasing its performance would, due to the way I'm training them, only cause it to get good at reconstructing rubbish, which isn't useful... 
I guess the reasoning behind why this doesn't really matter is because the weights of the autoencoder layers are just a starting point that turns out to be a good one in most cases but wouldn't having a better starting point usually tend to improve the final outcome?
I've tried to look into ways of ""solving"" this but I can't seem to find anyone that's really done research into it. I thought that discounting representations based on their reconstruction error might work, so that parts of the training set that are hard to reconstruct and are likely noise contribute less to the training of the deeper layers, but I have no idea whether that would actually work.
Does anyone here have an idea of why this could be and if it's a general ""issue"" with the method that someone has already tried to improve upon? Thanks in advance.",2,0

If you're classifying sequences of varying lengths then it seems reasonable to (1) embed sequence elements in a vector space (2) perform convolutions to capture local structure (3) feed the sequence of convolutional activations to an RNN to capture longer-range interactions.

Are there any good papers or tutorials which discuss these kinds of models in detail? 

Specifically I'm hoping to answer some of the following:

1) Are the convolutions typically 1D (applied along only one embedding dimension) or 2D (mixing all the components of embedding vectors)?

2) Is there any reason to preserve convolutional activations which overlap only part of the sequence (i.e. border_mode=""same"")? 

3) Is it useful to add explicit start and stop symbols to each sequence (which would then have their own embedded representations)? 

4) If using convolutions of multiple widths with a ""valid"" border mode then the number of timesteps from each convolution size will differ. How can these activation sequences of differing lengths be used as inputs to the same RNN layer? Should each conv size have its own downstream RNN, with a merge of outputs afterward?

5) Purely a detail of implementation, but how can convolutional RNNs be implemented in Keras when the convolution classes don't support masking (and thus seem to require that every input be of the same maximal length).

note: the points above are a very common story for biomedical imaging... Typically you have images from sources other than your common 3-dimensional rgb (e.g. mri, spectral) providing a lot of pixels but with no/little information available.

There two quite similar net architectures for semantic segmentation task:

1) [Learning Deconvolution Network for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04366)

2) [SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561)


They both use similar VGG network for encoding part, but they differ a bit in decoding part. Though, still it is quite similar. They use the same layers as VGG net, but in reverse order, replacing max pooling operations with unpooling (remembering max element index). The difference is that in the first paper they use deconv layers (with stride 1), so it doesn't change spatial dimensions, while in the second paper they use just regular conv layers, thus they don't need deconv layers at all.

Before it was more logical for me that if you use convolution layers in encoder part going from input pixels to more abstract features, then you should use kind of reverse operation like ""deconvolution"" in the decoder part, which will take a single coarse element as input, multiply it by some kernel (e.g. 3x3) and a produce bigger output.

Though, as it turns out in SegNet paper, you don't actually need deconv layers, which is not very intuitive for me.

One case, when I thought deconv layers can be useful is with stride &gt; 1, when they actually upsample input. But in these papers, they always use stride=1 for all conv/deconv layers and all upsampling is done using similar unpooling layers.


So I see 3 options:

1. unpooling + conv
2. unpooling + deconv (stride 1)
3. deconv (stride &gt; 1)

Is any of them more preferable than the others, or they yield effectively the same result?

BTW, I've been mainly testing fully-connected nets, from 50 to 100 neurons per hidden layer only.

With pre-activation BN (dot -&gt; BN -&gt; ReLU), I can train networks with up to ~21 hidden layers effectively (~98% val acc). When I get to around 25 layers it breaks completely (stuck at 10% error forever).

However, with post-activation BN networks with up to around 35 layers converge normally, and start breaking when they have ~50 hidden layers.

Interestingly, dropout also has a really weird factor in all of this. For 10 hidden layers, a dropout rate of 0.5 in the last layer only makes the validation accuracy go 2% up. However, with 20 hidden layers the same rate makes the network break - while no dropout at all makes it converge normally.

Are there any studies and experiments on such things that you all are aware of? I'd like to compare and check what's been done and what hasn't before spending more time on this.

On a side-note, I'm testing this on Keras, using net = BatchNormalization(mode=1)(net) to apply BN. I'm not 100% that's the right way to do it, but that seems to be the correct way from what I read in the documentation (at least for fully-connected nets).",9,2

Now for my naive series of questions: 

1) As a beginner, having a million sources to start with is more harmful than helpful. I've found a few nice books that look to get you up and running writing code and using libraries (scikit-learn, tensorflow, etc.). However, they are really shallow on the explanation part. I am looking for a solid book to start with, and, from what I've managed to find so far, there are two choices: [Murphy's Book](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Probabilistic-Perspective-Computation/dp/0262018020/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470435013&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=machine+learning+a+probabilistic+perspective), which some people have told me is THE textbook in the field, and [Marsland's Book](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Algorithmic-Perspective-Recognition/dp/1466583282/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470435027&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=machine+learning+algorithmic+perspective), which, as the name says, is oriented towards writing actual code (indeed, in Murphy's book I did not see a single line of code or even pseudocode).

Thus, the question, Murphy introduces you to a ton of statistics, but is it a good place to start ? I was thinking of doing Murphy first and then Marsland, once I have some understanding of what is actually going on.


2) It might sound funny that I place this as a second question, but is ML the best place to start learning about AI ? Are there any AI specific books that would be of use?

Well, that's about it, looking forward to reading your opinions. ",7,4

Turns out my numpy in 2.7 and my numpy in python3 behave differently for some fucking reason which tied back to my third point, which led me to finally debug my errors. I know it was numpy because I tried some tutorial code that didn't work on 2.7 (exactly the same issue as I was facing) but worked on 3.....

Hey all,

I have a few questions: 

1) should I add a bias to my output layer? 

2) say I'm doing a binary classification task, should I add a round(like the function) to the end of my feedforward (right before returning the answer?) because when I don't I get numbers that are around 0.99

3) All my outputs, regardless of how I'm training my network seems to output to 1. Any ideas as to what might be causing this? My accuracy as far as I can tell seems to be hovering around 22-30% and I've checked my weights and they do seem to be changing.  I'm doing a 1 hidden layer NN with sigmoid activations all across.

4) Would I be changing the biases as I would the weights of the function? I'm reading through Mitchell and there is no mention of the delta_bias, but in other sources (internet) it seems like they change the bias during the derivation (either that or I'm misunderstanding their point)",11,4

Deep learning/neural networks are already roughly modeled on the principles of the human brain. To get an even more accurate picture (especially for things like spiking neural networks) why can't we take a human brain (or a rat brain or other animal brain), strap a set of electrodes on, and acquire the signals from a variety of different tasks? The results would be the discrete spikes resulting at different layers of biological neural networks. We could use linear regression or other basic statistical methods to construct a basic rule for reproducing such spikes, and we would have a (roughly) accurate neural network potentially capable of human-level performance.

Sorry if this is a dumb/amateur question, but I'm genuinely curious.",10,0

I wonder if there're techniques to measure how helpful some particular feature in solving classification problem with a feedforward neural network?

The straightforward approach is to evaluate NN performance on two datasets (with and without the feature) and compare results. However, there're two issues with it: 1) NN training is a rather costly process (at least in terms of time  and let's fix that we can't switch to a more powerful computing unit that will require significantly less time to train NN); 2) NN training heavily depends on weights initialization, which is usually stochastic process, therefore NN training process most of the time finds different suboptimal local extremums in an error surface, i.e. yields different performance every training session. So, it leads to a conclusion, that the straightforward approach will require a fairly large number of costly NN training sessions to draw a probabilistically correct decision.
However, on a first glance it looks like the only 100%-correct way to find out if a feature helps. I wonder if therere more clever approaches available?
Its not a strict requirement for a solution to be a 100%-correct. Its okay if it almost always correct, or even sometimes correct provided that it almost never marks a helpful feature as useless.

If one to compute loss function derivatives w.r.t. NN input features (X data) over the whole dataset for a trained network, is it safe to say that features with a bigger mean/median absolute derivative value are more helpful than those feature with a smaller corresponding statistic? (provided that features were normalized under the same strategy). Could this approach be used to rank feature helpfulness? What are the tricks and drawbacks?

UPD1: I'm aware about L1-penalty technique. It's still very computationally expensive, though a bit better than the straightforward approach.

These products are available all over the world, and therefore not only is it important to get a product level demand forecast as well but a product-geography demand forecast.

Of course this means that there is product*geography number of forecasts that need to be created. (The whole point here is to avoid dis aggregation to boost accuracy)

Is there a way to cluster all of these product-geography combinations efficiently with the goal of assign a forecasting methodology to each cluster that is highly accurate?

How would someone go about doing this? What kind of clustering technique would need to be used? What would be the criterion that would need to be clustered on?

Note:
Hypothetically it would be important to use causal variables, not just time series/historical models. Would one of the other criterion be to cluster based on significant factors for each of the product-geography combinations?
Please let me know if I should elaborate on any of the points below.

I'm trying to implement char-level rnn in tensorflow but I had a few conceptual questions. From the way I understand it, seems like most people like to have num_batches per epoch, and each batch has say 50 sequences and each sequence can have 50 tokens (chars). Now we feed in all the first tokens for all the sequences in the first batch at once into the first input of the RNN. This goes through the hidden layers and we get our output char distribution. 

My question is, lets say we have two hidden layers and each hidden layer has 128 hidden units. If our sequences only has 50 tokens, what happens after the 50th token. My next question is for making predictions with our trained model. If we want to predict a 200 token long sequence, but we only have 128 hidden units, how does this work?

I've been reading a few papers, and did some small experiments, and it seems that neural nets sometimes do obviously stupid things, but not obvious for a neural net. 

Two examples to illustrate:

1) MNIST: I trained a net (followed an example) and looked at the wrong classifications. Sometimes, it would confuse a 6 and an 8. The 8 would often be an unfinished 8, so it would strongly resemble a 6. The thing is, a human would never confuse the two, cuz you can clearly see it was a 8 which wasn't properly finished. You can see the difference in were you start to draw an 8 vs a 6 (6 you start on the top, and 8 in the middle, hence the little ""dent in the middle left)"". This ""extra"" information, on how a number is drawn (were it starts and ends, etc) is not available to a neural net, but is to humans, and thus gives us extra information to classify a number correctly. 

2) I saw an image which was labeled: ""people standing under a table"", by a network. Obvious that is wrong, cuz people are smaller then tables (is 99% of the cases), so that would make no sense. It was a partytent, which looks like a table cuz it has 4 legs. Again, easy for me to use that extra information about a table being too small, and therefore it couldnt be a table. 

A few questions:
1) Doesn't the lack of ability to incorporate commonsense / world information, put a hard limit on how much better we can get with ml in its current form? It seems that more layers, and more neurons, or better activation, or better features, will not solve this? Or would it?
2) What is this problem formally called, ie, what should I look for when reading arxiv/blogs etc.
3) What are the solutions that are being tried here?

So for example you have a sentence like such: Be cognizant of products you frequently use

And the neural net would be tasked with changing the sentence into: Be AWARE of products you OFTEN use

Of course there would be another algorithm deciding which words are ""difficult"" and require changing.

For what it's worth, let's say I have a way to determine simplicity of words, I just need words to rank. This is what I imagine the ""work flow"" so to speak will look like:

1. Mark words that need to be simplified 
2. Feed the sentence into the neural net
3. Get neural net replacement suggestions
4. Rank the replacements from hardest to simplest and use the simplest one in the sentence

I was studying Pedro Domingo's ""A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning"" and ran across what seems to be a very counter intuitive assertion in Part 3 (It's Generalization that Counts)

Regarding the last statement(**bolded**):

""Notice that generalization being the goal has an interesting
consequence for machine learning. Unlike in most other optimization
problems, we dont have access to the function
we want to optimize! We have to use training error as a surrogate
for test error, and this is fraught with danger. How
to deal with it is addressed in some of the next sections. On
the positive side, since the objective function is only a proxy
for the true goal, we may not need to fully optimize it; **in
fact, a local optimum returned by simple greedy search may
be better than the global optimum.**""

This goes against everything I've learned so far (admittedly, limited to Andrew Ng's course)  How could an algorithm with a higher cost function be superior to one with a lower cost function?  is this simply a matter of the cost function not being the end measure of success, but rather success on test data sets?

For example you could just scale the gradient vector such that the magnitude of the linear approximation to the change in the loss function, before multiplying by the learning rate, is equal to the remaining loss. 

Without doing this it seems to me the linear approximation to the change we make when doing a gradient descent update could be drastically larger or smaller than the remaining loss. In which case it seems fair to guess the actual resulting update may be drastically too large (or small), and thus more likely to overshoot the minimum even given a fixed learning rate.

This seems like a simple and obvious thing to do but I can't remember ever seeing it discussed so i'm wondering if I'm missing something. Is this implicitly handled by most of the SGD improvements that exist? Or is there another reason it is not necessary or helpful.",6,0

303,2016-8-10,2016,8,10,13,4x0hbi,Natural way to specify arbitrary recurrent connections in networks?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4x0hbi/natural_way_to_specify_arbitrary_recurrent/,NichG,1470804049,"I've been implementing a number of attentional models, and it occurs to me that while we have very natural ways to set up feed-forward architectures or architectures with compartmentalized recurrent parts, we don't have a natural way to make long-range or arbitrary recurrent connections between different parts of a network.

For example, if I make an AttentionLayer in something like Lasagne, I could design it to take an input of some data X, and another input of sequences of coordinates Y, and then output views of X that depend on each Y. That's relatively straightfoward as long as the sequence of coordinates can be generated in a way that does not depend on the output of the AttentionLayer. It's globally feed-forward, even if the generator of the Y sequence is an LSTM or something.

But now lets say I want the results of the AttentionLayer from the first coordinate to influence the choice of the next coordinate. Now I basically have to wrap the entire coordinate generator inside the same layer class as the attention mechanism, because they have dependencies which would cross scan boundaries due to the way the recurrent layers are compartmentalized. In practice, the way I'd do this in Lasagne is to use a CustomRecurrentLayer and use its hidden_to_hidden functionality to wrap the entire sub-network.

The attentional case is pretty simple, but also things like Neural Turing Machines or Reinforcement Learning problems where you need to query some black box for the next data-point need things with this kind of structure. So it seems like it would be very useful to have a language in which you could specify these kinds of recurrent links as easily as we specify feed-forward or locally-recurrent stuff now. If nothing else, it'd enable a lot of experimentation.

Part of the design trouble seems to be that you want to say 'I'm going to receive something here from a layer I haven't defined yet, from the previous recursion'. So one idea would be to use a placeholder or socket or something for that. You declare something as a receiver of data from a previous iteration of the network, then let that receiver be used as an input to any layer. Later on, you call a connect method which connects the output of some later layer at t to the input of the socket at t+1.

Anyhow, the purpose of this post is:

1) If this exists somewhere, I want to know about it so that I don't waste a lot of time re-inventing the wheel

2) Spur discussion on this, to see if it would be possible to add this kind of thing to existing libraries or if its too far outside of the design metaphors they're assuming.",6,2

In the last few months, I have had several people contact me about their enthusiasm for venturing into the world of data science and using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to probe statistical regularities and build impeccable data-driven products. However, Ive observed that some actually lack the necessary mathematical intuition and framework to get useful results. This is the main reason I decided to write this blog post. Recently, there has been an upsurge in the availability of many easy-to-use machines and deep learning packages such as sick it-learn, Weka, Tensorflow etc. Machine Learning theory is a field that intersects statistical, probabilistic, computer science and algorithmic aspects arising from learning iteratively from data and finding hidden insights which can be used to build intelligent applications. Despite the immense possibilities of Machine and Deep Learning, a thorough mathematical understanding of many of these techniques is necessary for a good grasp of the inner workings of the algorithms and getting good results.

Why Worry About The Maths?

There are many reasons why the mathematics of Machine Learning is important and Ill highlight some of them below:

1. Selecting the right algorithm which includes giving  considerations to accuracy, training time, model complexity, the number of parameters and number of features.

2. Choosing parameter settings and validation strategies.

3. Identifying underfitting and overfitting by understanding the Bias-Variance tradeoff.

4. Estimating the right confidence interval and uncertainty.

What Level of Maths Do You Need?

The main question when trying to understand an interdisciplinary field such as Machine Learning is the amount of maths necessary and the level of maths needed to understand these techniques. The answer to this question is multidimensional and depends on the level and interest of the individual. Research in mathematical formulations and theoretical advancement of Machine Learning is ongoing and some researchers are working on more advanced techniques. Ill state what I believe to be the minimum level of mathematics needed to be a Machine Learning Scientist/Engineer and the importance of each mathematical concept.


1. Linear Algebra: Someone recently said that Linear Algebra is the mathematics of the 21st century and I totally agree with the statement. In ML, Linear Algebra comes up everywhere. Topics such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Eigendecomposition of a matrix, LU Decomposition, QR Decomposition/Factorization, Symmetric Matrices, Orthogonalization &amp; Orthonormalization, Matrix Operations, Projections, Eigenvalues &amp; Eigenvectors, Vector Spaces and Norms are needed for understanding the optimization methods used for machine learning. The amazing thing about Linear Algebra is that there are so many online resources. I have always said that the traditional classroom is dying because of the vast amount of resources available on the internet. My favorite Linear Algebra course is the one offered by MIT Courseware (Prof. Gilbert Strang).

2. Probability Theory and Statistics: Machine Learning and Statistics arent very different fields. Actually, someone recently defined Machine Learning as doing statistics on a Mac. Some of the fundamental Statistical and Probability Theory needed for ML are Combinatorics, Probability Rules &amp; Axioms, Bayes Theorem, Random Variables, Variance and Expectation, Conditional and Joint Distributions, Standard Distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Multinomial, Uniform and Gaussian), Moment Generating Functions, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Prior and Posterior, Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (MAP) and Sampling Methods.

3. Multivariate Calculus: Some of the necessary topics include Differential and Integral Calculus, Partial Derivatives, Vector-Values Functions, Directional Gradient, Hessian, Jacobian, Laplacian and Lagragian Distribution.

4. Algorithms and Complex Optimizations: This is important for understanding the computational efficiency and scalability of our Machine Learning Algorithm and for exploiting sparsity in our datasets. Knowledge of data structures (Binary Trees, Hashing, Heap, Stack etc), Dynamic Programming, Randomized &amp; Sublinear Algorithm, Graphs, Gradient/Stochastic Descents and Primal-Dual methods are needed.

5. Others: This comprises of other Math topics not covered in the four major areas described above. They include Real and Complex Analysis (Sets and Sequences, Topology, Metric Spaces, Single-Valued and Continuous Functions, Limits), Information Theory (Entropy, Information Gain), Function Spaces and Manifolds.

Some online MOOCs and materials for studying some of the Mathematics topics needed for Machine Learning are:

Khan Academys Linear Algebra, Probability &amp; Statistics, Multivariable Calculus, and Optimization.
Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications by Philip Klein, Brown University.
Linear Algebra  Foundations to Frontiers by Robert van de Geijn, University of Texas.
Applications of Linear Algebra, Part 1 and Part 2. A newer course by Tim Chartier, Davidson College.
Joseph Blitzstein  Harvard Stat 110 lectures
Larry Wassermans book  All of the statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference .
Boyd and Vandenberghes course on Convex optimization from Stanford.
Linear Algebra  Foundations to Frontiers on edX.
Udacitys Introduction to Statistics.
Finally, the main aim of this blog post is to give a well-intentioned advice about the importance of Mathematics in Machine Learning and the necessary topics and useful resources for a mastery of these topics. However, some Machine Learning enthusiasts are the novice in Maths and will probably find this post disheartening (seriously, this is not my aim). For beginners, you dont need a lot of Mathematics to start doing Machine Learning. The fundamental prerequisite is data analysis as described in this blog post and you can learn maths on the go as you master more techniques and algorithms.

I've dealt with baysian methods in machine learning in the past, and now I find myself working a lot with neural networks in learning models. Specifically, multi-layer neural networks and recurrant neural networks.

One metaphor I see again and again, is that classic diagram with 'circles' as neurons, with lines connecting each layer of neurons such that the network is fully connected, the lines themselves representing the weight of the signal from one neuron to the next.

As a learning exercise, I'm working to write a neural network from scratch, and then train it to do some kind of regression and classification. I'm going to start with a single-layer neural network.

Now, my understanding, mathematically, is that the 'best' representation of a single layer neural network is actually just a linear transformation. If we take the simple example of a vector of values, mapped to a vector of outputs, in the same dimensional space, we can represent a neural network like so:

$$w\_{2}A(w\_{1}x) = y$$

Where $x$ is an n dimensional column vector, $y$ is an n dimensional column vector, $w\_{1}$ is a matrix of weights (k by n), A() is a sigmoid function, and $w\_{2}$ is a another matrix of weights transforming the activation 'vector' $w\_{2}x$ back into the output space.

My understanding is that $w\_{2}x$ represents the activation signal sent out by each neuron (of which there are k, in this case), and each 'neuron' is basically represented by the thing that outputs that weight, which is essentially the dot-product of a row of the $w\_{1}$ matrix and the $x$ vector.

The process of training a neural network involves calculating the cost function as the difference between the calculated $y$ value and the true $y$ value, using the residual, and then applying gradient descent on the weights of the network.

So, how's my understanding? I'd like to read more on this, but I don't see many resources take a linear algebra approach which connects back to the standard neuronal metaphor. Any thoughts or suggestions? As a first project, I'd like to write a simple neural network to get the 'best fit line' to a 2D data set.

What methods/models would be able to learn under these conditions? Most machine learning methods I'm aware of assume IID data, and these scenarios would not allow this.

I think reinforcement learning typically doesn't assume IID data, although on a related note ""shuffled"" data can help (like experience replay for DQN). So I thought maybe considering RL approaches would help, but I'm not so sure.",8,2

[Github](https://github.com/Avmb/clweadv)  
[Poster](http://www.di.unipi.it/~miceli/cleadv-poster.pdf)

In this preliminary work I try to learn a transformation word embeddings from one language (e.g. English) to another language (e.g. Italian) without using any parallel dataset.

My hypothesis is that this should be possible because languages are assumed to have a hidden vector-like ""concept"" space (of which word embeddings are a crude approximation, although it may make more sense to consider sentence or document embeddings) and if different languages are used to talk about similar themes, the stochastic processes that generate these latent representations should be near isomorphic.

So my general idea is to use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn to match word embedding distributions: instead of transforming Gaussian noise to images, as it is usually done in GAN papers, I transform English embeddings to Italian embeddings.

Unfortunately this basic setup doesn't work since training ends up in the pathological state where the generator collapses everything into a single output vector, a known problem of GANs which I think becomes even worse in my case since I use point-mass probability distributions instead of truly continuous ones.

Hence I use adversarial autoencoders (AAEs): I add a decoder that tries to reconstruct English embeddings from the artificial Italian embeddings produced by the generator, using cosine dissimilarity as a reconstruction loss.

Using a few tricks to aid optimization (a ResNet leaky relu discriminator with batch normalization to increase the magnitude of the gradient being backpropagated to the generator) I manage to make the model learn.

Qualitatively, it approximately learns some frequent mappings, but overall it is not competitive with cross-lingual embedding approaches that make use of parallel resources. I don't know if it is just a matter of architecture/hyperparameters or if I have already hit a fundamental limit of how much semantic transfer can be done by using only monolingual data.

Comments, suggestions, criticism are welcome. Also, if you are at ACL 2016 in Berlin, I will present this work as a poster today (Aug 11) in the REPL4NLP workshop.

Will be happy if folks share any insights or help reframe the question. 

&gt;I have a dataset of photographs of forms (say 1000 images). Since the forms belong to about 50 different layouts (i.e. templates), I expect the corresponding images to be clustered. I want to visualize these clusters prior to performing any classification or advanced processing.

&gt;My approach is to compute a 64-bit hash for each image and reduce to two dimensions before plotting. Conceptually, hash(""img001.jpg"") = ""0100101...1"" (64 bits). When applied on all 1000 images, this yields a 1000 x 64 matrix. However, I have doubts about PCA being the right tool for the dimensionality reduction step.

&gt;PCA seems appropriate for quantitative-valued matrices with Euclidean distance metric. For hashes, the proper distance metric is different (Hamming distance, for instance). As a result, I'm not sure if the traditional PCA-based visualization would make sense.

&gt;What is a more appropriate dimensionality-reduction approach for bit strings with Hamming-like similarity measure? More generally, is there a better approach to visualize clusters of images than my current hash -&gt; dimensionality reduction -&gt; visualization approach?

I'm trying to get my head around Adaptive boosting, specifically the Viola Jones Facial Detection modified version.

I've tried to outline roughly what it entails, I was hoping that anyone could try validate what I'm about to write and any further questions afterwards.

(Using a positive sample set of faces)

1) Apply Haar like features of all sizes and positions within each 24x24 window.

2) Assign weights to all positive results that pass within a predefined threshold, as 1/N (N being the number of features that passed).

3) Apply passed features to each window and assign higher weights to features pass with higher contrasts.
4) Re-normalise weights so they sum to 1.

5) Generate new thresholds to increase the difficulty for features to pass.

6) Repeat step 3 through 5 till the end of the training set.

7) Build strong classifier from the most successful features (Highest weights) where the classifier includes information of the weights and feature type.


A few questions:


 - Is the strong classifier built after each iteration or series of iterations of the total training sample (maybe used for the cascading afterwards)

 - Does the Viola Jones Algorithm only train using a positive sample set (only faces)

 - On what reasons are weightings modified, popularity? Misclassification? Size of feature (larger features -&gt; Larger weightings etc??)

I might very well be way off the mark, any insight would be appreciated. Please be blunt, I'm only trying to learn.

Thanks in advance!

https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/936429/-solved-tensorflow-with-gpu-in-anaconda-env-ubuntu-16-04-cuda-7-5-cudnn-/#4880949

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md#optional-install-cuda-gpus-on-linux

UPDATE 2: For now I'm just using this Docker container: https://github.com/saiprashanths/dl-docker
Seems to work great when run with nvidia-docker. Thank you for all the comments!",30,20

Any insight?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4xei18/newcomer_questions_when_would_you_recommend_using/,BlueFolliage,1471020692,"So I'm just getting started with using Isomap, after a professor recommended it, for my research. I'm using stanford's isomap matlab package(http://isomap.stanford.edu) and am getting familiar with it by playing around by using Nba player's PER 36 min from the 2016 season(http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2016_per_minute.html). My understanding is that by using Isomaps, I can build a model(K-nearest neighbor) based off of my input thats an order of degree(dimensions) much less than the input, allowing for noise to be removed and trends to be discovered. 

My goal is to build a model around player positions, which will learn player positions based on the data provided, and then allow me to input in a new player and determine what kind of position he is most like(ex: Player A, 60% center, 28% pf, 8%pg, ...). So far I ran the isomap program 6 times: once for all the players, and 5 more times for each position where only players who play that position are put in. My output are the residual variances( calculated for K neighbors(2-10, 25, 50, 100) and for each K value, X dimensions(1-10). 

Now that I have this data, I'm really lost on what to do with them next and how to apply the models themselves. Any help, in the form of examples,analogies, or related projects would be very helpful.

I hope that I'm able to make this post as concise as possible so as not to waste your collective time. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read through it :D



I'm a masters student studying biomedical sciences. I majored in physics with a minor in mathematics. The year I graduated, physics funding was still down from the recession, so I did some coffee shop type jobs and took a break before ultimately being accepted into a masters program. I'm familiar with programming in Python and I'm just learning the fundamentals of Java. I have a good handle on calculus, basic physics, linear algebra, and applied statistics.



I want to take Udacity's nanodegree in machine learning, and in general, I would like to specialize in cross disciplinary computational biology. There's no way to know for sure if it will help my career, but it's interesting to me nonetheless. I'm currently doing little refreshers on java and linear algebra, but I'm finding that my physics education was completely devoid of **conditional probability**, and **stochastic analysis**. I reel at the sight of equations of the form P(x|a) = P(x)P(a|x = sum(xi)) &lt;-for the record, this probably is a meaningless equation and I'm aware of that.



There are three books I'm considering on the subject:

[An Introduction to Probability and Stochastic Methods](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Stochastic-Processes-Mathematics/dp/0486490998/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471103376&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=probability+dover)

[Principles of Statistics](https://books.google.com/books?id=dh24EaSrmBkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

[Probability: An Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Introduction-Samuel-Goldberg/dp/0486652521/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471103376&amp;sr=8-9&amp;keywords=probability+dover)

Which of these books make the most sense to rent from the library and start digging through? Or is there some other method of learning this information that I haven't considered yet?



Any other advice would be appreciated if you have some ideas! For the record I'm not that smart of a guy, but I'm generally decent with theory. My main goals in my career is to be able to work hard in a field I feel at least mildly adept at and be able to help contribute to our knowledge of biology (and if I make a little bit of money that would be cool too).

Of course, it would depend on the hardware, so let's assume that we're using the same gpu. -- and also say we fix the batch size. And of course the same cudnn/library (theano for example).
I also think it would better to have a 'reference' (or baseline?) system that we know how long it takes for each training sample. 

Very simple example: 
* If a convnet (input size 128x128), that has **one** convolutional layer (3x3 convolution and 32 feature maps) + batch mornalization + max pooling (very weird 128x128 max-pooling just to make it simple...), and then a fully-connected layer of 10 node (e.g., for MNIST) took 100s for one epoch, how long do we need to train a convnet of conv(3,3,32)-BN-MP(2,2)-conv(3,3,32)-BN-MP(64,64)-FullyConnected(10) per epoch? 

My understanding is: 

* First, matrix multiplication would be the most important here. Naive implementation of matrix multiplication of (NxM) x (MxK) is up to O(NMK) (or people just say O(n**3) for the simplicity). There are then some optimisations to speed up to O(n**2.3ish), but I don't know how it can be applied to this case. 
* I also don't know how much the batch process would help here - but I want to fix the batch size and just want to compare the time consumption of the configuration, not something due to HW/SW/batch size.
* There are forward path, backprop w.r.t. input, backprop w.r.t. weights, and they are represented with matrix multiplication, so for conv layer or rnn, we can compute the sizes of matrices that are multiplied. I haven't thought about BN/Dropout much. 

I can actually just run and see how long does it take. But I want to understand what affects the most - and how precisely we can at least approximate the time consumption. I assume it is highly dependent on something like how well the library/cudnn is optimised, but still! Is there anyway to *try* to compute it?

--------
**The Problem:**

Let's say I have a bunch of people that sign up for a free trial.  A percentage end up subscribing afterwards.  During the trial, users can take a variety of actions with my product, which I have logged in a DB in the form of dimensional event data, counts of activities, etc.

I want to understand what makes someone a ""qualified"" trial. Ie. someone who has a higher propensity to convert because they did X, Y and Z actions, and had certain ranges of values in their user data.

I understand that a basic classifier algorithm can tell me that, given all of my attributes that I'm looking at, a new trial is either likely or unlikely to subscribe.  However I want to understand what those combination of factors is so that I can better optimize for them.  For example, if they do action X, Y and Z, but had certain metric values greater than 5 in their account, they are 10x as likely to convert as someone who was otherwise equal but had &lt;5 for the same metrics. Thus, to improve overall conversions, I should focus my efforts on getting people to get that value &gt;5.

-------

Please let me know if I should clarify on anything and forgive me if this is a very poorly worded question.  Like I said, I'm just getting started, so not intimately familiar with all of the math and terminology yet, but eager to learn and dig deeper into concepts related to solving this problem so I can experiment with implementing something basic.",5,0

1. Taking the mean over the binary cross-entropy loss across each label (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_entropy_function)
2. Using the Hamming loss (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.hamming_loss.html)

I'm not interesting in using the zero_one_loss (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.zero_one_loss.html) as I'll very rarely have perfect classifications across all 100 binary labels.

Based on your experiences what are the pros/cons of using either the binary cross-entropy or the Hamming loss for a multi-label problem?",4,0

Many Demis slide decks with making the ""computer differentiable"" and ""learn algorithms"").

Yes, there are exploratory works and there has been some progress. But nothing to the effect I had imagined tbh (compare it with resnets or even ELU). And I haven't seen any paper that showed very good improvements with using them on real world tasks. Actually there are papers that say that Memory Networks are more easily trained and they have been applied to a wide range of real world NLP tasks with excellent results.

Also in NIPS Alex Graves talked about training NTMs to learn shortest path and other graph algorithms. Will the utility of it be in such symbolic tasks only?

Joe Blitzstein's answer on Quora **[3]** about the availability of 2015 problem sets for public states that they are not released to the public. (I don't have enough information to comment on the availability of the problem sets as I haven't gone through any of the videos as of yet. The class material page **[4]** seems to have the working links to notebooks followed in labs though). He suggests to watch 2015 videos and do 2013 assignments **[5]** - I guess it would be tedious to align these two though.

* IMO the most resourceful version would be 2013, given that it has all the assignments + solutions available **[5]**, it would be great if we could find the videos for this offering. 
A while ago, /u/Chrispy645 has posted a script **[6]** to download all the 2013 material which are now no longer hosted. Maybe someone that already downloaded them can upload them to Youtube?

I have a Feed Forward Neural Network that Predicts the next Character based on the last n Characters. I tried values of 4,5, 7 and 12 for n.  A Character is represented as a 28-dimensional vector, where 27 are one-Hot, the 
27th is space and the 28th is shift. shift + space are newline. 

I took Pride and Prejudice as training data.

KL divergence is my error measure and RMSProp with first and second order momentum and standard parameters 
is my weight update algorithm.

I tried batch sizes of 40,100, 400 and 1000.

After every step, i've put out 100 Characters of generated text.

The only network architecture that didn't end up to always putting out the same character or putting out Spaces was sine activations in all hidden layers and sigmoid in the output layer. The first layer after input was a wide layer with more nodes than input nodes. Then 4-5 layers, decreasing in size.

With a test training set only consisting of ""LOLOLOLOLOLO..."", it converged after 3 training steps with n = 4 and batch size 40, but diverges after that and never converges again. With the Pride and Prejudice set, it puts out total gibberish, no words whatsoever. The classification error is decreasing, but plateaus after ~100 training steps. It does model some probabilities, for example, a vocal is always followed by a consonant, there are never more than 3 consonants in a row, word length is realistic, shift is low most the time, but it hasn't learned that it should only be high after a space character. Also, i think the words sound somehow english. 

I can't provide output text atm because i'm not at home, i can do so in 7 Hours.

My intention behind the sine is that the Bias is far more easy to train because of the periodicity of the sine Function. I already trained some sine networks on MNIST and image regression, and got very good results with both of them. 

Is there any work on Sliding-Window Feed-Forward Neural Networks used for character-level text synthesis? ",4,1

I had read [Learning Deep Architectures for AI](https://indico.cern.ch/event/439520/contributions/1941519/attachments/1147353/1645461/Learning_Deep_Architectures_for_AI_-_Bengio.pdf), which claimed that (1) deep architectures can model exponential (with depth) number of regions, and (2) SVMs and regression are depth 2 and 1.
&gt; Depth of architecture refers to the number of levels of composition of non-linear operations in the function
learned. Whereas most current learning algorithms correspond to shallow architectures(1, 2 or 3 levels),
the mammal brain is organized in a deep architecture (Serre, Kreiman, Kouh, Cadieu, Knoblich, &amp; Poggio,
2007) with a given input percept represented at multiple levels of abstraction, each level corresponding to
a different area of cortex. Humans often describe such concepts in hierarchical ways, with multiple levels
of abstraction. The brain also appears to process information through multiple stages of transformation and
representation. This is particularly clear in the primate visual system (Serre et al., 2007), with its sequence
of processing stages: detection of edges, primitive shapes, and moving up to gradually more complex visual
shapes.

[...]
&gt; Section 2 reviews theoretical results (which can be skipped without hurting the understanding of the remainder)
showing that an architecture with insufficient depth can require many more computational elements,
potentially exponentially more (with respect to input size), than architectures whose depth is matched to the
task. We claim that insufficient depth can be detrimental for learning.

[...]
&gt; More precisely, functions that can be compactly represented by a depth k architecture might require an
exponential number of computational elements to be represented by a depth k  1 architecture. Since the
number of computational elements one can afford depends on the number of training examples available to
tune or select them, the consequences are not just computational but also statistical: poor generalization may
be expected when using an insufficiently deep architecture for representing some functions.

[...]
   
&gt;  If we include affine operations and their possible composition with sigmoids in the set of computational
elements, linear regression and logistic regression have depth 1, i.e., have a single level.

&gt; When we put a fixed kernel computation K(u, v) in the set of allowed operations, along with affine
operations, kernel machines (Scholkopf, Burges, &amp; Smola, 1999a) with a fixed kernel can be considered
to have two levels. The first level has one element computing K(x, xi) for each prototype xi (a
selected representative training example) and matches the input vector x with the prototypes xi
. The
second level performs an affine combination b +
P
i iK(x, xi) to associate the matching prototypes
xi with the expected response.

&gt; When we put artificial neurons (affine transformation followed by a non-linearity) in our set of elements,
we obtain ordinary multi-layer neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986b). With the most
common choice of one hidden layer, they also have depth two (the hidden layer and the output layer).

&gt; Decision trees can also be seen as having two levels, as discussed in Section 3.1.

&gt; Boosting (Freund &amp; Schapire, 1996) usually adds one level to its base learners: that level computes a
vote or linear combination of the outputs of the base learners.

&gt; Stacking (Wolpert, 1992) is another meta-learning algorithm that adds one level.

&gt; Based on current knowledge of brain anatomy (Serre et al., 2007), it appears that the cortex can be
seen as a deep architecture, with 5 to 10 levels just for the visual system.


 I'm looking for the simplest counterexample that SVMs/gaussian processes can't model - in the same way logistic regression can't model XOR. I haven't worked with kernel methods much, so I can't figure out one myself. Also, what does ""kernel machines with a fixed kernel"" mean?",44,42

I'm one of the founders of eBlur, the company responsible for creating Feedless, an AI Dota coach that talks to players in real time advising them about a bunch of different things. You can learn more about it on [our website](http://www.eblur.co.uk) and you can even download it and try it out for yourself.

We have a lot of features that we want to add to Feedless and some of the most ambitious ones require quite a bit of machine learning and data processing.

We have a system to download Dota match data at will, meaning we can put together a huge dataset of complete Dota matches.

We are looking for someone with machine learning skills to help us analysing the data

If you're skilled in machine learning and want to help developing an exciting new product with a small, agile and skilled team of engineers, just pm me so we can discuss it further.

Also, being a Dota player is obviously a plus! You don't have to be a pro but some insight of the game will go along way into figuring out what to extract from the data provided.

[EDIT] Huge thanks to everyone that pm'd me! I never thought we would have such a strong response from you.",9,16

I used to work for a deep learning startup, and we had an amazing data scientist who did an amazing job designing the technology. I joined the team a year into development and it was amazingly efficient to work with someone of such high class. We had a great time and the technology got acquired. 

Flash forward to now: I've been working on another app idea that involves facial recognition. I have some investors now, but they want to see ""Deep learning"" in the company before they commit. 

I've got a few questions. 

1) How difficult is it to build a CDNN today? With the company I was at it took them roughly two years to design the backend. Have things changed since then? Has research in the field decreased the time/cost that it takes to build these networks? We spent over 1 million, and the AWS charges/fees were around 40k a month. While the AWS fee haven't really gone down, that's not the issue. The real issue is the time. 

2) Where are the best places to go to find recruit this type of talent? I've done the craigslist/Angel list posts, but haven't had a ton of replies from people with experience with deep learning. I've done some searches with linkedin, but a lot of  people I find have already been picked up haha. 

Any replies are greatly appreciated!

I've got a problem I'm currently trying to solve using a CNN, and was hoping for some input on heterogeneous outputs and whether or not that's a bad idea.

The input to the net is a 360x140 black and white image. The images contain 8 alphanumeric characters of uniform size somewhere in the image, placed along the outside radius of a downward curve. The characters are rotated to follow the curve.

The output I need to get is three part: the 'font size' of the characters in pixels (falls between 50 and 70 pixels), the X and Y coordinates for 'upper left' of each character (if you were to draw a box around them), and the rotation of each character.

Is it a bad idea to attempt to train one CNN on all of these outputs? That would be 25 (3 per character + the font size).

Is it a better idea to train different CNN's on the three sets of homogenous outputs?",1,1

We are a growing fintech company currently having our business in 8 countries. What we would like to do is to base our decision in which country to go next, completely on data. Meaning that we would like to build such an algorithm that outputs us the country to which we should be expanding next.
Problem is that it is a small sample problem and applying something like regression would not really be sufficient solution in my opinion. Plus we have 8 countries which we consider to be good and 0 countries which we can tell by our experience to be bad.
We have many good ideas on feature engineering side but we struggle choosing the right algo. The only thing that came into my mind was to try to make clusters and hope that some new country appears to be in a same cluster that good countries are in.

The popular way is to use SGD. However, we know that SGD has slow convergence rate. We can only get an approximate estimation even with enough time. More over there is many tricks/heuristics to do SGD well.  
My idea is that we use mid-batch (~10,000 sample) l-bfgs. Each CPU core train one mid-batch using l-bfgs. Finally the yhats for each mid-batch is averaged. There are three obvious advantages: (1)easy for tuning (2) bagging/pertubation effect (3) speed (~10 miniutes on CPU), partly due to smaller network. The disadvantage is that mid-batch model is less powerful than full-batch model, however this disadvantage is reduced (since we have many mid-batches, I have a 56-thread computer:-) and acceptable as we accept SGD approximation.

I am currently looking into SVM's as a method for separation of data.


 I understand an implication for creating the quadratic form and passing it into a quadratic programming function however there are a few things that I dont understand.

Starting with a linearly separable dataset:

1.) with the quadratic form, there is this:
sum(i=1,M sum(j=1,M yi*yj*ai*aj*xi_TRANS*xj))

I understand that to find the alphas, or ""a"" in the above, you have to first run the quadratic programming methods using constraints. However, what is j? and what is i? if I have a dataset using x as an nx2 matrix of points to place in a 2-D space, and y being an nx1 matrix containing labels of each point, how does all of that information fit into creating the quadratic coefficient matrix?

2.) are there any sources one may have that has a walkthrough to create an SVM (excluding the quadratic programming -- I plan on using MATLAB's quadprog for that) from beginning with a dataset/labels and ending with calculating the decision boundary and plotting it?

If I am understanding the concepts I have learned correctly, NON-linear separation would just include using the kernel trick in addition, am I correct? just wanted to get a confirmation on that from someone who has had experience with this.

Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance to all!!",2,1

My network has a series of nodes that are randomly connected to any other nodes initially. Some are mapped to inputs, and some to outputs. Each node is connected to itself and so has at least 1 input (and recurrence). Node state can be from 0 to symbolcount - 1. For display convenience I am using 26 (internal states 0-25) and mapping ""A-Z"", but it can work with arbitrary number of symbols (such as 676 ""AA-ZZ""). Each node has a weight matrix such that for each input symbol, a value is added to a running total for each potential output symbol. When all inputs are added, the symbol with the highest value becomes the next output. Each input connection is also multiplied by a connection weight. During evolution of the network nodes can be added/removed (if not mapped to I/O), connections added/removed, connection weights adjusted, or the input symbol to output symbol weight matrix adjusted. Values are typically bound to +/- 1.0.  
  
I would like to call this a sort of finite state machine, for the network can be in one of symbolcount ^ nodecount states generally and the transition rules are deterministic, but it doesn't match any definition I could find for FSM (and even if it is one, what subtype?). One major difference is that the order of inputs doesn't matter, input string ""ABCD"" might as well be ""DCBA"" because of how it is added to form the next state. I used this method to make it more robust with respect to network structural changes; it incrementally changes the result (by the weight of the added/removed node), rather than completely changing how all other inputs are mapped. I also found it easier to understand what is going on visually with the state history than with SNNs - I was able to observe cyclic and chaotic string patterns and transitions between them as well as changes from one cyclic pattern to another given an input perturbation (while being unaffected by other input symbols). It leads me to think that this network is capable of using working and long-term memory structures while being near a critical point where recognized inputs cause transitions more easily.  
  
I am sure this is unoriginal, but I have yet to find anything like it (and thus, I have no specific term to describe it). In case you need a visual: http://imgur.com/a/q04ki (top: output history of selected node, left: network; colored nodes are I/O/selected, right: agent moving along X/Y axis on grid, tiles with various ""food"" values among other values).",4,0

I was wondering if there is any approachable paper/theory/book/algorithm that deals with regressions of n parameter vectors (or really any ML algorithm that can predict continuous quantities) which deals with the subject of predicting values while striving to be always above or equal with the highest possible values.

Obviously one approach would be implementing a regression (say ridge regression) on only the highest data-point in report to the parameter(s) that influence them (e.g. if for a parameter X there are 3 different values of Y, only take the highest Y), but this seems like quite a brute force approach and also a bit harder to apply when dealing with N parameter vectors instead of one.

**Is this a common setup?**

I mean it could be motivated in various ways, e.g.

* Less risk of vanishing gradients, as opposed to when tanh units are used in subsequent layers

* The sparsity induced by ReLUs could arguably be more relevant at later layers of processing (i.e. nice to use smooth activations for edges but more relevant to disentangle factors of variation for high-level representations).

1) It might show that I am serious about research in ML.
2) It might improve my chances of getting in a decent school. 

Recent papers in Computer Vision eg. most from CVPR 2016 ( something like this http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Noh_Image_Question_Answering_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf ) do not require much of mathematical understanding other than some basic concepts of deep learning. This might change in a couple of years and the research might require more theoretical understanding. eg. http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04485

I can read about this stuff on my own. I have tried it and it works.

I was halfway through the RNN chapter of the [DLBook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) and a thought came to my mind: *Why tying the weights instead of compressing them?*

In other words, we could simplify a model by modeling its weights instead of just tying them. Then, in principle, we could model the weights of this second model and so on.

This could be seen as adding more layers along orthogonal directions. The main advantage should be that our net can grow or reduce without breaking things (too much).

Modeled parameters are more than a compromise between free and tied parameters. In fact, modeled parameters might also depend on the input (or on part of it or indirectly) and thus appear to be *dynamic* and more powerful than static free parameters.

We could also use this method to make our net more powerful during training without wasting work already done. In particular, we attach to the main net a very simple ""parameter-modeling net"" and after some time we switch the parameter-modeling net with something more powerful (initialized or trained so that we resume more or less from where we left off with the previous modeling net). At the end, we have a main net fully trained with fully free parameters. Or we could keep going and make the parameters dynamic.
Instead of replacing the modeling net to make it more powerful, we could also model its parameters, and so on...

We could also use this strategy to automatically grow or reduce a net during training to adapt to the quality and amount of available data.",7,4

From what I've researched we are seeing simple game applications of voice recognition (like some games that use Amazons Alexa) and a few months back Google revealed how they had been able to achieve like 85% offline word recognition on a Nexus 5 (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.03185.pdf).

I have data which describes the state of the game 'S' and the action which a player takes 'A'. There are two types of players with different playing styles and they have different functions to decide their action, I call the functions A=f(S) and A=g(S)

I'd like to model f and g but I don't have any labels for which function is being used to make a decision. I'm interested in what methods are available for approximating these functions. My best idea for an algorithm is a bit like k++ clustering and it works like this:

1. Approximate f by using all the data

2. Split the data into two parts, the half which was best predicted by the approximation of f, and the half which was worst predicted.

3. Use the two data sets to approximate f and g with two models.

4. Like the k++ algorithm keep updating the approximations for f and g with the data that they best predict.

Generally betting against Python as the paramount ""scientific"" language in the next years would be silly. Reasons:

- It is backed by Google, Facebook and others
- It has low barriers to entry - making it easy for mathematicians, physicists, economists, quants... to join the community
- It is versatile - it can stand in as OO, functional or scripting language
- Its ecosystem is diversified - there is a huge long-tail of developers, not just a couple of big tech companies
- ... and of course, almost all of the most up-to-date machine learning and data analysis libraries are written with Python in mind

However, at my work, I am hearing an increasing amount of noise about switching to a Scala stack. This is mainly because of Apache Spark and its related libraries. To me, it looks a little boring for a machine learning engineer/researcher/romantic: out-of-box classifiers, machine learning as behemoth data jobs in the cloud, therefore an assumption of many-terabyte datasets (which denies the future of ML as standalone architecture). I am somewhat familiar with Scala, but see no way for the language to progress as the main scientific language in the community, because of these reasons and:

- Higher barriers to entry (stricter functional principles, less intuitive syntax, lots of vintage Java thinking/complication)
- A lack of backers in scientific/ML research
- Reliance on the JVM, which is far from universally native

Spark is probably unmatched just now as a tool for distributing jobs safely across clusters (thankfully you can still jam Python dependencies into Spark, although it's not straightforward). This is the only aspect of the market I see in Scala's favor.

What we really need is reinforcement learning which is much more powerful - that might include systems like autoencoders - but the key part is the reinforcement learning.

DQN was a great achievement for DeepMind, but I feel with since it's just the integration of existing technologies (CNNs, Q Learning, backprop, etc) 'owning' the concept is a bit of a stretch.

The glance that I had on my Quora feed compelled me to write this article.
As the century is gearing up with latest technologies like cloud computing and internet of things (IoT) , everyone has witnessed the amount of high-velocity data coming through various resources all around and we call this Big Data, which is the latest buzzword of the decade, hence big data brings it with the unstructured data that is useful only when the systematic analytics is done around, thus the demand of data scientist needed by organizations has been in vogue. Its ubiquitous to see that everyone wants to learn the skills to get into the trending things of today, but when I see questions on Quora it makes me feel anxious that how most of the aspiring data scientist just dont know where to get the guidance from.

The resources are limited and there are nothing mainstream to get the insights to get into the field, many of them are confused what major should they pursue to get into data science there is nothing direct for these young data enthusiast and many of them leave their aspirations as they arent able to get things right.

As being one of you I would like to solve this arcane puzzle through sharing my one-year of experience in the field of data analytics. So starting with the answer of most ubiquitous dilemma these days of the major to pursue as being a data scientist, Okay now I would like to tell you that data science is an interdisciplinary field that derives its roots from mathematics, statistics, economics and for sure computer science. My research concludes that for a data scientist technology is just a medium to apply the knowledge of the core fields that are math, stats, and economics. One needs to have good fundamental knowledge of linear algebra, calculus, advance probability, advance statistics &amp; econometrics, to create their own prompt data models of given scenario, these models should have pre-determined objectives that eventually help to drive the economics growth of the organization.

Therefore one can do any major provided it covers the above-mentioned subjects, anything that involves logical reasoning &amp; critical thinking is a good fit. Also, the hard fact is that your major would help you deal with partial knowledge through data science being an interdisciplinary field, you need to gain tremendous knowledge from your internet resources.

To summarize it I would like to tell that data science as the field is still in development phase, and in near future, the data scientists equipped with Artificial Intelligence skills will help society to unleash the disguised patterns of the data all around. In future, the information of a particular transaction would be much valuable than the actual value of that transaction.

Co-author here with a short summary:

The word2vec skip-gram model consits of two matrices which are learned, the word embedding matrix (from which the embeddings are extracted from after training) and a second matrix, of the same size, just before the loss, which we refer to as the ""output embedding"". 

In this paper we show that the word embeddings learned by this output embedding matrix preform almost as well as the ones in the original ""input embedding"" matrix, on multiple benchmarks of word embeddings.


The language model of [Zaremba et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2329) consists of a word embedding layer, connected to two LSTM layers, which are finally connected to a softmax layer. Like in word2vec, the softmax matrix (""output embedding"") is of the same size as the word embedding matrix.

We show that this output embedding preforms much better than the input embedding of the same model. By training a modified model, in which the input and output embeddings are tied (equal), we significantly reduce the model's perplexity. 

Finaly, we show that this weight tying can also be used to increase the performance of [attention based translation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473).

I have a collection of audio recordings tnat are mostly noise, but occasionally contain short bursts of meaningful signals. Think something like several minutes of radio static punctuated by occasional speech/music, or a recording of ambient highway noise with occasional car horns, etc. The content and timing of the hidden signal bursts is unknown, and typically has fairly low SNR. I'm looking for a ML approach to automatically slicing the recording into periods of noise and periods of signal activity. I know that the DSP community has done a lot of work on denoising, but at the moment I'm more interested in putting together an unsupervised learning approach to recognizing the presence of real signals, rather than some combination of filters and stuff to recover a clean signal from a noisy one. Unsupervised is key here, because labeled versions of the data I'm working with does not exist.

As a toy example to get started, I generated a bunch of sample data that's just a few minutes of white noise added to a signal that alternates every few seconds between silence and a pure tone. Taking the FFT and running k-means with k=2 on the result works very well in this simple case, even with very weak signals, since there's a clear difference between time points with equal intensity at all frequencies and time points with much higher intensity at the signal frequency, but I don't think something that simple will work when there might be more than one type of signal present, or when the signal present has more complicated frequency content.

If you look at the spectrogram of the types of recordings I'm working with, they will look like a mostly uniform background of empty space with some small colored blobs scattered around. Detecting those blobs really seems like something that should be easy to solve with machine learning as an image segmentation or object recognition process, but I'm really not sure how to approach it. Something with CNNs? Autoencoders? Whenever I try searching for relevant techniques, I keep getting results that are for hugely more complex problems -- searching for how to recognize objects in images gives you stuff like ImageNet, for example.

tldr: if you wanted to use machine learning to take [something like this image as input](http://i.imgur.com/nu1BXzL.jpg)  and output ""I see five blobs, with centers (x1,y1),...,(x5,y5)"", or put a bounding box around everything it thinks is a non-background object, or better yet, ""I see four of one type of blob with centers (x1,y1),...,(x4,y4) and one of another type of blob with center (x5,y5)"", how would you go about doing that in an unsupervised way?

&gt; there are 2 ^ {T U^ 2+U(T 3)} * 3^ {(U1)(T U)2} paths.


![](http://i.imgur.com/mrug6jm.png)  

Take a simple example with input length T=4, labelling length U=3. 

Say the labelling for the input sequence is `abc`, we can list all the possible paths (`-` represents a `blank`):

&gt; -abc

&gt; a-bc

&gt; aabc

&gt; ab-c

&gt; abbc

&gt; abc-

&gt; abcc


For this example, there are **7** paths in total. 

However, using Alex's formula with T=4 and U=3, the result is 2^-2 * 3^0 = **1/4**, not even an integer.

Goals: 1) Learn about some cool new ideas in ML!! I'd hate to sit through all the lectures and have it all go over my head. It would be too cruel a fate.
          2) Impress someone enough that they'll take me into their lab as a PhD candidate. Had good grades in undergrad + GRE's but honestly my undergrad was just such a weak school that I decided to spend a year improving my knowledge base before applying for grad school. Figure this will help to offset that deficiency (along with tons of studying of course!).


I've been an ML enthusiast for a long time and I just finished my undergrad (math) this past May so I decided to suck up the price and attend NIPS for the first time! I went now, I'd gain nothing from it but luckily I have a few months to prepare! 

Current strategy: Bought ""Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective"" as recommended on Talking Machines. I hope to get through most if not all of it by december. As I go through it, I keep finding new dependencies I need such as matrix/tensor calculus, probability theory in general, etc so it's been going a lot slower than expected! And of course I am experimenting with making new algos and using existing algos (at this point I'm super comfortable with tensorflow and all of scikit as well as a few other random tools) for analyzing various data sets (mostly non-public) and reading about 3 papers a week (although they are not all recent papers, just ones relevant to the speech problem I've been working on for the past few months). 

I have about 3 months of actual work time available - any ideas on key things to learn (or sections of math etc to skip for now) would be great!

My goal is to take m accounts and divide them into n territories based on their geographical distribution and sales potential. The challenge is to ensure that the territories are evenly distributed in terms of total sales potential with each cluster also being (relatively) geographically local. 

I have been testing k-means clustering which does a great job of clustering geographically. However, it is proving to be counterproductive when I include sales potential as an input since k-means will group objects that are similar. The resulting output tends to cluster accounts with similar potential sales value which then creates geographically scattered clusters. I have tried normalizing the sales potential values to reduce its effect but it does not help much. 

Is there a good way to break down the problem to achieve my goal? I am thinking of doing high level geographical clustering followed buy low level geographical clustering and then regrouping certain members of low level clusters to achieve an equitable distribution of sales potential but I'm not sure this is the most effective or efficient approach.

Finally, I'm not sure if I am asking the right questions. Is this a known type of optimization problem?

Due to limited hardware I'm starting with a small network, which unsurprisingly underfits. So now how do I know where the information flow bottleneck might be? For example, maybe I'm not picking up enough low-level features in the images, or maybe my initial state to the RNN isn't large enough to hold sufficient information about the text. 

Let's say an exhaustive parameter search like grid search or even fancy bayesian search methods are not an option. Is there any kind of intuition I can apply that can help with the design?

One idea I have is to try sizing the convolutional portion separately with something like an auto encoder. Then when satisfied with how well it trains, I could use those hyperparamers as a starting point for the full end-to-end model. Would that work or mostly a waste of time?",3,0

I was experimenting with ReLU and LeakyReLU for some time in feedforward neural networks and for me it looks like ReLU has no advantages over the LeakyReLU (besides being just very slightly faster to compute). In my experience, LeakyReLU shows at least the same or better results in most comparisons with ReLU, but moreover, it allows NN to learn in setups (architectures) where the ReLU fails. For example, it's the case where a NN architecture contains ""bottlenecks"" - very narrow layers with small neurons count. Many ReLU neurons in such bottlenecks can be and remain ""locked"" during learning which prevents gradient propagation and therefore NN can't learn to represent even a training dataset. LeakyReLU in the same scenario still propagates some gradient down the stack effectively allowing NN to learn.

So, I'm curious, did anyone investigate the question put in the subject line and what results did he or she get?

Thanks.",14,8

I've talked to him in the past about Machine Learning and he seems to have these ideas of throwing everything at it or parsing out specific parts of the data and then throwing that in a bucket with some magic and getting answers.

From my understanding (and small amount of experience) we take the data, normalize it, cut it up into pieces to build a model, train the model, and most importantly have a clear, direct, and simple question to ask of our data. 

Are there any simple and insightful resources out there for showing the extreme basics of machine learning? I've tried looking but everything I've seen jumps right into frameworks and tools. 

For instance, I remember an article that was parsing user feedback (text and a score they picked) and trying to predict the score based of text to the feedback. It went through parsing the data, normalizing, creating a bag of words, a model, training the model, and then further methods. I can't find the article now (of course) but it illustrated the ""simple questions"" aspect I am trying to drive home.

I think this is a interesting subject, and I wanted to start a discussion here.

As far as I can tell the take-aways from this presentation are:

* Subdivide your software into independent toolboxes.

* Create a new directory for each project you work on with fixed subdirectories, e.g. `html`, `tex`, `python`, `matlab`. Each subdirectory has the related parts of your project.

* Each project uses a fixed version of the toolboxes, e.g. by downloading a certain version from your repositories. This is so other researchers can reproduce your research exactly. But you also provide the ability to use the most up-to-date toolboxes.

Personally, I have a little bit of downtime which I'd like to use to free myself from matlab (moving to python+numpy+scipy), as well as to organize my code libraries sensibly.

It seems like smaller kernels like 3x3 are all the rage these days, and I'll often hear things like, ""it allows for more expressive power"" or ""can pick up on finer details"" but this seems opposite to me. Shouldn't larger kernels always have greater expressive power (assuming same number of layers and at a greater computational cost, of course)?

For example, let's say I'd like to discriminate between very small features, such as detecting computer typeface. Should this warrant larger or smaller kernels?

As a quick test I built a 1 layer convolutional auto encoder and as far as I can tell, lower loss and better output from visual inspection of the decoded images are highly correlated with larger filters. So this seems to support my intuition that information is lost after pooling that no matter how many 3x3s we stack with the additional non-linear transformations, it will never be able to capture the information we could have learned if we used a larger filter. Would love some confirmation on this, though.",4,1

&gt; The generalization error typically follows a U-shaped curve when plotted as
a function of one of the hyperparameters, as in gure 5.3. At one extreme, the
hyperparameter value corresponds to low capacity, and generalization error is high
because training error is high. This is the undertting regime. At the other extreme,
the hyperparameter value corresponds to high capacity, and the generalization
error is high because the gap between training and test error is high.

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization_error):

&gt; The generalization error is the difference between the expected and empirical error. This is the difference between error on the training set and error on the underlying joint probability distribution.

This means that in underfitting regime the generalization error should be low. I think the authors of that book are using a non-standard definition of generalization error. Do you agree?",7,5

I am considering expanding the instruction set to two byte instructions but am not sure the best way to do that; for example if one byte value is the ""add"" command, but the operands are implied by registers or pointers, it tends to work better, while having a destination pointer byte after the add command is less likely to work with relevant data to the algorithm. In real assembly language, data values often follow the instruction code (for example, 1 byte for a load EAX and then loading the 4 following bytes to the register). This can work, as can having a different pointer to data values that increments. I am just not sure which structure will work best when randomizing, mutating, or crossing programs together. ",0,4

I've never really done this before, so I don't have a lot of experience. I've only been taught technical information through lectures. When I learn something in class, to make sure I remember the information, and really digest it, I do problems from the textbook; they make me a lot more comfortable with the material.

Now obviously there aren't any practice problems for a research paper. So far, I've just been reading the paper and trying to make sure I understand everything. It's been going okay so far, but *I know* that I'm going to completely forget the paper in a few weeks, if not days.

I was hoping for some advice on what I could to make sure I really remember the material and understand it well enough to be able to apply it in different contexts. Practice problems are obviously not an option, so I was hoping for an alternative.

Here are some ideas I've had so far, please add to them:

- Write a page summarising the research paper. I find that writing something out in my own words can be very helpful.

- While reading the research paper, add annotations to different parts. This will make reading the paper more memorable, and it'll help me connect different concepts and thoughts.

- Try to teach a friend about the research paper. Teaching someone else can often be the best way to make sure you understand the content yourself.

These all seem like decent methods, but they all seem very time consuming. I'm happy to do them if need be, but I was wondering if there are other, faster methods that researchers in the field use to help them out with this. ",6,5

That is, people finding a function to describe the relation between some inputs and outputs, then calling said function a ""causality function""... or other such terms. e.g ""X, Y, Z have a strong impact on Z"".

Surely, I thought, this must be a mistake due to the author's mother-tongue not being English, however, I've seen this type of mistake, that is implying causality when a correlation is found, so many time, that I think there might be something I'm not understanding about this whole machine learning thing.

The way I see it, there correlation and causation stand as such:

Even if a relation can be established 100% of the time between event X and event Y (e.g. y =x*w), unless one can come up with a feasible explanation (e.g. one's that certain humans will find compelling on the ground of some scientific theory or, at least, philosophical trend, one that preferably can be generalized to other sets of data which share similarities with x and y).

Stating, for example, G = m*g, is a correlation, it can be observed but there is not necessarily any humane reasoning behind it.

Explaining that the earth (and any other object), exhibit a gravitational field that can be characterized by a constant (assuming the object is perfectly round), ""g"", which defines the acceleration of an object towards the center of mass of said object. Is a correlation, even though a poor one, ignoring many important aspects that related to gravitational acceleration.

In the same way, stating that, for a right angled triangle, ""the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides"". Is a correlation, it can be observed, but simply stating it, does not prove it.

There are then various proves for said theorem, that find a ""causality"" between said right angle and the relation. Some are fairly poor, relying on finite differences, others are more robust, but still assume that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees and other yet may change the relationship by assuming the sum of the angles in a triangle is less than 180 degrees.

Even if the prefect sine wave has a very exact relation in report to time, defining it amplitude, we can't assume a certain point in time ""causes"" the sine wave to be as such, only that it is correlated with said amplitude.

It stands to reason, then, that a machine learning algorithm would never be able to find causality, only correlation. Since none of these algorithms are able to quite ""explain"" their reasoning. Indeed, correlation seem to be a very objective and provable thing, causation is a more philosophical matter, one I would have assumed is left to human and possibly the more ""intelligent"" machines of the future to debate upon.

Am I getting something wrong here ? Mixing up terms or not understanding how a ML algorithm works ? Can one ever state that an algorithm that is able to learn to predict outputs based on inputs is doing more than finding correlations.",8,1

I am trying to train a front car view classification CNN with caffe by finetunning googlenet. Since I own some old AMD Radeon 7970 (3GB global memory), I am using the OpenCL branch. My dataset consists of weakly labeled car images scraped from the net and thus I am manually sorting it out, eliminating ""bad"" training images. Since this is a tedious work, I am curious to see the intermediate results as I am ""clearing"" the dataset and noticed the following:

* With ~30 classes and several thousand training images, I could use training batch size of 32 and testing batch size of 16 with no issues

* With ~160 classes and about 14000 images, I had to decrease training batch size to 28 and testing batch size to 4 to avoid running out of vram.

* With ~300 classes and about 30000 images, I had to decrease training batch size to 24 and testing batch size to 2 (!) to avoid running out of video memory

My images are split like 9/10 for training, 1/10 for validation. I am using the LMDB backend.

Since I am fairly new to this, my question is is that memory consumption behavior expected or I am doing something wrong with the train_val.prototxt parameters? Why is testing consuming so much more video memory? Does the memory consumption increase with the number of training images or the number of classes and if so why, shouldn't it be solely dependant on the batch size itself? Is that an issue with the OpenCL branch only?

Another question that bothers me is as I am iteratively finetunning (trained the first ~30 classes net for ~20 epochs using weights from bvlc_googlenet, changing the last 3 layers, then finetunning the resulting net with more classes, changing again the last 3 layers, then again the same procedure with more classes) - top-1 validation accuracy increases sharply for the first 1-2 epochs, then it begins to vary randomly from ~75% to ~85% without any further improvement (yes, I've looked at the training curve), should I decrease the learning rate?

Also, my dataset is imbalanced as some classes have up to twice as much training images as other classes, does that significantly affect the accuracy of classifying the ""underpresented"" classes or even worse - the accuracy of the net as a whole? If so, where approximately is the point where the training data is considered ""imbalanced"" (e.g no class should have less than x percent training samples as compared to any other or something).

Sorry if the questions are formulated badly (English is not my native language as well). 

Thanks in advance.",1,1

I'm working in the following scenario (with Python). I have a neural net optimised with SGD. Each datum is fairly large (let's say 10 megabytes) and I have a lot of data. The entire data set is too large to fit in the RAM. I can see three possible ways of working with this data.

1. Load each datum sequentially from hard drive. This is slow for obvious reasons.

2. Use multithreading (threading library). Then I can have multiple threads loading the data from the hard drive and putting them in the queue from which the main process is reading. This is working fairly well though it seems to me that GIL (https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock) is slowing me down. The computation of the gradient is clearly not really executed in parallel with reading from the hard drive.

3. Use multiprocessing (multiprocessing library). This is analogous to 2. though the implementation of the queue I need to use then is using Linux pipes which are limited to be very small, so the main process spends most of the time reading data from the queue in tiny parts.

Can you think of a more efficient way of implementing such producer-consumer problem for the purposes of SGD in Python?",0,1

this might sound like a stupid question and I'm sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong subreddit. 

Before I go into details, let me briefly let me give you a little bit of background information about myself. I'm a pretty fresh PhD student in the field of data analysis (few months in). I did my both my bachelor and master in the field in computer science with a focus on the areas of data mining/visualization/machine learning. In my bachelor my task was to identify similar gene expression patterns (using existing and some self defined similarity measures) and for my master thesis I compared documents using combinations of multiple available modalities like text, images, metadata, etc. Now I'm at the beginning of my PhD and although I already had one small accepted publications, I somehow can't shake off feeling like a fraud sometimes. 

In principle, I know how the techniques I'm using work, how I can apply them and how I can combine them to get the desired results.  But for me it seems, that the more papers and books I read, the more lost I feel. There are so many different niches, so many different theoretical backgrounds and so many different combinations of techniques, that I sometimes don't know if a given or self-constructed approach if or why an approach is the right or even the best one. Sometimes I think that I'm missing some fundamental basics, that would make sense of everything and put everything into it's correct place. However I don't know what I'm missing? When I'm dealing with computer vision I think that I should deepen my grasp on linear algebra, when dealing with networks or graphs it seems that my graph theory skills are lacking, same with text, timeseries, spatio-temporal problems, statistics, etc.

I'm aware that a huge part of my PhD is research and learning, but I can't help but feeling overwhelmed by diversity and scope of ... well somehow everything. That is why I'm now asking you now. Is it normal to feel that way? Do you have any tips or advice you could give me? Is there some core fundamental knowledge, that would help me to make some sense of everything thats going on in the machine learning domain?

Sorry for the long read, but I'm really looking forward to your answers and I would be really grateful to any advice you could give a new PhD student.",2,1

My background is in Physics, so I'm comfortable with doing plenty of math, but I did my studies some years ago, so a few things may have to go through a refresh.

I took Andrew Ng's course on Coursera and I thought the partial derivatives, and the linear algebra part, were pretty easy, and actually quite fun. But for statistics I'd definitely need a refresher.

BTW, does anyone know how many lessons are in Hinton's course, and whether it's self-paced or is it on a strict schedule? I'm trying to figure out how many weeks it would take to complete if I just stick to the default schedule (if any).",3,3

What I'm interested in trying out is automated denoising of an audio file. I want it to be able to distinguish between background noise and speech. It doesn't need to recognize the language, only needs to recognize noise vs. human speech. 

I'm not sure where to start on this exactly or what it would look like in the end. Here's my educated guess so far:

1. Use supervised ML to learn distinguish between noise and human speech. 
2. Write audio denoiser in MATLAB. 
3. Turn that into an executable file.
4. Automate so an audio file can be input, the machine distinguishes between noise and speech, then the denoiser automatically reduces the background noise.
5. Output the file at the same sample rate

Again, I don't have a degree in programming so it would take significant time for me to do all of this myself. I'm just trying to figure out how to do it (what languages it would need to be coded in, how long it would take 1 or 2 good developers, how much ""horsepower"" I would need for ML of audio files, etc).

1013,2016-8-31,2016,8,31,19,50gf8w,Top 3 Languages to build Machine Learning Algorithms.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/50gf8w/top_3_languages_to_build_machine_learning/,muoro,1472637605,"  
Here I come with yet another interesting topic to help budding data scientist, the article will help you to choose the best languages for developing machine learning algorithms. 
 
Machine learning is a process to build AI enabled algorithms with which machines are able to learn or produce codes automatically through analyzing the given data. 
 
Machine learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence and again has the intersection with many fields including math and psychology. 
 
Now after giving a brief introduction lets start with the tech part of the article:
 
After dong intensive research, I clustered these following languages, but please dont be afraid to learn the other programing languages because to become a competent programmer and data science you must know a dozen of tools to stumble upon one that works the best in a particular situation, hence you can't restrict yourself to a language or two. Again to mention different jobs are best done in different languages.
 
1)   R Language:

 
This language was developed to as a modern version of S language developed in Bell labs, R language is combined with lexical scooping, which tends to provide the flexibility in producing statistical models. R is a really powerful language to start with machine learning, as there are many specified GNU packages available. One can surely choose to use R for creating powerful algorithms and plus the R studio has an easy statistical visualization of your algorithms. Though the language is widely used in academic research and gaining really well recognition in the industry use most recently. 
 
2)   Python 

 

Python language is one of the most flexible languages and can be used for various purposes. Python has gained huge popularity base of this. Python does contain special libraries for machine learning namely scipy and numpy which great for linear algebra and getting to know kernel methods of machine learning. The language is great to use when working with machine learning algorithms and has easy syntax relatively. For beginners, this is the best language to use and to start with.
3)   C language:

The mother of all language is definitely a great programming language to build your predictive algorithms. Developed at Bell Labs by Denise Ritchie (google researcher and creator of going). This language is not a cakewalk and should be only be considered when you have strong fundamentals of computer science and programming languages, however, once you are proficient in C language then there is nothing that can stop you developing your advance algorithms. One does not need Ph.D. but knows the computer programming concepts thoroughly.  You can build your own regressions analysis and time series simulation easily, which would create strong machine learning algorithms. 

 

In conclusion, I would like to add that there are many other languages that you can use after going through  the above ones. Once you get deeper you can explore the functional languages like Haskell, Erlang , Julia and Scala, these tools need you to have good knowledge of C first. As a beginner, you can start with Python and move to other languages once you get the command of that.
