Following an SVM like approach, I'd like to project an n dimensional dataset into a higher dimensional (m) space such that all the data fall onto a hyperplane.   

Similar to SVM, the projection to the hyperplane could be approximate and robust (say as measured via cross validation).

The application is to gene expression data.   If I get many many measurements for a single cell type (say yeast), then all of these gene expression values should be constrained by the cell's physiology (+ noise).   One way to express this cellular constraint is by a projection onto a hyperplane, or better yet a nonlinear variant.

Does anyone know of an algorithm that already does this? ",0,1

I remember reading something about this earlier this year, but I can't seem to find where I read it, so I figured that I'd ask here.  It was about predicting the randomness of some amount of text using Markov chains.  You'd enter a word, and the program would say whether it thought it was random or not (possibly implemented in Python).  Does anyone remember reading about this?  Or, if not, any suggestions on how to implement?

My second question involved classifying text.  Say I have some text strings that are of certain classes (A and B):

A) SomeRandomTextString  
A) SomeRandomLongerString  
A) This.One.Has.Periods  
A) And_This_One_Has_Underscores

B) sh0rt  
B) bb  
B) 12*b$q)x  
B) arijwijqwoqqkf

Now, given an input string, I would like to see which class of strings it's closer to.  A simple approach would be to calculate the Levenshtein distance for the input compared to each string, but that's rather inefficient.  Does anyone know of an alternative method?

I have noticed that only a few schools seem to offer an explicit degree in machine learning (such as Carnegie Mellon, which also offers a joint degree in ML/statistics). The problem is I don't think it is realistic for me to get into CMU or other elite schools like that.
