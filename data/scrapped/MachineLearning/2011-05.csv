Like to teach binary (+) operator to computer, it does not need to be operators any kind of functions not data based classifiers?

Any keywords for searching is appreaciated. thanx.

Edit:
I mean for example when we want to build a car classifier. We provide machine features from car like length,
height, shape etc and label these features.And we train our classifier like SVM, neural network.
But if we need to do teach an operator or a function so there will be no data matrix. In this case what we should do?

Second Edit:
Sorry for ambiguity but simply what i want is a program which can learn mathematical operators like addition, multiplication by given input.

Example input can be several addition operations and results.

it can be supervised or unsupervised, does not matter.

I'm curious about approaches taken to this problem and the technical, statistical and philosophical underpinnings of it.

For example, if my sets are identical and both contain one banana, I could say they are 100% alike. But if one has a banana and apple, the other a banana and pear, how can I measure this?

As a starting point, I could give 1 point for a match and divide by the average length of the sets. In this case, my sets have 0.5 similarity, while the two bananas score 1. But I can see there are problematic implications here - sets with four matching items and length nine have a lower score but more matches. I'm not sure if this is what I want or not. Similarly, I can see there are consequences to deducting points when items don't match.

I'm asking such a broad question seeking general overviews of approaches and options. Are there any good articles about similarity which you could recommend? I'd also be interested to see some examples of different similarity measures used in different applications and discussion of why they were chosen.

tl;dr there's a lot to the concept of similarity - can you suggest some overviews?

The algo uses 2,3, or 4 rectangles to calculate a feature score. I'm wondering over what parts of the image it calculates this.

Does it calculate this feature score for each sub 24x24 image and then classify each of those sub windows as having a face and not? I read something about zoom levels and it seemed kind of confusing.

If it takes say a 640x480 image does it then split that into 27x20 sub boxes, apply the 2,3, and 4 feature things using the integral image for efficiency, and then using Adaboost does it say ""boxes 15 and 16 may contain a face"" is that basically how this works?

I've just finished my first week, and have:

* Read a bunch of online material to get an overview of data mining.

* Read several chapters from [*Data Mining* by Witten and Frank](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Practical-Techniques-Management/dp/0120884070/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305991819&amp;sr=1-2).

* Played with WEKA, mostly to learn how to use it. (And sworn at the ARFF file format).

* Worked a bit with MS SQL Server and Excel PowerPivot.

* Installed Excel's Data Mining plugin.

There's a *lot* of data for the project, but I myself have downloaded and am working with six databases, each of which has approximately six million rows. It's about some pretty complex engines, and has several years' worth of readings from several dozen sensors. I think it's supposed to be tied to events (engine turns on, turns off, overheats, fails, etc.) but that column is blank.

Recently, I had the following conversation:

&gt;Me: I have all the software installed and more-or-less know how to use it. So...what am I supposed to be *doing*?

&gt;Boss: Oh, just play around with the databases and see what you learn.

&gt;Me: Well, I started doing that, but I feel like I can't really discover anything useful without having the readings tied to events...

&gt;Boss: No, there's a lot you can learn without the events.

&gt;Me: I mean, while learning WEKA I made really trivial observations, like, ""The temperature and pressure have a strong positive correlation"", but--

&gt;Boss: No, that's a good thing to know!

&gt;Me: Oh, well, um, okay.

For reference, here's a simplified version of the data I have:


Timestamp| SensorID  | Value | Unit
----------|----------|---     |
1/1/01 0:01| 1          | 478    | PSI
1/1/01 0:01| 2          | 50 | Ft/sec
1/1/01 0:01| 3          | 0 | 0=off; 1=on
1/1/01 3:23| 1          | 485 | PSI
1/1/01 3:23| 2          | 55 | Ft/sec
1/1/01 3:23| 3          | 1 | 0=off; 1=on


And here are my problems:

* I have a number of issues with actually manipulating the data into a useful form. I can figure it out eventually, it's just not streamlined at all. If you're interested, [here](http://pastebin.com/mj4epk8N)'s a description.

* I feel like I'm obsessing over stuff like my ARFF files just because I'm not actually sure what I'm going to do with them once they've actually been loaded into WEKA. It's also a much easier problem to solve, and tricks me into feeling productive when I do solve it.

* My boss told me to read up on Naive Bayesian classifiers, which I did, so I'm probably the most knowledgeable about how to classify stuff. However, as far as I know, I have no classes in which to put stuff (if I had the EventIDs, I'd imagine it'd be massively useful to be able to classify things into events...) I'm actually a bit unsure about what I *could* do...I guess I could make a model to predict the reading of one sensor based on the readings of the other--but when would that be useful? If you can get all but one reading, odds are you can get the last one too. I guess I could also try to predict stuff based on the previous readings (which would probably be useful, actually)...but without knowing if the engine is on or off or whatever, I'm guessing it wouldn't be as accurate as one would hope.

* Ooh, I guess I could discretize everything, and *then* I could classify stuff, right? Is this a good idea?

So I'm unclear about what my objective is, and I have only a shallow knowledge about how to achieve any objective I might have.

In case it's useful--I *do* know how to program (in Python, Java (I even have a Real Job doing Java development), and Lisp (I won prizes for a pretty cool genetic algorithm that generates AIs for games)), I took AP Statistics (which so far has not been remotely useful, unfortunately). I'm just quite clearly in very new territory (and don't get me wrong--I'm really happy to be learning new things. It's just pretty uncomfortable, too.)

So I'm sorry if this has been kinda long and unfocused. I'm just overwhelmed and am hoping that you guys will have some words of wisdom.

Thanks in advance.


---------------

TL; DR - I have a stack of data that I'm supposed to get information from. The data is readings from sensors on a large engine (and thus has the pressure, temperature, and other parameters from several different locations) taken periodically over the course of several years. There is no *specific* thing I'm trying to find out. I think it'd be useful to be able to take a set of readings and predict the next one, but that's just me--I could be wrong. Rather than blindly running promising-looking algorithms and seeing what happens, I'd like suggestions on what I should be looking for. I'd rather have an objective and then select a method based on it than do it the other way around.",10,26,False,self,,,,,

So I do understand the core concepts, but currently I'd be more likely to write my own implementation than use something off-the-shelf. Which I know is a bad idea!

I'd really appreciate your help MLdit!",0,1,False,default,,,,,

I'm about to start a PHD in the fall in computer science focusing on Machine Learning and Information Extraction. I am aware that faculty positions are hard to come by and may not be the best fit for me in the future, and I was wondering what the industry jobs prospects are there for people trained in Machine Learning at the advanced graduate level. 

The program I am accepted into is a well ranked one and has some famous professors in the field I can work with. 

If you have one of these sorts of jobs I would like to know the following:

* Do you regret the time taken to get your PHD?
* Are you happy with your salary?
* Do you find the work stimulating?
* Do you find this sort of work isolating (Could someone who defines themselves as an extrovert work in your job)?
* Is there an ability to move up and progress at your job or is it dead end?

Thanks in advance.",51,37,False,self,,,,,

My background is in econometrics, and statistics.  I'm proficient in SAS, and R.  I'm currently in university for a MS in stats.  As part of our program we have to choose a minor, I wanted to take an ML course, but there were at least four prereqs. including learning C++, advanced data structures, mastering recursive algorithms, etc..

My question is, how much do I need to know to start doing reasonable stuff with ML in R using existing packages?  Are there any good books for people specifically lacking in a CS background?  While I believe that I can accomplish anything I set my mind to, how far behind am I?  Is it reasonable to think I could be competing (at least middle of the pack) in Kaggle competitions using ML in two years?

I'm confused about why correlated predictors don't mask each other when the Mean Decreased Accuracy variable importance method (where the values of the predictor are permuted over the out of bag set) is used. Under my current understanding of this method, correlated predictors, even if strongly correlated with the target variable, would show a low importance because the other would act as a surrogate when the one is permuted. Maybe someone could point me to a link that explains this. Thanks!

Breiman says the following, but I don't understand the last sentence:
""My definition of variable importance is based on prediction. A
variable might be considered important if deleting it seriously
affects prediction accuracy. This brings up the problem that if two
variables are highly correlated, deleting one or the other of them
will not affect prediction accuracy. Deleting both of them may degrade
accuracy considerably. The definition used in random forests spots
both variables.""

Further research found one study showed a statistically valid results in predicting earthquakes from EM activity. cite http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1549778

Now given that not all EM activity is from earthquakes, something more is needed to give accurate detection/prediction.
Now for my questions:Is there publicly minable data of EM occurrences, and seismic activity? Has much research been done using Support Vector Machines/Genetic Algorithms/Neural Nets as a training model for earthquake prediction, and if so, what problems have arose from these techniques?
