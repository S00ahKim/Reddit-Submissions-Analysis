So when I am presented with algorithms(example: hypothesis function for logistic regression), I find myself forgetting the actual algorithm. Yet I still understand the concept itself. I feel that part of the problem may be the fact that when I try to look up the derivation or explanation of the algorithm itself, most of it goes well over my head since I have not taken a calculus class yet(currently taking one). I understand the concepts of how it works in general, but I tend to have trouble remembering the specific formula/algorithm and I never really understand where it comes from.

Any recommendations for the best algorithms or papers on this problem? Any results for using CNNs for thing like this, or maybe even using RNNs to matching specific animations(sequences of images)?

I figure I could use a binary classifier to find out which characteristics have strong positive predictive value, but I was hoping to learn some new tricks. Is something like the Kullback-Leibler divergence applicable here?

I have a 500MB data set, and started with models using 10MB of it. Once I got those working well, I went to 20MB, then 50MB, then 100MB without too many issues. 

1. My validation loss begins close to 3.8. In most cases it will extremely quickly drop to 1.4 or 1.5, then decrease towards my current best of 1.1-1.3 depending on my hyperparameters. Sometimes if I let it go for a while the validation loss moves up and down a bit. I took the low points of these checkpoints, and made the learning rate smaller. This got me pretty good gains. I then kept doing this with smaller and smaller learning rates. My intuition is that with large learning rates you can jump over local minimums. I can only get into the local minimum with a smaller rate. Each time the validation loss goes up and down this is a new potential minimum that I can explore with a lower learning rate. Each time I jump over it, I have no idea how low it might be. Is this accurate? If so I can just let it drift up and down at the high rate, then take each of my low checkpoints and turn my rate down and start from those, then rinse and repeat for ever smaller learning rates. I've decreased my validation loss a lot doing this, but maybe I'm just overfitting? Or maybe just reducing my rate when it starts to level off is the only thing that matters, and I don't need to worry about picking these minimums?

2. I tried to make the jump up to 200MB and now it isn't converging at all. I made the net sizes a lot larger, I have ~50million parameters (3 layers of 1800). My 100MB dataset was converging fine with ~20million paramaters (3 layers of 980), though I think it was underfitting by a bit. I still got my best results using the 100MB dataset and model. Do I need a smaller learning rate, or are there other tricks once the model starts getting pretty big? I'd like to use my entire dataset if I can, and my cards can handle pretty large models. I should probably just lower the size and/or learning rate and increase it until it stops converging, but was hoping changing a different parameter might be a faster/better way of going about it.

How can temporal coherence be achieved ?

I have some fuzzy ideas, but as I'm not a deep learning researcher, I don't know if and how they can be applied:

* using optical flow to penalize strong changes in style application while optimizing the image
* using recurrent neural networks to remember the last style application and reapply this on the new frame

To be concrete lets say we have a convolutional network and we leave the number of features in each layer as free parameters. Obviously this would be a little nontrivial to implement as it would have to be done in a differentiable manner.

One way I could see this working is training the network with one additional feature per layer but with the outputs of these features weighted by a softmax over the layers. This way the network would have to select where it was most valuable to have this partial feature. Presumably we would regularize the weights so that the partial features were actually inferior to full features.

After allowing the network to train like this for a while we could just take the partial feature with the largest weighting (possibly weighted by computational cost of the addition) and actually add it as a full feature to the network. Iterate until we reach some allowed computation budget.

And opinions on classes",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3n71r9/unusual_question_about_types_of_companies_dealing/,ThrowawayTartan,1443762327,"Hey there! 

**Question 1**So I understand that this is a somewhat strange question but I was wondering if anyone knew of any other companies like Palantir which deal with using data to ""make a difference""? 

Okay, I'm exaggerating of course- I think most people feel like their data is making a difference. I'll explain myself more: I'm currently looking around to apply for internships over the Summer of 2016. Last Summer I dealt with data related to health, and predicting if a user would get injured and such. It was a lot of fun, but it was a young startup and it came with a lot of great things, but also some things that weren't necessarily great: 

i) the nature of it being a startup meant that often the data was sparse and I had to get it myself/ I had to do a lot of ground-up work.
ii) There were a lot of deliverables: meaning there were times where efficiency of an algorithm wasn't necessarily what mattered, where a lot of it felt like Google and Stack Overflow were my answers and I wasn't using the best thing that was out there/ approaching the problem the right way.
iii) In some sense I was working with data but with the end goal of a product in mind. The objective was to sell the product, and to sell the product we needed some degree of accuracy. What I imagine/ I'm thinking about in a company is a company that is concerned with making sense of what is happening and then selling that (so kind of the reverse of the startup)

**Q1: Tl;dr care to recommend data companies that deal with ""important data""? Only caveat is that it needs to be in Europe or in America.**

**Question 2** I've been considering a double major in statistics and machine learning to help me in an application to grad school but I don't know how rigorous it actually is. My school is pretty decent when it comes to ML but the courses required for the double surprised me in that they seem more focused on statistics and less about math? Anyone have opinions on whether I should just switch or do the courses that I think are relevant [stat-ml](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/new-majors-launch/program/stat-ml.html) I've been thinking about taking algebraic structures(might just skip this), [linear algebra (really really old syllabus)](http://www.math.cmu.edu/~handron/21_341/03spring/sched.html) - has a pre-req of [matrix algebra](http://www.math.cmu.edu/~handron/21_241/schedule.html) and real analysis on top of the classes that sound more technical on that list. The classes on that list that I think are technical and haven't actually taken yet are 10-701, 15-351, 10-605, 36-401 and 36-402. The others I've either already taken or I think aren't that math-inclined. My problem is that I don't have much time left here so I can't do everything or I definitely would.

**Q2: Tl;dr What should I take classes that are rigorous but not a major that supposedly prepares you for grad school, or a major that supposedly prepares you for grad school (and I get the fancy cert) but I don't think prepares me well enough for grad school.**

If you feel this is inappropriate, please delete the question.

I am looking for methods to calculate a reasonable similarity metric or clustering for my data. I have data in the form of a number of distinct events (lets call them A, B, C, D, ...), and the time between the events. A few example data points could look like,

    X1 = [(A, 0), (B, 2.2), (C, 3.2), (A, 4.0)]
    X2 = [(B, 0), (C, 2.2)]
    X3 = [(B, 0), (C, 2.2), (D, 4.2)]
    X4 = [(B, 0), (A, 2.2), (E, 1.5)]
    X5 = [(B, 0), (F, 2.2), (E, 1.5), (F, 5.0), (G, 2.0), (H, 2.0)]
    X6 = [(B, 0), (A, 0.0), (E, 1.5), (F, 5.0), (G, 2.0)]
    X7 = [(I, 0), (J, 0.0), (K, 1.5), (L, 5.0), (M, 2.0)]

To explain the format: each entry in the array is in the format event, time since first event. E.g. for X1, at time=0, event A happened. At time=3.2 (after event A), event C happened, and so forth. Also note that multiple events may happen at the same time. 

In reality, the sequences are typically much longer (50-100ish). The ""vocabulary"" of events is 1500ish. The time between two events ranges from 0.0-100.  

I have a good few million data points, give or take, so I have been trying to look into a clustering based approach. From the above example, I would expect X1, X2, and X3 to have some similarity (X4 maybe, since the pattern A-&gt;B is just reversed). Also, X5 and X6 should be fairly similar. X7 should not have any similarity to any of the patterns. This is a somewhat fuzzy explanation, and that is intended. I am not looking for the one method that clusters perfectly - I am just looking for one that does an OK job taking all variables into consideration

I have been looking into things like Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Self Organising Maps, unsupervised Recurrent Neural Networks, Autoencoders, just counting the similarity between triplets, ...

My major problems in finding something reasonable has been,

1. The method expects an equal number of features
2. The method sees the sequence as a bag-of-words
3. The method does not implicitly handle a mixture of categorical and continous data
4. The method has no notion of time
 
I put some very broad categories on this question, simply because I am looking for suggestions or pointers to software/papers. 

Any help would be much appreciated, and please do comment if something is not clear.

In order to do so, they include in the training cost an ""invertibility measure"", which is the sum of the logarithms of the condition numbers of the weight matrices.

I have two issues with that. First, computing the condition number has O( n^3 ) complexity, where n is the dimension of the square matrix. Second, and more importantly, in order to use this term in the training cost, you need to compute its gradient w.r.t. the weights. Technically, if I understand correctly, the condition number is differentiable almost everywhere, but all the algorithms that I've seen are quite complicated, involving matrix decompositions and iterations, and I doubt you could successfully backpropagate through them, hence you would need to estimate the gradient using something like the finite differences method, which would be very expensive.

So my questions are: is this ""invertibility measure"" really needed, given that you initialize with an orthogonal or near-orthogonal matrix and almost all square matrices are invertible? (The authors themselves claim that the invertibility measure didn't constrain the model by much in their experiments).  
If it is needed, how do I compute its gradient?

What I mean by this is that we take a NN for vision, one for NLP, one for voice recognition and so on. Then we feed the last hidden layer of each NN as input of all the NNs, communicating context between all the NNs.

Everytime I see or read things about neuroscience, they always say how we activate other parts of the brain when we think about something and how other senses interact together. How we activate specific motor parts of our brain when we think about a task that involves moving those muscules. How we activate the fear module of our brain just by remembering a traumatic event.

But in ML, we always do single tasks, with the expectation that training a single task well will get better results than having the cooperation of many modules harder to train.

I find Imagenet especially ridiculous as we try to learn everything from vision only. I would intuitively expect having a NLP module would massively increase context understanding. Same thing with sounds. We see many things about videos but they often just are conv nets where we feed several pictures at once to see motion, just by adding more channels. They are not multisense architectures. They are just a convnet trick.

Also, another related topic is general intelligence. It seems obvious that our brain works by having a few dozen modules connected to each other as a graph and that our complex decision making just comes from having modules competing against each other.

But I never saw a paper that tried to create a generalised architecture to have many modules interact together. A universal handling of context, independant of the type of network used inside the NLP RNN, the vision convnet and so on.

For example, we see many NNs to do picture description these days. They are simple convnets, where once trained we put a second NLP module to generate a sentence based on the last hidden layer of the convnet.

But there is no looping. There is no mechanism so that while writing the description, the NLP module calls a third module ""attention manager"" to zoom into a part of the image, redo the convnet forward computation and then we have a more detailed input for the NLP module, so that the description is more accurate. That would be looping, the NLP module would not simply describe the output context of the vision module, the NLP module would tell the vision module to provide more details on a part of the image.

Of course, this would be dirty and full of tricks, that's why I spoke before of a having a generalised way to feed ouput layers into input layers of all the modules, so that ""contexts"" are helping each module to do a better job.

What I said is a little messy, but my question is: Why don't we see more work on generalised architectures with lots of modules instead of massive single module, purely feedforward, single task, AIs ?",9,8,False,self,,,,,

I'm trying to find a function from word vectors from one language (dutch) to
word vectors to another language (english).
The vectors are generated using word2vec and a have a fixed size of 300.

Translation is done by activating the network with the associated dutch word vector
and the finding the closest word vector in english.

The only thing I thought which could learn that is a neural network. After some
trial and error, the best model seemed to be a nn without hidden layers. The
activation function is: `f(x) = tanh(W . x + b)`, with `W:[300x300]` and
`b:[300]`.

The error is defined as `sum((prediction - expected)**2)`.

While training the error rapidly drops from around 1300 to 500, but after a
few hundred iterations it doesn't change anymore.

Training algorithm is minibatch SGD with L1 and L2 regularization and dropout
(tried p=0.1,0.3,0.5). Without dropout the error would rapidly converge to small
values on the training set, but raise to values of about 5000 on the validation
set. I only have about 4000 samples to train on.

All inputs are normalized to mu=0, sigma=1.

Unable to get better results, I tested the network on a few words, which showed
some interesting results, the most reasonable showed below. Numbers shown are
the error values.

Now, I'd like to know; How can I make this model perform better?

Are neural networks the right solution here and is the network used not way too simple?
Are there some algorithms that would make it perform better?
Or is the problem more fundamental and does such a mapping not exists?

In the former case, I have to update gradients for all weights at every step in the training process, whereas for the latter case I only update weight gradients when the weights themselves are being updated.

Some papers (e.g. the DQN Atari Nature paper) claim that they use stochastic RProp because it causes the update process to remain constant as a function of the number of weights. This implies that all weight gradients are not calculated every frame since, in that case, computation would scale with the number of weights. However, I haven't found an explicit description of the correct procedure (at least not one that I could understand).

-----------

Following Nando's notation (replace x with h in the paper), dh\_i/dh\_{i-1} is clearly a Jacobian matrix since we're taking the derivative of one vector with respect to another one. 

Let h be an m-dimensional column vector as defined in equation (2). Ignore the bias and the weighted input since they are constant during our differentiation and thus unimportant. We are thus left with h\_i = W(h\_{i-1)}

We're therefore looking for dW(h\_{i-1)}/dh\_{i-1}. Now W is a constant, it isn't a function of h\_{i-1} so by definition we can take W out:

dW(h\_{i-1)}/dh\_{i-1} = W(d(h\_{i-1)}/dh\_{i-1})

2) I then made it so it fits the model, then scores it, and I found that the cross_val_score was consistently lower than just scoring the model using its own method. Whose side is the error on?

I. Are there any best practices in organizing datasets for training a CNN? i.e. number of classes and number of samples for each class? For example if I was training on Vehicles, would I be better off either:

(a) Vehicles - Car-Sedans/Car-Hatchback/Car-SUV/Truck-18-wheeler/.... (note this could mean several thousand classes), or 

(b) have a higher level model that classifies between car/truck/2-wheeler and so on... and if car type then query the Car Model to get the car type (sedan/hatchback etc)



II. How many training images per class is a typical best practice? I know there are several other variables that affect the accuracy of the CNN, but what rough number is good to shoot for in each class? Should it be a function of the number of classes in the model? For example, if I have many classes in my model, should I provide more samples per class?


III.  How do we ensure we are not overfitting to class? Is there way to measure heterogeneity in training samples for a class?


Thanks in advance.

The problem that exemplified in my head is, if a maxout unit outputs 0.9 as its activation, it has two possible source for it which is hidden from the following layer. That is, the next layer  is unable to uncover whether 0.9 is coming from the first linear piece or the second (given a 2 pieces maxout units). 

For making the problem more concrete, suppose you have two different filters capturing corner and horizontal edge. Assume these are the competing functions of a maxout unit. Given two different images with a horizontal edge and a corner respectively, final maxout unit activation can be same where as, in essence, one of these filters is activated for corresponding shape.

I think I understand the general idea, but I'm a bit confused about how reconstruction occurs. The encoding works as so:
    
    input -&gt; convolution -&gt; max-pooling -&gt; hidden autoencoder layer

Then, to reconstruct, we want to ""undo"" these layers:

    hidden autoencoder layer -&gt; undo max-pooling -&gt; new convolution -&gt; output

The first thing that throws me off is how to undo the max-pooling layer. The linked paper says nothing about this step. Maybe they don't even do it? I think it might even be reasonable to go directly from the hidden autoencoder layer to the output?

I absolutely love Keras, and would highly recommend it. Their examples are great.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to take raw words, and make a word dictionary (word_index) and then based upon a list of words, input it into a lstm

For example, Take the sentence ""The cow jumped over the moon"" is first converted to 

    ['the', 'cow', 'jumped', 'over', 'the', 'moon'] in a list form. 

I have made a word index for all words that I will use, where each word is assigned a unique number.

the =1, cow =10, jumped =5, etc to get:

    'the cow jumped over the moon' is translated to: ['1','10','5','7','12','28']

But this is where I get stuck. How do I feed this list of numbers into a lstm and RETAIN THEIR ORDER. 

I see that keras has the one_hot function which might be useful in this case.

The main thing is that I need to retain the order of the words. I don't want to scramble them or anything. I really appreciate any help. 

P.S. I have looked very extensively at all the keras examples, including the text-generation one. The main issue with this is that it is character based. I have tried converting it to using words, but I think their might be a more efficient way.

I dropped out of high school and left the home I grew up in to go to university when I was 16. I dropped out of university and moved to Tokyo to learn Japanese when I was 19. I returned to america, taught myself how to code, and have been making 6 figures as a programmer for almost 2 years now.

Every decision I've ever made has been made with strict consideration to maximizing the return on my investment (of time) - making me as marketable as possible in the shortest amount of time. Originally I had planned to retire by my 28th birthday. I'm currently 23 and this is still very much within reach. But I've never felt any sort of satisfaction, or passion towards any one thing, except for the process of learning, itself.

Enter Artificial Intelligence - stage right.

For as long as I can remember, I've thought about intelligence. In grade school i would write poetry asking questions like ""what **is** learning?"" and have spent countless nights awake in bed pondering the mysteries of cognition and intelligence and over the last year I've been growing especially dissatisfied with the trajectory my life is taking.

I have ideas! I want to research them! Test them! I want to contribute to AI *right now*, but I don't know where to start and I'm feeling trapped with my career taking up all of my productive hours. Should I go back to school? Should I start pouring my retirement money into startup companies that focus on deep learning? What would i study? Where would I go? Who do I talk to about my ideas to determine a solid course for me? I have no trepidations with leaving my career, as I have total confidence that I can land a similar or better job with a medium amount of effort - I just need some direction.

I've never asked for help with making a major life decision before, so this is new territory - and completely terrifying - for me.

[Pattern Recognition],https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3o0yez/simplest_way_to_detect_and_return_specified/,eggbrain,1444341488,"**Preamble**
I've been reading up on text extraction and keyword extraction today, and I feel like I must be missing something, because I feel like I can't figure out what I'd consider a ""simple"" use case. To put it simply, I'd like to take a body of text, and train it to recognize certain pieces of information in that text (with as little code as possible). I've provided some generalized examples below so you can see what I'm thinking.

*Example 1:*

&gt; ""While the United States was fighting with Russia, it also had to deal with Spain, and that was the worst time for  the fire nation to attack, and attack it did. The United States went on to win that war, though, with the help of thousands of CocaCola bottles.""

I'd then give the algorithm the text, and tell it what data I want it to respond with (in this case, I want it to return ""United States"", since I'm trying to extract the subject of the text). I could do named entity recognition, but there's multiple named entities there, and so I'd want it to then start to look at frequency, or other factors, without possibly being told about those factors.


*Example 2:*
&gt; ""Hey, just checking in. If you could pick up 12 popsicles, that would be great. I'm located at 123 fake street, Cali""

In this case, I'd want it to start to detect addresses, so I'd supply it with the answer ""123 fake street, Cali"" (and train it on thousands of examples with supplying it answers)"".


*Example 3:*
&gt; ""Hey man,

&gt; You're right, I do love those shoes. You are always so great!

&gt; Sincerely,

&gt; Jordan""

In this case, I'd want it to detect just the body of an email, rather than the signature, so I'd supply it with the answer ""You're right, I do love those shoes. You are always so great!"". 

**Final thoughts**

The idea would be that, in each example, I feed it thousands of training data samples (and the correct answer) and it starts to determine features about that text that it can use to generate its predictions. Then, I can give it a new sample (within it's category), and it can spit out what it predicts is the match. 

I feel like I've read hundreds of articles on text extraction, keyword analysis and more, however, and I can't find a simple example with code that I can work with. Does anyone have any background on doing something like this simply?

I want to predict which of those sensors is most likely to go from low to high, and end up among the top 100 highest-valued sensors, within a window of upcoming time periods.

Seasonality isn't significant for this dataset. 

It is very important that it detects the trends very early. If the problem is framed like this, it would be ideal -- Detect sensors that are going to be in the top 100 within the next 100 time periods, while they're still in the bottom 10,000.

NOTE: Since the problem involves an overall ranking - which sensors will end up in the top 100 - the magnitude of each signal must be considered in relation to all the other magnitudes, not just the shape of the signals over time.

This could also be seen as somewhat like an early anomaly detection system, but those don't seem to frame the problem correctly for my task.

The data follows natural patterns (unlike stocks) and looks quite predictable. It's similar to detecting of trends on twitter.

When it comes to writing text, Karpathy wrote an excellent [post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) using character based training with lstms. 

I noticed in his post that he regularly used 2 layers of lstms and at max three. I went ahead and used 4 and 5 layers, and obtained slightly better results (in my opinion -- hard to actually judge objectively). But it started to match word pairs together. 

The reason why I think this is the case is that by using more and more layers, you increase the final level of abstraction you can reach.

For example, if you used character based writing, you first have to learn that there is a concept of words separated by spaces. We'll call that level one. 

However, if you use more levels (say 5 or 6), I believe that you start to get the next level: That is, you understand that these words have relationships to each other. This is level two of abstraction.

So I guess my question is: Should I go for the 10 layer lstm? It would take me a week to train on my 980 TI. Does abstraction level correlate with the number of layers you stack? 

I'm hoping to reach level three of abstraction: Sentence to sentence relationships. 

I put 256 hidden variables on each layer with a dropout of 0.5 between each one. I'm also currently investigating word to word relationships instead of character to character.

I have a neural network where I am trying to optimize sum of a reconstruction error, a rectified linear output and L2 norm of weights using SGD.

Here are some of the cases I face:

1. When I chose a high coefficient for L2 norms of weights, the cost reaches infinity pretty quickly. Since I am restricting the range in which weights can vary, this seems to be due to high coefficient
2. The same happens when I chose a low coefficient for L2 norm. This I assume is because the weights are allowed to vary more and hence the gradient gets pretty high.
3. Since this (2) seems to be a case of gradient overshoot, I clip the gradient at a low threshold. In this case, the gradient seems to be stuck in a range where the overall cost is mostly comprised of the L2 norm (so if loss if 10, the loss due to L2 norm is 8, due to reconstruction and relu is 2). When I run this for a long time, the results seem to be OKayish, but I am not sure SGD optimized well.
4. When I try changing the initialization of weights (even by a factor of 1000) , it just seems to delay the converging to infinity in (1) and (2) by sometime, but nothing else.

From what I can think, the right way is to find a middle ground by setting weight-initializations, coefficient of L2 norm and Gradient Clipping. Is there a thumb rule I should follow while varying these three?
Also I might be missing out on some method I should have employed, if you think that is the case, please let me know.",12,0,False,self,,,,,

Hypothetically you have an trained a deep autoencoder regularized with dropout on 1,000,000 different cities which each had data on 1,000 informative features (e.g. population, incomes, crime rate, date, etc). Would you be able to feed in a manipulated example to predict changes in that example?

For example, let's say I took the Los Angeles input vector and reduced the population size by a little bit or increased the average family income: would such a model be able to extrapolate and accurately predict the future state of the LA if that artificial change took place?

I think I am having trouble here because my understanding with such complex systems is that I can imagine almost all features to capable of causal influence.

My initial set of data is unfortunately quite small, so I've generated artificial trials by time-frequency bootstrapping (break down each trial by time and frequency components and randomly recombine within a particular class to generate novel trials). 

Instead of using cross validation, I'm training on only the artificial dataset and testing on the actual data. Does this seem like a legitimate technique or am I missing something that will confound my results? I've tested and it seems that once past a minimum number of artificial trials, generating more doesn't seem to increase classification accuracy. 

I was hoping to compare classification of the actual data to a label shuffled null set, but without cross validation I only have a single accuracy value. Would it make sense to subsample from the test data and do a number of training/test loops to generate a distribution of classification accuracies?

I have data in the format of text and associated labels given by values between 1 and 5, where 2.5 is the zero point (&gt; 2.5 means the label is positive for this instance, &lt; 2.5 means it is negative, 2.5 is neutral). (Note that the values are not discrete but continuous.)
I always assumed that this was simply a multi-label classification problem. Currently I think it is more of a ""bunch of regression"" problem where I should predict the value for each ""label"".

My original plan was to predict labels for each instance and then extract the estimated probability for each of those labels (ranging from 0 to 1) and scale them linearly to [1,5]. I am not sure if this is too nave or not, or even terrifyingly wrong.

I'd love to hear your input on this as I am not sure this is the way to go.

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06726v1.pdf

I've spent some time trying to recreate this paper in [Keras](http://keras.io/). 

In summary, I want to feed the model an array of words (translated to their respective integers) and get an output of an array of integers (that correspond with their respective words). Each array should be a sentence. 

For example the input sentence would be: ""The stars shine very brightly."" and the output sentence would be something like ""They shine brightly because of the enormous amount of energy they contain"". 

My full script can be found on github:
https://github.com/LeavesBreathe/Sequence-To-Sequence-Generation-Skip-Thoughts-/blob/master/sentence_to_sentence_generation.py

There are plenty of examples in Keras using text-generation, but they all use one-hot vectors for words/letters. 

However, I've heard from several that using an embedding layer is more efficient than one-hotting words. To that end, I can't find my examples that use embedding AND predict from their model. 

The main problem I'm currently having is this. The whole thing works except that when I do the predict function, I end up getting a 1d array of incredibly small numbers. Instead, I want to get a 1d array of integers that correspond with the index_to_word dictionary. 

Here is an example of my output currently when I use the model.predict function:

I want to start off by saying that ML is not my area, but recently I have started reading a lot about it and it really intrigues me.

One thing that has crossed my mind is how you stop ""self-enforcing"" (not sure if that is the correct term) predictions/recommendations in engines based on a bunch of data.

To clarify, I discovered Quake III Arena while trying to download Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 from DC++. I discovered french electro duo Justice while searching for Metallica on Spotify. A lot of the things I've discovered have been relatively random, and I can't help but think that if a recommendation engine were to ""choose for me"" instead, I would've nevered discovered the greatest FPS of all time while searching for a skateboard game, or finding an electro duo while searching for heavy metal. In contrast, today I noticed that the ""Recommended for you"" playlist on Spotify is entirely based on what genres I've listened to in the last weeks, resulting in a playlist consisting solely of Swedish hiphop. If I were to listen to that, next week's recommended playlist would probably also just consist of that genre.

I guess my question is: with 1. all the data collected on me 2. the trend that more and more decisions are taken for me by intelligent engines; wouldn't I ultimately be seeing the same things over and over again? Is this some kind of phenomenon that is discussed in ML? I guess there is an obvious answer to this, but I can't really find it by searching, and was wondering if you guys could help me in my thinking.",7,4,False,self,,,,,

I want my work to ""matter"" in a way that I find meaningful (I briefly debated studying to be a doctor before deciding something more math-intensive is the right choice for me). So for me, the ideal would be applying ML methods (or even just computational methods) in fields that can benefit other people.

I think that I'm across what the AUC is meant to do and I hear from a lot of people who swear by it. I've heard the definitions about probability of classifying a positive example as positive over a randomly sample negative example and all that. That's fine.

My interest here is in things that make it work extremely poorly and I think I've found a case but would just like some confirmation that I'm thinking about it correctly. Basically imagine that you have some data in two classes and you train two separate classifiers for it. The classifiers identify two parallel hyperplanes to separate the classes but they are not equivalent. Now when you adjust the threshold to generate the ROC curve those hyperplanes will basically be translated up and down normal to their direction and at each point sensitivity/specificity are calculated and so on. But if they're parallel they will surely cover the same ground and so the AUC will be identical even if one classifier is intuitively much worse than the other.

Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks for your time

My question is, do you guys know of any way to deal with these situations? I have been thinking about trying to encode the missing values with a -1, but I'm also not sure if that's a good solution, since for real valued variables, -1 is closer to 0 than to 10.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I have tweaked around with Lasagne and I found it an excellent library. My experiments revolve around building an autoencoder for the MNIST dataset. Unfortunately I didn't manage to train it properly, maybe you can spot any mistakes I made?

Here is the structure I chose:

 * input layer (28x28)
 * 2D convolutional layer, filter size 7x7
 * Max Pooling layer, size 3x3, stride 2x2
 * Dense (fully connected) flattening layer, 10 units (this is the bottleneck)
 * Dense (fully connected) layer, 121 units
 * Reshaping layer to 11x11
 * 2D convolutional layer, filter size 3x3
 * 2D Upscaling layer factor 2
 * 2D convolutional layer, filter size 3x3
 * 2D Upscaling layer factor 2
 * 2D convolutional layer, filter size 5x5
 * Feature max pooling (from 31x28x28 to 28x28)

All the 2D convolutional layers have the biases untied, sigmoid activations and 31 filters.

All the fully connected layers have sigmoid activations.

The loss function used is squared error, the updating function is adagrad. The length of the chunk for the learning is 100 samples, multiplied for 1000 epochs.

I have received a bunch of documents from a company and need to cluster and classify them. The document are bag-of-words vectors containing around 5000 words.

Classifying with this dataset is no problem, I am getting very good results training a plain feedforward network. But I want to show that it is also possible to cluster and visualize data with unsupervised training. I used the autoencoder on the [theano website](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/dA.html), reduced dimensionality and visualized the data using PCA.
Without any training, the raw data looks like [this](http://imgur.com/dNWy4Mx). After pretraining the first layer, the data looks like [this](http://imgur.com/mROAATo). As you can see, the data is hardly clustered. When I train the network with labels and then output the values of the second last layers and visualize that, it looks like [this](http://imgur.com/9a3CMi5). Here you see that the data has been split way better. In the middle, the data lies on a big pile, but that may be the visualization in two dimensions.

So let's say I'm interested in ML (mostly algorithms) and I'd like to get a job in the field. I live in EU and probably will never have a PhD, so let's say we're not talking about research positions.

As far as I understand, though, most positions will not only require strong skills in the algorithmic part of ML, but also broader knowledge of ""data science"", like getting and cleaning data, exploratory analysis, descriptive anlysis, feature engineering etc.

I guess most job interviews will **not** be about **""OK, so how do we formulate learning objective for SVM?""**, but more about **""OK, here's a dataset, what do you do with it""**. 

* **Q1: how do learn such practical skills.**
* **Q2: what books can You guys recommend?**
* **Q3: how do I prepare for a job interview as a data scientist / machine learning guy.** There are tons of web-pages for coders to practice their algorithmic skills. Is there any such thing for ML / DS (except Kaggle).

Note: 

* I hate MOOCs. They're slow paced, take a lot of time, are mostly targeted at high-school level audience (ML without calculus...?) and none of the free ones uses Python. 
* When it comes to alogs, every ML expert should know Murphy's ML:PP (or equivalent). Is there any such text for more general Data Scientist?
* ""Compete on Kaggle"" is not really an answer. I first have to learn that Random Forests exist to use them. I first have to learn data science to use it in practice. Reading winning solutions give me fragmentated knowledge that I can't always understand.

(layer 1 weight)(layer 1 activation)(layer 2 weight)(layer 2 activation)(layer 3 weight)

I'm looking at app review text, trying to find emergent problems or issues.  For instance, did many more people start complaining about X in the last month?  Given the space of potential problems in apps, it's impossible to write rules to detect every X, making these kinds of models attractive.  The problem I'm experiencing is that results always take lots of study to yield valuable information, due to the destructuring (via bag of words) of reviews.

I've been using Word2Vec to vectorize words. Based upon these vectorizations, I apply a K-means to cluster the words, and I've been absolutely blown away by the results. It groups them very well: better than I ever could...and all in 10 minutes. 

Here's an example of one cluster of words from 33mb doc on astronomy:

	[265:'stars','fusion','fission','H','speed_of_light','Hydrogen','atoms','hydrogen','energy']

If anyone else is interested in doing this, there's a nice guide here: http://www.yseam.com/blog/WV.html

However, there is a huge problem I have with this approach. Word2Vec only works well on words that appear at least ~5 times within your corpus. From Zipf's law, we know that there are going to be *many* words that don't even come close to reaching this number. 

I feel that those who are involved with translation would also have this problem: What do you do with all of these infrequent words? What happens when you're training your neural net and you come across one of these words?

Ideas I've come across:

1. Make another cluster, and just throw all of these infrequent words into that cluster. (Plausible, but you still lose all meaning of the word)

2. Simply delete the words, and have the neural net never know that there was that word (I really don't like this idea, because it throws off the grammar/sentiment properties of your net)

3. Just Vectorize the words with a word count of 1 (leads to all your clusters being contaminated by words that simply don't belong.)

4. Increase Your Training Corpus Size by Orders of Magnitude, and delete infrequent words (I can probably get about 1gb of text at the most, but with more text will come more infrequent words!!!)

These just don't seem like the best approaches. Is there a better idea to group these infrequent words? Ram and Gpu Memory is not a concern at all. ",9,17,False,self,,,,,

I'm trying to make a logistic regression model in Matlab, and apply the kernel trick to it to allow it to learn on non-linearaly separable data. I've got the logistic regression bit working with a gradient descent algorithm and have tested it on a few different data sets - it works exactly as I'd expect. My issue is with the kernel part.

I think the problem is that I don't truly understand what the kernel does from a programming perspective. 

What I think it does is this: Using the data set, generate a column vector which, when multiplied with a row of data, results in a scalar value which is in turn multiplied by the vector which describes the change in the weightings (dE/dw). This new value of dE/dw is then applied to the weights, and a new iteration starts.

I scrapped/crawled a realty website that has around 2k~ places, deleted some broken records and created my own data set that consists of:

* state
* city
* neighbourhood
* kind (house/apartment)
* price (tried to group values into ""ok"", ""cheap"" and ""expensive"")
* rooms
* area (grouped values into ""small"", ""ok"" and ""large""
* **label** (good/bad) &lt;-- This is the value I'll try to find later, the one I'm using to check my algorithm accuracy

The problem I'm seeing ahead is that some of these values are not discrete (price, rooms, area) and these are the most important values for the classification.

The other values like state/city are not really important, because all my dataset is on the same location, so they're all equal.

Other problem I'm having is that I have too few ""good"" labeled training oportunities (because what I'm looking for is really specific in terms of rent value range and number of rooms)... more than 90% are bad oportunities (too expensive).

And another problem with NB is that it cannot handle unkown values... if I my dataset has only places with 1-4 rooms, and I throw a place with 5 rooms at it, it simply cannot handle it.. even though it would be awesome to find a 5 room place with the same rent range.

I'm starting to wonder that **maybe NB is not the correct algorithm to use on this kind of problem**... I started to look into some regression classification algorithms but I wanted to hear from you guys first.

You might ask **WHY i'm trying to use machine learning** in this classification... Well, my idea is that there are too many variables to handle each one of them with simple if/elses.. maybe there is a good opportunity with a rent 10-20% more expensive, that would be filtered out if I did a simple `if &lt; x`.. But this is exactly what's happening now that I need to group the values into labels to use NB.

The biggest feature is that the GIL has been released for distributions and hidden Markov models, improving their speed on all tasks significantly. Viterbi is usually 10x faster now, and Baum-Welch training can be 4x faster. Given that the GIL has been released, multithreading training is now an option, though it only works well for large models.

* Discrete Bayesian networks and Factor Graphs have been added
* Bayesian networks can now impute missing data from tables easily
* Conditional and Joint Probability Tables have been added
* Finite state machines have been simplified
* General Mixture Models have been added
* scikit-learn like interface, where models can be `fit` and `predict` or `predict_proba` can be called on new points.
* MultivariateGaussians and Kernel Densities have been significantly sped up, with MultivariateGaussians training and prediction being an order of magnitude faster in some cases
* JSON serialization now works for all distributions and models (except Bayesian networks) 

Most importantly, a [series of tutorials](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate/tree/master/tutorials) have been added as iPython notebooks so that you can see how to use these methods in the wild.

We start with a very simple network: 1 input 1 parameter 1 output. We think of all possible ways it could be set up (I guess this would create a 2 variable system, one being input, and the other being the only parameter)

Then we consider:

- 1 input, 2 parameters
- 1 input, n parameters
- 2 inputs, 1 parameter
- 2 inputs, 2 parameters

and so on. Obviously there are two many cases but we can make some observations:

- We don't need parameters that are fed partial inputs, e.g., for a 2 input network, all our parameters have 2 inputs. We don't need any parameter with 1 input because it's the equivalent of a 2-input parameter one of which is zero.
- We can limit n, e.g., for 1 grayscale pixel, input is 0-255. Maybe we can use this to conclude a value of n beyond which further enumeration is superfluous.


Anyway I hope you get the idea. So my question is, is there any resource, tutorial, article, book chapter that discusses neural networks along these lines?

second question: is there something like a directory/collection of well-known neural network designs? (**EDIT 1**: in other words, well-known NN architectures).

Instead of training with sample per experiment which has 2000 features per sample. In the case of a sample per frame, each sample has the same feature space, which is the same type of sensors.

In fact, one of the major parameters to tune are the regularization terms and the number of epochs (or iterations). Also, it has been shown that ANN are universal approximators, and they can learn functions like XOR using small data but enough epochs. 

So, building on that shouldn't it be possible for an ANN to learn using a small data set, of the order which is used by SVMs, Logistic Regressions (which can all be represented as ANN), e.g. 20k instances for binary sentiment analysis. 

What are some limitations of using ANN for small data, e.g. Iris data with ~100 instances, movie reviews data ~20k instances etc?

Just want to note that I don't have any formal education in machine learning, just trying to learn it on the side, so forgive me if the questions sound a little noobish. 

After several epochs of testing, I find that my loss dips below 0 and eventually reaches -2. At the same time, the accuracy is consistent and never changes from the original value. This happened after I changed the rnn's final output to be a single variable. In a setup I tested before this, I had the rnn's final output to have 4 variables. With this setup, the loss eventually reached to a low number, 0.05, but the accuracy was around 0.65. The plot of the accuracy over several epochs was changing unlike the single variable case, but it was always decreasing. So I'm having trouble understanding how to interpret these results. Does a loss of 0.05 and an accuracy of 0.65 mean 'the rnn will use 95% of the input data to correctly predict 65% of the time'? If that is the case, what does it mean to have a negative loss? And I believe the usual behavior of an rnn is to increase in accuracy while the loss is taken out. How come the accuracy never increases in either setup I've tried?

I for sure made some of the mistakes shown in the article. My question now is around how important it is to follow these guidelines.

Some info about my data:

- low n (around 1000)
- highly dimensional 

Features are calculated values and there are many, many available. You can easily get 500+ features if you like.

1. Feature Selection Leakage

I for sure made that mistake. As a simple method of feature selection I used GBM to determine the importance of each feature and cut of all features below a certain threshold. So this is bad correct? I now removed that step and simply to low variance and correlation filtering. Problem is this leaves me with 100+ features. I thought it was bad to have many features compared to rows. Plus this of course greatly increases runtime.

Other options of feature selection? PCA seems to greatly reduce performance.

2. Parameter Selection

specially in aspect of runtime as the article mentions inner and outer cross validation loops. So that would lead to runtimes of days for what I seem simple models (n = 1000).

So for optimizing parameters I should only use a part of all data available? And then repeat the whole optimization step in a outer CV loop? Isn't that a bit excessive?

In my case I might get 10 new data points (measurements) a year. Am I correct to assume I can optimize parameters once and not bother to do it again when creating a new model with new data points say once a year?",7,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently using Keras to implement LSTMs in NLP. I currently input a sentence of words (represented by a cluster id and then a word id) and ask the LSTM to predict the next word, and it works pretty well. If you are interested in the clustering, the ideas was started in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3og80o/recreating_skipthoughts_paper_in_keras/

If you're interested on how to handle infrequent words in clustering: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3p7tns/handling_infrequent_words_in_corpus_with_word2vec/

	Currently:

	Input Sentence of Words --&gt; Predicts next word

	Goal:

	Input Sentence of Words --&gt; Predict next sentence


I'm looking now into feeding the LSTM and entire sentence, and then asking it to produce an entire sentence. However, the major problem is this: I don't know how to format y_train (or the labels)

For x_train (input), I understand that I use a 2d array, and pad the array with 0's. So that the first dimension is the number of samples, and the second dimension is the sentence that I'm feeding into the lstm. I then feed this into Keras's embedding layer -- and it works great! (I mask the zeros)

However, the 2d y_train is where I get lost. Currently, I one-hot my y_train to the *one word* that is supposed to come next. In order to have y_train be a sequence of words, it almost seems I would have to add an extra dimension (which is impossible right?). I have a Dense Layer at the end which condenses the output to 2d, followed by a softmax.  

So the question is: How do you format the y_train so that you can output an entire sentence versus a word? 

Hopefully others in the future with this question can use this post! Thanks alot guys. ",17,1,False,self,,,,,

Anyway, the entire reason that I majored in Statistics as an undergrad and am currently going to grad school in Data Mining was because of a paper that I read on predicting the winners of greyhound races. All through undergrad and to this day, I've been reading papers about this specific topic.

I've run across papers in CS, Operations Research, Statistics and Economics specific journals. As well as thesis projects that you can just find online. A lot of the papers do things like show that ""X"" technique can be used to predict winners ([Adapting support vector machine methods for horserace odds prediction](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10479-006-0131-7)), others compare the performance of variations of learning algorithms in the same family([A Case Study Using Neural Network Algorithms: Horse Racing Predictions in Jamaica](https://eprints.usq.edu.au/4300/1/Williams_Li_Publ_version.pdf)), some use horse racing as an example of how prediction markets work ([Prediction Markets for Economic Forecasting](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/6/13%20prediction%20markets%20wolfers/13%20prediction%20markets%20wolfers.pdf)) and so on.

I've noticed that in a lot of the papers that really take a focus on testing some classification algorithm, especially the CS papers, never really go into how they do feature selection. They generally say that it is important and that there are a lot of variables involved and we decided to pick these 5,7,12, or whatever the number is. Sometimes they'll say that they spoke to an ""expert"" or they will just use the same features that were used in another paper but with a different learning technique ([here](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4030214_Neural_networks_mine_for_gold_at_the_greyhound_racetrack)).

What I want to know is, what effect does using various feature selection algorithms have on your prediction accuracy and ROI? So I'd start with as many explanatory variables as possible and then use different feature selection algorithms while keeping the classification algorithm the same and then check the results.",3,4,False,self,,,,,

I was hoping someone could help me understand two concepts which are giving me trouble:

1. I've worked through the tutorial stuff on Kaggle with the Titanic dataset. They use a random forest to try and predict passenger survival from a variety of factors (age, gender, passenger class, etc.). The tutorial itself makes sense to me; however, after learning a little about support vector classification I am confused as to why a random forest is the better choice here. 

2. On the topic of SVC, I am having a hard time understanding what the C and gamma values do. I have a vague idea that they control ""fuzziness"" - but when I read that low gamma means a training example has a far reach and a high gamma means a close reach, I don't really get what that means. I think if I better understood this, I could wrap my head around `sklearn`'s grid searching.

When using denoising autoencoders, the input values are just set randomly to 0, when non-training the input is being put into the network without corruption. Why are the values not adjusted then like when using dropout?
- When I am training a second layer, are the inputs also set randomly to 0 or is this only done for the lowest input layer?
- An upper layer is trained with the hidden data of the lower layer. The lower layer is trained with tied weights, so the results are not as good as with untied weights. When the network is being unfolded and trained as a whole with untied weights, does the pretraining of the upper layers still make sense, since they have to learn from input which later don't appear anymore? Wouldn't it make more sense to pretrain one layer, then untie it and then train the next layer?
- When using dropout, in the unfolded phase, does it make sense to use dropout in the decoding part of the network?
- When corrupting the input, is there any heuristic which input to corrupt? Like corrupt input values that are 1 seldomly with a higher probability?
- From the experience I got so far, I noticed when visualizing data using PCA/tsne, the network does not need to have several layers, one layer is enough. Is one layer really enough to learn patterns from data and cluster/visualize data accordingly?

The main limit of neuralnets is they are more of a computing format and lack external memory to save and load large amounts of data. Convolutional Neuralnets deal with that by running the same neuralnet centered on each pixel, so they can gradually talk to eachother across distance. Deepmind's kind of Neural Turing Machine uses a turing tape of small blocks of bits. Eurisko stored data in lisp lists, numbers, and derived its own datastructs.

Eurisko's datastructs, starting with lisp's basic datstructs, were most flexible because they were sparse. The others are more linear, even with multi-tape-turing. But with that flexibility came the usual problems of Turing Completeness including infinite loops.

Somewhere between, keeping the sparseness, but not the full power of lisp easily able to destroy itself, I expect to find a good combination of neuralnet and compute theory, something that merges statistical learning with data storage and sparse navigating through it.

Lately, I've been experimenting with pretty substantially deep neural nets:

1. Six to Ten LSTM Layers
2. Anywhere from 512 to 1024 Hidden Variables.

To clarify, chars *are not characters*, they are words. I take all the words in the text and cluster them. From that I assign a cluster id and a word id. This allows chars to be around 400. I used to do chars which is why the variable is named that way. 

For reference, my Keras model is below:
	number_of_layers = 6
	hidden_variables = 512
	chars = 400

	print('Build model...')
	model = Sequential()
	model.add(Embedding(input_dim=(len(chars)), output_dim=512, input_length=maxlen))
	model.add(LSTM(hidden_variables, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(maxlen, len(chars))))
	model.add(Dropout(dropout))
	for z in range(0,number_of_layers-2):
	    model.add(LSTM(hidden_variables, return_sequences=True))
	    model.add(Dropout(dropout))
	model.add(LSTM(hidden_variables, return_sequences=False))
	model.add(Dropout(dropout))
	model.add(Dense(len(chars))) #this is the length of your output array. 
	model.add(Activation('softmax'))
	print('you are about to compile')
	model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
	print('you finished compiling')


I am inputting sentences and predicting the next word. I have much training data (about 10M samples), and I end up doing a softmax over ~400 outputs. However, these large neural nets on a 980 Ti take about 9 days to train for 100 epochs. I'm trying to figure out ways to speed up testing so that I can estimate what parameters are best, and then do a full 9 training days.

My goal is to have each test to take at most 48 hours. Once the most promising configuration is observed, we'll run the full LSTM 9 day training. 

Here are a few ideas to speed things up:

Idea 1: Change all the LSTMS to GRU's -- GRU's are about 2x faster, but LSTM's seem to outperform them in the long run (as the number of epochs increase).

Idea 2: Change the learning rate on the Adam Optimizer from the standard 0.001 to 0.010. After about epoch 10, decrease the learning rate by half each time. Stop learning after epoch 20.

Idea 3: Decrease hidden variable numbers or LSTM layer numbers -- I dislike this option the most because I feel that the level of abstraction reached will be significantly lower. 

Are there any other ideas you guys can think of? Maybe I'm missing something obvious. I'm also considering buying another 980 TI to run two separate configurations at once.

I have tried using a method where I take the label which has &gt; 90% proportion of the total counts as the true label and can train a model on that using any binary supervised machine learning model. However, I feel in this case I am throwing away a lot of information which doesn't have &gt; 90% proportion as well as information that something which is 90% positive is different from something which is 100% positive. 

Are there any methods which I can use to train my model which uses the full information present in the model? Either the raw counts or proportions.

One method I can think of is using the cross entropy error and instead of y being a one hot vector like [0, 1] for counts [10, 90], I can have y as [0.1, 0.9] and then back propagate the true cross entropy error as defined here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy,

Is it mainly trial and error and tedium?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3q4gwi/how_interesting_is_ml_actually_in_practice/,mlthrowaway2,1445754656,"I took a few Machine Learning modules at Cambridge as part of my four-year Engineering degree, from which I've just graduated. I can say that I found the theory very interesting - the maths is compelling and I loved how the concepts brought all the statistics and linear algebra that I had learnt before in one place.


HOWEVER, what I'm worried about is whether a job will be actually very intellectually stimulating at all. Looking at the student projects for the Stanford course, it seems like pretty much all of them involve trying to make a number go down (error rate) by changing other numbers (hyperparameters, variables) without really using much linear algebra or statistics to get those numbers. It just seems like they just try everything, and THEN in retrospect try to explain why this particular set of numbers worked best by saying, ah, yes, this makes sense because X. Like, if the opposite approach worked, they'd just say ah yes because Y. It was exactly like how some of my courseworks ended up being, and it just feels so meaningless! At the end of the day you don't really learn much from the work itself because everything is just probablys and maybes.


Is this kind of thing just fundamental in machine learning jobs? Do you ever really need to have understood deeply the mechanics that underpin the practice? I KNOW that, in order to choose an approach, you could theorise that SVNs would work better in this particular domain or something. But even in Kaggle competitions, looking at the postmortems by the winners, it turns out that it was just a lot of trial and error, and choosing a combination of different approaches, which might as well have been black boxes. And all the work is really just coding it all up, making it run fast, maybe writing a batch script to be able to use all the data, etc. There was something Andrew Ng said as well, about how the frontier now is not in theory, but simply in computing power, which further gives me the impression that in practice it's mainly just dark arts and trial and error.


I'm at the point now where I've graduated with my Masters in Engineering, and I must choose between going into industry as an engineer/machine learning engineer.. or to throw it all away and go into Medicine.


My biggest fear in life is having a job that feels meaningless. Data science in order to predict how often you should send push notifications feels utterly meaningless to me, and I'm not sure I could derive much pleasure from it unless it was particularly intellectually stimulating. Even if it did get results, and get you a number (""3 times a week!""), it just.. compared to diagnosing someone and helping them personally with an illness.. ugh.


I've also shadowed doctors enough over the past months to know that as a doctor I will be guaranteed to have a fundamentally meaningful job for the rest of my life, even with the paperwork and bureaucracy, because I would be directly helping individuals with their problems. It will just take another 4 years of medical school. (Money thankfully is not a problem and is the least of my worries. It's just wanting to impact the world in any way I can)

But I would like to think it's possible to get a meaningful job in Engineering too, and I have a natural affinity to the theories and the maths. People like Erik Bern inspire me to no end. Seeing how great Spotify's Discover Weekly is, how well it works for me personally, is a great motivation for ML. And there's still all this talk about how the world needs Data Scientists etc etc.

From talking to software engineers in industry, it seems like it's very possible to end up being a small cog helping a company with growth by doing tedious jobs. I would never ever want to do this, and would much prefer ML jobs where ML is actually part of the product itself (either recommendations engines, or robotics, or NLP etc), rather than just to help a company grow. Do many of these kinds of jobs exist, because I can't really find many, and if anyone is in this kind of job, can you tell me how it's like?

So yeah, it's a big decision to make, whether to stick with this and hope to be able to impact the world in a bigger way (but maybe end up not doing so at all), or to go into medicine and have a smaller but guaranteed impact. If anyone can tell me if my outlook on the tedium in Machine Learning jobs is accurate, and maybe tell me what the most rewarding part of the work is, it'd be appreciated!",60,84,False,self,,,,,

Lately I have been working with midi data but I have been struggling with a good and learnable representation of my data.

As far as I know right now I have two ways of representing a midi file.

1) sample every X ticks and use a 1 when a note is ON at the current step and a 0 when it is OFF.

Pros: The neural network needs only to learn binary output.
Cons: If sampled at too low rate, the input data is no longer representative of an actual song and it skips notes.
If sampled at too high rate, the data becomes extremely large, with for example a quarter note taking up 16 timesteps.

2) Use real numbers, where the first column of my data is the offset from the last note and the rest are the notes with their duration.
Pros: the data is now flawless AND much more compact, leaving any sampling out of the question.
Cons: the data is very precise. A note could have a duration of 3.750, 1.666..., 0.333... And so on, which makes the data harder to learn an autoencoding

I have been working a lot with the last option using ReLU output. And while my NN is apparently very quick at learning the rough structure of a song perhaps even better so than with binary representations, it has trouble getting to those exact values of offsets and note durations, especially in a VAE setting. So basicly I am looking for some pointers on other ways I might be able to represent my data. Preferably in a way so that it circumvents any sampling and thus corruption of input data.

Important side note: multiple notes can be on at the same time in my data (nottingham midi database, piano-midi,...)

In the main post:

&gt;Note that all these convolutions are one-dimensional; the convolution happens only in the time dimension, not in the frequency dimension.

This is in reply of a comment:

&gt;No, the spectrogram is processed by a 1D convolutional layer with 256 filters. So the first 4 frames (4 x 128) are convolved with 256 filters that are also 4 x 128 in shape, giving rise to 1 x 256 outputs. Because this is a convolution, we get this over the entire time axis, so the input is 599 x 128 and the output is 596 x 256. This is then max-pooled to 149 x 256 (pool size 4).

My knowledge of neural networks is limited to using libraries and I don't understand much of the theory behind it, so I don't understand how this is a 1D convolution but uses a 2D shape (4x128). An example of this first layer in any python library/torch would probably clear up my confusion.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

I have a Dataframe (pandas) with multiple string columns.

Columns description : 
- description : text =&gt; ""I like it, i was very happy about it and my friend have the same opinion""
- label : text ==&gt; ""restaurant""
- target : 0 or 1

So i try use some classification and predict target.

I first only use ""description"" column with this processing:
1. remove stopword
2. remove ponctuation
3. stem word
4. using CountVectorizer
5. using TfidfTransformer
6. train LogisticRegression

step 1, 2 &amp; 3 are done by a function : clear_text(text).
clear_text(""""I like it, i was very happy about it and my friend have the same opinion"") return ""like happi friend opinion""

step 4, 5, 6 are done by pipeline :
clf = Pipeline([('vect', CountVectorizer()),
                     ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()),
                     ('clf', LogisticRegression()),
])

Then i use GridSearchCV to tune my parameters.

Result are quit good ! But i would like to add ""label"" feature.

As ""label"" is a nominal feature (ie : len(df.label.unique()) : 119). i procession it like to feed my model :
1. LabelEncoder()
2. OneHotEncoder()

Question : 

How can i use Pipeline process and GridSearchCV with this 2 different features processing ?

Thank guys ! :)

**My main point**, I have read reviews of the previous edition, stating that there are quite a lot of flaws in the first edition. I would like to know if these flaws have been completely rectified in this latest edition.  

**Secondly**, are there any other introductory books on ML that are as well written as this and does a good job of presenting the math in a really pedagogic manner? I want to know, because Marsland's book is quite expensive, so I only want to spend this kind of money on one introductory book on ML.

In liquid state machine use biological like neurons, and in the Echo state use more analog units. So in term of very short term memory the Liquid State approach each individual neuron remember its own history, where in the Echo state approach each individual neuron react base only on the current state, there for the memory stored in the activity between the units.

I am trying to use sklearn to predict a time series with multiple features.. and I just dont know how to organize the data.

If I only had one input, my understanding is that I would structure the data as such with a 'lookback' window of, say ,'3' : 
rawInputData =  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
features = [[1,2,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,5]]
labels = [[4],[5],[6]]
... etc; I hope I have this correct.. if not, please let me know.

My issue is that if I have multiple inputs, I'm not sure of the best way to present this data to sklearn without using 3 dimensional arrays.

Can I just append data from the second input source onto the data from the first input?
ie:
rawInput1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
rawInput2 = [11,12,13,14,15]
features = [[1,2,3,11,12,13], [2,3,4,12,13,14]]
labels = [[4,14],[5,15]]

I have recently been learning about advanced optimization methods, such as hessian-free methods. I am wondering if such methods are worth it, and give significant boosts over, say, plain old SGD?

The reason I ask is because gradients are noisy. Also, with more complex optimization algorithms more time is required for a single update; in that same time, multiple SGD updates can be done (so complex optimization algorithms have to deal with this trade off).

Further, correct me if I am wrong, the error surface changes from minibatch to minibatch (since the optimal weights will typically be different for any given minibatch).

So given noisy gradients, changing error surfaces, and the fact that SGD can go through multiple updates in the same time as a single update for a more complex optimization algorithm, are more complex optimization algorithms worth it?

Does the answer to the above depend on the network type? E.g. for RNNs and LSTMs perhaps hessian-free results in way better results?

Are there any empirical studies of different optimization methods on different network types?

Optimization seems quite critical to deep learning, and I am curious about the above.

Thanks in advance for sharing your knowledge!",6,4,False,self,,,,,

I'm working on a project right now for some research. I have a Monte-Carlo model which I use to generate simulated data, shown in red, and I'm trying to make this data match my ""real data"" which is shown in blue. 

You can see my manually tuned distributions here: http://i.imgur.com/8SwBIPj.png

The distributions are histograms, binned in an arbitrary parameter - so we have some number of observations of the parameter per bin.

I'd like to match the simulated distribution as closely as possible to the data distribution, so that I can use this to estimate the value of a few features responsible for the shape of the the data distribution.
I can tune the simulation arbitrarily to match the data, manually, but I'd like a way to automate this - something like least-squares fitting (gradient descent fitting) or some other method/algorithm.

The problem is that I generate the simulated data based on randomly sampling a distribution, and this distribution is generated by assigning values to the features I want to estimate in the first place. There isn't a ""simple"" functional form which governs the shape of the simulation. I tune the value of the features which then generate distributions, which are then sampled randomly, to produce the histogram. I feel like this rules out using regression/gradient descent, as I can't ""take the derivative with respect to a feature"" of my simulated distribution. 

One idea is to generate ranges of parameters, and many different simulated distributions based in these parameters, and then pick the one which is mathematically most similar to my data, however, as it stands, this is computationally intensive, might take a long time (perhaps very long), and I feel that there must be a better way.

So, I feel like I am touching on a class of solved computational and/or machine learning problems, and I just don't have the exposure to implement a proper solution. Can you folks offer any help?

Cheers!

Say I want to train a LSTM with the following:

Input | Output
---|---
(0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) | 2
(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) | 3
(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0) | 4
(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) | 3
(0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) | 2

I imagine that shouldn't be too hard. But if I add a ""distraction"":

Input | Output
---|---
(0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) | 2
(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0) | 3
(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0) | 4
(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0) | 3
(0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0) | 2

... things get complicated. Are you aware of a way to 'tell' the LSTM cell to only track the first 1 and ignore the second (at test time)?

To parallelize a single long sequence I would imagine that segmenting the sequence into windows &amp; training it in mini-batches would make sense. 


The hidden state should be easy enough to pass along as you might just use the resultant h_t from the final state of the previous sequence (eg: seq0's output) as the initializer of the new sequence (eg: seq1's initial h_0) at the next iteration &amp; so on.

My understanding of what they did is given below:

Input sequence (English sentence) --&gt; Encoder LSTM --&gt; **v** vector that represents the entire sentence

**v** --&gt; Decoder LSTM --&gt; output sequence (French sentence)

In particular, each time an output word is produced by the decoder LSTM, it is done by carrying out a softmax over all possible French words: http://i.imgur.com/43E4PKF.png

This seems quite expensive to me since the output layer needs to be the size of the French vocabulary (80k was the actual number).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I was wondering, why not use vector representation for words? Then the output layer just needs to be n dimensional (where n is the vector size).

Then the LSTM decoder output is a set of n-dimensional vectors: [ outputVec1, outputVec2, ... ] which is essentially a matrix, let's call this matrix **Y**. We then compare **Y** with the target output matrix, let's call it **T**. The height of **Y** and **T** may differ, so we can use zero padding. Afterwards, our loss can be, loss = sum( (**Y**-**T**)^2 ), or elementwise difference, followed by elementwise squaring, followed by a sum on all elements.

(You can use kNN on Y to get the actual French sentence).

To me the above would be a **lot** more efficient. I am wondering if there is any flaw with the idea above? And if not, why wasn't this approach used?",20,10,False,self,,,,,
