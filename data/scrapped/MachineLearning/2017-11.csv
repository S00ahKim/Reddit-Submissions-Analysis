Especially, I hope this will result in realistic video-to-video translation. Naively it can be extended to speech-to-speech, text-to-image (like StackGAN), possibly text-to-text and (image+text)-to-image with the existing technology in unpaired style. Here are some questions:

1) There are already numerous algorithms like this, including unpaired speech-to-speech, one of which was posted here, and there was one ICLR paper about this; on the other hand, I have only limited time. Is it worth pursuing this direction? Or is there no more outstanding problem about this particular task? 

2) There is one ICLR paper about text-style transfer. Is it unreasonable to expect that Cycle-GAN-like algorithm can do unsupervised translation (another ICLR paper) like this (with RNN)? If that would be realized, then Cycle-like-GAN can possibly solely do unsupervised voice-to-voice inter-language translation with the user's own voice, which is interesting.  

3) If you have any idea about nice (academic or industrial) applications of unpaired translation of X-to-Y please comment it.

Let's say I have a 32x32x3 input (RGB image), and am about to use a CNN on it, with several Conv-Pool layers and one or two Fully Connected (dense-dropout) layers.

I read [this paper](https://annals-csis.org/Volume_8/pliks/472.pdf) that uses Torch, and apparently its Conv layer reduces the size by `kernel_size-1`, so when the 32x32x3 image passes through the first Conv layer with 5x5 kernel size and 64 filters, it produces 28x28x64 segments/features.

Whereas in Tensorflow, as far as I know, it doesn't, so when the 32x32x3 image passes through its Conv layer with 5x5 kernel size, and 64 filters it produces 32x32x64 features.

A while back I asked if there's a good resource for ML learning hobbyist with low ML theory background but strong math( differential equations, stats, linear algebra) background. 

The top recommendation was Andrew Ng's Stanford course and I got to say it really hit the spot. As someone with the correct math background and practical experience with ML, the course was really fantastic for me for getting the theory, and as I am about to wrap up the series I'm a bit sad about finishing it, sort of like when you finish a book you're really into. 

I am wondering if a machine learning course to go from here, something like a continuation of Andrew Ng's course, which is heavy in math and theory. I've been looking at some of the other courses/resources/books out there, it seems like the most prevalent ones are those that heavy in the programming implementations of machine learning, and light in theory/math. 

I don't mind a course that is practical and programming, but I want to continue to strengthen my math/theory background is I already have a bit of experience on the practical implementation side. ",10,14,False,self,,,,,

And I was wondering. What makes someone 'good' at AI? I think the most objective metric is the ability to produce results and cutting edge new applications. For example, being able to beat the world Go champion decades before scientists predicted it would be possible.

But what are the exact traits lead to these people to produce such accomplishments? 

My best guess is a deeper theoretical background. However, I'm not so sure as it seems the most of the breakthrough applications of ML have come from better hardware and access to data, compared to more cutting edge ML theory. Or perhaps a deeper theoretical background gives the scientist an essential intuition for developing the best results. 

In that case, should a person working in the ML field invest time into certain concepts? If so, which ones? Just machine learning? Or more foundational ones such as linear algebra, statistics, and computation? ",23,15,False,self,,,,,

If you just train with e.g. skip-gram, the dimensions seem to be somewhat entangled with each other. I'd guess that placing a Gaussian prior on the embeddings using KL should work similar to how the latent vector in a VAE is forced to be approximately Gaussian. I've searched Google, but have been unable to find any papers on this.

The motivation for me is that I need a very efficient method in terms of computational resources, which makes a logistic regression on top of word embeddings tempting. However, the logistic regression treats each embedding dimension as independent so it would seem natural to ensure that they are independent as possible. Also, the word embeddings might be more interpretable if the dimensions are independent, which would be a big plus.

Brine is focused specifically on hosting image datasets since that's where we found being able to visualize the images and get the dataset in a standardized format is most helpful. If there's interest we might expand to video and audio as well. Our plan would be to make Brine completely free for public datasets and charge for private ones (similar to GitHub).

The data is at the moment just some simple sinus functions as a toy example. I am using variations of GANs. 

Setup: 

1. Extract Identity with an Encoder -&gt; get a latent space z (which is trained with a Decoder to produce nice latent representations, AE like)

2. Use this latent space z for my conditional GAN. The conditional GAN is based on cGAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784) and WGAN-GP (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028). So it is kind of a cWGAN-GP. 

3. The Generator consists of fully connected layers and transposed convolutions to sample up the small latent space. The Discriminator is kind of the inverse of the Generator, using also fully connected layers and 1D-convolutions. 

What I want to achieve (example):

Suppose I have training data of numerous sinus curves which are conditioned on a y-axis offset and its frequency.  I get the sinus curves and I get the conditions (offset, frequency) of those as well. I extract the identity, the latent space, of one specific sinus curve (lets say 0.1 offset and 2.0 frequency). Now I want to take this identity as input for the GAN with an additional condition that changes the frequency from 2.0 to 2.5. The GAN should now learn to generate the sinus curve with the old identity (offset) but with the new frequency 2.5. So in the end I want to have a curve that has the offset 0.1 with a frequency of 2.5.

This is a simplified example, the end system is more complex, but I wanted to get it running with this easy example first. 

Under normal conditions, my cWGAN-GP is working really fine and is able to produce nice conditioned sinus curves even with data that it has not seen, yet. I am inspired by those papers:
http://web.eecs.utk.edu/%7Ezzhang61/docs/papers/2017_CVPR_Age.pdf
https://zhaoj9014.github.io/pub/0004.pdf

Questions: 

Do you think this is even possible? Do I need to define special losses or use the standard ones from WGAN-GP? Am I on a completely wrong track?

* Starting reinforcement learning with a network of random weights, rather than one trained to predict the moves of expert humans.
* Training one network to output both policy and valuation scores, instead of two distinct networks.
* Evaluating MCTS leaf nodes with only the NN's valuation, instead of summing that value with a likelihood of victory based on naive fast rollout.

The only other changes that I can really discern from the paper and the AMA are:

* Using a residual neural network instead of a convolutional neural network.
* Changing the gradient descent to [minimize the difference between the neural net predictions and search tree predictions and the difference between the predicted and actual outcome](https://imgur.com/a/qigLS), rather than [minimizing the likelihood the game would end in loss](https://imgur.com/a/a3eyD).

Can that really be all? This begins to beg the question of why pure reinforcement learning wasn't enough for the original AG. [The top question of the AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/76xjb5/ama_we_are_david_silver_and_julian_schrittwieser/dokh31z/) asks how AGZ's reinforcement learning was so stable. The answer only addresses why the AlphaGo approach to reinforcement learning is more stable than other algorithms, but doesn't explain at all why AGZ is better than AG, as they use almost identical reinforcement learning algorithms.

So where is the magic? Is this just great engineering and iteration on a codebase with the careful tuning of hyper-parameters? Or is there really a great algorithmic leap here besides simply doing less?

&gt; Evaluator. To ensure we always generate the best quality data, we evaluate each new neural network checkpoint against the current best network f before using it for data generation. The neural network fi is evaluated by the performance of an MCTS search i that uses fi to evaluate leaf positions and prior probabilities (see Search algorithm). Each evaluation consists of 400 games, using an MCTS with 1,600 simulations to select each move, using an infinitesimal temperature   0 (that is, we deterministically select the move with maximum visit count, to give the strongest possible play). If the new player wins by a margin of &gt; 55%  (to avoid selecting on noise alone) then it becomes the best player , and is subse-quently used for self-play generation, and also becomes the baseline for subsequent  comparisons.


If we use temperature = 0, the selection is deterministic. As I don't believe their is another source of randomness in the play algorithm, all 400 games should always be the same. Am I missing something and only the tested player plays deterministically while the Best model still plays with temperature=1 for the first 30 moves ?

General data augmentation idea:
Given input-output pair (x, y), you can construct a new input x'=a(x) such that (x', y) is also a valid input-output pair using augmentation function a. As an example, if x is a picture, y says this is a picture of a cat, and x' is image x with the brightness increased.

Typical use of data augmentation during training:
Let f(x) be some differentiable function of input x and parameters theta that maps to space of y. Let L be a loss function. Rather than doing SGD only on L(y, f(x)), also do SGD on L(y, f(x')). Essentially, consider both (x, y) and (x', y) as entries in the dataset. At inference time, just compute f(x).

Data augmentation as constraint on function:
Let g(x) = [f(x) + f(a(x))] / 2. Train g and also use g at inference time. The use of g always enforces that g(x) = g(a(x)) so should help with generalization. Additionally, can be considered a type of ensembling if (y - f(x)) and (y - f(x')) aren't perfectly correlated.

Data augmentation as a regularizer:
The previous definition of g does not actually force f(x) to have a similar value to f(x'). This means f itself doesn't necessarily incorporate the prior knowledge that f(x) should be very similar (or identical) to f(x'). We could make f itself learn this relationship by adding penalty d(f(x), f(x')) for some loss d. I consider this a regularizer because adding this term cannot improve primary loss L(y, f(x)) or L(y, g(x)). Perhaps this term could f or g generalize better to unseen data.

Of course, all of these ideas could be applied to to multiple augmentation functions (besides just changing brightness, could also crop image or do something else).

Has there been any research into using data augmentation in these ways? I couldn't figure out quite what to Google. Given the simplicity of these ideas, my guess is they've been researched or at least used in Kaggle competitions. CNNs and spatial transformer nets come to mind as related ideas as those models are invariant to some types of augmentations and therefore would likely have little trouble minimizing the regularization penalty.",12,38,False,self,,,,,

We show that such CNNs produce linearly independent features at a ""wide"" layer which has more neurons than the number of training samples. This condition holds e.g. for the VGG network. Furthermore, we provide for such wide CNNs necessary and sufficient conditions for global minima with zero training error. For the case where the wide layer is followed by a fully connected layer, we show that almost every critical point of the empirical loss is a global minimum with zero training error. Our analysis suggests that both depth and width are very important in deep learning. While depth brings more representational power and allows the network to learn high level features, width smoothes the optimization landscape of the loss function in the sense that a sufficiently wide network has a well-behaved loss surface with potentially no bad local minima.""",1,9,False,self,,,,,

Forms are submitted by people and multiple forms can be submitted over time. I'd like to understand a few things: 

&amp;nbsp;

1) How do I know what kind of labeling is possible? (examples below)
2) Is this a problem for deep learning?
3) Are there papers that I should read up on to familiarize myself with techniques and data preprocessing for this kind of task?

&amp;nbsp;

The project has a lot of historical data, but it also has many fields that the human considers when applying a label. Some example field considerations include: categories mismatching in two fields, date ranges out of sync between two fields, price values that do not add up in two fields. There are also more complicated consideration which I cannot yet comprehend how I would engineer features out of such as: forms being very similar to past submitted forms (ie duplicates) based on similar dates or values. So, humans would apply labels such as ""duplicate, due to X/Y/Z"", or ""field A category is not applicable to field B category"", or ""value in field A,B do not match value in field C"".

&amp;nbsp;

I _believe_ this is an ML task because they have people doing this, but noone has taken the time to write up specific rules to do this task. The domain of data is pretty much limited to the form, or forms historically submitted by the same person. But at the same time, it seems like a lot of features need to be set up relationally/manually and this feels like maybe an ML approach is not the right way. Referencing the end of the last paragraph, would I need to feed in features such as ""C-(A+B)"", and how could I feed in historical form data?

I need something fixed. I know person y, so I hand off the thing to person y and rely on that hand-off to fix the thing. Person y does something, then hands it off to person z, who does something, then hands it off to person a, who will hand it off to b after doing something, then it'll keep going all the way down the alphabet until it gets to person w, who knows me, and then person w, after making his own final touches, will hand the item back to me, and it's supposedly fixed from the broken state after going through all those people/layers.

Am I to trust that my item has been properly fixed? As person x, all I have sight of is person y directly after me, and person w directly before. I have information on what person y does to my item, and what person w does to my item just before he hands it back to me. Let's say I saw what they did and trust it because I monitored y's actions and w's actions and determined they were ok, so those are fine. But then, I have completely no knowledge of what any other person in the alphabet chain did because they're not in my direct vicinity. They could've done anything for all I know, screwed with it in ways i never wanted. So when I get handed back my item after it's gone through all those hidden layers, how am I to trust it or what's been done to it? Personally, I would want to properly monitor every single thing that anyone decides to do to my item, because otherwise I don't know how badly they're messing with it.

So then why is this ok in a deep neural network which has countless ""hidden layers"" that are not explicitly programmed by you and they could be doing all kinds of things you don't approve of? How do you trust what the output is if you only have knowledge of what a couple of the layers are doing, and no explicit knowledge of anything else? How are outputs that have been through tons of ""hidden layers"" to be trusted at all? Or is my analogy just off-base? I'm having a hard time grasping this concept.

Have been trying to approach this area for a while, and struggling with how to manage the magnitude of the imagery size while keeping within memory. Most up to date libraries have measures for managing large volumes of pictures/data, but I haven't seen much that has solved for efficiently managing massive single-item images.

I'd really like to be able to freely train CNNs on various sat imagery data I've been gathering/exploring, with emphasis on the smaller details of high-res, and I was wondering if anyone else had explored similar solutions?

Is this just a matter of dividing up larger images by x/y axis to resize, train a network, then re-map with information (bounding boxes/etc), or is there more of a generator-oriented solution on the horizon?

My question is, once you fit an LSI model to a tf-idf corpus (using Gensim for example), how exactly are you supposed to interpret the individual topics? For example, both LdaModel and LsiModel classes in Gensim have the show_topic(topic_number, topn) method which prints out a fitted topic along with the topn words which make up that topic, and their weights. In LDA, these weights come from the Dirichlet MLE, so represent a probability distribution over words in that topic, and each weight is positive, and the total sum should be 1.

However, the same show_topic() output for an LsiModel is not based on a probability distribution, and in fact, looking at the individual word weights for show_topic, there are usually loads of negative weights associated to some words for a particular topic. I'm not sure how to interpret these values, as they are clearly not weights. Are they eigenvalues of a sort? And more importantly, can I still interpret the output from show_topic() under LSI the same way I interpret it from LDA? It doesn't seem to me that it is creating proper topics as robust as LDA.",0,5,False,self,,,,,

How is backprop on a convnet doing so badly at classifying images, especially when training error is so low? Is this not overfitting? 

Seems like all three methods described for that ConvNet are over-fitting. While I understand that the point is to show that the three methods perform roughly equally well, I'm curious why there is so much overfitting.

(I would not claim to understand the proof in all of its details.)
So far so good, but at the Bayesian DL workshop at NIPS2016 Ian Osband of Google DeepMind published his note [Risk versus Uncertainty in Deep Learning: Bayes, Bootstrap and the Dangers of Dropout](http://bayesiandeeplearning.org/2016/papers/BDL_4.pdf), where he claims that even for absurdly simple networks you can analytically show that the 'posterior' you get using MC dropout doesn't concentrate asymptotically. Which I take as saying that there's no Bayesian approximation happening, since almost any reasonable prior on the weights should lead to a near-certain posterior in the limit of infinite data.

Alas, there are still papers popping up using the MC dropout approach, without even mentioning Osband's note.
Did I miss something? Is there a follow-up to Osband's note? A rebuttal?
I didn't attend NIPS2016, and I am thus not aware of any discussions that might have happened there, but would certainly appreciate any pointers (-- and given that Yarin Gal was co-organizing that workshop, I am pretty sure that he has seen Osband's note).

So far I've developed a random forest model that uses the first X days of a users experience to determine if they will churn before day Y.  I've had some good results with an AUC = .85 but this model is only good around the time it is run.

One solution could be to develop several more models (a model that runs on day 30, another on day 365, etc) but this seems like an inelegant and unwieldily solution.  I'd like a model that could be run at any point in a customers life and give an indication of their propensity to churn.

I've tried RFM models 

http://lifetimes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

(Using customer interaction with the app as activity, the RFM model wasn't able to predict customer churn early enough to be useful)

and a WTTE RNN model

https://github.com/ragulpr/wtte-rnn

(Although the above article recommends the WTTE RNN model for predicting churn, it doesn't seem able to fit my training data very well, producing an average likelihood of .1)

but the results just don't work.

Most work on churn seems to be in the non contractual sector.  There the above models seem to work well because even if you have a customer churn, it's not as urgent to identify them.  Where as in the contractual sector, you want to identify a churning customer before they hit the unsubscribe button.

I guess I'm just looking for general advice from anyone who has worked on this sort of problem before.

I am currently learning about machine learning and had a question about ANNs. 

I am currently working on a problem with predicting time series data. 
This data is multivariate, and I need to predict multiple variables of that data. 
So, option one that I thought of using was multiple LSTMs for each variable and then predicting based on that. However, if I do that, my understanding is that the ANN will not be able to learn the relationships of the vars, such as if var 1 goes up, var 2 will go down, because the LSTMs are being trained separately. Is my understanding correct?

Another option I thought of using was the multivariate example here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/, however in this example, only one  variable is predicted, and only a small subset of the data is used to generate the prediction. (I have much more than 3 vals/var, and in some predictions I may have like 20 vals/var, and in others 1000s of vals/vars). 

And the third method I thought of using is something similar to the machine learning mastery example, but modifying it to give greater flexibility on how many vars I can feed in, and then having multiple networks for each var that I need to predict. However, implementing this flexibility, is something I am struggling with. Can someone point me in the right direction, or tell me what would be the best approach?

I'm still exploring the connections. I think VI offers methods which can be applied to the gradient estimation problem as well. I'm thinking of the reparametrization trick, for instance.

Here are three interesting review articles:

1. [Neural Variational Inference: Classical Theory](http://artem.sobolev.name/posts/2016-07-01-neural-variational-inference-classical-theory.html)
1. [Stochastic Computation Graphs: Continuous Case](http://artem.sobolev.name/posts/2017-09-10-stochastic-computation-graphs-continuous-case.html)
1. [Stochastic Computation Graphs: Discrete Relaxations](http://artem.sobolev.name/posts/2017-10-28-stochastic-computation-graphs-discrete-relaxations.html)

I'm reading the third one right now.

Then I input 4, and ask the machine to guess if it's true or false. The machine uses the data it's been fed, 3 is true, 4 is 1 away from that, 5 is true, 4 is 1 away from that, average distance from the value I know are true = 1. 10 is false, 4 is 6 away from that, 12 is false, 4 is 8 away from that, average distance from the values I know are false = 7. 1 &lt; 7, therefore distance from ""true"" is smaller than distance from ""false"", so machine predicts that 4 = true.

This may be a very tiny example, but this is the way I've been basically understanding what a binary classification algorithm does. I fail to see how this constitutes an ""intelligent machine"". This seems like basic programming, it calculates an average distance of a new value based on al lthe distances of ""true"" vs ""false"" values of the values it already knows, then simply spits out the binary value with the smaller distance. This doesn't seem like a ""learning"" algorithm at all, it looks to me like this is a fixed algorithm that doesn't change its behavior and just does the same naive dumb thing to guess true or false every time. I mean, I could program this without using any of the popular ""trendy"" machine learning algorithms in use today, I could program this with zero knowledge of machine learning at all. Like, why would I need a ""sigmoid function"" or a ""support vector linear space"" or something else unnecessarily complex to make this? Sure, if you feed it more data to train on, then it might calculate a better and better average distance for true vs. false just by the sheer volume of data it already knows. But this really doesn't seem to me like it's an ""intelligent machine"" at all, it seems like it's applying a fixed equation on possibly variable amounts of training data, and will only perform differently if there are different amounts of data it's trained on. I thought machine learning was algorithms that don't define fixed behavior, this just seems like very fixed behavior to me, the amount of data changing things doesn't change the fact that this is a fixed algorithm.

So would somebody please help me understand why this ISN'T a fixed algorithm and why something that makes a T/F guess in this fashion constitutes an ""intelligent machine""?",10,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm willing to reproduce the laid back gathering from last year at NIPS 2016 in Barcelona. I am well aware that many may prefer to join the fancy and well catered corporate parties to be announced. There's no contradiction here. This subreddit is an anchor to the daily practice of many and I feel it's a great opportunity to meet in real life.

A local friend highly recommended to meet at the 'Blind Donkey' (http://www.theblinddonkey.com/long-beach), that he said reminded him of good old 'Amnesia' bar in San Francisco, may ring bells around here :)

Gathering would be around 9:30pm/10pm with no bounds into the night I guess.

I'm more or less new to keras. I'm using Keras with a Tensorflow backend and now I'm trying to debug my models with Tensorboard. 
I got it running and in my opinion the graphs are kind of a mess even for simple models. By googling I found some links where some people thought it's because of the inproper labeling. What are your opinions?
Does anybody use Tensorboard with Keras and do you have tips for debugging and optimizing with Tensorboard? 
Or some tutorials for Tensorboard with Keras, all I could find were tutorials with Tensorflow.
Or do you have alternatives?

Thank you in advance.

   I'm starting with this basic example that trains a NN to output sin(x): https://github.com/delip/blog-stuff/blob/master/tensorflow_ufp.ipynb
After training it, I try to pass in a single X value to produce a single Y value, expecting Y=sin(X) but what I actually receive as output is garbage.
Can someone show me method definition to have this NN operate as a replacement for sin(X)?

The authors propose using dilated convolution to get global context as opposed to max-pooling since pooling will shrink your image and dilated convolutions will not.

My first question is: They modify VGG16 and remove the last two max-pooling layers but they leave the other 3 max-pooling layers in. Why did they not just remove all the max pooling layers? Computational efficiency? Won't this result in a smaller image? How do they expand it back to the original size, bilinear interpolation? I didn't see that detailed in the paper so I wonder if my understanding might be off.

My second question is: They note in the paper:

&gt;We also remove the padding of the intermediate feature maps. Intermediate padding was used in the original classification network, but is neither necessary nor justified in dense prediction.

Why would that be the case? If you don't pad will you not further reduce the size of our final output, especially given that dilated convolutions can have very large receptive fields?",3,5,False,self,,,,,

Currently I'm trying to solve regression problem with deep neural network. I have some problems and I couldn't find appropriate answers from google so I'm here to ask your ideas. 




**Current problem**

My data samples are in [0, 1]^N. Because of this range, I had to use sigmoid(or tanh) as activation of output layer(Other layer's activations are all ReLU). However this cause serious problem which is gradient vanishing. After certain training epochs, my network became very hard to be trained. 





**My idea to solve this problem**

With simple assumption, I can transform the data samples into [-inf, inf]^(N-1) but this is just theoretical boundary. After this transformation most of data will be in [-1, 1]^(N-1). And rest of them will not diverge.(But those will have quite large number). 
In this case, I can use same network but different output layer which output [-inf, inf]^(N-1) vector(after that I will transform it back to N dimensional vector and solve the same problem). In this situation, I can use linear activation as output layer's activation function(or other non-linear function which has output range [-inf, inf]). 



But I don't know which one is better decision. Also I'm still hesitating to use linear function as activation function of last layer since I couldn't imagine potential problem which is caused by using it. Do you have any ideas?

H. and to me, it seems a lot of the intuitions on why we need it are simply wrong.
[I'll refer to this post because it's short and talk about the basic ideas of CN vs classic CNN.](https://kndrck.co/posts/capsule_networks_explained/)


Firstly, I would say that rotation equivariance is cool, but we could build a layer in a CNN to do the same. I'm not sure I understood why capsules networks would solve it (it has to be some learned function if it use the activation of some neurons and output the rotation. It is not something that will emerge out of nowhere with capsules networks).

The part about translation invariance/equivariance is simply wrong to me. 


&gt; ConvNets are unable to identify the position of one object relative to another, they can only identify if the object exists in a certain region, or not. This results in difficulty correctly identifying objects that have sub-objects that hold positional relationships relative to one another.

This is just wrong, isn't it? we're not talking about a single layer CNN, the kernels learned for the representation of ""Face"" will just not activate if the underlying representations (eye, nose, mouth) are not in the correct position. If we used a 1x1 kernel, yeah, we couldn't work with the spaciality of the data, but I don't even know why this is an argument. CNN allow for positional logic, but keeps the data in a 2D state, instead of making it ""0D"" and embedding the position inside the representation.

&gt; In order for the ConvNets to be translation invariant, it has to learn different filters for each different viewpoints, and in doing so it requires a lot of data.

Is the term ""viewpoint"" used as ""where is the data we use with the kernel"" or something about 3D-&gt;2D projection that happen with photo? Of course a CNN will not know out of nowhere to represent the 3D world, it doens't even know this is a thing. 

If the term is used as ""where do we apply the kernel"" then it is simply wrong (in fact it say the opposite of the truth). A face on the left and on the right of an image will output the same neuron activity! Even at epoch 1. It is how Conv work and it makes it so the network dont need to learn it (if the data is ""face, 5, 10"" and ""face, 45, 100"" the network surely will need to learn to work with it. but with convs it is embedded inside the model).

Dynamic routing on the other hand seems like a good idea, but it is simply pruning on neural activity to me. Pruning done with a NN if I understood, but still. It makes it more efficient and it's a path to look at for the future of ML when we will have huge networks and won't be able to run every signle neurons at a time, but I don't think it give something more useful than more performance in our models.

If I wrong can you tell me? I feel like this is so overhyped.

635,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,2017-11-13,2017,11,13,23,7cngwi,self.MachineLearning,[D] Fuzzy ART Capsule networks?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7cngwi/d_fuzzy_art_capsule_networks/,Turcik,1510583952,"Since I've read the ""Dynamic routing between capsules"" paper, it seemed to me that the idea of routing is quite similar to the idea found in Fuzzy ART networks: for each sample vector, find the neuron whose parameter vector best matches the input according to some similarity metric. In the case of Fuzzy ART networks, there is also a similarity threshold used to decide if a neuron can be committed to a sample. Also, if no neuron with a similarity above the threshold is found, then a new neuron is created.

I think a similar idea could be applied to Capsule networks but I may be wrong, so the purpose of this post is to discuss this idea and maybe to come up with some implementation if it seems feasible. In short, I think that a dynamic list of capsules can be used, and the routing algorithm proposed in the paper can be replaced with a similar routing to that used in Fuzzy ART networks (but perhaps still using the metric proposed in the capsules paper). Once a winner capsule is found, only that capsule is used in the backprop stage (although maybe all/a subset of the capsules can be used by taking into account how well each of them correlates to the input feature vector - however I don't know if this would be useful). The benefit of this approach is that you don't have to choose the number of capsules in advance, or that at least you can increase the number of capsules on the fly. The downside is that the network becomes sensitive to the order of training samples (or at least this was an issue when doing online learning with Fuzzy ART networks). The possibility of doing online learning with this type of Fuzzy ART Capsule networks is also an interesting thing to consider.

Lastly, there are also other ART networks that may be interesting to study, for example the Gaussian ART which I think is somewhat similar to the EM routing proposed in the second paper.",6,15,False,self,,,,,

Paragraphs are all from Wikipedia.

My question is not about the network architecture, but as an intro: 

We're using a simple RNN where the question and paragraph are the two inputs. Each is separately converted into a representation through a GRU layer, the outputs are concatenated and run through a dense layer with 2 output nodes (each giving a probability for either class 1 or 2). Class 1 means that the question is not answered in that paragraph, class 2 means it is.

My question concerns the training data: What is the best way to synthetically obtain more data? The data is in the form
    (question, paragraph) -&gt; label (0 or 1)

Options that we can think of:

* Use synonyms for questions (""What is physics"" and ""Can you explain physics"")
* Use synonyms for the paragraphs
* Generate random question/paragraph pairs that don't match (label = 0)


Short of the empirical method, is it possible to say which methods should work generally better or worse in this situation? I know that for image classification stuff like rotating etc. is done - is there a similar method in the case of text?

I don't know the title is correct for this topic but I want to discuss about the output shape of neural network. 


In regression problem, we approximate a function which can represent the data best. Let's say data is on the surface of upper half sphere. This means, the range of z value is [0, 1] and the range of other variable is in [-1, 1]. 
In this case, I think there are two possible choices of neural network output.


**Find explicit form of function, NN with Three output variable**
This is trivial. We can design a NN which spit out three variables which is x,y,z. Since our data is spread out on the surface of hemisphere so that the NN should find out the relationship which is *x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1, z&gt;=0* and suggest proper inference from input.



**Find implicit form of function, NN with Two output variable**
We already knows the relationship between variables(upper half sphere)*z = sqrt(1 - x^2 + y^2)*.(To make problem easy, let's say we clip the negative value in the root) So I can use this relationship and apply it to NN. In this case, the network has only two output variables and find out the last one with the relationship. (By equation above) So it doesn't have to know relationship between variables and the only thing it should do is, suggesting proper output correspond to the input.


What do you think about this two type of design? What would be advantages/disadvantages of both model? Which one would show better performance?

My argument against this point is that human interpretability of models holds them back - if we solely used models that were easy to interpret, then we wouldn't have all the advances that we see in machine learning today.
If you define machine learning as ""the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed"", then it's almost by definition that these models are going to be hard to interpret (otherwise you could easily explicitly code models yourself).


This is not to say that we shouldn't strive towards a better understanding of these models. Indeed, [this recent lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLqJHjXihK8) on the information theory of deep learning is fantastic and I hope we see more of this sort of work.

Scope: management wants automated QC of data dumps that occur monthly so that manual reviews are no longer required. That's really all I have to go on.

The data: Time series (monthly), approx. 100 variables, with hundreds of millions of training examples going back decades. Data dumps occur monthly with a few million observations.

My thoughts: Train a LSTM on historical data and generate predictions/confidence intervals for current month load, and flag data that are out the interval.

I have looked for research on applying deep learning to data quality problems and haven't found much, mostly applying older algorithms to do anomaly detection. A few more recent papers I found:
[MRI data QC and SVM/Gradient Boosted Trees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06353.pdf)

[Salary data QC, comparing MLP, CNN, SVM, and regression models](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318601321_Improving_Data_Quality_Through_Deep_Learning_and_Statistical_Models)

[Discussion],https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7d60u3/how_do_you_properly_load_models_ckpts_in/,Moondra2017,1510769973,"This is something that is giving me a hard time.

There seems to be a different ways. 

I see some blogs using the `.get_checkpoint_state`,

which I tried, but I couldn't properly load my global step.


`NotFoundError (see above for traceback): Key global_step_1 not found in checkpoint`

However, the weights were loaded properly. 

The other way I see is to look at all the nodes with 
`for op in tf.get_default_graph().get_operations():
  print(op.values, '\n')`

And then activiate(?) those nodes within the current graph as such:

accuracy = tf.get_default_graph().get_tensor_by_name('Accuracy/Mean:0')


However, there are so many similar nodes (All have the Accuracy base name), I'm not entirely sure which one I am supposed to load. 

I made a long question on SO, but I don't really get many responses on SO when it comes to tensorflow(everything else is lightning quick). 

Here is my post:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47299378/correctly-loading-a-model-to-resume-training-meta-graph-ckpts

What is the correct way to use ckpts to load models?


I'm mainly interested in computer vision tasks and RL with Python, so not sure if I should move to another framework that is easier to use.

I want to build my own custom NNs as well as use a lot of pre-trained models. 




Thank you.

&gt;Very few researchers: a) don't miss any prior work (especially published same year or, in another extreme, - published before Internet existed); b) don't make mistakes in their implementations, experiments or proofs.

&gt;As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough enough literature search.

It seems like if a prominent member of the Google Brain team had trouble with literature searches, it would be a problem for just about anyone. 

The term 'Machine Learning' by itself has over 4 million results in google scholar. It seems like there a lot of literature out there. 

What issues with ML literature searches have you seen or experienced? Was there a time where you knew it was very likely there was literature about some particular topic, but you just couldn't find it? Or, like in the case of the swish incident, was there a time where you thought you did a thorough literature search, only to find out that you missed some papers? 

What do you think the main issues are? Is there a variation in semantics which causes search queries not to pick up all results for a particular topic, or retrieve too many? Is there a lack of terms or phrases for a particular topic, so that you have to look for indirect ways to look it up?

One drawback of Capsules which it shares with generative models is that it likes to account for everything in the image so it does better when it can model the clutter than when it just uses an additional orphan category in the dynamic routing. In CIFAR-10, the backgrounds are much too varied to model in a reasonable sized net which helps to account for the poorer performance.

I read an introductory text to Deep Learning/CNN somewhere that argued that the best approach for overfitting is not to reduce the number of layers/filters but to increase regularization measures such as dropout, l2 regularization and so on. I think it went as far to say that (given you have enough data) you should try to use the biggest model your machine can handle and work from there

I wanted to reread/reference this text, but I can't find it anymore, does anyone remember it? And while we are at it, is this hypothesis tested? Is this generally true? In the Deep Learning Book there is something going in that direction: 

""What this [extremely complicated domains] means is that controlling the complexity of the model is not a simple matter of nding the model of the right size, with the right number of parameters. Instead, we might ndand indeed in practical deep learning scenarios, we almost always do ndthat the best tting model (in the sense of minimizing generalization error) is a large model that has been regularized appropriately.""

With no educational or research background in either machine or deep learning, they think they have obtained expert knowledge in deep learning just by installing tensorflow or keras and running some code from github. Then, they immediately add ""deep learning expert"" to their name and write tutorial blog posts or even have the nerve to offer courses and write books. Not long ago, I reviewed a book proposal about deep reinforcement learning by some two ""hackers"", who had no education and no work experience in either machine, deep or deep reinforcement learning, yet they felt they are already experts in it that they just had to write a book about it...

Why this bothers me?

It destroys the reputation of deep learning. Most companies have no clue how to recognize these so called ""experts"". The job interviewers don't have the required deep learning expertise to properly evaluate candidates and NIPS, ICML, et al. mean nothing to them. So they end up hiring the ""experts"". Then when inevitably their ""deep learning"" solutions fail, they conclude that deep learning is not working and it's nothing but a hype. As more and more companies experience this, more and more companies become skeptical about deep learning. 
Already, people from the industry half-jokingly refer to AI as artificially inflated. 

What do you think? Do you agree or not? 
If you agree, what should we do? 
Start, a deep learning hiring agency? :)

Particularly for something like xgboost or tree based models. 

The way I sort of think about it is that if a particular partition of the data has different behaviour to another then the trees will just split on that characteristic and then build their own sub models from there. If I partition the sample then train models on the partitions then I can think of it as a larger tree where I've forced the first split on the model. 

One hypotheses I have is that if there's one feature where I expect the generating process to be wholly different dependent on the feature then maybe it's worth building different models. For instance if I have the same types of customer demographic info for an electronics store and a real estate company and want to predict likelihood to buy electronics or real estate I should probably build a separate model for the real estate company and the electronics store.

Not sure if it's the correct subreddit to post to, was referred by someone from AI one. Sorry for possible inconvenience.
I am currently enrolled in a Master level AI program, and as classes go by, I am starting to have increasingly more serious doubts about whether I should go through with it, so I'd love some feedback from the people that are already in the industry. The current situation is:

1. I have a previous degree in electrical engineering, but I have graduated about 5 years, ago, and I was not the top student. Since then, I have worked in testing

2. My math skills are pretty limited. Somehow the math in the program is not that complex, but I really worry I will need to greatly improve to actually be meaningful irl.

3. The program is _hard_ for me, even studying almost full time I struggle. Which is not necessarily a huge problem, but combined with the next point feels to me like it is

4. My programming skills are very very meh. I know some Python and have a good foundation in algorithms, but I have never coded in a professional setting or written anything longer than 500 lines of code for that matter.

So all in all, looks to me like my chances of finding a job in the industry upon graduation are pretty slim. I wouldn't mind doing the program as a thing in itself and then learning to code, but I'd like to adjust my expectations in that case. As I've said, any thoughts/input are really appreciated.",27,6,False,self,,,,,

The goal was to create a network which can take extremely simple images composed of various color regions (where each color corresponds to a particular type of terrain) and generate a realistic looking terrain map. The inputs being the sort of image an average human with no artistic ability could reasonably sketch out in MSpaint.

The GAN is based on AffineLayer's ""pix2pix"" code with a variety of changes. Primarily I increased the image size to 512x512 pixels and wrote completely new network structures. The generator is composed of an encoder/decoder pair which are mirrored 25 layer ResNets with skip connections between them. The generator loss was skewed strongly toward fooling the discrimintor to emphasize creating completely new terrain features rather than recreating the original image.

I used a terrain map of the entire Earth and randomly sampled 512x512 crops to generate my ground truth set. To create the seed images, these crops were quantized to a color palette of 5 colors and successive mode filters were applied to simplify the features. Each of the five colors corresponded with a different terrain type (blue - water, grey - mountains, green - forest/jungle, yellow - grassland/desert, brown - hills/badlands). In total, about 1300 image pairs were created that spanned the entire globe. The network was trained on these pairs for about 450 epochs (more or less a full day on a gtx1070) before it reached a point that I was happy with the results.

Now for the fun part: pictures. I've posted several image sets below. Each set is based on a single seed image which I drew in MSpaint with the various color regions recolored in different ways to show how the generator adapts the same image structure with different colorings. Notice how the network is able to invent features like lakes and rivers and islands. It also learned to handle the features of color regions and their transitions differently based on overall context.

I have some *humbled* open source projects analyzing some datasets, along with some published papers. 

While I am interested in building up a career in Machine Learning/Data Science space. My question is about blogging, research papers, and open source projects, and how to build up a career in Data Science/ML, in INDUSTRY.

- I am intending to start blogging as well. While I use FB/Twitter to express my interest and opinion, I am willing to keep my blog as a space to showcase open source experiments. In this case, do you see it as a duplication (Open Source on Github with Readme file + blogpost on how to re-build things and lessons learnt ). The idea behind the blog and the website is to find a new a job, so it would be a place to show what I can do. My interest and work is around data science and data engineering.

- I interned at research Centers (R&amp;D), so I was involved in writing and publishing some papers. As an engineer, do you find (Applied data science ) papers helpful in my career (papers that doesn't come with novel ML ideas, but novel ways to apply ML).

- If you are manager, recruiter or an interviewer, what do you want to see in the resume of a data science engineer ?. I have mixed signals, some people want to see more in-depth knowledge of data science, and others skills on how to process, query and analyze datasets. 

- Do you have examples of good data science portfolios. Feel free to share links.

Using machine learning algorithms to play pokemon red.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7ecfqf/p_looking_for_advice_for_my_honours_year_project/,ceio,1511214033,"Hi,

First time poster in this subreddit.

I am in my final year of university and have decided that for my honours year project I'd like to look into the machine learning methods which could be utilised to play the game pokemon red. I'm going to assume that if you reply to this then you know roughly how the game works. The goal of the project would be to see if it can learn to progress through the game quicker than I can.

I am in the process of reviewing as many pieces of literature about machine learning in general and previous projects and I'm at the stage where I am not sure if the project will be too difficult to implement. I have looked into various machine learning techniques such as genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, neural networks and NEAT and I am unsure which approach/combination of approaches would be best to attempt to implement for this project.

I can use an emulator called Bizhawk to find the memory address locations which store game variables and write Lua code to access these variables, these variables would be used as input for whichever implementation I choose to go for.

I feel like there are many issues which I will have to overcome such as:

 * There are two distinct different parts of the game, battling and moving through the game, the moving through the game feels like it could potentially be addressed using NEAT in which I reward the algorithm if it transitions from to a game map which moves it in the correct direction, wins a battle etc, heals a pokemon etc. Although I am not sure if I should implement a separate learning algorithm such as reinforcement learning which handles the battling.

 * How does the system learn the reason for its failure, did it execute the battle poorly or was it under levelled, did it choose not to heal all pokemon to full health when it should have?

* Even with the emulator playing the game at 8x the normal speed will the learning process take too long?

* How will the agent even learn to do things like heal injured pokemon, buy items, learn which moves to replace and decide whether or not it catches a pokemon and train it as a part of the team. 

* Should I just pre-code in methods such as train, heal, progress through the game etc. and let it decide which methods to do and in which order?


I guess my question to all who read this is am I on the right track for this project or is this project going to be far too difficult to implement in the space of the next 4 months? Even if the project doesn't work I can still detail what went wrong in my thesis although I'd like to give it as good a shot as I can.

Any advice you guys can give would be appreciated!

Nvidia and AMD seem like the obvious choices, and I've also looked into semiconductor manufacturers and some ETFs purportedly focused on deep learning.

ImageNet for example - http://image-net.org/download-faq

I understand when the use of the actual images is restricted under the terms, but what about weights that we derive out of millions of these images? There is no actual trace of the image within the trained networks, its just a model derived by various iterations over the images. Much like we humans read books and derive knowledge (Most books by themselves are bound by restrictive copyright, but we are free to apply the knowledge we derive from them).

How do companies deal with this? Most companies using deep learning will have to use large datasets and actually creating the data(for example, of millions of images for tens/hundreds of classes) would not be viable.

Also when we do transfer learning on these heavily trained models, we essentially change the network using weights from a pre trained network and use our own custom data to train the last few layers, what about the licenses then?",16,31,False,self,,,,,

In short:
I was wondering if the critic f in a Wasserstein GAN works similarly as the discriminator in standard GANs, i.e. is it still the case that I get high function values for x from the real distribution and small values for obvious fake images?
 
LOOOOOONG:
After discovering  [Nvidia's ICLR submission on growing of GANs](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans) I noticed that I had missed quite some important papers on generative models, including  [Wasserstein GANs ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) and [the improved version of it](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028). However, I still have some questions, especially about the critic f. So standard GANs are formulated as a min max objective, and in fact under some assumptions this turns out to be a minimization of the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the true data and model distribution. By the way the min max objective is formulated, it is clear that the discriminator has to learn to differentiate between 'real' data points and the ones which come from the generator. This is why it is pretty intuitive that one can use a trained discriminator as a prior loss in an inpainting application for example,  where it basically judges how realistic the inpainted image looks like. In the Wasserstein GAN, however, the discriminator is actually called the critic and its way harder for me to get an intuition on what it is actually doing. So as the name suggest, in a Wasserstein GAN we are trying to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the real and the generators distribution. Unfortunately, the Wasserstein distance has a pretty horrible formulation so  adirect optimization of the generators parameters by backpropagating through the Wasserstein distance is intractable. Therefore the authors make use of this Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality which allows them to express the Wasserstein distance as a supremum over Lipschitz continuous functions. And at this point we get back to the GAN formulation, as we basically parameterize this set of functions by some feedforward-model (the critic f) and use a first-order method to optimize the parameters of f, which replaces the explicit computation of the supremum. The following update of the generators parameters can then be seen as one gradient descent step (or RMSProp to be accurate) on the Kantorovich-Rubinstein form of the Wasserstein distance. So sorry for the long wall of text, but this is what I understood of this paper. Now I have some questions about the  properties of this critic f. So let's assume that I have trained my generator until convergence and I also have a fully converged version of f. How do the function values of f look like on data from the real distribution and obvious fake samples, i.e. can I still use f as a discriminator in some other application, e.g. inpainting or is it really more of a helper function without meaningful behaviour? As this Kantorovich formulation still looks similar to standard GAN loss and we are in fact  maximizing the expectation of f over the generated data's distribution when training the generator, I would assume that f should behave similar to a standard discriminator, but I could be wrong here. Also the image of f is not necessarily bounded in [0,1] (or any other range) right? 

Thanks for your help,

I also plan on doing Andrew Ng's course in the future, but just want to get some opinions on the best path to learn and how much conventional programming knowledge is required.

I am fiddling around with a wine quality dataset that I found on UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). There are 4898 instances for white wine and 1599 instances for red wine. I am trying to do classification and linear regression on it by combining both dataset together and create another feature that determine whether the wine is good or bad (for classification), i.e. if quality of a wine is greater than 7 then it is a good wine otherwise it is bad.
The dilemma that I am facing currently is that there are far more white wine instances compared to red wine. Any tips on how I can increase dataset of red wine to match white wine? I am thinking of doing bootstrapping with replacement to draw more samples from the samples. The reason why I am trying to generate more red wine dataset is to prevent bias and improve training &amp; testing error.
Any suggestion on how I should proceed with this? Thanks!",10,3,False,self,,,,,

For a Computer Science project, I decided to work on adversarial attacks. The purpose of this project is to see how to train road sign slassifiers, then how to deceive them, then how to protect them from such attacks.

I started by working on MNIST, and everything works now. The repo contains modules to easily train models and run adversarial attacks against them. I hope you will enjoy this project, and I await your criticism and advice!

Collecting the data is easy but labeling it sounds like a job for Amazon turks. I could label the data using traditional CV, but if I have a CV algorithm that can do lane detection then whats the point of the DL approach (other than potential speed ups). I have this idea of:


1. training an auto-encoder on the unlabeled data
2. pop off the decoder layers and lock the encoder layers
3. append a much smaller fully connected layer to the encoder
4. hand label a small subset of original dataset (1%~10%)
5. train the small network on the small labelled dataset


The idea is that the auto-encoder will reduce the dimensionality of the scene and therefore a smaller labelled dataset can be used to train the smaller network.

I'm somewhat new to machine learning, but have taken a few graduate level courses and have a good understanding of the fundamentals of most ML algorithms. However, I'm having a research-related issue when it comes to the practical application of ML. My academic supervisor is very adamant that I apply a ML technique to a small (very small, ~16 data points with small feature vector lengths ~2-3 features). My initial reactions are that this is an extremely small sample set and from a ML standpoint the knowledge gained from using a NN or even simpler algorithm is very limited. It is my understanding that larger datasets trump even the most sophisticated algorithms for effective ML.

Has this sub discussed dataset size previously? Is this practical or even appropriate to try and force machine learning techniques on such a small dataset? I'd love some advice or for someone to point me towards some literature on small dataset ML. Thanks guys!

The paper Neural Discrete Representation Learning (from van den Oord and others from deepmind) calls this ""posterior collapse"". 

How is this possible?  

The decoder is deterministic, so in order to match different data, it needs a source of variability, and the latent is the only source available. If the decoder ignored z, it would always produce the same thing regardless of the input, which would result in high error.

EDIT: Last sentence should be ""If the decoder ignores the latent, it will produce output that does not resemble the input, which would result in high error"".  As the responses point out, saying that the decoder always produces the same thing is wrong.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution

    energy = sum of nodeX * nodeY * weightXY

    chance = e^-energy / sumOfAll(e^-energy)

If I have the context right, those imply that if the set of all possible correct beliefs of a RBM should occur equally often, then those states should all have equal energy which is lower than all other states. Therefore during training we should never reduce any state's energy to less than such constant.

If we know the sumOfAll(e ^ -energy), we could compute the chance of any given state, so we could also choose a high constant and never directly raise any state's energy above that.

It seems that during contrastiveDivergence, the unlearning of other states could somehow be improved by knowing the chance of each state before and after its learned and similar states after more inference cycles unlearned (as Geoffrey Hinton says (in very similar words to) ""learn the input, and unlearn what the RBM imagines about the input""). Simply raising some and lowering others the weights between pairs that happen to be on together works in practice, but then sometimes its recommended to do persistent-contrastive-divergence to unlearn anything that has become too low of energy. Of course any adjustment will have effects that are exponentially hard to know in advance, but it appears from those equations that it would be pointless to adjust any state's energy beyond some chosen range to try to keep all energies in, instead of ignoring energy and chance.",7,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm thinking of doing a project on GANs for Text using RL for a DL class in uni. From what I read online and from answers from u/ian_goodfellow it looks like the only approach is to use REINFORCE to handle the discrete nature of the latent space of words with rest of the GAN framework mostly unaltered.

There are already several tutorials on the internet on how to do this for one city, but what if you wanted to predict temperature for several cities and you wanted to us the additional weather measurements for each city as features to inform the temperature prediction?

I have seen two possible suggestions using neural networks and LSTM.

1. concatenate all the city data side by side (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/385#issuecomment-122595789)
2. feed the sequences from each city into the network one at a time (http://philipperemy.github.io/keras-stateful-lstm/ under the heading of ""Mastering stateful models"")

Of course this assumes that you can learn about the weather in one city using knowledge from a different city.

I'm not only looking for LSTM ideas, I'm open to any, but I am learning to LSTM with Keras.

I partially agree that regulation should be thought about, but he's just making matters worse by stretching_the_truth / overhyping_nearterm_capabilities like he does in previous Boston Dynamics robot tweet.

OpenAI seems to have not educated/rectified him that much,

By searching around I can see a lot of discussions about whether this is even possible and a lot of companies selling chips targeted deep leaning/machine learning algorithms.

However, I fail to understand what the problem actually is? Of course it requires a lot of computations to trains the network, but you can do that on elsewhere, and just install the model on the device. After that a single classification is (in my experience) quite fast. If I'm okay with a single classification taking a few seconds - and not a tiny fraction of a second - then is there an issue at all?

Then there is the model size. Of course the device needs to have enough memory to contain the model, but memory is not that expensive.

Can someone help me understand if there is a problem here, or if the reason I'm not finding any specifics is that there really is not problem.

My use case is a simple camera which triggers by a manual/simple process and the classifies the image.

Approaches tried:

1. Linear loss: applied to each output independently. The network rapidly learned the correct function for one of the outputs but never learned the other.

2. Linear loss v2: loss for the ""easier"" output multiplied by the accuracy of the ""harder"" one. The ""harder"" function eventually converged; the ""easier"" one plateaued on the training data and never did any better than an untrained network on the validation data.

I have been to a lot of medical, visualization, and lower tier ML conferences.  I have a couple of questions:

1. At many of the medical and other conferences, you see most people in business casual (dress shirt with tie) or even with full suits.  From what I understand, NIPS is nowhere near this case (which sounds awesome). What should I expect?  Khakis with a casual button down?  Or just jeans with a t-shirt?  What about if speaking to companies at booths?

2. Piggy backing on the last part of the first question, I have seen that there will be a lot of companies at NIPS.  As somebody finishing my PhD next year, what is the best course for exploratory talks with companies?  And similar to the first question: are any of these conversations like a normal interview where proper dress code is expected?

I am excited to attend NIPS for the first time, and as is probably evidentI am trying to break away from the strict dress code expected at some other conferences.

&amp;nbsp;

I am gathering materials to update my course and one subject that intrigued my students and me was the significant risk of hidden (and undesirable) biases of current ML systems -- aka racisms, sexisms, and other prejudices.

&amp;nbsp;

There are a few media articles about the supposed emergent threat posed undesirable biases in machine learning systems, particularly more recent DL versions. A quick Google search for [""racist ai""](https://www.google.com/search?q=racist+ai) shows that there is no shortage of mainstream media chatter about the subject:

&amp;nbsp;

* [Twitter taught Microsofts AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist)
* [Rise of the racist robots  how AI is learning all our worst impulses](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/aug/08/rise-of-the-racist-robots-how-ai-is-learning-all-our-worst-impulses)
* [Robots With Artificial Intelligence Become Racist and Sexist - Scientists think they've found a way to change their minds](http://www.newsweek.com/artificial-intelligence-scientists-racist-sexist-robots-ai-693440)
* [How to make a racist AI without really trying](https://blog.conceptnet.io/2017/07/13/how-to-make-a-racist-ai-without-really-trying/)
* [Artificial intelligence replicating the racial and gender prejudices of humans.](http://www.newsweek.com/artificial-intelligence-can-be-racist-sexist-just-humans-584240)

&amp;nbsp;

It certainly stands to reason that if, for example, we use retrospective data from previous analyst decisions on the issuance of credit (e.g., credit cards, mortgages, business loans) that the system would likely exhibit some of the same racial and sexist biases that were exhibited by the analysts (see Fuster 2017 below). Likewise, for systems to ""inform"" the criminal justice system in the US (see Kirkpatrick 2016, Rhodes 2013, or Burk 2012 below). I would like to put together some select readings on the subject matter with a strong preference for peer-reviewed articles for the graduate course I am teaching and would like to try my hand at getting recommendations from the Reddit ML community.

&amp;nbsp;

**Do you have recommended readings on the subject of prejudices/undesirable biases in ML systems?**

&amp;nbsp;

Below I have some scholar search articles that I have come across that address the issue directly or indirectly (in rough chronological order, not order of importance), but I am guessing that I am missing some that might be better. Note: some of the articles below (e.g., Galindo 2000) are more to show that ML has been used to make credit decisions for a while rather than to shed light on biases.

I'm approaching the end of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree and would like to continue to pursue Machine Learning! I find deep learning to be particularly interesting and would like to build a dedicated PC. I plan to mostly use it for deep learning but I'm not excluding other types of machine learning in the future. I've put together a build on pcpartpicker but I'm not sure if it's a bit overkill (or maybe underkill) for someone of my skill level. Any advice would be much appreciated!

A Large-Scale Study."" While the comparison between GANs in terms of ""performance vs. computing resources"" was interesting, but I think it missed another more important factor in its comparison "" the sample complexity,"" i.e., comparing the performances by different GANs under the same number of training samples.  


As we know, the GANs are supposed to be well generalizable to produce NEW samples (not just interpolating existing training samples) with a limited number of training examples. So comparing their performances  under the same size of training set can be more useful, since the available training samples, in particular those independent samples, could not be very limited  in real world.  


This generalizability in terms of sample complexity was studied before in Loss-Sensitive GAN (LS-GAN https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06264, not LS GAN -- Least Square GAN). It was shown that properly regularized GANs can reach polynomial sample complexity, which means they are generalizable.  This is important, because otherwise exponential sample complexity means  a GAN cannot well produce NEW samples unless it is presented with ALL samples.  To test the generalizability of GANs, we need to study their performances vs. different sizes of training set, rather than simply the computing overhead.  


 I think it is time for our GAN community to treat this issue more seriously.  In fact, I have been challenged multiple times by senior researchers in the computer vision and machine learning communities, who doubt the GANs may not be well generalizable.  I was trying my best to defend GANs in front of them, but we need more evidences with the collaboration from the whole community. This is a very serious concern, deserving us to address it seriously, both in theory and in experiments.  ",21,3,False,self,,,,,

I would like to train a machine translation model that is able to translate in both directions.

I do know that NNs tend to profit from multiple tasks during training, and I also know that there are pretty good results for machine translation models that learn multiple languages at once.

However, I am not sure if the naive approach of just feeding DE-&gt;EN and EN-&gt;DE training data at the same time to an otherwise un-altered model (""transformer"" model from ""Attention is all you need"" paper) is a valid approach on that. 

Does anyone have any experience in that direction?
