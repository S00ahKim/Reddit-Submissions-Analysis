I am writing on behalf of my institution's Technology, Relationship, and Language lab.  We are a small group of Psychologists aiming to understand the relationship quality and formation characteristics of chatbot and human connections. Once we can better understand the positive aspects of these technological relationships, we can initiate further studies that can aid in the advancement of more meaningful and fulfilling relationships with humans and their technological counterparts.

You are invited to participate in a survey assessing your experiences interacting with artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots. Specifically, our study focuses on the AI chatbot Replika. Your participation is voluntary, but nonetheless greatly appreciated. Our goal is simple: analyzing the effectiveness, quality, and relationships of human participants with their personal chatbots. With your help in taking this quick (7 min max) survey, we can create an informative understanding of the areas in which AI technology is improving the lives and relationships with humans. Please feel free to reach out to me or our principal investigator (whose contact information is included in the first page of the survey) with any questions. The survey is linked below:

&amp;#x200B;

I established a blog and a non-profit organization called [Machine Learning Mindset](https://machinelearningmindset.com/) trying to convey insightful information and debates about artificial intelligence and machine learning. Please take a look at the blog and the introductory post to machine learning:

[Blog](https://machinelearningmindset.com/blog/)

[What is Machine Learning?](https://machinelearningmindset.com/what-is-machine-learning/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Our Pledge**

**\*** We provide ***insightful posts*** in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence that help you to learn concepts.  
**\*** You feedback comments are much appreciated and ***NOTHING*** will remain unresponded. However, forgive us for possible delays.  
**\*** No more than ***three emails*** per week! No one wants to disappear in the cloud! 

&amp;#x200B;

**\*** Consultant regarding your ***Machine Learning projects***.  
**\***Free materials only available to subscribers. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Machine Learning?**

While artificial intelligence (AI) is the popular science of *emulating human cognitive behavior* and abilities, machine learning is a particular subset of AI that teaches a machine what it is supposed to learn. AI must be developed to process the vast volumes of available data into the essential pieces of information that decision-makers and others can comprehend, and *Machine Learning is the science* that enables this AI capability.The ***massive amount of available data*** and the ***advent of a new levelcomputational power*** made Machine Learning as of the most growing fields in science and technology. Machine Learning aims to examine bigger, more complex data and produce faster and more accurate to ***reduce the human cognitive and non-cognitive*** efforts. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Vision**

This [blog](https://machinelearningmindset.com/blog/) aims to provide the knowledge to become a master in Machine Learning. The goal is to bring insight from scratch ***without any assumption*** on the technical level of the readers.

## Introduction

Humans learn from the past experiences while computers need to be told what to do and need to be programmed. And now the question is can we get computers to learn from experience too? This question is precisely answered by Machine Learning. It is a method to teach computers to learn to perform tasks from past experience. Of course, it goes without saying, for computers, the past experience is data.

Lets look at one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms which is largely in use today in many industries and try to explain whats going on underneath the hood.

&amp;#x200B;

DyNet is a neural network library developed by Carnegie Mellon University and many others. It is written in C++ (with bindings in Python, and for the first time now also in C#) and is designed to work well with networks that have dynamic structures that change for every training instance. For example, these kinds of networks are particularly important in natural language processing tasks, and DyNet has been used to build state-of-the-art systems for syntactic parsing ([https://github.com/clab/lstm-parser](https://github.com/clab/lstm-parser)), machine translation ([https://github.com/neubig/lamtram](https://github.com/neubig/lamtram)), morphological inflection ([https://github.com/mfaruqui/morph-trans](https://github.com/mfaruqui/morph-trans)), and many other application areas.

&amp;#x200B;

C# installation is currently available through NuGet ([https://www.nuget.org/packages/DynetSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DynetSharp)), and will be available for compiling from the source over the next couple of days.

But the lack of version control of the data files is not the entire problem.

The determining factors for the results of training a model or other activities include the following:

* Training datathe image database or whatever data source is used in training the model
* The scripts used in training the model
* The libraries used by the training scripts
* The scripts used in processing data
* The libraries or other tools used in processing data
* The operating system and CPU/GPU hardware
* Production system code
* Libraries used by production system code

Obviously the result of training a model depends on a variety of conditions. Since there are so many variables to this, it is hard to be precise, but the general problem is a lack of whats now called Configuration Management.

Abstract:  Graph classification is a difficult problem that has drawn a lot of attention from the machine learning community over the past few years. This is mainly due to the fact that, contrarily to Euclidean vectors, the inherent complexity of graph structures can be quite hard to encode and handle for traditional classifiers. Even though kernels have been proposed in the literature, the increase in the dataset sizes has greatly limited the use of kernel methods since computation and storage of kernel matrices has become impracticable. In this article, we propose to use extended persistence diagrams to efficiently encode graph structure. More precisely, we show that using the so-called heat kernel signatures for the computation of these extended persistence diagrams allows one to quickly and efficiently summarize the graph structure. Then, we build on the recent development of neural networks for point clouds to define an architecture for (extended) persistence diagrams which is modular and easy-to-use. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by validating our architecture on several graph datasets, on which the obtained results are comparable to the state-of-the-art for graph classification",0,5,False,self,,,,,

I am having trouble finding right metrics for my problem.

I am predicting tags from text (multiclass classification) and I need to come up with metric that allows me to evaluate models.

I am taking top n classes with biggest probability as model output.
I can't monitor just precision/recall/f1 because I have similar classes. For example lets say that text X have classes [ocean, fish, boat] and my predictions are [sea, shark, boat]. I would say that this is correctly classified because sea and ocean are very similar, same for shark and fish. 
I am currently using word2vec and taking mean cos similarity between each prediction and label which gives maximum cos with given prediction. The problem with this metric is  (I suspect) that its value decrease as I increase n (top predictions). 

I think that good metrics would be something that combine cos metrics with precision.

The text of the petition below.

\-------------------------------------------

Largest computer science conferences such as SIGGRAPH, NeurIPS, ICML attract thousands of participants annually. The impact of such conferences is enormous on the community of computer scientists. For many it is the chance to expose results of research work on which one has been working for years and for many it is the opportunity to see the state-of-the-art achievements that will advance the world. It's no surprise that for computer science researchers the conferences are the main events of the year. However, many people cannot attend these conferences because of visa policies that governments impose.

The situation is especially prevalent in the United States, where the citizens of many countries have to wait for months to receive a visa for a 5-day trip to the conference. It is even worse for countries such as Iran, Russia, and China that are under a barrage of scrutiny directed at attendees and authors of the research work. This is particularly sad and humiliating as the savants who publish the scientific articles to bring the good to the world and benefit the society with non-harmless technology have to go through this process over and over again, for each conference that is organized in the U.S.

The goals of this petition are:

1. **Show a disadvantage of receiving a visa to the U.S.**While many countries (e.g. all citizens of European Union) enjoy free entry for the short trips to the United States, many prolific researchers and experts of their areas of research were not fortunate to have this option. This forces researchers to apply for a visa to the U.S. which is a complicated process. There are many hurdles with obtaining a visa to the U.S. for computer scientists. To give an example, *one has to take an appointment to the embassy, which can take up to a month in countries like France and up to a year in countries like Russia*. At the appointment the embassy will take your passport and supporting documents and with 95% *will send you to administrative processing* that takes 2 months. This happens almost all of the time to the people who have a profession of a researcher or an engineer, as these professions seem suspicious to the government. Not only don't you have your passport for this time, but you also don't get any updates or feedback. Even more, even if you got lucky and received a required stamp,*almost always the issued visa is one-time entry*, implying that you should get a visa for your next conference in the U.S., even if your previous visa didn't expire.
2. **Abandon the U.S. as a venue for computer science conferences.** We want organizers of the computer science conferences to exclude the U.S. as a place to host the conferences, until the situation of getting a visa is improved for the researchers and attendees of the conferences. There is *a large and growing number of authors, who cannot attend and present their scientific work*, because the U.S. government treats their profiles as suspicious, despite their academic results. *Countries in E.U. and Asia way easier issue visas for academics*, so they could accommodate more attendees.

This petition will be sent to organizers of all major conferences in computer science (SIGGRAPH, NeurIPS, ICML, etc.).

If you are an attendee of such conferences and also experience problems with obtaining the visas or if you share the same view on this topic, **please help us by signing this petition and sharing it in your social networks**.",232,355,False,self,,,,,

Abstract: An end-to-end approach for environmental sound classification based on a 1D Convolution Neural Network (CNN) that learns a representation directly from the audio signal. Several convolutional layers are used to capture the signal's fine time structure and learn diverse filters that are relevant to the classification task. The proposed approach can deal with audio signals of any length as it splits the signal into overlapped frames using a sliding window. Different architectures considering several input sizes are evaluated, including the initialization of the first convolutional layer with a Gammatone filterbank that models the human auditory filter response in the cochlea. The performance of the proposed end-to-end approach in classifying environmental sounds was assessed on the UrbanSound8k dataset and the experimental results have shown that it achieves 89% of mean accuracy.",1,5,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently trying to make an MLP which outputs statistics for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), i.e.,  means, covariance matrixes, and coefficients for each mixture components. This approach is already have been explored by others, such as Variational RNN paper (2016,  [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02216.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02216.pdf) ).  Although I'm not interested in posterior distribution and not going to implement my NN as Variational form, I tried to dig into the source code since the form of NLL loss function should be the same. Fortunately, the authors provided their GitHub link ( [https://github.com/jych/nips2015\_vrnn](https://github.com/jych/nips2015_vrnn) ) and I could find a form of loss function they employed.

&amp;#x200B;

Following code is the cost function for bivariate GMM model.([https://github.com/jych/cle/blob/master/cle/cost/\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/jych/cle/blob/master/cle/cost/__init__.py) )

&amp;#x200B;

![img](7k435xush0w21)

I've found that the highlighted part seems... *not right.* 

Here is the log-likelihood function for Gaussian Mixture Model. 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](pfmf560ei0w21)

This function is rather intractable, since the log contains a weighted sum. As far I know, we need to relax the problem and classic EM iteration is necessary to optimize this log-likelihood function. (Actually, there are many papers solely focused on this problem; such as neural EM. ([https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7246-neural-expectation-maximization.pdf](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7246-neural-expectation-maximization.pdf) ))

&amp;#x200B;

In EM algorithm, after you calculate gamma (posterior of component categorical distribution) in 'E' step, you maximize the log-likelihood ('M' step') by maximizing following formula.

![img](k9w6ast9j0w21)

But it seems like VRNN paper's implementation of NLL loss just simply ignored the gamma function (or E-step), and **assume that red-circled part is sufficient for loss.** (Ignore c\_b part, which is a binary entropy term for non-GMM posterior.)

&amp;#x200B;

With simple intuition, the whole calculation doesn't involve the variable 'coeff' () except the highlighted part. It means that NLL loss just contains the log value of the coefficient,  which makes all coefficient equal to 1/N in order to minimize negative log value.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is this kind of formulation is appropriate for Gaussian mixture model?** (Like, is it some sort of linear approximation of original form?) Otherwise, is there a simple way to calculate (or approximate) NLL loss for GMM?

&amp;#x200B;

Announcement on Twitter: https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1124440412679233536

From the update on their blog (https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#update):

#Staged Release

&gt;Staged release involves the gradual release of a family of models over time. The purpose of our staged release of GPT-2 is to give people time to assess the properties of these models, discuss their societal implications, and evaluate the impacts of release after each stage.

&gt;As the next step in our staged release strategy, we are releasing the 345M parameter version of GPT-2. This model features improved performance relative to the 117M version, though falls short of the 1.5B version with respect to the ease of generating coherent text. We have been excited to see so many positive uses of GPT-2-117M, and hope that 345M will yield still more benefits.

&gt;While the misuse risk of 345M is higher than that of 117M, we believe it is substantially lower than that of 1.5B, and we believe that training systems of similar capability to GPT-2-345M is well within the reach of many actors already; this evolving replication landscape has informed our decision-making about what is appropriate to release.

&gt;In making our 345M release decision, some of the factors we considered include: the ease of use (by various users) of different model sizes for generating coherent text, the role of humans in the text generation process, the likelihood and timing of future replication and publication by others, evidence of use in the wild and expert-informed inferences about unobservable uses, proofs of concept such as the review generator mentioned in the original blog post, the strength of demand for the models for beneficial purposes, and the input of stakeholders and experts. We remain uncertain about some of these variables and continue to welcome input on how to make appropriate language model publication decisions.

&gt;We hope that ongoing research on bias, detection, and misuse will give us the confidence to publish larger models in a timely manner, and at the six month mark we will share a fuller analysis of language models societal implications and our heuristics for release decisions.

#Partnerships

&gt;Since releasing this blog post in February, we have had conversations with many external researchers, technology companies, and policymakers about our release strategy and the implications of increasingly large language models. Weve also presented or discussed our work at events, including a dinner co-hosted with the Partnership on AI and a presentation to policymakers in Washington DC at the Global Engagement Center.

&gt;We are currently forming research partnerships with academic institutions, non-profits, and industry labs focused on increasing societal preparedness for large language models. In particular, we are sharing the 762M and 1.5B parameter versions of GPT-2 to facilitate research on language model output detection, language model bias analysis and mitigation, and analysis of misuse potential. In addition to observing the impacts of language models in the wild, engaging in dialogue with stakeholders, and conducting in-house analysis, these research partnerships will be a key input to our decision-making on larger models.

We are Myeongjun Kim and Taehun Kim. Our major is computer vision research using deep learning. Previously, we implemented the paper with RandWireNN pytorch version and tensorflow version. This time, we implemented a paper on ""Billion-scale semi-supervised learning for image classification written by Facebook AI""(https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00546). To briefly describe the paper, it is stated that the classification performance is improved by using unlabeled data. We realized that it was a simple and novel idea. So, we implemented it.
Due to the lack of GPU resources and unlabeled data, we are delaying the experiment on ImageNet and are experimenting with CIFAR-100 first. We would like to ask for your interest and feedback.
Thank you for reading long long story.

In undergrad I majored Physics and Applied Math, and in the years since saw cool realms of application for ML in industry and research. Unfortunately because of my background experience I now have some imposters syndrome setting in, well before I've stepped foot in any classroom. Hoping people can look at my goals, courses, and experience to try to suggest steps to better prepare.

I'm hoping to gain essentially three things from this degree:

* Knowledge of the computational foundations of popular or common ML algorithms (because its cool)
* basic skills and best practices of an ML practitioner (because its practical)
* Some modest amount of experience in projects and homework for the above (because its practical)

I would hope that I can get a job as an ML engineer/scientist/whatever afterwards, but preferably not closely tied to the ops side of design and implementation.

Summary of any related experience:

* Classification and clustering algorithms applied in medical imaging/histology field in a mish mash of R scripts, some published but never really rigorous or vetted I guess
* Using numpy to implement Q-learning in a little baby neural net on the OpenAI cart-pole example
* Helping write components of a django app that does lots of data integration from multiple sources
* I still really like math after undergrad

Any and all advice appreciated. Should I dust off a linear algebra textbook? Should I start in on a class textbook before the term starts? Try to play with a big sample dataset with different learning tools?

Some example classes I want to take below:

Machine learning
&gt; This course will introduce the field of machine learning, in particular focusing on the core concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning we will discuss algorithms which are trained on input data labelled with a desired output, for instance an image of a face and the name of the person whose face it is, and learn a function mapping from the input to the output. Unsupervised learning aims to discover latent  structure in an input signal where no output labels are available, an example of which is grouping web-pages based on the topics they discuss. Students will learn the algorithms which underpin many popular machine learning techniques, as well as developing an understanding of the theoretical relationships between these algorithms. The practicals will concern the application of machine learning to a range of real-world problems.

Foundations of CS (since I have no formal CS training)
&gt; Students taking this course will gain background knowledge that will be useful in the course on:
&gt; 
&gt; Theory of Data &amp; Knowledge Bases
&gt; Automata, Logics &amp; Games
&gt; Software Verification
&gt; Categories, Proofs &amp; Processes
&gt; Game Semantics
&gt; Computer-Aided Formal Verification
&gt; Lambda Calculus &amp; Types
&gt; Logic of Multi-Agent Information Flow 

Artificial Intelligence (intro)

&gt; This is an introductory course into the field of artificial intelligence (AI), with particular focus on search as the fundamental technique for solving AI problems.
&gt; 
&gt; This course also deals with optimization problems. For example, the optimization version of the nqueens problem is to arrange n queens on an n x n chessboard while minimizing the number of pairs of queens that are under attack. Such problems can be effectively solved by search techniques introduced in the course such as hill climbing, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms...

Computational learning theory (I see this as directly applicable to my goals)
&gt; The course will begin by providing a statistical and computational toolkit, such as concentration inequalities, fundamental algorithms, and methods to analyse learning algorithms. We will cover questions such as when can we generalise well from limited amounts of data, how can we develop algorithms that are computationally efficient, and understand statistical and computational trade-offs in learning algorithms. We will also discuss new models designed to address relevant practical questions of the day, such as learning with limited memory, communication, privacy, and labelled and unlabelled data. In addition to core concepts from machine learning, we will make connections to principal ideas from information theory, game theory and optimisation.",2,5,False,self,,,,,

Let's suppose a  game has 50 levels given to each player in the random order (levels never repeat). There is analytics data of 1000 players with the events of the following type:

\- Level Start

\- Level Failed

\- Level Success

Each event has a timestamp and a unique player ID. We can safely assume that after 7 days of not being active, player had left the game forever. 

# The idea

We are thinking of using the neural networks to arrange the randomised levels in the order that would **maximize the number of level restart events**, and **maximize the number of levels the player would be able to complete**. Given the user retention metric is maximized as well. We need a program that would receive an array of events as input, arrange the levels in the best order and output the list of level IDs with the difficulty indices that we can use to order the levels in the game.

&gt; But the fact that computers think very differently than our brains do actually gives them an advantage when it comes to tasks like number crunching, while making them decidedly primitive in other areas, such as understanding human speech or learning from experience. If scientists want to simulate a brain that can match human intelligence, let alone eclipse it, they may have to start with better building blockscomputer chips inspired by our brains.

Usually I am a JS developer, but wanted to extend my knowledge and incorporate the two at some point.

I hope there are not any stupid questions here.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to create a project that recognises different elements drawn on a piece of paper, for example rectangles and squares of different dimensions.

I am currently having to create the images manually by drawing them myself, I am worried this data will become too bias as I know what I want the end result to be.

I then feed that data into CV2 to add a randomly generate background to the image as the first few runs I processed with TensorFlow seemed to pick up mostly the white areas and gave me false readings.

Once I have the background image I use labelImg.py to draw borders and label the areas which contain the elements.

My data it then ready to be trained below are the results I received:-

(I allowed the training to run through 20,000 steps before stopping and testing)

&amp;#x200B;

|Data Sets|Success Rate|
|:-|:-|
|25|75%|
|100|40%|
|2000|10%|

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see from the table above when testing against the same testing images, the more datasets I introduce the lower the success rate of recognising the boxes becomes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question Time:-**

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a relation between the amount of steps the trainer should run multiplied by the amount of data sets provided?

eg.

|Data Sets|Steps|
|:-|:-|
|25|20,000|
|100|80,000|
|750|600,000|

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible to over train making the machine only recognise the data sets you have provided?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a place I can request data sets, I do not mind doing this manually, but for bias reasons, I am wondering if it is possible?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there an optimised configuration file for this particular task I am trying to achieve?

I am currently using the ssd\_mobilenet\_v2\_coco config file with some edits to image and batch size.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any advice you would offer a ML noob to help progress their knowledge?

I have been watching quite a few videos on YouTube (most notably Gilbert Tanner and Sentdex) and they are getting amazing results with only a small dataset and 20,000 steps.

Also just to note, the loss rate sits under 0.8 whilst training around the 20,000 step mark.

&amp;#x200B;

I am hoping the question above are not too targeted and could also help other people who are starting out with ML.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Using their current best model of the brains visual neural network, the researchers designed a new way to precisely control individual neurons and populations of neurons in the middle of that network. In an animal study, the team then showed that the information gained from the computational model enabled them to create images that strongly activated specific brain neurons of their choosing.

The findings suggest that the current versions of these models are similar enough to the brain that they could be used to control brain states in animals. The study also helps to establish the usefulness of these vision models, which have generated vigorous debate over whether they accurately mimic how the visual cortex works, says James DiCarlo, the head of MITs Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, an investigator in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research and the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines, and the senior author of the study.

Yes their [second derivatives are all zero](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/aqfl70/d_neural_networks_with_second_derivative_zero_ae/), but there is another interesting property that they all satisfy:

    f(a x) = a f(x)

Which means that, when you stack these on top of each other, scaling the input of the network by some constant is equivalent to scaling the output by some constant.  Moreover, there are cases where the scale of the output doesn't matter (e.g. if predicted classes are based on argmax of the network output).

This leaves us in an interesting situation where it's actually very easy to encode complete brightness invariance in a network -- where you can always brighten/darken an image by some factor without affecting its predictions (assuming you normalize the scale of the output in some way -- softmax, sphere projection, etc.).

I've trained models with and without biases on CIFAR and find they're both reasonable.  I suspect a more rigorous comparision would find that networks without bias terms tend to do marginally worse than models with them -- if only because they have more parameters (e.g. without bias terms you can't learn that airplane images are usually brighter than frog images).

But in the interest of developing networks that actually generalize well to the real world (not just the random sample of your data you held out as a test set) it seems like this a modest performance gap might be permissible, if it means you can be confident that your network will work well in significantly different lighting conditions.",22,38,False,self,,,,,

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00067.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00067.pdf)

Abstract:

Recent methods generalize convolutional layers from Euclidean domains to  graph-structured data by approximating the eigenbasis of the graph  Laplacian. The computationally-efficient and broadly-used Graph ConvNet  of Kipf &amp; Welling, over-simplifies the approximation, effectively  rendering graph convolution as a neighborhood-averaging operator. This  simplification restricts the model from learning delta operators, the  very premise of the graph Laplacian.  In this work, we propose a new  Graph Convolutional layer which mixes multiple powers of the adjacency  matrix, allowing it to learn delta operators. Our layer exhibits the  same memory footprint and computational complexity as a GCN. We  illustrate the strength of our proposed layer on both synthetic graph  datasets, and on several real-world citation graphs, setting the record  state-of-the-art on Pubmed.",5,23,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

For my research/thesis I want to apply Deep RL to a problem. In order to do that, I have implemented the problem as a custom Gym Environment.

Now, I want to use a Library like (Stable-)Baselines or Ray/RLlib to train an agent on the environment, but I am unsure which one is best suited for my problem.

&amp;#x200B;

**Strict requirements:**

* Be able to run on custom Gym environments
* Supports PPO and some other state of the art algorithms
* Be able to use a custom neural network

**Very nice to have:**

* Be able to use PyTorch for the custom neural network. (If not: Be able to use circular padding in the convolutions, since my Agent has a 360 degree view of the world.)
* Easy to use distributed training

&amp;#x200B;

*Libraries that I am aware of are:*

* RLlib (Ray), which does not seem to support PyTorch when it comes to SOTA algorithms like PPO.
* Baslines, which seems to be strictly worse than
* Stable-Baselines, which does not seem to support PyTorch
* TF.Agents, which looks cool but is quite young and would force my to switch to TF.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I am afraid that I have to switch to Tensorflow, in which case it would be a nice to have if the library is compatible with Tensorflow 2.0 as I hate the syntax of the old one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts or pointers?

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its worth in a series of artificial domains, and is beginning to show some successes in real-world scenarios. However, much of the research advances in RL are often hard to leverage in real-world systems due to a series of assumptions that are rarely satisfied in practice. We present a set of nine unique challenges that must be addressed to productionize RL to real-world problems. For each of these challenges, we specify the exact meaning of the challenge, present some approaches from the literature, and specify some metrics for evaluating that challenge. An approach that addresses all nine challenges would be applicable to a large number of real-world problems. We also present an example domain that has been modified to present these challenges as a testbed for practical RL research.",0,2,False,self,,,,,

So, say we have 4 balanced classes [1,2,3, and 4], and we train a Keras classifier and get the probabilities for a given prediction in the test set:

GT: Class 1

Output: [0.4, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2]

Great - the classifier predicted Class 1 correctly. But how should we interpret the 0.4 probability that was attached to the class?

Does it mean that given that particular feature vector, class 1 will be the correct choice 40% of the time?  

Where does the actual performance/accuracy of the classifier come in to this?

With some friends, we replicated some of the most important disentangled VAE (beta-TCVAE, FAactorVAE, both versions of beta-VAE). The motivations were the following:
- Have a modular framework easily extendable for any type of VAE
- Separate the loss and the architecture to have a better understanding of what causes the improvements in new papers (many papers change both and it's thus hard to disentangle - no puns intended - where the improvements come from).
- Have a clean and easily extendable visualisation pipeline for VAEs
- Replicate quantitative metrics to compare disentanglement 

I hope you find it useful, and please let me know if there is anything you think would be useful to add (new disentangle VAE loss, add GAN for reconstruction loss, ...)

The paper describes how to embed medical data for downstream prediction tasks.

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07860](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07860)

Supplementary: [https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-018-0029-1/MediaObjects/41746\_2018\_29\_MOESM1\_ESM.pdf](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-018-0029-1/MediaObjects/41746_2018_29_MOESM1_ESM.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

I am using Pytorch and trying to modify an existing template I found online ([https://github.com/yuchenlin/lstm\_sentence\_classifier/blob/master/LSTM\_sentence\_classifier.py](https://github.com/yuchenlin/lstm_sentence_classifier/blob/master/LSTM_sentence_classifier.py))

&amp;#x200B;

In the supplementary material, they have a section describing how to embed medical data by doing the following (pic attached below too):

1) Take the raw medical data per patient per time step and embed them (like how its done in word embeddings)

2) Concatenate all history of that patient for that timestep together into a long vector

2a) For multiple information of the same type, average embeddings using a learned weighting. The weighted averaging is done by associating each feature with a non-negative weight that is trained jointly with the model. 

3) Create another vector that contains time information (seconds)

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/b41lbaylotw21.png

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, in the supplementary material, it states that:

The sequence of embeddings were further reduced down to a shorter sequence. Typically, the shorter sequences were split into time-steps of 12 hours where the embeddings for all features within a category in the same day were combined using weighted averaging. The weighted averaging is done by associating each feature with a non-negative weight that is trained jointly with the model. These weights are also used for prediction attribution. The log of the average time-delta divided by a factor (controlled by a hyperparameter) at each time-step is also embedded into a small floating-point vector (which is also randomly initialized) and concatenated to the input embedding at each time-step.

&amp;#x200B;

My first question is: How do I actually go about inserting this time vector? 

The supplementary states that the sequences were split into 12-hour time steps. If that's the case, why the need for a time vector? It then later states that you can just simply concatenate the time vector to the input embedding. Why would a simple concatenation like that work and how would the model know to associate that time information with the appropriate part of the input? 

&amp;#x200B;

My second question is: For Step 2a), how do I go about getting a weighted average for the same-category features? That part is glossed over without much explanation and it is lost on me.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Tremendous progress has been made in the last few years in developing advanced virtual reality (VR) and robotics platforms. As the examples above show, these platforms now allow us to experience more immersive virtual worlds, or allow robots to perform challenging locomotion tasks like walking in snow. So, can we soon expect to have robots that can set the dinner table or do our dishes?  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, we are not yet there.  
&gt;  
&gt;To understand why, consider the diversity of interactions in daily human life. We spend almost all of our waking hours performing activitiessimple actions like picking up a fruit or more complex ones like cooking a meal. These physical interactions, called **humanobject interactions**, are multi-stepped and governed by physics as well as human goals, customs, and biomechanics. In order to develop more dynamic virtual worlds, and smarter robots, we need to *teach machines to capture, understand, and replicate* these interactions. The information we need to learn these interactions is already widely available in the form of large video collections (e.g., YouTube, Netflix, Facebook).  
&gt;  
&gt;In this post, I will describe some first steps we have taken towards learning multi-step humanobject interactions from videos. I will discuss two applications of our method: (1) generating plausible and novel human-object interaction animations suitable for VR/AR, (2) enabling robots to react smartly to user behavior and interactions.

**Shes a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons. How could she not believe in destiny?**

But I don't believe she lived. Her story is not all that unusual. Not in other kingdoms. And what is the difference between a dragon and a girl? The dragon is only two stones and her dragon is three.

As the dragon dies and leaves behind him the girl, she has now lost the chance to fulfill her destiny. In the end, she gives up the body, but it did not have wings. Her power dissipates and the girl dies like a leaf on a river, but with the power of a dragon and the dragon's magic that could have killed her.

That's what my stories are like. I don't know when or why something happens, but it always seems to happen within me.

 Abstract Enabling robots to understand instructions provided via spoken natural language would facilitate interaction between robots and people in a variety of settings in homes and workplaces.  However, natural language instructions are often missing information that would be obvious to a human based on environmental context and common sense, and hence does not need to be explicitly stated. In this paper, we introduce Language-Model-based Commonsense Reasoning (LMCR), a new method which enables a robot to listen to a natural language instruction from a human, observe the environment around it, and automatically fill in information missing from the instruction using environmental context and a new commonsense reasoning approach.",4,8,False,self,,,,,

Hi, I'm one of the lead authors on this paper.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: We show that adversarial examples aren't really weird aberrations or random artifacts, and are instead actually meaningful but imperceptible features of the data distribution (i.e. they are helpful for generalization). We prove this through a series of experiments that shows that (a) you can learn just based on these imperceptible features embedded into a completely mislabeled training set and generalize to the true test set (b) you can remove these imperceptible features and generalize \*robustly\* to the true test set (with standard training).

From this, I'm trying to build a language model. I don't have the whole text, so I can't do the conditional probability, so I calculated the global probabilities of each word. Now, how do I calculate the cross-entropy or perplexity of this distribution against a test data? Test data will have a certain number of words starting with the letter S.

Also, if I shouldn't have calculated the global probability, what else could I have done?

TLDR: I have the list of over 4000 words starting with letter s and their frequency distribution and have to build the language model to predict next word in the test data which contain 10-12 word starting with s letter. What are the best ways to approach this problem?

We call this result The Strong No Free Lunch Theorem as some recent results (Tsipras et al. 2018, Fawzi et al. 2018, etc.) on the subject can be immediately recovered as very particular cases. Our theoretical bounds are demonstrated on both simulated and real data (MNIST). We conclude the manuscript with some speculation on possible future research directions.

Abstract:  ProductNet is a collection of high-quality product datasets for better product understanding. ProductNet aims at supporting product representation learning by curating product datasets of high quality with properly chosen taxonomy. In this paper, the two goals of building high-quality product datasets and learning product representation support each other in an iterative fashion: the product embedding is obtained via a multi-modal deep neural network (master model) designed to leverage product image and catalog information; and in return, the embedding is utilized via active learning (local model) to vastly accelerate the annotation process.  For the labeled data, the proposed master model yields high categorization accuracy (94.7% top-1 accuracy for 1240 classes), which can be used as search indices, partition keys, and input features for machine learning models. The product embedding, as well as the fined-tuned master model for a specific business task, can also be used for various transfer learning tasks.",3,5,False,self,,,,,

I've been working on news recommendation problem, and I'm implementing a factorization machine optimized by FTRL (the original paper is here: [https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/zh-CN//pubs/archive/41159.pdf](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/zh-CN//pubs/archive/41159.pdf)) to model user interests, in an online learning fashion. As users' reading interests might change over time, I want the model to capture this change rapidly, hopefully. But the learning rate of FTRL decays as the following equation:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing gif 1wzmxtpt67x21...*

learning rate decreases monotonically over time, So as training goes for some certain time, model change might become very slow, thus hard to follow the users' interest.

What I'm trying is, do not accumulate the square of gradients from the beginning, just accumulate recent ones. In order to do this, I change to gradient accumulating line in the pseudo code to the following, where \\lambda is a number in (0,1), like 0.99 or something like that. In this way, I hope the gradients long ago make little contribution to the denominator.

Is there someone familiar with FTRL could tell me does this make sense, or is it valid in math? because the mathematics behind FTRL is just beyond me.

Thanks in advance : )

Housing ""resiliency"" is a problem in poor urban areas around the world as these homes are often not up to code (e.g., because families are doing their own house construction or good materials aren't available). This makes the homes (and the families inside) vulnerable to disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes. Many governments in these countries have resources to retrofit the houses for safety, but it's inefficient for structural engineers to walk up and down neighborhoods to identify the vulnerable homes that need fixing.

We [just finished some pilot work](https://medium.com/devseed/finding-vulnerable-housing-in-street-view-images-using-ai-to-create-safer-cities-2b58b4e3b991?source=friends_link&amp;sk=6606e973db864a29f90f41dda99350cd) to identify building features that could confer risk. The features we detected here were

1. building material
2. whether or not a building looked designed by an architect
3. and whether or not construction appeared complete. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is definitely more application focused, so we just used TF's object detection API under the hood w/ an SSD backbone and trained on \~7000 labeled street view images. The fun part was relating street view detections to an overhead building footprint map -- something I talk about a lot in the blog. (Does anyone know how Google or other tech companies do this?) We're working on releasing that training data if anyone else is interested in this problem space.

Hi Friends,

&amp;#x200B;

When I started learning AI last year, I found a ton of excellent free lecture material, but I felt that the available exercises and community was extremely lacking. I wanted to learn by actually figuring out and coding neural nets. I also wanted to find other people interested in AI to work on projects. It's hard to actually understand neural nets until I dive into coding some mini projects.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to build [exercises.ai](https://exercises.ai) to help people learn AI with a hands on approach. Not completed yet, but right now, you can browse around the collection of free lectures, or connect on Discord to talk about your project ideas or ask for coding help.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I want to get involved with whichever task of classification (sentiment analysis, hate speech, etc.) regarding text data, by using deep learning for my bachelor thesis.

I am confused about what should be the aim of the dissertation.  I mean, I am not capable to come with something ground breaking or fancy (eg. A new complicated architecture).  Beyond building some architectures from papers and testing data on them, what can I do in order to make the thesis more interesting?

Something I have thought of, is to create a pipeline that will retrieve tweets from the Twitter API from different locations and then pass them to a trained model in order to perform some kind of classification and then create a visualization of the world map regarding the topic (eg. brexit-preferences of each country).  However, this doesn't make a lot of sense since that procedure could be done more naively by counting specific hashtags on a geographical location.  Also, how the dataset could be created and labeled?  

Can you help me reconstruct my idea or guide me to a better direction?",13,1,False,self,,,,,

In a classification task in PyTorch framework, I see that, if instead of using a linear FC layer at the end without an activation function performs poorly than sending the outputs followed by a sigmoid function to torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.  This loss function computes softmax internally.   
I have no intuition why this might work but when I read about it online, there seem to be two different answers,  
1. Don't do this

2. If you do this learning will be harder.   
My observations are on the other end, where doing this helps.

This is a question that isn't really touched upon in most deep learning research, so thought I would reach out to the community for advice.

With neural networks, it is sensible practice to run the same experiment multiple times with different seeds, reporting the mean and standard deviation. This helps factor out the effects that random initialisation has on the model. 
However, how do you then perform significance testing on the results?
Picking a single seed seems random and arbitrary. Using all of them makes the significance test think the test dataset is much bigger than it actually is, which also doesn't sound right. Aligning the outputs from only from the same seeds seems random as well, as all the seeds are supposed to be equivalent.

Should I cite the pre-print? The pre-print was never peer reviewed and all results in the new version are better.

Can I simply reuse large portions of the pre-print (i.e. word for word)? Much of the old paper (e.g. introduction, related work) could be reused without any changes and be just as correct.

Various researchers ( [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06567.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06567.pdf) ), DeepMind ([https://deepmind.com/blog/population-based-training-neural-networks/](https://deepmind.com/blog/population-based-training-neural-networks/) ) and OpenAI ( [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03864.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03864.pdf) ) have highlighted the applicability of evolutionary methods (especially genetic algorithms) on training neural networks. The main reason is because evolutionary-based training can be easily parallelized and is highly-scalable. However, if we have a more efficient evolutionary algorithm, it is most probable that better performing neural networks can be trained. Can duelist algorithm speed up evolutionary-based training?

We analyze adversarial examples using techniques from high-dimensional geometry. We demonstrate several problems with the standard formulation of adversarial training using Lp-balls centered on the data, which occur in high-dimensional space. From these insights, we propose a new geometric constraint to replace the Lp-balls which gives improved robustness in some settings.

**What is this?**

About a year ago, a [tweet](https://twitter.com/KeatonPatti/status/1006961202998726665) went viral purporting to be written by a bot: *I forced a bot to watch over 1,000 hours of Olive Garden commercials and then asked it to write an Olive Garden commercial of its own. Here is the first page.*

It was a funny script but it was written by a comedy writer, not a bot. This was obvious to some people, but not others, and enough people that it was real that sites wrote [articles debunking it](https://gizmodo.com/dont-be-fooled-by-the-forced-a-bot-meme-1826832915).

I've had this in the back of mind for while. It **used** to be obvious that scripts like this were fake -- anyone who had used an RNN network knew they could only hold a coherent thought for about two sentences, there's no way it would produce something like that.  But since that tweet GPT-2 came out and changed everything. I was looking for something to test fine-tuning the new GPT-345M on and picked the dumbest silliest option.

I can't tell you exactly why I also it on Star Trek The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine scripts except that it was hilarious to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**How it works**

There is no Olive Garden or commercial data in the training set, that's all Star Trek, but GPT-2 is shockingly good at writing lines appropriate for a waitress or restaurant scenes 100% are not in the Star Trek Training Material. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Are these hand selected samples?**

Nope.  The title says 1,000 commercials but it's actually over 30,000 commercials now -- I couldn't resist trying different prompts and tweaks to the training data to get better results.  I didn't filter the samples at all so it's a wide mix of iterations, temperatures, learning rates, tweaked training sets, I pretty much just tossed everything up there.  I was overall impressed with how well GPT-2 worked with both very little fine-tuning, and how it avoided overfitting with a more training.  I trained these same Trek scripts with the smaller GPT-2 and definitely ran into overfitting.",1,4,False,self,,,,,

I built a tool which keeps track of all code and data deps of your data science project.

""We consider the problem of inferring the probability of a probabilistic
Bayesian network from observations in a sequence of discrete components. We
first assume a Bayesian network to be bounded by a set of discrete
frames, which can be regarded as a hierarchical structure. We then use
diversity to guide the inference process, by leveraging a Bayesian inference
algorithm to show that the probabilistic network can be executed with a
probabilistic network architecture that is both more efficient and more
powerful than that of the state-of-the-art. We show empirically that our
algorithms are more helpful than the state of the art in inference in
Bayesian networks.""

With everyone trying their hand at NLG I tried to train the recently released 345M version GPT-2 model on ~30k papers from arxiv. 

The results look pretty great to me. Few of my friends had a hard time believing the titles and abstracts have been generated by the model and not written by a human.

Made a simple webapp to show a few generated samples [here](https://thispaperdoesnotexist)

I'm still figuring out how to format the output data in a nice way and display in the webapp without taking too much space. The webapp currently has ~80 random samples out of ~1000 samples the model generated. I had to manually format the output for them to be displayed using JavaScript.

I've found [The Illustrated Transformer](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) and [The Annotated Transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) much help. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, after great lengths I think I've gotten solid intuition on what the self-attention layer will learn. It will essentially learn a **contextualized** meaning for each word in the input function (correct me if I'm wrong here).

  
Then each of those ""contextualized-meaning embeddings"" are then put through the same 2 layer, fully connected feed-forward network - which has an output of the same size (512), with a much larger hidden layer.   


The output is then feed into the next Transformer layer, with a batch norm, and a residual connection along for the ride (Going to try leave them out of this for a while if possible)   


Do we have any idea what the that feed-forward neural network actually learns? What is it's purpose?  
Or why the same feedforward is applied to each ""contextualized word""? Is it sort of learning what might be important? (But then again, didn't the WO vector that took the multi-head attention matrices into a single matrix learn to do the same thing?)",8,143,False,self,,,,,

AWS: p2.xlarge -- 1 Tesla K80, 4 vCPUs, 61gb ram **$0.900/hr**
Azure: NC6 -- 1 Tesla K80, 6 vCPUs, 56gb ram **$0.900/hr**
GCP: 1 Tesla K80, 6 vCPUs, 52gb ram **$0.663/hr**

Further, for training CNNs on the K80 I never exceed 4-5gb of memory usage or reasonable utilization of 4 vCPUs. Since GCP is the only cloud that gives me ability to finely tune specs I can even further decrease cost for ML applications. For example:

GCP: 1 Tesla K80, 4 vCPUs, 5gb ram **$0.424/hr**

When benchmarking resnet50, this cheaper configuration provides no performance decrease compared to the more expensive instance.

Perhaps spot instance pricing (low-priority for azure, preemptible for GCP) comes into play, where GCP is in the middle of the pack:

AWS: p2.xlarge -- 1 Tesla K80, 4 vCPUs, 61gb ram **$0.270/hr**
Azure: NC6 -- 1 Tesla K80, 6 vCPUs, 56gb ram **$0.180/hr**
GCP: 1 Tesla K80, 6 vCPUs, 52gb ram **$0.236/hr**

This kind of instance, however, does not work for every use case so the regular on-demand pricing difference is still significant.

This all leaves me wondering:
If you train your models on the cloud, which provider do you use?

Can you imagine any reasons/use cases/etc that might warrant picking a provider other than GCP?

What is GCPs business model? How can they make money selling for so much less? Is this a loss leader to gain market share?",20,17,False,self,,,,,

1. Wxh - multiple with new input to give a hidden state
2. Whh - multiply with rolling hidden state to add to it the above hidden state
3. Why - multiple with the rolling hidden state to obtain the output

And we have the rolling hidden state (H) which accumulates all the information from the inputs. And we optimise on the loss calculated from the output to find the best set of above params

What I am not able to visualise and understand is the part in which the so-called sequential memory is stores ? 

Is it stored in the vector H (the rolling hidden state) or the weight matrix Whh ?

Given how competitive PhD applications are, do I stand any chances, since my background is not pure engineering? If yes, any advices on how to start?

A **method for training artificial neural networks** to generate missing data within a variable context. As the idea is hard to put in a single sentence, I will use an example:

An image may have missing pixels (let's say, under a smudge). How can one restore the missing pixels, knowing only the surrounding pixels? One approach would be a ""generator"" neural network that, given the surrounding pixels as input, generates the missing pixels.

But how to train such a network? One can't expect the network to exactly produce the missing pixels. Imagine, for example, that the missing data is a patch of grass. One could teach the network with a bunch of images of lawns, with portions removed. The teacher knows the data that is missing, and could score the network according to the root mean square difference (RMSD) between the generated patch of grass and the original data. The problem is that if the generator encounters an image that is not part of the training set, it would be impossible for the neural network to put all the leaves, especially in the middle of the patch, in exactly the right places. The lowest RMSD error would probably be achieved by the network filling the middle area of the patch with a solid color that is the average of the color of pixels in typical images of grass. If the network tried to generate grass that looks convincing to a human and as such fulfills its purpose, there would be an unfortunate penalty by the RMSD metric.

My idea is this (see figure below): Train simultaneously with the generator a classifier network that is given, in random or alternating sequence, generated and original data. The classifier then has to guess, in the context of the surrounding image context, whether the input is original (1) or generated (0). The generator network is simultaneously trying to get a high score (1) from the classifier. The outcome, hopefully, is that both networks start out really simple, and progress towards generating and recognizing more and more advanced features, approaching and possibly defeating human's ability to discern between the generated data and the original. If multiple training samples are considered for each score, then RMSD is the correct error metric to use, as this will encourage the classifier network to output probabilities.",74,272,False,self,,,,,

The idea is this. Imagine you had a group of agents who randomly match up and repeatedly play 2-player zero-sum game against one other. This game has a known structure, and each agent has a strategy for playing the game that has varied success depending on the opponent they face.

The goal is to represent each agent as a point in feature space such that these features maximize the ability to infer ""skill level"" for a player. Then given 2 agents' representations, the outcome of a matchup between those agents can be predicted.

However, the idea is that the features have to be inferred from interactions between other players, so after each matchup's outcome the features of the two agents are adjusted based on new information, and agents' ratings converge to their ""true"" rating as more games are played.

The idea is inspired by the Elo rating system used widely in chess and competitive gaming, because it's a special case of what I'm trying to do. Each player has an Elo rating that is a normally distributed measure of skill. After each seen game outcome, the winner gains points and the loser loses points, but the amount transferred depends on the disparity in score between players. The difference in Elo rating produces a predicted chance to win/lose for either player when a game is played between them.

In a more generalized case where you have an N-dimensional rating with more possible game outcomes, could you learn the optimal transition function that would need to be applied after each game that can maximize game outcome prediction accuracy?",2,1,False,self,,,,,

It's a lot easier to compute a lot of useful quantities using this form like e.g. stationary distributions.

However, one of the things that gets lost in this formalism is are intrinsic scales of the problem. In the continuous limit, rescaling the time variable t (or more generally, performing an arbitrary coordinate transformation) leaves the trajectory invariant, because the differential equation is formulated in a covariant fashion. This gives misleading results if you want to analyze something like the convergence rates. In this continuous formulation, you can just rescale your time parameter to 'speed up' your dynamics (which is equivalent to increasing alpha), whereas you obviously can't do this in the discrete formulation, because if you rescale alpha arbitrarily you overshoot and you get bad convergence.

The first thing that came to mind when I started thinking about this was that you could amend your differential equation to include higher-order correction terms. Specifically, if we have a differential equation of the form x'(t) = f(x), we can Taylor expand to get x(t + delta)  x(t) + f(x)\*delta + 0.5\*Df(x)\*f(x)\*delta\^2 + O(delta\^3). This tells us that the difference between the continuous trajectory solution x(t + delta) and the discrete trajectory x(t) + f(x)\*delta after a time delta will be roughly 0.5\*Df(x)\*f(x)\*delta\^2. In order to get a more accurate model for the discrete-time process x(t+delta) = x(t) + f(x)\*delta, we can introduce a correction term into our differential equation: x'(t) = f(x) - 0.5\*Df(x)\*f(x)\*delta. When f is -alpha\*grad(loss), this becomes x'(t) = -alpha\*grad(loss)(x) + 0.5\*alpha\*Hessian(loss)(x)\*grad(loss)(x)\*delta. This correction term breaks covariance: when t is rescaled, both alpha and delta are necessarily rescaled, so the correction term transforms differently than the gradient term. It seems to me like this is a natural way to model the breakdown of covariance in the discrete dynamical system in the continuous setting and to study why certain timescales/learning rates are preferred.

tl;dr: Does know if this version of the continuous-time limit has been studied before? If so, can someone point me towards some references that I can read up on?",3,9,False,self,,,,,

The paper states:

1) There are 1837 features representing medical concepts. These concepts are textual medical codes such as ""CPT 9002""

2) These 1837 features are put into an embedding layer with an output of (1837 x Demb-1)

Assuming I have 10 out of the 1837 features available for a timestep, would the input to the embedding look like:

1) A vector of length 10 representing the available data? If so, why would the paper say that the output is 1837xDemb-1?

2) A vector of length 1837 containing 1's and 0's indicating which features were available for this timestep? If so, why would you need to concatenate the frequencies to the output?

Abstract: Insects and hummingbirds exhibit extraordinary flight capabilities and can simultaneously master seemingly conflicting goals: stable hovering and aggressive maneuvering, unmatched by small scale man-made vehicles. Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicles (FWMAVs) hold great promise for closing this performance gap. However, design and control of such systems remain challenging due to various constraints. Here, we present an open source high fidelity dynamic simulation for FWMAVs to serve as a testbed for the design, optimization and flight control of FWMAVs. For simulation validation, we recreated the hummingbird-scale robot developed in our lab in the simulation. System identification was performed to obtain the model parameters. The force generation, open-loop and closed-loop dynamic response between simulated and experimental flights were compared and validated. The unsteady aerodynamics and the highly nonlinear flight dynamics present challenging control problems for conventional and learning control algorithms such as Reinforcement Learning. The interface of the simulation is fully compatible with OpenAI Gym environment. As a benchmark study, we present a linear controller for hovering stabilization and a Deep Reinforcement Learning control policy for goal-directed maneuvering. Finally, we demonstrate direct simulation-to-real transfer of both control policies onto the physical robot, further demonstrating the fidelity of the simulation.

**Notes**

* The paper introduces three techniques for augmenting speech data in speech recognition.
* They come from the observation that spectrograms which often used as input can be treated as images, so various image augmentation methods can be applied.
* I find the idea interesting.
* It covers three methods: time warping, frequency masking, and time masking.
* Details are clearly explained in the paper.
* While the first one, time warping, looks salient apparently, Daniel, the first author, told me that indeed the other two are much more important than time warping, so it can be ignored if necessary. (Thanks for the advice, Daniel!)
* I found that implementing time warping with TensorFlow is tricky because the relevant functions are based on the static shape of the melspectrogram tensor, which is hard to get from the pre-defined graph.
* I test frequency / time masking on Tensor2tensor's LibriSpeech Clean Small Task.
* The paper used the LAS model, but I stick to Transformer.
* To compare the effect of specAugment, I also run a base model without augmentation.",3,5,False,self,,,,,

I maintained HyperLearn ( [https://github.com/danielhanchen/hyperlearn](https://github.com/danielhanchen/hyperlearn) Faster ML algos on Python ), but from Feb - May I was a bit busy with uni + work. But since stuff has calmed down, I was just asking everyone here on what fast and useful ML algos people would like to see, where maybe other packages lack in.

My main aims for HyperLearn are:

1. Delete all C/C++ dependencies, and rely solely on Numba + Scipy LAPACK.
2. Focus on specific algos that are extremely relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

And on algos, I wanted to focus on:

&amp;#x200B;

a. Randomized + Dense PCA on Sparse Matrices (without converting sparse to dense). decomposition.PCA \[people tend to use pure SVD, but it ""can"" have different results than without removing mean""\]

b. Porting Eigendecomposition via MRRR for the top K eigenvectors. \[Scipy still hasn't..\] decomposition.EIGH

c. Fixing all memory copies for SVD, and support Randomized SVD on sparse matrices. decomposition.SVD

d. Fix up LinearSolve and place it into 1 module with LSMR (super fast sparse solve), combine with Cholesky, SVD, Eig, etc solving + Ridge. linear\_model.solve

e. And finally, introduce a Python only modified version of Spotify's ANNOY library (a limited nearest neighbor KD-Tree based on other heuristics I found to be useful).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just ""guessing"" the top 5 seem useful, as I myself have had many issues / struggles with other package algos. I'm aiming to make the final package easily installable with only Scipy + Numba as it's prereqs (no more C/C++).

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone else has opinions on what algos people want to see, but current packages lack in, please do! \[Notice my field of knowledge is also limited....\] If you want to help, PLEASEEE MSG me!!! I wantttt help!

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, check out NVIDIA's cuML  [https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml) ! I'm part of their team making GPU algos super fast! For eg - UMAP runs in 2 minutes or so vs 15 minutes for Fashion MNIST.

&amp;#x200B;

Suppose we want to estimate the distribution of entities in one dimension x and how the distribution evolves over time. For the sake of example the dimension can represent the spatial position of the entities, e.g. in east-west direction. Unfortunately the entities do not have identifiers, so we can not tell if two measurements x\_1 and x\_2 belong to the same entity or not if they arrive at different times.

&amp;#x200B;

The observability of the entities is limited which means that current x positions are not known at all times. Measurements of x arrive with varying temporal density. Thus, binning by time would lead to some time bins having few, others having a lot of data points.

&amp;#x200B;

If we assume that the total number fof entities is constant, how could we estimate the distribution over x, given t, in such a way that the temporal density is accounted for? I'd imagine a system where measurements in times of low density have a longer time-to-live, i.e. contribute to the density estimation for longer times compared to times when a lot of measurements arrive.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a stochastic filtering problem? I'd be grateful for any hints what papers or textbook chapters to read to understand this issue better. My experience in the field is mostly limited to classification and regression with only limited exposure to density estimation and unsupervised learning. So, apologies if the question is trivial, I currently just don't know where to start reading.

""Assessing Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning""
https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/03/18/rl-generalization/

&gt; We present a benchmark for studying generalization in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Systematic empirical evaluation shows that vanilla deep RL algorithms generalize better than specialized deep RL algorithms designed specifically for generalization. In other words, simply training on varied environments is so far the most effective strategy for generalization.


""Quantifying Generalization in Reinforcement Learning""
https://openai.com/blog/quantifying-generalization-in-reinforcement-learning/

&gt; Generalizing between tasks remains difficult for state of the art deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Although trained agents can solve complex tasks, they struggle to transfer their experience to new environments. Even though people know that RL agents tend to overfit  that is, to latch onto the specifics of their environment rather than learn generalizable skills  RL agents are still benchmarked by evaluating on the environments they trained on. This would be like testing on your training set in supervised learning!

**Detailed Description:**Current state-of-the-art VQA models are unable to read and reason about text in images which in contrast is most asked by the users of such systems. TextVQA aims to provide a benchmark for measuring progress of VQA models on text reading and reasoning capabilities.

State-of-the-art VQA models on TextVQA are only around 14% while the human accuracy is \~85%. LoRRA module introduced in [TextVQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08920) paper can be attached to any VQA model to add text reading and reasoning capabilities. The current state-of-the-art on TextVQA is \~27% with LoRRA.

In ""Unusual Activity Detection for Video Surveillance by Rajat Singh, Sarvesh Vishwakarma, Anupam Agrawal, and M.D. Tiwari"" , the authors have laid stress on the fact that the field of security, video surveillance has been of paramount importance because of which its importance has somewhat escalated in the past few years. This growth can be accounted for when considering that it has numerous applications in the field of law enforcement, both police and military and, therefore, detection of suspicious or unusual activity has gained importance and various governmental agencies are looking for an efficient and robust application of the same. This system can be broken down further in the following processes: detection of object, tracking the movement, and monitoring of activity. The authors have tried to present a system that examines the activity performed by a human. This system does two things: detects a person who is carrying with him an object or a person who is abandoning an object and then it segments that object from the person so that it could be tracked as well. The system sends a notification to the end user when it detects an unusual activity.

Now, the video is broken down into several image frames and each frame is fed to the system and the algorithm detects the person as a whole as the system is not specifically aimed at capturing human parts like limbs. Now, the object segmentation is done using Gaussian mixture model. The features such as size, centre of mass and bounding box are used to maintain matching in consequent frames. Now, as the object is being tracked, Bayesian inference framework is used for the analysis of the event.

However, this system is limited to a single camera view and the scenario considered here is that the number of people present in the environment is pretty limited whereas in real life where there can be a large crowds as well, a system which can analyse unusual activities using multiple camera views along with a robust and sophisticated algorithm which can handle complicated scenarios rather easily is needed.

The methods presented in this paper give promising results in a constrained environment and can be used as a base for future research.

As far as I'm aware of, vocabulary is not normalized at all across research. 
I tend to use depth for the number of consecutive convolution, and width for the number of filter used at each convolutional layer.
Though, its tricky when considering the tensor shape, where height and width are used to describe the tensor shape that comes from input size, and depth corresponding to the number of filter.

**INTRODUCTION**

A machine analysis of facial expressions first surveys the problem domain, describes the problem space, and examines the state of the art. Four areas will receive particular attention: face detection, facial feature extraction, facial muscle action detection, and emotion recognition. 

**IMPLEMENTATION**

First step is pre-processing of the image to bring in the proper luminance value throughout

the image. Then by using the Haar-Cascades method the skin and the non-skin pixels are separated to separate the face from the background. A simple rectangular Haar-like feature can

be defined as the difference of the sum of pixels of areas inside the rectangle, which can be at any position and scale within the original image. This modified feature set is called 2-rectangle feature. Viola and Jones also defined 3-rectangle features and 4-rectangle features. The values indicate certain characteristics of a particular area of the image. Each feature type can indicate the existence (or absence) of certain characteristics in the image, such as edges or changes in texture. For example, a 2-rectangle feature can indicate where the border lies between a dark

region and a light region.



Sliding-Window Approach and then Gabor filter responses calculation is done. Once the skin or the face is detected, then we go in for the mouth and eye mapping. Before going in for the mouth extraction, we apply the colour constancy algorithm, to correct colour deviations caused by a difference in illumination as done by the human. We use the max rgb algorithm for the correction.

This algorithm uses the special Minkowski norm, given by,

where p=6

The next step is extraction of the mouth and the eye map, which is done based on the chrominance and luminance values, within the classified skin regions. Those regions which have a high red component are said to form the mouth map, and those regions with high black and white components are said to be the eye region.

Once the maps are formed they are converted to binary images to extract the mouth and eye regions from the original image. Based on the Euclidian distance the eye and mouth region are identified Lips and Eyes are extracted based on the Mouth\_Cascade and Frontal\_Eyes\_Cascade. Extracted eye and Lips is processed for expression analysis.

Once the mouth and the eyes are extracted, the expression analysis is done with the extracted

/segmented image. For the eye, the intraocular distance is measured and for the mouth the expanse of the lips and mid-point of the mouth are calculated. Depending upon the two values the expressions are calculated and they are listed in a table depending upon the numbering value the frame is classified whether it is a sad or normal or happy expression.

**RESULT**

The lip ratio is taken into account for finding the expression given by the user. Depending upon the value of the lip ratio the expressions are displayed.





The facial expression on a particular face image is analyzed automatically and it produces the result stating the emotion on the subjects face. The proposed system is tested against a collection of face images both containing single and multiple faces in a scene. The experimental results show better face detection rate under variable luminance levels. From this experimental result, we achieved a recognition rate of 60% when detecting in a multiple face image.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I reimplemented and trained a bunch of different networks for a project I'm working on ([in birdsong](https://github.com/timsainb/AVGN)), and decided to also put online the same notebooks for more general use trained on fashion-MNIST and NSYNTH. I made each network self-contained in a notebook and set those notebooks up so they would automatically download the required packages in colab so they would be easier to run online. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of these models I haven't tried to re-implement since tensorflow was in its early (v0.0X) days. I was really impressed with how easy and intuitive it is to implement models in 2019. I did run into [a bug](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/28444) or two with TF 2.0, and ended up opting for running the nightly version rather than 2.0alpha but for the most part tensorflow 2 seems very stable and I would recommend anyone starting a new project to use it over Tensorflow 1.X at this point.

AI and machine learning have a lot to offer in other disciplines. Therefore, I'm working on using it to improve the realiability of renewable energy sources, hoping to make some environmental progress.

I'm faced with a problem ATM, and need your advice.

I'm training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), with the purpose of deciding to what degree a data sample is 'interesting' (from 0 to 1), so it's basically regression.
From a dataset of 31 mio. observations, the AI picks one and tells me if it is interesting or not. I don't know in advance (no labels) if the sample is interesting, but have the possibility to verify this through FEM simulations, which take a long time to run. So I'd like to train the network iteratively and with as few samples as possible. Allowing it to learn from each guess, until it guesses correct the majority of times.

What type of ANN would be best suited for this purpose? Most of the applicaitons that I have come accros, train the network like you would in regression, but I don't have a full sample for the network to get started on, and would like to avoid procuring it.

Hope you can point me in the right direct.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Think of it like a decentralized Uber.

The image comes from Stanford CS321n.

[![VAE scheme][1]][1]

In many of the code implementations though, this step is not present. For example in the Keras implementation available here: https://keras.io/examples/variational_autoencoder/

In the latent space `z` they sample with the Lambda layer, but at the end of the decoder there is just a Dense layer with a sigmoid activation.

Is the sigmoid doing something I don't understand mathematically? Is the VAE math still valid without this sampling step?


It is not only in code implementations, in some other schematics and textual material it seems to be ignored (see next image).

I've been working on a project where I use StyleGAN to generate fake images of characters from Game of Thrones. I wrote an [article](https://blog.nanonets.com/stylegan-got/) that describes that algorithms and methods used, and you can try it out yourself via a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/iyaja/stylegan-encoder/blob/master/generate_GoT_characters_with_StyleGAN.ipynb#scrollTo=LKzLQp1QIkHd).

* Colab notebook: [https://colab.research.google.com/github/iyaja/stylegan-encoder/blob/master/generate\_GoT\_characters\_with\_StyleGAN.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/iyaja/stylegan-encoder/blob/master/generate_GoT_characters_with_StyleGAN.ipynb#scrollTo=LKzLQp1QIkHd)
* GitHub repo: [https://github.com/iyaja/stylegan-encoder](https://github.com/iyaja/stylegan-encoder)

&amp;#x200B;

Something interesting to note: All the results (images and animations) were generated from Nvidia's StyleGAN that was pretrained on the FFHQ dataset, with absolutely no fine-tuning.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, to make StyleGAN work for Game of Thrones characters, I used another model (credit to [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/iyaja/stylegan-encoder)) that maps images onto StyleGAN's latent space. I gave it images of Jon, Daenerys, Jaime, etc. and got latent vectors that when fed through StyleGAN, recreate the original image.

&amp;#x200B;

With the latent vectors for the images in hand, it's really to modify them in all the ways described in the StyleGAN paper (style mixing, interpolations, etc.) as well as through simple arithmetic in the latent space (such as shifting the latent vector in the ""smiling direction""). As a bonus, since there's no StyleGAN training involved, all the steps that I just mentioned can be executed extremely fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, stick around to the end of [the article](https://blog.nanonets.com/stylegan-got/) to see a result of character style mixing that might be very interesting to Game of Thrones fans.",7,11,False,self,,,,,

This treatment is not only painful and can cause further [complications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127875/), but is also [emotionally and financially draining](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2003712) process for the patient and his/her family.

&amp;#x200B;

In recent years, researchers have developed a non-invasive process, called [elastography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastography) or [elasticity imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastography), which  essentially maps the mechanical properties (like Young's modulus) of tissue from ultrasound and/or MRI data and use this map of (mechanical) properties to diagnose the tumor. Thus, circumventing the need of undergoing an invasive biopsy.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](qelczz8l0gy21 ""Typical workflow of elasticity imaging"")

While valuable and promising, elasticity imaging requires solution of an inverse elasticity problem in modulus reconstruction step. This step is complex (doesn't admit unique solution), computationally expensive, and is time consuming (this could be critical in medical diagnosis). **To circumvent these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning based workflow to non-invasively diagnose breast lesions from ultrasound data, while preserving the underlying mechanics.**

&amp;#x200B;

In the process, we also demonstrate how physics-based modeling can felicitate transfer learning/domain randomization in data-scarce applications like medical imaging. By analyzing learned filters in physical and Fourier space, we also find interesting connection between this learning-based approach to elasticity imaging and traditional strain-imaging based approaches.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](vrjc7yux4gy21 ""Connection between learning-based elastography to traditional strain-imaging based approaches"")

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from medical diagnosis, the proposed framework can also find application in many areas of science and engineering like design optimization, non-destructive testing etc. where the goal is to make decision based on quantities of interest inferred from measurements.

Based on [this blog entry](https://www.knime.com/blog/use-deep-learning-to-write-like-shakespeare) exploring how to generate Shakespearean English, I tried to do the same while surfing the current Game of Thrones hype wave.

Downloaded all of the [subtitles from seasons 1-7 on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gunnvant/game-of-thrones-srt), and got my computer to work on a very simple Tensorflow-based Keras Network identical as the one from the KNIME blog :

&gt;The input layer withnunits would accept\[m, n\]tensors, wherenis the size of the character set andmthe number of past samples (in this case characters) to use for the prediction. We arbitrarily chosem=100, estimating that 100 past characters might be sufficient for the prediction of character number 101. The character set sizen,of course, depends on the input corpus.  
&gt;  
&gt;For the hidden layer, we used 512 LSTM units. A relatively high number of LSTM units is needed to be able to process all of these (pastmcharacters - next character) associations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, the last layer includednsoftmax activated units, wherenis the character set size again. Indeed, this layer is supposed to produce the array of probabilities for each one of the characters in the dictionary. Therefore,noutput units, one for each character probability.

(GoT spoilers in the coming text, fair warning...)

**Results:**

**(In italics is what was initially given to the trained network)**

Iteration 1 (taking 100 previous characters into account):

&gt;*What if the Seven Kingdoms were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man? You're Aegon Targaryen.* I wanted to see the strengless. I wanted to see the strengless. I wanted to see the strengest that was a boy and the world was a bastard. I wanted to see the strengless. I wanted to see the strengest that was a boy and the world was a bastard. I wanted to see the strengless. I wanted to see the str

First impressions, actually not bad! It's english (except for ""strengest"") and I'm guessing GoT talks about bastards a lot for it to show up here. Still, obvious looping is going on. I figured that if the network was given more characters to decide what to write it might loop less easily, so I trained again, but this time with 200 previous characters.

Iteration 2.1 (taking 200 previous characters)

&gt;*You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off. You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that? Because I have balls, and you don't.

I was a boy and the world will be a long time. I was a boy and the world will be a long time. I was a boy and the world will be

At this point I'm a bit disappointed that it's still looping, but curious to see if it loops on the same sentence regardless of the input. What if I give it complete garbage ? I generated a 200 character long random string from the dict values in the training data

Iteration 2.3

I was a boy and the world will be a long time. I was a boy

So yay, generating text, but eh... looping the same sentence regardless of the input, not really what I was expecting.

I know this network is very rudimentary, and I'm just starting out using Deep Learning, so I'm really just throwing a bunch of data in a network and hoping for the best here.

I will graduate after six months, and I am confused about where should I going.

The most common way among AI students to make a living is IT companies. But I have lots of concerns. 

Firstly, AI is not a mature technology. Deep learning is still unproven in mathematics, and the capacity of a deep model is still limited. I am afraid that the profits made by AI are dissatisfied in industries and the investors in AI industry will calm down, and then mountains of AI workers will be dismissed in the future.

Secondly, Chinese IT companies are axing jobs in recent days to meet with the bad economic environment. And the severe working stress of IT employees, which arise discussion about ""996""(https://996.icu) widely, has not been relieved in China. The winter of IT is coming.

Finally, I am not interested in Deep Learning. The features extracted by CNN or other strange networks are so unrealistic. The AI papers don't show any mathematical proof in detail but experiments run by GPUs. It's just a tool, not science.

But where can I go? Bank? or state-owned companies? or applying phd in another subjects like economics? How many choices do AI students have after graduation except IT companies?

I'd be very interested to hear what this community thinks about the issue, in particular efforts to try to explain machine learning models rather than creating interpretable models based on underlying scientific background knowledge. From my perspective as an applied mathematician we should build mathematical models as far as we can, and use machine learning to fill in our gaps of knowledge. This allows us to follow the scientific method of hypothesis, testing, and modification, as well as giving perspective when our predictions fail.  


Soon after I posted this, the article below was published in Nature Machine Intelligence. The arguments are similar, although the examples are much closer to traditional applications of ML (e.g. image recognition).

Probably not. But I began working on this project about three years ago when no good frameworks were available and it just kept growing. So it probably doesn't hurt to have another open-source framework out there.


The goal is to try to keep up with the state of the art in terms of [models](https://pywick.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pywick.models.html) and various training enhancements so that you have something to play around with. Does SWA or Swish really guarantee you best results? Probably not... but it's there in case you want to check it out.


Lastly, I just wanted to mention that I really can't take credit for any of the cool stuff. I mostly assembled and cleaned up what other awesome people have already done. But that way you don't need to do the dirty work and can just use it.",4,38,False,self,,,,,

Hi! In this work we managed to smash previous state-of-the-art result in **3D human pose estimation** using a novel multi-view volumetric aggregation method. We hope this work will **revolutionize** the motion capture industry!

&amp;#x200B;

The main practical result of the work: if you have several cameras pointing to a human, then with the help of our method you will be able to determine his **high-quality** and **smooth in time** 3D skeleton.

&amp;#x200B;

There're many possible applications:

* **Motion capture** \- animate characters in movies/games
* **Surveillance** \- to understand what a person took from the shelf in a store without sellers (e.g. Amazon Go)
* Human-Computer interface - to play games like ""Just Dance""
* Sport tracking - to understand how players move around the field
* **Self Driving Cars** \- to understand how and where the pedestrians cross the road
*  ...

[Parameter Space Noise for Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01905)

&amp;#x200B;

While I was learning about various RL algorithms, I've successfully implemented noisy networks for my DQN project; I added another set of parameters used as the standard deviations for Gaussian noises added to the main parameters during a forward pass, and optimized through gradient descent along with the main parameters. I obtained satisfying results using my implementation and I finished the project with a decent agent.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, recently, I changed my DQN algorithm and turned it into a DDPG/D4PG algorithm. I used the same noisy network algorithm for exploration and it still gave me fine agents from time to time. However, it often did not perform significantly better than the ones that used action space noise with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, sometimes performing worse, even.

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to find what I might have mistaken or misunderstood, I searched for the original paper again to read it once more thoroughly. Then, I found an article posted by OpenAI about parameter space noise. At first glance, I thought this was the same thing as the noisy networksin fact, I still thought those were the same after reading through that article and skimming through the paper on parameter space noise.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, reading the paper on parameter space noise more carefully, I finally realized that these are two similar but different approaches to adding noise to the parameter space. I noticed how the method described in ""Parameter Space Noise"" samples random Gaussian noise values at the beginning of each episode and scales it according to the variation between the actions with and without noise; while noisy nets add additional noise parameters that are optimized through gradient descent rather than using a scalar standard deviation and a scaling factor.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have tried noisy nets so far, but I haven't used this alternative parameter space noise method.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there other differences between these two methods? Do they perform differently? Is one better than the other? What are the main applications for each approach and what would be the best option for DDPG/D4PG?",1,2,False,self,,,,,

Also, ive been thinking about using hierarchical softmax somehow to model this tree, but not sure about the possible gains.
I've tried focal loss, it just ends up not guessing any label, so I increased the reward for true positives, it helped a little bit, still only got auc of 0.8.

Rebalancing is also difficult since two labels might be very overrepresented but very rare in combination.

Also, the inputs to the model aren't very descriptive, as in, I'm not even sure this problem can converge, maybe...

Should I try XGBoost?

So I have been looking for some intuition of what embeddings actually _do_ apart from providing a vector space for one-hot encodings.  In fact, what they do allow if imposed on a discretized continuous space, is to break up the ordering relationship, allowing each new interval to be completely independent in subsequent mapping relations.  (Just as there is no ordering relation between words in a vocabulary.)  In some cases where a continuous mapping is particular non-linear and convoluted, maybe this ""breaking up"" via discretization allows a more efficient expression of the mapping -- each interval can have its own ""starting point"" in a space that better maps to the target space.

Well, thinking that maybe this is interesting, I starting wondering how a discretization + embedding layer could be inserted into a neural network, seeing as usually embedding is only the first layer because the table lookup (or one-hot encoding) is not differentiable.

I started thinking that a continuous approximation of a discretization would be to replace the embedding look-up with a logistic function that modulates the index of the embedding table.  Similarly a one-hot would be such a look-up via a softmax function.

Then suddenly I realized, that is exactly a description of attention models -- a differentiable table lookup.  Is attention just a continuous version of discrete vector space embeddings?  Is that why attention is so powerful, because it allows a *conditioned* ""remapping"" of a spatial transform?  Similar to finding an optimal point in a vector space for each word in a vocabulary, an attention model finds an optimal transform *for a given context* (ie for a given distribution over a continuous space) to ease the work of the rest of the network.

Please tell me if I am out to lunch :)  I thought I might be onto some interesting ideas but I would be delighted to know if I simply stumbled onto a better understanding of something that is already known to work well!",1,0,False,self,,,,,

**Do We Need Peer Review?**

Specifically, do we need double-blind peer review of the sort that conferences provide?

As scientists, our job is to develop and capture knowledge. Peer review ensures that the work of the least-advantaged members of our community is judged by the same standards as the most-advantaged members. By advantage, I mean any number of intangible qualities that might cause you to trust a researcher, including:

- Being a well-known senior name in the field

- Coming from a respected institution or group

- Having significant funding for PR

- Being a member of a privileged racial group

- Charisma

Peer review is an invaluable resource for *disadvantaged* researchers, who lack the above qualities. In reality, of course, being advantaged or disadvantaged is not a boolean, or even a scalar, but hopefully its a coherent enough concept to get the point across. I think its fair to say that in general, the more disadvantaged a researcher is, the more they are forced to rely on the peer review process to build their resume and share their work with the community.

So I'm running a parameter search on a binary classification problem I'm working on using the Talos library under Keras/tensorflow. (Really useful library by the way, though there are a few bugs and the documentation is not as through as I'd like).

The training set is about 55k examples with around 600 features each.  The pc I'm running it on is an i9 9900k 5Ghz, 32gb ram, M2 drive and a 8GB RTX2080.

Running nvidia-smi (or any other monitoring tool) shows that I am using the GPU for the processing, but utilisation floats between 5-20%.

Clearly I have a bottle neck.

My CPU is showing 10-12% usage on the python process, which I initially thought would equal 100% usage on 1 of the 8 cores, however CPUID/hwInfo show that all the cores are being utilised, and none over ~50%.  All temperatures are in the 40s C thanks to water cooling.

The M2 hard drive is showing essentially zero usage, and the python process is only using 2gb of ram, with the system having 13gb remaining unused.  The GPU ram usage is ~7.3gb out of 8gb, but I've read that tensorflow just eats it up ""in case"" - so I'm suspecting that the training process is not actually using all of the available GPU ram (however, I'm not sure how to double check this).

If the bottleneck is not on the GPU (cores or ram), CPU, RAM, or Disc, where is it? Any help would be appreciated!",6,1,False,self,,,,,

I am playing around with image generating GANs (image as input + output for the generator, so my ""noise"" is in fact a bunch of images) with Keras+Tensorflow in the last few weeks. My problem: I get horrible results!

Vocab for clarification:
generator = generator only
discriminator = discriminator only (binary crossentropy as loss)
gan = generator + discriminator with discriminator output (binary crossentropy as loss)

So what is happening?

After a couple of epochs my discriminator prediction accuracy for generated (label 0), real (1) and (added for better quality) some distorted (0) images is converging towards 100%.

After the discriminator training (per batch) I begin training my gan with real image inputs (labeled as truth, 1), the trainability of the discriminator (generator) is locked (unlocked) for this process. The gan gives me another 100% accuracy after dozens of epochs!

But: The resulting generator is giving me very bad results! Even when I try to pretrain the generator in a way that gives me relatively good results *before* I go through the first GAN epoch (= discriminator training + gan training with locked discriminator), the outputs become worse even directly after the first GAN epoch.

What I don't understand is: When the discriminator is able to understand the difference between generated and real images with 100% accuracy in nearly every case and when the gan shows 100% accuracy at the same time how is the generator able to perform that bad? I am aware of problems like mode collapse but I don't understand how the generator can fool the discriminator within the gan training process but at the same time this discriminator seems to be perfectly able to classify (generated+distorted) = fake and real images.

So I'm working on this virtual sensing DL project (basically, I try to estimate (regression) the outcome of an expensive sensor from other cheaper sensors), and I have a limited amount of real-life labelled time series data (Acquiring the labelled data is expensive because of the sensor in itself).

The physics behind what I'm trying to estimate can be pretty accurately modeled with complex equations that doesn't have any close form solutions. Those physical models also require me to feed as input some parameters that I wish it didn't need because I would ultimately want something that is able to generalized in all type of situations.

So far, I have some results using DL (MLP and RNN variants), but nothing crazy. I think I am limited by the fact that the data I'm provided is extremely small.

Now come into play a simulation some of my colleagues have been working on. According to them, the simulation can reproduce with a high degree of accuracy the behavior of the physical model. The simulation take into account some of the parameters I mentioned above, which is a good news since it can generates diverse data with respect to those parameters and maybe help the NN to better generalize.

Unfortunately so far, I have extremely poor results when training on the generated data and testing on real life data. I believe the simulated data is too ""perfect"" to the point where the network can easily fit the smooth training data, but this does not help the noisy real life data. I don't know if this would be consider over-fitting (My validation loss on real life data, does decrease first before it goes up, which makes me believed the network is learning some stuff), but even so, I tried regularization, up to simplifying the network to one hidden layer and a dozens of neurons, and some dropout; it didn't improve anything.

Now appart from adding noise to the simulated data (which I will try next), do any of you guys know how I can better exploit the simulated data ? I still have some labelled data from real life and and also a ton of unlabeled data (data from the cheap sensors). I'm wondering if there is an equivalent of GAN for non images data (time series of physical quantities for instance). From what I understand, they can ""turn"" simulated data into something closer to reality, but doesn't seem to apply outside of image data.

Any ideas ? I'm even open to the semi supervised side, since I have a lot of unlabeled data.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

I just realized after a few weeks of sitting on this that I didn't tell you guys about something really cool I've been working on! Maybe I should do that. 

A few months ago I posted about [DeOldify-](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify) my pet project for colorizing and restoring old photos. Well now that includes videos as well! Here's a demo I showed at Facebook's F8 conference:

&amp;#x200B;

![video](9tu80qji41z21)

And here's the talk at F8: [https://www.facebook.com/FacebookforDevelopers/videos/340167420019712/](https://www.facebook.com/FacebookforDevelopers/videos/340167420019712/) 

And here's the article I wrote with Jeremy Howard of FastAI and Uri Manor of Salk Institute: [https://www.fast.ai/2019/05/03/decrappify/](https://www.fast.ai/2019/05/03/decrappify/) 

Anyway, the gist is that we (FastAI and I) developed this one weird trick called NoGAN to achieve this. That basically consists of this (slide from F8): 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](midd5z9v41z21)

 

The pretraining is using basic perceptual loss (or ""feature loss"") for the generator.  This gets you the benefits of GANs, without the problems, basically. Hence, smooth video!

The progression of training looks like this (sweet spot is at 1.4%, then it goes too far from there and gets weird with the orange skin):

&amp;#x200B;

![video](34o1egby41z21)

Anyway, that's the gist. You can read more in the links above (readme for github project also has good details on NoGAN). Oh by the way, NoGAN also works on super resolution, and I suspect for most image to image tasks as well as perhaps even non-image tasks.

I've seen a few instances of GPT-2 deployed with UI allowing users to generate text on their own, but the performance has been much shoddier and more erratic than what I'm capable of producing on my own system (sampling is either straight up bugged, or spits out fairly repetitive mush).

I'm in the later stages of building a platform that presents educational materials relating to language models, and some of machine learning's role in NLP tasks, from understanding to generation, hitting upon super entry-level concepts, recent architectural innovation, and some social/societal ramifications of the state of the art, etc. All in all, it's aimed at relative beginners and curious enthusiasts, but also includes plenty of resources for more intermediate and advanced users.

Very aware that any of my assumptions/conclusions may be totally flawed or just too vague to mean anything, so please let me know if they are! And maybe what I'm writing out is already known via neuroscience to be nonsense.


So I think researchers don't believe our brains do backprop, but don't know what mechanism they do use.


I was thinking about this with regards to learning how to position and manipulate an arm in order to catch a baseball.


The idea was that certain actions are already hard-coded as neural networks, and the weights within each of those networks don't change. These are discrete actions like moving the arm up/down/left/right/forward/back .


These actions, along with coefficients for duration and intensity for each action, are strung together into a task, with multiple actions being possible at the same time, but also there is an order given to show which actions (or group of actions) should follow other actions (or group of actions).


So the actions are assembled into a task, the task is performed, and once the task is performed, a learning pathway is invoked to assess the level of success, based on the sensory data received during the task being performed.


The coefficients of intensity/duration for each action are modified based on sensory input. And modified by a little, a medium amount, or a lot. So instead of all of the weights being available for modification, just a few parameters are able to be modified, with most of the connections between neurons (the ones within each action) having already been hard-coded. It's also not modification by an exact amount, but more a minor, a medium, or a major adjustment.


The task is then run again, and the level of success is assessed again, resulting in further modification of the action coefficients.


I was also thinking about how when you first learn a task, you generally are moving between actions in a very shaky, haphazard manner. Think about when someone first learns to walk. So possibly at first the series of actions in each task are being executed separately, but once the task has been completed successfully a number of times, each action in the task then activates the next action in the task in a cascade, without outside activation being required (fire together, wire together).


This could correspond to the neocortex having access to the initiation of each action, and sending the signal to initiate each action in the sequence required. Eventually each action grows direct connections from one action initiation to the next, so that the actions happen smoothly, right after one another. I was wondering if this could be the kind of learning that happens while we sleep.


I also had more thoughts on the brain building models of the world -  is there a model-building task that piggybacks on all other tasks? And those models are used to estimate which actions to use and initial duration/intensity coefficients? How does the brain know what models to invoke for what tasks? How does the brain know what a minor, medium, or major adjustment is?


Also, how do the neural networks of those discrete actions get created without using backprop? Are the neural networks built in from birth? Are they created within the brain from one neuron up? Then how would that work, if those networks aren't using backprop?


Anyway, this feels a little like ""On Intelligence"" but possibly less thought out, but like I said, wanted to share, if only to be told it is nonsense. Thanks for any responses.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I need to choose between a Threadripper WX2990 or WX2970 CPU and an Intel i9 9960 or less CPU. I don't know which should be best, I can see the following advantages to each platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Threadripper:

\- 64 PCI Express lanes

\- 24 or 32 cores for the models I'd buy, so at least 6 cores / GPU

\- Cheaper for more cores

&amp;#x200B;

Intel:

\- AVX512 support

\- Higher per-core performance

\- Faster memory controller, which gives better performance in memory-intensive applications

\- Good synergy with the MKL

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the config will be: 64Gb of 3000MHz DDR4 RAM (system builder doesn't offer 128Gb at 3000MHz), 1Tb NVMe SSD, 2x4Tb 7200RPM hard drives in RAID 1.

&amp;#x200B;

I know GPUs are the most important etc. I want to know specifically if the better vector instructions and memory controller on the Intel CPUs outweight the higher number of PCI-E lanes and higher core count on the Threadrippers.

Hey guys! I am currently an iOS developer by trade with my undergrad in Computer Science. I am wanting to spend my free time getting started on my journey to gaining experience in Machine Learning ( specifically deep learning ). I am fascinated by so many things and I think the main project I would like to focus on is creating a chat bot using a neural network. ( I hear it is good to have something you want to work on to help you learn. Especially in a field this difficult and ever changing ).

My question is. With so many different suggestions on take this course, take that course, spend x amount of weeks refreshing calculus or stats, I was wondering what a simplified approach would be for someone who just wants to get their hands dirty from the beginning.

I don't learn well in a classroom environment and have taught myself everything I know by trial and error and just brute forcing a problem until I arrive at a solution. With all of this said, does anyone have any recommendations on how I should go about my learning path? Are there any books that are good to read and then maybe just dive in to a specific topic?

TL;DR I learn by brute forcing a problem until I find a solution, not in a classroom environment like the many classes that are recommended. What is your suggestion on how I get started. Assume I have no knowledge of machine learning, much less deep learning.

Thanks! I hope to hear from experienced data scientists!",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Not only did I not get any feedback, but I received no communication at all. I've been worried about about possible mail glitches (checked my spam folder repeatedly) and tried contacting workshop organisers both via Microsoft CMT and directly via e-mail.

I have understood some of it and some I am still figuring out. However, I am not able to think how would one use these all for real time applications. Like I understood how EM or GMMs and HMMs work, but is there any place where I could learn about some practical applications of these models.

 Googles AutoML efforts aim to make ML more scalable and accelerate both research and industry applications. Our initial efforts of [neural architecture search](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/05/using-machine-learning-to-explore.html) have enabled breakthroughs in computer vision with [NasNet](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/11/automl-for-large-scale-image.html), and evolutionary methods such as [AmoebaNet](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/03/using-evolutionary-automl-to-discover.html) and hardware-aware mobile vision architecture [MNasNet](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/08/mnasnet-towards-automating-design-of.html) further show the benefit of these learning-to-learn methods. Recently, we applied a learning-based approach to tabular data, creating a scalable end-to-end AutoML solution that meets three key criteria:  


* **Full automation**: Data and computation resources are the only inputs, while a servable TensorFlow model is the output. The whole process requires no human intervention.  

* **Extensive coverage**: The solution is applicable to the majority of arbitrary tasks in the tabular data domain.  

* **High quality:** Models generated by AutoML has comparable quality to models manually crafted by top ML experts.",17,71,False,self,,,,,

I am writing my thesis on anomalies (errors) in data and how it effects neural networks. The main goal is to detect them with no extra information such as response time. The anomalies can occur in both the x and y variables so some data is mislabelled. Since there is not a lot of literature on this topic I have a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1) What techniques could I use. For mislabeled data I could simply select the observations which have the worst prediction results (not using these to train the data if the number of observations is small). For anomalies in the x variables I am considering creating a neural network to detect them. This network would include random x data as observations with a separate label (so for example 3 classes, A B en C (anomalie)). Again with a low number of observations if I use data with errors to train the network would recognise such data as true so I would have to exclude all data I am checking to be an outlier from training. But that would cost a lot of training time. Maybe such a procedure would only be worthwhile if I suspect data to be an outlier (poor prediction performance, x far away for other x's). Other methods I am considering are the KNN and the isolation tree/forrest method.

&amp;#x200B;

After having a list of presumed anomalies I could train the model without them and see if performance increases. The number of outlier excluded from training can be chosen with a test set. For what number of outliers excluded is the performance best on a separate set without anomalies? or with bayesian techniques. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) What papers to use? There is not a lot of good papers on this topic so I have problems finding good papers to cite. If anybody would have some ideas it would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

3) What data to use? right now I am considering a classification numerical dataset (so no images or audio) which can be modelled with a neural network. But not sure where to find good data. After that I can add some noise to the data.

I'd like to tell you about our recent paper. We've tackled the problem of a *few-shot* generation of *talking heads:* given a few (or even a single) image, train a model that is able to synthesize new images of that particular person with a new pose (viewpoint and expression).  


Our model was trained on a publicly available dataset of YouTube videos ([VoxCeleb2](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html), 224p) and avoided mode collapse, even though the quality of images here is quite diverse. Hense, we're able to generalize well for new images with identities unseen during training (we can even run it for paintings and get reasonable results).  


The key ingredients are adversarial meta-learning, adversarial fine-tuning and adaptive instance normalization, for more details please refer to the paper, short description of our method as well as the results are in the video below.

For my master thesis, my goal is to perform a speech emotion recognition task in a continuous space where I try to predict the dimensional values(valence, arousal, dominance) of emotion classes. I extract the features for each frame of the wav files in order to avoid non-stationary nature of the speech signals. Since the feature vector for each example needs to have the same shape as the input of the model, I investigate the number of frames for each audio file and found that the number of frames range between 32 and 1364. I know one solution for having equal sized feature vectors is to pad zero values until every vector have the maximum length which is 1364. So I have two questions regarding the construction of the feature vectors;

1. Does adding too many zeros(increasing the sparsity of the vector) have a negative effect on the performance of the features? If yes, can I tackle this by calculating the statistical functions(min, max, std, mean etc.) of the each feature vector? Or is there any other solution rather than padding zeros?
2. Some of the features in my case are extracted not from a frame but from the whole utterance like the duration of the utterance or the emotion class of the instance. What should be my approach for these features? Are there any downsides of considering them just like the other features with only 1 frame and to pad 1364-1 zero values to those vectors?

&amp;#x200B;

As part of my recent side project to learn about reinforcement learning I've created a clone of the classic Snake game as a reinforcement learning environment and solved it with advantage actor-critic. This is one of the warm-ups from OpenAI's requests for research 2 ([https://openai.com/blog/requests-for-research-2/](https://openai.com/blog/requests-for-research-2/)).

&amp;#x200B;

You might be thinking this sounds like a very run of the mill introductory RL project. Well here are a few things that I think make it more interesting than just that.

1. I went completely overboard on the environment. Its implemented in pure PyTorch in a vectorized fashion such that I can run 1000s of environment in parallel on a single machine.
2. I compare performance of a few architectures, including a model copied from Deepmind's recent Relational RL paper (spoilers, it doesn't outcompete the other agents on this very simple task).
3. I evaluate the performance of an agent trained on a small environment in a larger environment - a limited form of RL transfer learning.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for some guidance with respect to CT scan analysis. There is currently a similar software called ""Dragonfly"" (if you search Dragonfly CT it would come up on google) with an integrated deep learning mechanism. For my purposes, I feel like this is overkill. I simply need to define the line between bone and tissue for each individual slice (can be done through mouse directed spline creation or XY coordinates per slice -- would probably be harder to code for). My thoughts were to use TensorFlow and integrate that into the current software I use, but I was wondering if anybody here had some better ideas. All scans are presented on an 8bit gray-scale with individual values pre-determined by the software (could be useful to differentiate between tissue and bone).

I'm currently enrolled under scholarship, the Stanford Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng. I was planning to take the deep learning specialization by [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) right afterwards. This plan was because I assumed the stanford content was beneficial theory, and/or prerequisite knowledge. Though it seems to be that some concepts in the Stanford course are in the [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) course.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I am currently finishing up a PhD in physics and got into ML two years ago. I have been lucky enough to collaborate with some ML researchers at my institution and have published a few (\~4) papers at top conferences. Two of them are first author papers, but none have really gotten that much attention (I do have several hundred citations but mostly for my physics publications).

&amp;#x200B;

I have spent the last few months looking for research scientist positions at industry labs. Unfortunately I was unable to secure a research scientist position, but was recently offered a ""postdoc"" position at a well-known lab. Basically they said that that they want to hire me in this position for a year and then potentially promote me to a ""research scientist"" position depending on my performance.

&amp;#x200B;

I was surprised since I didn't know postdoc positions even existed in industry (but they told me that this type of position is typically offered to students who are taking a year off before becoming faculty). While the salary is not too bad (\~130K), they are giving me no stock. My ML PhD friends have told me that you can typically expect 100K+ in stock that vests over a few years when you join as a reserach scientist with a industy research lab.  So I am not too happy in terms of total compensation.

&amp;#x200B;

I do have another job lined up (quant finance) that pays substantially more (300K+), but it is not a research position. Any advice on what to do? Is there a chance that the industry lab would consider giving stock to a ""postdoc""? Anyone else have taken such a postdoc position?",8,8,False,self,,,,,

Recently, I've come to the conclusion that AutoML is broken. AutoML should make deploying ML easier and faster, I think it is the opposite. What is more, I think it can do more harm than good.

The benefits of AutoML:

1. AutoML can train (some) model for provided input data. Nice!
2. AutoML can be used for computing batch predictions for provided test data.
3. AutoML can be used for deploying the model behind REST API. User can access model with REST requests. Nice :)

The boring code - hidden part needed to make AutoML work:

1. In real-life someone needs to create the input dataset. There is a need to write some code which will fetch data from multiple sources, merge and create a data frame. This code needs to be well written, so all software engineering good practices should be applied.
2. If the final ML model will be used in production, then more code needs to be created, for preparing data for predictions. Whether you are going to use batch predictions or use REST API,  you need to add more code.
3. Most of the AutoML solutions I know, do not provide detailed model maintenance mode. There should be monitoring of model and monitoring for input data quality. Based on this monitoring, there should be an automated decision when to update/retrain the model. The feedback of model decisions should be stored somewhere. If you go to production with AutoML, probably there will be a need to write additional code for maintenance and monitoring.

I think there is a lot of boring-code needed to use AutoML in real-life in the production.

The last thing I don't like in AutoML is complexity. When you apply ML to the problem even a simple model should bring you huge improvement (ROI). I like simple models because they are easy to understand. Applying a complex model as a first iteration for solving a business case with ML is unnecessary over-complication. 

If you want to read more, I wrote a post about my thoughts about broken AutoML:

**Slightly Longer Story:** All are invited to participate in a computer science competition that will be part of the 2019 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS, [https://nips.cc/](https://nips.cc/)), Reconnaissance Blind Chess.

&amp;#x200B;

Many of the favorite studied games in artificial intelligence (AI) such as checkers, chess, and Go lack something that is common and critical in real-life decision making, uncertainty.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a competition with a simple but powerful twist on what may be considered the most classic game in AI history, chess. Reconnaissance Blind Chess (RBC) is like chess except a player cannot see where her opponent's pieces are a priori. Rather, she learns partial information about them with the ability to sense a 3x3 square of the board each turn and from the results of moves.

&amp;#x200B;

In comparison to poker, which seems to be the most popularly studied game of imperfect information, RBC includes a critical component of long-term planning. Compared to phantom games like Kriegspiel, in RBC players have much more ability to manage their uncertainty, which we believe makes the game more interesting from an AI perspective and more realistic for most scenarios; players are not completely blind, but rather, metaphorically, they simply cannot look everywhere at once.

&amp;#x200B;

For more information on the NeurIPS competition, the game itself, or the API, or to play the game to get a feel for it, visit our website below.

&amp;#x200B;

All are welcome to create the best RBC bot they can, and see how well it can play against other bots in the tournament starting on October 21, 2019!

Abstract:

In this paper, we present GraRep, a novel model for learning vertex  representations of weighted graphs. This model learns low dimensional  vectors to represent vertices appearing in a graph and, unlike existing  work, integrates global structural information of the graph into the  learning process. We also formally analyze the connections between our  work and several previous research efforts, including the DeepWalk model  of Perozzi et al. as well as the skip-gram model with negative sampling  of Mikolov et al. We conduct experiments on a language network, a  social network as well as a citation network and show that our learned  global representations can be effectively used as features in tasks such  as clustering, classification and visualization. Empirical results  demonstrate that our representation significantly outperforms other  state-of-the-art methods in such tasks.",0,1,False,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/AJ7Wnlhub1PGo8uHy39QksVLwhibgHPN3KCG3oauldw.jpg,,,,,

After all, unless you are part of the PyTorch or TensorFlow dev teams, you really don't need to know how SGD or ADAM works. 

Similarly, you just need to know that your model uses MCMC, but do you really need to know the details of Metropolis-Hastings and or how the cooling schedule works in Simulating Annealing? You would just really on whatever framework you were using (TFP, PyStan, etc...) to do all that for you, and worry about the high level functional aspects of your model.

We have been making advancements toward better *multi-purpose* network architectures (networks which can work in a wide range of task types, not networks which can work *between* them), but we still have not made much progress toward the kind of AI that might begin to resemble the sentient minds that biological brains produce, not have we replicated their abstract thinking skills.

Given most of our previous advancements have been biology inspired, why stop now?

Biological brains are vastly more complex than their machine counterparts, but this complexity does not exist solely at the basic level of *number of neural connections*. Brains are more like *groups of neural networks* which exist within vertical and horizontal hierarchies of partially discrete networks. At the bottom level of this hierarchy we can only assume that *specific skills,* which are organically learned, must physically exist within a local or discrete network in the same way that an individual trained *perceptron* identifies and encodes relevant relationships from input data + feedback. We might think of a perceptron as the most fundamentally basic version of intelligence (and a necessary component in more complex intelligent structures).

One or more levels up from this array of *learned specific skills*, there must be another network which actually operates them or identifies the *skill* or *combination of skills* required to perform an incoming task so that it can activate the correct grouping of sub-skills. Whether by some horizontal connectivity between specific skilled networks at the bottom level (established, somehow, in organic training), or by a higher level network which can learn which combination of sub-skills are required to complete a given task, this seems like a plausible means of achieving the ability to combine specific skills in creative or abstract ways.

Biological brains have a superstructure that goes beyond individual neural connections (there are coherent parts of the brain, which themselves are composed of sub-networks, and which as a whole connect to other parts of the brain in peculiar (evolutionarily designed) ways. One thing about neurons in the brain is that they have a varying numbers of relatively short and long range connections. Neurons that are physically closer together are more likely to form a random connection with each-other, and are less likely to form distant connections with more distant neurons. If we visualize this, we might come out with the idea that any **given local group of neurons may constitute a somewhat separated network from more distantly separated regions simply because there are more local interconnections.** I believe that this aspect of neural topology is a necessary component of capacity of the human brain to produce an exotic *general* intelligence, specifically, our ability to solve *abstract* problems.

Some studies examining the neural topology (and associated cognitive profiles) of Autism Spectrum (Disorder) have found that individuals who are on the Autism spectrum tend to have a greater ratio of shorter range neural connections to longer range connections than the average population (they have more shorter range connections, or fewer longer range connections), and many studies have also found that Autism is associated often with an increase in cognitive/learning capacity in specific task types (such as spatial reasoning), but it is also associated with decreased learning capacity in areas such as language. In other words, the average population performs averagely across the main fields of human cognitive ability, but individuals with Autism often have an increased capacity in specific areas of learning, and reduced capacity in others (typically language, communication and social skills).

I'm definitely not making the statement that anyone who is on the Autism spectrum is less intelligent than anyone else. In fact, it seems to me that having an intelligence geared toward a very specific field of study is now in high demand, and anecdotally I can say with certainty that individuals with Autism have been making endless contributions to the advancement of science and human knowledge. In the primitive setting, human beings have always needed to perform a very general set of tasks that often changed with the seasons and the weather (we needed to be generally intelligent to adapt and survive), but once civilization started to take off we essentially began to require specific-field-experts in addition to general laymen, and this might actually be one of the strongest selective forces that might help us explain the rise of Autism in contemporary society. Nobody knows for sure why Autism has been on the rise beyond an increase in diagnosis opportunity, but the insights we get from network topology and my assumptions about general and specific intelligence actually gives us an explanatory model *and* the selective mechanism which can help explain the rise of autism.

Autism is a very interesting case study because it seems to actually relate to abstract thinking in humans. Schizophrenia, which is sometimes described as the symptom of *too much abstract thinking* does correlate with having a greater number of long range connections than the average person (there's evidence they are diametric conditions). If we can export any of these insights into the quest for G.A.I, that would be amazing. I'm only an initiate into machine learning (but have long explored subjects like complexity science, biology, evolution, philosophy, and more, which has I think given me these rather unique insights). I know this is a very messy post, but as a recovering perfectionist who never finishes anything, and as someone not wishing to write the 9000 minimum required words to explore the theses, I just had to get the gist of it out.

I would much rather do researchy engineering than data science or generic software engineering but I dont think I have a good shot at one of the research labs-best case is that I graduate in 6 years and then likely end up in one of these research engineer roles that only require an MS.

for those of you who are interested in RL, 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently implemented basic RL algorithms such as 

REINFORCE, vanilla actor-critic, DDPG, A3C, DQN and PPO with PyTorch.

&amp;#x200B;

Characteristics are as follows :

* Each algorithm is complete within a single file.
* Length of each algorithm is up to 100\~150 lines of codes.
* Every algorithm can be trained within 30 seconds, even without GPU.
* Envs are fixed to ""CartPole-v1"". You can just focus on the implementations.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see in the name of the repository, 

I tried to make the code as  brief and intuitive as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you enjoy :)

Thank you.

I want to detect if a manuscrite word is good or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I have some characters (get with OCR no problem with that), with accuracy by char.

For exemple : \[\['A', 0.81\], \['8', 0.3\], \['C', 0.83\], \['D', 0.98\]\]

&amp;#x200B;

And I have the good word to detect, for exemple : ""ABCD"". (the size is always the same)

&amp;#x200B;

I build a data like that : All good word chars, all OCR chars, all accuracy OCR chars, then if is good  or not (boolean).

For exemple : \[\['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', '8', 'C', 'D', 0.81, 0.3, 0.83, 0.98, 1\], ...\]

(I use LabelEncoder for the 8 firsts fields)

&amp;#x200B;

My answer is : what is the best machine learning algorithm for my predict ?

1. No external library used - sklearn, tensorflow, pytorch etc...
2. Uses a fit() and predict() function approach - just like sklearn. This makes any model very easy to plug and use.
3. I have utilised these implementations in my own pet projects on real datasets and they work without any errors. Obviously, not optimised for speed but they are more for learning the concept and math.

Just wonder if there is any other method to reconstruct the input but without using auto-regressive.

I have thought about 
1. Negative sampling, like what word2vec does, then we dont need to normalize on the whole vocabulary 
2. Bag of words, just simply averaging the word vectors and then use it as sentence vector, then reconstruct this sentence vector by minimizing MSE. Since this method reconstruct only one vector for one sentence instead every words, this will be fast and memory friendly. But I am not sure if this can work, or if the neural network will learn some trivial representation instead, e.g. all zeros

**Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09791](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09791)

**PyTorch Code:** [https://github.com/ibalazevic/multirelational-poincare](https://github.com/ibalazevic/multirelational-poincare)

&amp;#x200B;

**Key contributions:**

* proposing MuRP, a theoretically inspired method to embed **hierarchical multi-relational data** in the **Poincar ball** model of hyperbolic space which achieves **state-of-the-art** results on the hierarchical WN18RR knowledge graph dataset;
* showing that our Poincar embeddings require far **fewer dimensions** than Euclidean embeddings to achieve comparable performance; and
* visualizing the learned embeddings and analyzing the properties of the Poincar model compared to its Euclidean analogue.

**Abstract:**

Hyperbolic embeddings have recently gained attention in machine learning due to their ability to represent hierarchical data more accurately and succinctly than their Euclidean analogues. However, multi-relational knowledge graphs often exhibit multiple simultaneous hierarchies, which current hyperbolic models do not capture. To address this, we propose a model that embeds multi-relational graph data in the Poincar ball model of hyperbolic space. Our Multi-Relational Poincar model (MuRP) learns relation-specific parameters to transform entity embeddings by Mbius matrix-vector multiplication and Mbius addition. Experiments on the hierarchical WN18RR knowledge graph show that our multi-relational Poincar embeddings outperform their Euclidean counterpart and existing embedding methods on the link prediction task, particularly at lower dimensionality.",0,24,False,https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jDVU7owiZZZmeRGpJJ_wvAy1DnoZ-lgn_trSwPNhd58.jpg,,,,,

**TLDR:** Our task is to compress a large neural network (teacher) into a smaller one (student), but we assume that the data used to train the teacher is not available anymore. Our solution is to generate pseudo points adversarially (yellow markers above) and use those to match the student (right) to the teacher (left).

First, we collect data from an existing Kafka stream into an Iguazio time series table. Next, we visualize the stream with a Grafana dashboard; and finally, we access the data in a Jupyter notebook using Python code.

We use a [Nuclio serverless function](https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio) to listen to a Kafka stream and then ingest its events into our time series table. Iguazio gets you started with a template for Kafka to time series.

We visualize the data with Grafana and work with time series data using Python code in Jupyter. Data scientist easily access both historical and real-time data in a full Python environment for exploration and training with Iguazio.

I just wanted to present my latest work to you. We, humans, have the ability to not only learn quickly from a few labelled examples, but we can also adjust our notions in light of new unlabelled data. I found this fascinating and wondered whether meta-learning an intrinsic loss function to do the same in the few-shot learning would, in fact, improve generalization performance. Turns out, it does. Any and all feedback is welcomed. You can be as harsh as you want. You can't top reviewer #2 anyway.

The event was certainly bigger and more colorful than the previous ones. Aside from the usual vendors, I came across many new names offering various products, services, and tools covering the gamut in the field of computer vision. Clearly AI-based vision processing and automotive overshadowed the traditional computer vision technologies and use cases. As expected, there were number of new companies announcing their new vision-optimized AI accelerator chips and Intellectual properties. (I must say that it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of all the players in this domain and I might be forced to add a new tab to my excel sheet. Reducing the font size does not cut it anymore).

I was struck by one notable trend and that is vertical integration. There were several vendors that had offerings covering the entire spectrum for the automotive application. They offered autonomous driving software stack, ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) hardware, AI accelerator ASICs, and in some cases even their IP.

While there were many promising companies with breakthrough technologies, I was particularly impressed by the technology and achievements of a few that are most relevant to this forum. Below is a brief summary:

&amp;#x200B;

Mythic

Mythic ([www.mythic-ai.com](https://www.mythic-ai.com)) is a fabless semiconductor company based in Austin and Redwood City building AI edge accelerator chips. Their initial target applications are smart speakers, drones, battery-powered video monitors specialized smartphones for certain vertical markets. Their implementation of deep neural networks is based on flash-based analog technology. This approach reduces the need to retrieve network weights from memory leading to a significant power savings (10x). 

I felt they have a very clear and focused mission and were able to effectively convey their differentiation (10x power savings). They showed various reference boards with different form factors. One in particular caught my eye and that was a PCIe card hosting eight of their chips. I am guessing they are targeting power-restricted edge servers. Keep in mind all server companies are building edge servers that are only slightly bigger and thicker than an iPad, with hardened enclosure and having a fan is not an option.

While the power advantage of their analog approach is undisputable, this advantage becomes less pronounced when the competitors opt to use finer process nodes. Despite such a competitive threat, I have never come across a startup with innovative technology that has been able to maintain their lead without reinvention. My guess is that Mythic will continue to innovate.

&amp;#x200B;

[Xnor.ai](https://Xnor.ai)

[Xnor.ai](https://Xnor.ai) ([www.xnor.ai](https://www.xnor.ai)) is a company based in Seattle that has developed very low footprint and optimized Deep Learning CNN models for computer vision tasks. These models can run on low-power SoCs with embedded Arm CPUs or dedicated computer vision hardware. Their initial target markets are Home Security, Home Automation, and Smart Appliances. They seem to have a close partnership with Ambarella. The beauty of their story is that they can enable legacy hardware to tackle complex vision processing tasks such as object, or face identification as well as more complex tasks dealing with live video feeds. As an example, large video surveillance camera companies can add AI-based vision processing features without major hardware rework.

I would guess their technology is a godsent for traditional MCU companies (the likes of Microchip, On Semi., Silicon Labs, and ST) that are yet to have MCUs with dedicated AI acceleration hardware.

Like any other upstart, they also have their challenges. Computer vision models are getting bigger and more complex and there are limits on what optimization and compression can achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hailo

Hailo ([www.hailo.ai](https://www.hailo.ai)) is an Israeli company that has been able to accomplish a tremendous amount with relatively limited funding (\~$25M I think?). I saw live demos of their Hailo-8 chip and was impressed by its performance metrics. Tiny chip with no heat sink. Impressive peak performance of 26 TOPs and 2.8 TOPs/W (for an AI edge inference accelerator).

Although they are targeting most edge applications (autonomous vehicles, smart cameras, smartphones, drones, AR/VR), I got the sense that they have a special affinity toward the automotive segment. This makes sense since their performance is among the highest that I have seen (among edge inference chips) and no other edge application values performance more than the automotive segment. Alternatively, they may have been inspired by Intels acquisition of Mobileye for $15B. These are merely my guesses and both reasons are perfectly valid in my book.

Aside from the technical mumbo jumbo, their unwavering focus, infectious optimism, and determination impressed me the most.

Existing techniques for comparing generative models focus on global data properties such as mean and covariance; in that sense, they are extrinsic and uni-scale. We develop the first, to our knowledge, intrinsic and multi-scale method for characterizing and comparing underlying data manifolds, based on comparing all data moments by lower-bounding the spectral notion of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between manifolds. In a thorough experimental study, we demonstrate that our method effectively evaluates the quality of generative models; further, we showcase its efficacy in  discerning the disentanglement process in neural networks.

TL;DR: We introduce a metric based on heat kernels that is able to compare data manifolds in unaligned spaces. We test it on GAN evaluation (it works), and on tracking the disentanglement and training progress of NNs (also works!).

&amp;#x200B;

**Abstract:**

Word2Vec (W2V) and Glove are popular word embedding algorithms that perform well on a variety of natural language processing tasks. The algorithms are fast, efficient and their embeddings widely used. Moreover, the W2V algorithm has recently been adopted in the field of graph embedding, where it underpins several leading algorithms. However, despite their ubiquity and the relative simplicity of their common architecture, *what* the embedding parameters of W2V and Glove learn and *why* that it useful in downstream tasks largely remains a mystery. We show that different interactions of *PMI vectors* encode semantic properties that can be captured in low dimensional word embeddings by suitable projection, theoretically explaining why the embeddings of W2V and Glove work, and, in turn, revealing an interesting mathematical interconnection between the semantic relationships of relatedness, similarity, paraphrase and analogy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Key contributions:**

* to show that semantic similarity is captured by high dimensional PMI vectors and, by considering geometric and probabilistic aspects of such vectors and their domain, to establish a hierarchical mathematical interrelationship between relatedness, similarity, paraphrases and analogies;
* to show that these semantic properties arise through additive interactions and so are best captured in low dimensional word embeddings by linear projection, thus explaining, by comparison of their loss functions, the presence of semantic properties in the embeddings of W2V and Glove;
* to derive a relationship between learned embedding matrices, proving that they necessarily differ (in the real domain), justifying the heuristic use of their mean, showing that different interactions are required to extract different semantic information, and enabling popular embedding comparisons, such as cosine similarity, to be semantically interpreted.",9,41,False,self,,,,,

Abstract:  Recently, autonomous driving development ignited competition among car makers and technical corporations. Low-level automation cars are already commercially available. But high automated vehicles where the vehicle drives by itself without human monitoring is still at infancy. Such autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on the computing system in the car to interpret the environment and make driving decisions. Therefore, computing system design is essential particularly in enhancing the attainment of driving safety. However, to our knowledge, no clear guideline exists so far regarding safety-aware AV computing system and architecture design. To understand the safety requirement of AV computing system, we performed a field study by running industrial Level-4 autonomous driving fleets in various locations, road conditions, and traffic patterns. The field study indicates that traditional computing system performance metrics, such as tail latency, average latency, maximum latency, and timeout, cannot fully satisfy the safety requirement for AV computing system design. To address this issue, we propose a safety score as a primary metric for measuring the level of safety in AV computing system design. Furthermore, we propose a perception latency model, which helps architects estimate the safety score of given architecture and system design without physically testing them in an AV. We demonstrate the use of our safety score and latency model, by developing and evaluating a safety-aware AV computing system computation hardware resource management scheme.",0,2,False,self,,,,,

Currently, data governance teams attempt to apply manual control at various points to control the consistency and quality of the data. The introduction of Data Version Control (DVC) version tracking would allow data governance and engineering teams to engineer the data together, filing bugs against data versions, applying quality control checks to the data compilers, etc.

Platforms like [Palantir Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) already treat the management of data in much the same way as versioning of code. Within data versioning platforms datasets can be versioned, branched, acted upon by versioned code to create new data sets. This enables data driven testing, where the data itself is tested in much the same way as that the code that modifies it.

There also some open source options:

My initial idea was to setup a camera and train a model (using TensorFlow) on what is a small rock, big rock, quartz rock. And so far my tabletop demo is successful. My goal is to then send the coordinates of the rock to pick out to a robotic arm that will pick out the rock at a given coordinate. Lets assume that the rock picking process is trivial.

My problem is when vendors approached us, they convinced my boss that they know better (usual vendor logic) and they say that its better if we train the machine by observing an actual operator do the work. They didnt go into much detail but when i asked them how they would do that they had vague answers that made no sense, such as ""its an AI that learns which rocks to pick, by wtaching the operator it will learn""

They showed us demos of games being played like racing cars around artificial tracks, super mario etc. But from my understanding, wouldnt it be better if we could actually train the algorithm to detect what is a quartz rock and how to detect it in a camera frame and then proceed to remove the rock? I think its much harder to train the algorithm with a weird camera angle watching someone do the job and then determining which rocks to pick.

Recently i saw a user post a video on here showing a generation based car racing track. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL7tSgUpy8w) Wouldnt that be a generative model and is maybe what's causing confusion to the vendors?

What is the effect of training a system with ""jumbled"" inputs `vx`, and `vy`, such that `vx = [c1, s2]` and `vy = [c2, s1]`?

My immediate thought is that you can't really give labels to jumbled training examples (it can't be a cat if it has a horse's head and a pig's tail), but perhaps the system could learn a probability distribution of the labels based on the features included?

I have known I wanted to get a masters for quite some time. I am currently a Data Scientist in the DC area, however want to move towards machine learning applied for engineering applications as opposed to business/ enterprise applications.

For a while I have been looking at schools in the United States, such as Maryland, Austin, UIL, Michigan etc. However, the idea of going abroad has been in the back of mind for some time. I studied abroad at Edinburgh, which is where I first studied and acquired a passion for machine learning.

Alongside the cheaper cost of school there, on a more personal level I am anxious about missing out on a chance to experience living in a foreign country again. So I am considering applying to programs at UCL, Imperial and Edinburgh.  My one concern is how thst will Impact career prospects in my future.

Some more background, I graduated relatively recently. I had a 3.5 GPA with a degree in applied stats and computer science from a fairly well known school (albeit not well known in CS). I have research experience from an internship and expect to be published at some point. I   have some long term professional goals, but they may just be pipe dreams, of continuing my growth at one of the well known residency programs but I understand my performance during a masters will impact that likelihood more than the school itself. Also a Ph. D is not off the table, but I think masters would help with finding a program.

I am obsessed with making Data Science in Python faster and many people told me that data cleaning and manipulation are the most tedious tasks in their daily work.

Which are the exact tasks where you spend/lose most of your time when performing data cleaning/manipulation in pandas?

1. reading in datasets (finding the right separator, dataformat, ...)
2. adjusting the data types of the columns - eg parse datetime, parse to numeric or categoric, others?
3. removing missing values
4. finding and removing duplicate values
5. parsing columns and removing invalid strings?
6. concatenating datasets
7. joining multiple tables
8. creating groupbys and aggregations
9. filtering and selecting subsets
10. creating new columns/feature engineering
11. visualizing the dataset and exploring it
12. **Something else? Did I miss something?**

I am planning to collect the best libraries for the tasks (or maybe write a library on my own to fill the missing gaps) in order to make the working process much faster.

I would be grateful for any input

&amp;#x200B;

What part of training makes this happen? For concreteness, let's look at VAEs for the time being, with the usual Gaussian prior. It would seem like linear interpolation in this case could yield bad results, since there's a good chance that at some point in the interpolation we could pass by a vector of smalll norm, which would be very unlikely to be sampled from a Gaussian in the latent space has high dimension. In fact, some papers even make references to this and use things like SLERP. Nevertheless, the results clearly work. Is there a theoretical justification for why these operations have meaning?

Firstly I know it's a basic question but there are a few constraints that make it interesting. 

The problem is as follows - I have an equation of the following form

a1 \* b1 \* c1...f1 = x/y

here 

x/y is a ratio which can range from 0 to +inf.

a1, b1....f1 are features that are all binary. 

I want to measure the change in ratio( x/y )  due to the presence of a1 feature and similarly for other features as well.

I applied LOG transformation of the equation to convert into sums and applied Linear Regression ( sticking to basics ).  The learned weights by the model actually denote the change my output value which can be reduced back by taking Exponent of the weights. However, the results were not good. 

I needed help with the following - 

* Are there any other methods by which I can measure such change, like using weights of Linear Regression, etc?
* Since ratio tends to be from 0 to +inf, applying, is there some other transformation I should prefer?
* All my features are categorical which were one hot encoded, is there some other encoding that might be preferred in such use case?",4,2,False,self,,,,,

This is my forward pass:

`res_1_activation = sigmoid(res_1)`

`output =`  
 [`np.dot`](https://np.dot/)`(W_2.T, res_1_activation) + b2`

`output_activation = sigmoid(output)`

This is my backward pass:

`grad_pre_output = -(y[i] - output_activation)`

`grad_W_2 =` [`np.dot`](https://np.dot/)`(np.expand_dims(res_1_activation, axis=1),np.expand_dims(grad_pre_output, 1).T)`

`grad_b2 = np.expand_dims(grad_pre_output, 1)`

`grad_post_1 =` [`np.dot`](https://np.dot/)`(W_2, np.expand_dims(grad_pre_output, axis=1))`

`grad_pre_1 =np.multiply(grad_post_1.T, d_sigmoid(res_1))`

`grad_W_1 =` [`np.dot`](https://np.dot/)`(np.expand_dims(x, axis=1), grad_pre_1)`

`grad_b1 = grad_pre_1.T`

`W_1 = np.add(W_1, lr * ((grad_W_1) - lamda * 2 * W_1))`

`W_2 = np.add(W_2, lr * ((grad_W_2) - lamda * 2 * W_2))`

`b1 = np.add(b1, np.reshape(grad_b1, (grad_b1.shape[0],)))`

`b2 = np.add(b2, np.reshape(grad_b2, (grad_b2.shape[0],)))`

I think this implementation should work, but when I run it for &gt;2 epochs all the output neurons get saturated and always return a value of 1. I tried using L2 regularization but it still saturates. Can anyone please tell me what I am doing wrong?

Worked on the intersection of physics and supervised learning methods.  

Wasn't happy as a postdoc and decided to join the industry instead. 

Joined a mid-level software company that developed analytics software for various businesses, hoping to  utilize my ML and stats knowledge, but quickly found that at the time (2009\~2010) domain knowledge and implementation expertise were much more valued than mathematical and modeling skills (again *at that time* \- things seems to have changed radically since then - I remember hearing more than once while interviewing in 2009 hiring managers say that they'd rather hire a domain expert and train them on the science than hire a scientist and train them on the domain).   

Within a year, I switched to a TPM/Architect type of role, going to client sites and doing implementations or assisting with project management and tech support, and worked for various consulting firms in that capacity, as there seemed to be more money and opportunity there. 

In a way, I was never that far removed from data science, since the products I was peddling always involved an analytics/predictive function. But none of the roles I had involved any explicit science work, other than having to explain to clients and business stake holders the math that was behind some of the algorithms used in the software I worked with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then in 2014, I realized that DS and ML were fashionable, and that experience with neural networks (my old passion) was considered a hot skill on the market, so I decided to get back into data science. I started learning R and Python (in my grad school days I was mostly a Matlab person) and catching up on the latest developments in the field, frequenting Kaggle discussions and other forums, Leetcode, etc...

I thought the combination of business knowledge / consulting experience + Ph.D level understanding of the models and math involved would make me a golden candidate for various DS/ML roles. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, over the last 5 years, I have found it very difficult to break into the field, with recruiters and hiring managers rarely paying attention to me, and when they do, I can't seem to get passed the technical screens or initial interviews because of my lack of real world experience with things like Spark, Flask, etc... and my mostly theoretical (very deep, but still purely theoretical) knowledge of how models other than time series and linear regression work. 

Even more frustrating is that more and more people with less qualifications than me seem to transition at will into data science roles (business analyst or SDE completes a Coursera certificate in machine learning, gets promoted to data science role the next month). 

To top it all off: I'm nearing forty now (which I gather is ancient in machine learning years) and I feel like my chances of breaking into the filed based on age alone are decreasing exponentially every year.

Abstract: A human does not have to see all elephants to recognize an animal as an elephant. On contrast, current state-of-the-art deep learning approaches heavily depend on the variety of training samples and the capacity of the network. In practice, the size of network is always limited and it is impossible to access all the data samples. Under this circumstance, deep learning models are extremely fragile to human-imperceivable adversarial examples, which impose threats to all safety critical systems. Inspired by the association and attention mechanisms of the human brain, we propose reverse adversarial examples method that can greatly improve models' robustness on unseen data. Experiments show that our reverse adversarial method can improve accuracy on average 19.02% on ResNet18, MobileNet, and VGG16 on unseen data transformation. Besides, the proposed method is also applicable to compressed models and shows potential to compensate the robustness drop brought by model quantization - an absolute 30.78% accuracy improvement.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people ask how to combine NLP based features (or in general sequence embeddings) with standart features. In keras it pretty easy with a multiple input modell:

    nlp_input = Input(shape=(seq_length,), name='nlp_input')
    meta_input = Input(shape=(10,), name='meta_input')
    emb = Embedding(output_dim=embedding_size, input_dim=100, input_length=seq_length)(nlp_input)
    nlp_out = Bidirectional(LSTM(128, dropout=0.3, recurrent_dropout=0.3, kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.01)))(emb)
    x = concatenate([nlp_out, meta_input])
    x = Dense(classifier_neurons, activation='relu')(x)
    x = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)
    model = Model(inputs=[nlp_input , meta_input], outputs=[x])

I have been trying to use an unpaired image-to-image style transfer GAN to convert shoes to dresses. After trying a few different algorithms (including DiscoGAN, StarGAN, and MUNIT), I settled on CycleGAN as it has given me the best results.

I have collected 99,500 and 114,000 images of dresses and shoes, respectively. All of the shoes and dresses are the same orientation and scale (within category). Compared to other projects, I think my dataset quality is quite good.

I am using an implementation by [aitorzip](https://github.com/aitorzip/PyTorch-CycleGAN) ([my fork](https://github.com/lpupp/PyTorch-CycleGAN)). I have tried a few different configurations but havent been able to get anything better than the default configurations.

The quality of the generated images initially progresses well (until around 1/3 of an epoch30,000 steps on a batch size of 1). After that, even after 32,000, the results worsen. The mode seems to collapse after the first epoch has been completed.

&amp;#x200B;

[Image 1: progression of generator's outputs and reconstruction over time for shoes2dresses task](https://i.redd.it/a8r08leroc131.jpg)

The results generated by the model after 30,000 steps are still very checkered. I tried replacing the transposed convolutions with upsamples (see [here](https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/ 2)) but it resulted in a mode collapse very quickly.

I am not sure if I have already reached the best performance I can expect with such small images (64x64) but its hard to believe since this would imply that the best results are achieved before the GAN has seen the whole training set. I am unable to get anything comparable with larger images (128x128 or 256x256).

Additionally, I feel like I am battling many issues at the same time. First, I am finding it difficult to get high-quality outputs. Then, the GAN is very unstable and collapses frequently. Finally, it is often the case the even though the GAN produces the same output for any input, it is able to reconstruct the input image (see image 2)

&amp;#x200B;

[Image 2: reconstructs output of mode collapse generator well](https://i.redd.it/y40069tvoc131.jpg)

I have already played around with many of the training parameters (batch size, learning rate, decay rate, loss function composition, added feature matching, Wasserstein loss, added noise to the input images, added extra layers to the discriminator and generator, used upsample operations in place of transposed convolutions, played around with the buffer size, also attempted to keep the kernel size proportional to the 64x64 image ratio when using larger images). However, since there are so many things to change, my experiments were not exhaustive. In particular, I feel like I could try playing around the decay rates and composition of the loss function in more detail. Things that are on my list but that I havent tried are mini-batch discrimination, packing (from PACGAN), different normalization (currently, I am using InstanceNorm), and logit loss (from LOGAN).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I have been spent many hours on this, and, without positive feedback, my personal learning is not so high.

I've done courses in Deep Learning, Statistical Learning, Sensing and Estimation,  Image processing and Recommender Systems - and got a few projects. I'm good at Python, and using PyTorch for developing CNNs ( familiar with TF and Keras, but not very fluent). I'm at the end of my first year, and I've got my summer ahead of me, after which I want to start hunting for jobs. One wrong decision I made was to take up a project under a Prof in the summer on Data Science, which I think has made my work too diversified- basically a little bit of everything but not enough depth in one. I think this was a bad idea because as a grad student I'm expected to me really knowledgeable in one field. Of all the things I've done, I'm interested in CV the most, as it looks the most exciting and I've had fun doing projects on it. I am planning to do a classical CV course from the CSE department next quarter. I was wondering if I'm making mistake by deciding to give all my energies to CV. Are there enough job opportunities out there in CV to a Master's student to pursue? Or should I dabble a bit everywhere - a few projects on NLP etc, so that I have a shot at any ML related opening?

TL;DR - Masters student trying to choose between focusing on CV or doing a bit of everything, for ML related software jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to reimplement CycleGAN in a Jupyter notbook and (for me) the code looks good, but somehow my generators just learn to map an input to itself (so what I put into it comes out at the other end). I'm testing my implementation with the horse2zebra dataset.

*Processing img nehc7wksti131...*

*Processing img th5sljd1ui131...*

What's odd is that the GAN loss is going up, which is probably why the generators don't learn anything meaningful other than the identity mapping. I also got the feeling that my discriminators just learn to distinguish fake from real images, but nothing about horses or zebras.

when it comes to deployment and integration of deep learning models, it seems like there are a lot of solutions out there, but the most are kind of complex or depend on third party solutions. While it often seems to be a good idea to containerize models and deploy them the modern microservices way, I think this approach is kind of heavy and needs a lot of infrastructure, therefore is not the best idea as small or medium sized company.

I want to share an alternative approach, which can be used easily by just utilizing what python and e.g. the Java ecosystem offers out-of-the-box. [Link](http://digital-thinking.de/deploying-deep-learning-models-into-production-without-famework-overhead/)
