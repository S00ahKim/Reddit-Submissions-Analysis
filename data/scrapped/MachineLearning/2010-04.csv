We have decided to make a reddit recommendation site/app based of links visited/recommended.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/blqnz/ok_rmachinelearning_after_talking_with_quite_a/,atlas245,1270235315,"Kudos to urish for the idea, so what is my goal for this project?  To finish in one week.  

I am starting a simple startup after this and am looking for some co-founders.   Mainly 1 Web developer and 1 Machine Learning/Web Developer if possible.  This project will serve as a very simple spring board.  Think of this as a trial in which the outcome doesnt matter and cost nothing and we build something cool.   After we work together we will have a good idea of what people would be good to work with and we can discuss where to go from there.  
If you want to join send me a message and lets get started!
Edit: Ok I created a google group, as its simplest and fastest way to collaborate.

A bit like http://blog.peltarion.com/2006/07/10/classifier-showdown/, but this isn't it.

The page had naive bayes, SVM with a range of kernels, some rule learners, etc. 

I was pretty sure I found it from reddit, but for the life of me I can't find it again now.

My background in machine learning is lacking, I'm afraid, but I'm sure I can get up to speed during the process (I've only done one course in machine learning, but a few courses in econometrics). 

My idea is something along the line of forecasting and algorithmic trading/portfolio selection. I'm trying to set up a meeting with (hopefully) my future supervisor in a few weeks and thought that you guys might have just the right ideas for me. I'm currently trying to read up on relevant litterature, if you have any good sources for journal articles not to be missed, or even good textbooks, I'm all ears.
