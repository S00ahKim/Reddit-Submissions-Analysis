For the last few months I've been building a Quadcopter, I've got to the stage where it's completely built, and pretty much programmed. I have it set up to use a PID controller to stabilize it by adjusting the power going to each motor.

If you're not familiar with a PID, you basically give it 

* an input value (say the current pitch angle)
* a target input value (say 0 degrees to keep it level) and 
* 3 coefficients (P, I and D). 

It then does a calculation and gives an output. This output is added to the speed of one motor, and subtracted from the speed of another. This should keep the pitch under control. The same thing is then done for Roll.

The tricky part of this setup is finding the correct values of P, I and D. 

I have it rigged up as in

Are there any PID tuning techniques or can anyone think of an approach I could use by collecting data and analysing it?

**EDIT:** Just throwing this up here in case anyone's interested, I'm trying to document the build as much as I can, coming at it from a complete beginner to electronics, so here's a [blog](http://gerharte.blogspot.com/) I'm trying to keep updated (not fully up to date yet) and here's my [github](https://github.com/GerHarte/quadcopter).

I'm taking the same course as the OP of that post and am stuck in the same spot.

A recap of the task I'm trying to perform (as I understand it) is: Generate N+4 2D points. Pick 2 points at random and remove them from the pool. Use the line these 2 points form to label all other points as + or - depending on if they fall above (+) or below (-) the line. Pick another 2 points. Use this line as the hypothesis function for determining if a point in the pool should be + or -. Use the PLA to update the hypothesis until it is correct.

I've been able to do everything except the last line. I'm starting out with an N of 10. I generate 14 points, remove 2 and use that line to label the other 12. I remove another 2 and have my hypothesis function. I loop over the other 10 points, determine its actual label, then I multiply the x element of the point by the x weight and the y element of the point by the y weight (the weights are initialized to 1, so this does nothing at first). I feed this weighted point into my hypothesis function and get the guessed sign. If it matches the actual sign, I continue on. If not, I update the x weight as so: weight_x = weight_x + (desired_sign * original_unweighted_input_x). I update the y weight in the same fashion. Then I loop through all the inputs again using the new weights until my hypothesis matches the actual for every input. This usually ends up looping forever and never converging.

A UNIVERSAL NON-LINEAR FILTER, PREDICTOR AND SIMULATOR WHICH OPTIMIZES ITSELF BY A LEARNING PROCESS, D. Gabor, W. P. L. Wilby, and R. Woodcock, 1960.

I thought some people in this subreddit might find it of historical interest.  Some points I took away from it:

* We have it *good*.  It was _so much work_ to do anything in 1960.  The authors had to construct a tape-based recording machine, design servo-controlled potentiometers for each variable, design hall effect and piezo-magnetic multiplier circuits (check the diagrams on page 428!), etc.

* It was hard to imagine big data back then.  Sentences such as ""It has been mentioned that with M terms this will require a great number of repeated runs through the training samples, of the order 1/2 M^2, which is 5000 in the somewhat unlikely case in which all 100 terms are of importance.""

* Economy of circuitry lead to some pretty creative design choices.  ""It would, of course, be most uneconomical to take a separate set of multipliers for every term in every one of the orthogonal polynomials, but this could be avoided by attaching to each term a potentiometer with as many taps as there are polynomials in which it occurs.""

* There's a brief mention of over/underfitting, though he doesn't exactly talk about cross-validation, but rather that we can expect future values to follow similar statistical parameters. (""What encourages us in the expectation that, if the filter has
learned to minimize the error on a teaching record, it will do
equally well when presented with another sample of the same
stochastic series?"", page 425)

* I didn't know that a ""general"" analog computer was an achievable or practical thing, but here is an analog computer which can learn ""any function"" within a certain range and to a certain degree of precision.

Use case: We get observation data from two sources: a tower that senses CO2 flux value @ 15 minutes, and spectral data from high resolution cameras in different wavelengths.

The dimensionality of the bands can be further reduced to about 200 by calculating some informative indices. But still the problem is same, which is which set of indices are good predictors of the CO2 flux value. We would like to then correlate the predicted flux value with observed flux value and try to hypothesize the causes for any discrepancy.

*Designer spin systems via inverse statistical mechanics*
http://prb.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v88/i13/e134104

In the paper, they claim

&gt; Over the past century, a tremendous amount of work
has been dedicated to solving the standard, or forward,
problem of statistical mechanics for the Ising model and
generalizations thereof.1,6,914 Given a Hamiltonian such as
those found in Eqs.(1) and(2), one computes the structural and
bulk properties (e.g., expectation values, correlation functions,
thermodynamic functions, etc.) corresponding to the spin
system of interest.

&gt; By contrast, little to no attention has been focused to date
on inverse problems within the context of the Ising spin
models, in which the problem proceeds in reverse, i.e., given
a targeted spin conguration to be a desired state of matter
(e.g., a ground or excited state, or a system endowed with
novel bulk properties), one seeks to procure the Hamiltonian
(or class of Hamiltonians) describing the optimal underlying
set of interactions that will lead to the prescribed target
system. In fact, several promising techniques for solving the
inverse problem have recently emerged in the literature and
were initially applied to classically interacting many-particle
systems to produce unusual ground states1518 as well as unique
bulk properties at positive temperatures.19,20 To the best of our
knowledge, this paper describes the rst application of inverse
methods developed by us to spin systems.

Now, my field isn't really ML or this sort of condensed matter spin-lattice stuff, but my understanding of Boltzmann Machines is that they're trying to do something very similar: tune the parameters of a spin Hamiltonian in order that thermodynamic samples from the system have the same distribution as some input training set. Am I right to see this connection? Are there interesting links between the two, and in fact the statement ""little to no attention has been focused to date on inverse problems within the context of the Ising spin models"" isn't entirely true?",13,13,False,self,,,,,

And for a long time I've approached my study from a very conceptual point of view. I've learned about it in a how do you solve problems point of view to a point where I understand the concepts at a very high level.

Unfortunately, whenever I attempt to go deeper and get into the Math of it such that I can actually use the models, I find all the resources to be very abstract and detached from the actual problems they're solving. 

This is frustrating as from as far as I can tell the most complex operations that are really occurring are summation of series and multiplication of weights. Sure there are different threshold functions that can occur within a neuron, and there can be some calculus involved. But in reality from a overarching view, these models are fairly simple.

The really frustrating thing I've found is I'll avoid some piece of math because it looks complex only to find that the notation actually means something along the lines of ""apply this simple equation to these terms and add them together""

Obviously I don't come from a math background but I'd like to learn just what I need to, to get up and running. I've been reviewing Math on Khan Academy but I really don't want to go through a ton of learning just to come to the conclusion that the math involved in these models is really actually very simple just stated in pointlessly complex terminology.

I developed this little application that uses a genetic algorithm and a Markov chain simulation of an offensive drive to find near-optimal offensive play-calling strategies for NFL teams. I think the data are pretty neat, and I think the concept is pretty novel, so I thought I'd share. Below, I've reproduced the abstract of a [manuscript](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxtaWNoYWVsYWFsY29ybnxneDozNDgwNWZmYjU5NDQ1NDIz) that I submitted to the *Journal of Quantitative Analysis of Sports*, but which was ultimately rejected.

&gt;In this paper, I present a genetic algorithm (and an accompanying open source application, [*Football-o-Genetics*](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelaalcorn/Football-o-Genetics)) for discovering near-optimal offensive play calling strategies in American football. By mating individuals (representing various play calling strategies) with a frequency proportional to their relative fitness, near-optimal play calling strategies can be evolved. An individual's fitness corresponds to the percentage of Markov chain simulations of an offensive drive that result in a touchdown. I tested the algorithm on each of the 32 NFL teams from the 2012 season, and, in each case, the evolved play calling strategies outperformed the observed play calling strategies in touchdown production. The genetic algorithm also produces several metrics that can be used for assessing the quality of individual coaches and players. The results presented in this paper suggest genetic algorithms (and other machine learning techniques) can be useful tools for investigating sporting strategy.

And now for a little backstory on me. When I developed this application, I had zero formal computer science experience (i.e. I had never taken a university course on the subject). In fact, I had recently ""dropped out"" (left with a master's) of a PhD program in evolutionary biology at The University of Chicago. As such, when I submitted my manuscript to *JQAS*, I did so without any faculty supervision or graduate student feedback. Although *JQAS* ultimately rejected the paper, they did say that they felt the methods and the results were interesting, but that other aspects of the paper were lacking. Anyway, I'm now in my first semester of graduate school in the computer science program at the University of Texas at Dallas. Unfortunately, first year master's students aren't really given the opportunity to discuss research ideas with faculty, and my attempts to reach out to certain faculty members have been ignored thus far, so I haven't had the chance to share *Football-o-Genetics* with any of the faculty at UT Dallas. With that being said, I was wondering if any of you had any thoughts on the matter, particularly whether or not this type of data would be publishable somewhere. I don't really care if it's not, as I'm proud of the product as it stands, but if getting it published was a possibility, then I think that could potentially open up some doors for me in the future (e.g. pursuing a PhD in machine learning/A.I.). Anyway, I'd really appreciate any feedback you have to offer, and if any of this data looks enticing to you, I'm very open to the idea of a collaboration; otherwise, I hope you enjoy the read!",10,20,False,default,,,,,

Here is a hypothetical case:  Let's say I have one set of data about (American) football players from one season and their statistics.  For each player there is one row of data that might have things like their physical attributes (height, weight, etc.), and their player performance (rushing yards, passing yards, tackles, etc.).  A second set of data is from the following season and is identical in structure except that it lacks the player's name.

I want to find a way to match up the new season's data to the previous season's data to try and figure out the missing players' names.  I know some of the features will be more helpful than others.  A player's height won't change much between two years, so I can tell that two records aren't the same player if the heights are very different, and a defensive lineman isn't likely to have many passing yards.

I'm wondering if this is even a machine learning problem, since many such problems are about simplifying and pattern matching (e.g. given that same data, figure out what can identify the positions played - taking the 1600 player data and clustering into about 17 positions, and given some new data, predict the position).  In this problem the data is very shallow, so there's not much to actually train and test on - I'm trying to match 1600 records to another 1600 records.

I'm not asking anyone to solve this problem for me, but if anyone can tell me what kind of problem this is so I can research it further, that would be great.",18,8,False,self,,,,,

I have an interesting problem that I am trying to solve.

**The Problem**


I have a dataset, I train a neural network to learn to classify instances of data using the dataset (very basic stuff here). 

Here's where it gets interesting. Assuming I have two possible classes (0 and 1), what I want to do is re-classify an instance that was say classified by the neural network as 0 into 1 by changing the attributes of the instance. 

Doing that is not particularly hard, I could do a similarity check using my dataset. However, the twist is I want to find the least amount of changes I would have to make to the attributes of the instance in order to classify it into the accepted class (1)

I have done an extensive bit of research already and can't seem to find a lot of research papers that addresses this problem (which I think is a bit odd as classification has had a lot of attention paid to it.) So I thought I'd crowdsource and ask you folks here what kind of approach you'd take towards solving this.

Another question I have is whether it is easy to move between application domains in machine learning. For example if your phd mostly focuses on applying machine learning to speech data or medical imaging data would it be difficult to get a position working on text analysis or video tracking.

More info inside...,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1p7rxb/ask_ml_im_currently_an_undergrad_would_i_be_able/,passingby,1382731820,"Hey all!

I'm a senior at my University and will be graduating next semester. I was looking for an upper level course to meet graduation requirements but none of the undergrad courses appealed to me so I looked at the graduate courses. One of them is on Machine Learning and it looks really interesting. I could take something easier like networking or software testing but I really want to challenge myself.

Here is the course description from the catalog ([source](http://catalog.iastate.edu/search/?q=com+s+573#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=com%2Bs%2B573&amp;gsc.page=1)):
&gt; Algorithmic models of learning. Design, analysis, implementation and applications of learning algorithms. Learning of concepts, classification rules, functions, relations, grammars, probability distributions, value functions, models, skills, behaviors and programs. Agents that learn from observation, examples, instruction, induction, deduction, reinforcement and interaction. Computational learning theory. Data mining and knowledge discovery using artificial neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, Bayesian networks, association rules, dimensionality reduction, feature selection and visualization. Learning from heterogeneous, distributed, dynamic data and knowledge sources. Learning in multi-agent systems. Selected applications in automated knowledge acquisition, pattern recognition, program synthesis, bioinformatics and Internet-based information systems. Oral and written reports.

The textbook assigned for the class is [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop](http://amzn.com/0387310738). I've heard it is a pretty decent one as well.

I meet all the requirements except for the Comp Sci Statistics course. I haven't taken it yet but will be taking it the same semester. I have a lot of experience teaching material to myself so over Winter break I planned on trying to learn as much as I could about machine learning/statistics before the course started (if I were to take it).

I tend to prefer harder classes and motivation isn't a problem for me. If it requires 20 hours of studying/homework outside of class a week just to keep up, I would be fully capable of handling it.

I emailed the professor but am waiting for a response and just thought I'd ask the community here to see what they think.

My goal is to match all of the groups into 8 clusters that are as close as possible to the original 8 in both size and the 10 characteristics. 

My first idea is to evaluate based on the distance between points, which I can do fairly easily for either age or the characteristics, but I am failing to come up with a method that accounts for both age and the characteristics.

Most of the time, I'm told that ""more data is better"" since you can better represent the population distribution, but we're going to be using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (a service where you can pay people to do simple tasks -- such as filling out a questionnaire) for our data collection, so we need an estimate of how much money we're going to need to allocate.

I was recently thrown head-first into the world of machine learning. I just started my first job, and had the opportunity to apply for an internal transfer into the Innovation and Development team for my company. Much to my surprise, I was accepted, and was assigned to the team that works on text mining/sentiment analysis. 

My team lead allowed me to choose which area I want to focus on, and I chose deep learning for sentiment analysis. To that end he told me to start programming simple neural nets, and move onto more complex networks as time goes on.

So, I just finished programming a feed-forward neural network which uses basic back-propagation. I'm a little confused as to how I feed in text data however. The goal is to try to classify sentiment with the network. (My team lead and I are cognizant that it most likely will not work well, but the idea is to try sentiment analysis with every network I create, to be able to compare the performance.)
