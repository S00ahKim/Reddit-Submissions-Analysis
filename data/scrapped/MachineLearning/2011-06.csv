I have approx. 24k example rows, with 25 real (double's) attributes, and a nominal label. Each example represents a snapshot of scientific measurements at a moment in time (g-forces, magnometer, etc.) and the nominal label is essentially a boolean (""was the event happening?""). I'm trying to build a model (preferably a formula) that can predict the boolean output, or provide some sort of numerical ""confidence"". 

Here's the issues I'm having:

* Almost everything I do is running out of memory, I have 3GB of RAM devoted to the RapidMiner JVM.
* In the event that I *do* get a model to self learn, I end up with something that has ""97% accuracy"", but always predicts one of the boolean values (e.g. it's 97% accurate and not 100% accurate, because it always predicts ""false"" and never predicts a ""true"")

I'm thinking some of my attributes are insignificant to the boolean result, but I don't understand how to identify which ones and eliminate them. I also think I'm wasting a lot of time trying each model type out (LibSVM, Neural Net, etc.) when the guru's would probably know which model applies to this type of data/problem.

&gt; A computer scientist working in the machine learning area joined a large money management
company some years ago and set up a group to do portfolio management using stock predictions given by large neural nets. When we visited, I asked how he explained the neural nets to clients. Simple, he said; We fit binary trees to the inputs and outputs of the neural nets and show the trees to the clients. Keeps them happy! In both stock prediction and credit rating, the priority is accuracy. Interpretability is a secondary goal that can be finessed.

I want to make sure I understand what this computer scientist at the large money mgmt company is doing.  He's taking the predicted outputs of the neural net - the yhats - and using them as the dependent variable for a single binary tree model.  Is that right?  I understand that this is solely for client interpretability, and the tree wouldn't be used for prediction, but it still feels a little funny.  The tree wouldn't fit the neural net's predictions perfectly, so you'd have situations like this:

you: ""well the tree predicts this, but that's actually not our prediction, because our real model is a neural net.""  

client: ""why does the net make a different prediction?""

you: ""it's a black box, I can't say""

Step 4 is: For each node of the tree, randomly choose m variables on which to base the decision at that node. Calculate the best split based on these m variables in the training set.

What I don't understand is:

1. What's the ""best split"" here for classification and regression problems ? And how do you calculate it ?

2. Is it saying the best split using all m variables, or just the one among m that gives you the best split ?

http://www.kaggle.com/c/mdm

Don't let the contest name fool you; it is fundamentally an image analysis problem. The contest organizers have provided 60,000 simulated galaxy images and want to participants to calculate the ellipticity of the galaxy, which describes its geometry (more info on the Kaggle page). In addition, the organizers blurred the images with an optical PSF (also with noise) given as a 'star' image - which is often used to represent the PSF in astronomy. One could use DSP methods to clean the images and calculate the ellipticity.

Where the machine learning comes in is that the organizers have also provided 40,000 ""training"" simulated galaxy images, where the ellipticity values are provided. Ostensibly this is for us to test our answers, but more experienced users are using it to form a predictive Machine Learning model and generate good answers (small root mean squared error) for the actual set of images in question ""without even looking at the images"".

Basically I have several graphs with undirected edges and each node can have an attribute from a set of possible attributes. Typically the graphs consists of 15-30 nodes and are moderately connected.

What I want to do is given a partial graph, I want to predict the most likely ""completion"" of missing parts. 
I've looked into things such as vectorizing graphs to project them to a N dimensional space and do clustering there and so on. But this gives the nearest neighbor and I want to estimate the missing connections and nodes given a partial graph with a probability attached to it.

It sounds like it should be a quite well researched problem. I am also interested in software packages so that I can quickly try out something...

Thanks a lot!

The Singularity Summit is an annual conference focused on the Singularity and related converging technologies such as robotics, nanotechnology, brain-computer interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

On present trends, computers will have more powerful ""brains"" than humans by around 2030. It's likely that this, and corresponding developments in biotechnology, robotics, nanotechnology and medicine will fundamentally change the world we live in. This will affect every one of us in profound ways that are only dimly understood. 

The Singularity represents an ""event horizon"" in the predictability of human technological development. We have no means to predict the behaviour of entities smarter and more capable than ourselves so our models of the future cease to give reliable answers. While some regard the Singularity as a positive event and work to hasten its arrival, others have misgivings. We debate and discuss the most practical means for initiating the Singularity, and how, or whether, it can be influenced or managed. The Singularity Summits lead the world's dialogue on the Singularity, bringing together scientists, technologists, sceptics, and enthusiasts alike.

The summit will explore the important human and philosophical dimensions of the Singularity. Presentations will explore how can we plan rationally for Transhumanism, how can we ensure that the beneficial potential of the Singularity is realised, and how do we manage the risks involved. David Chalmers and others will examine how the Singularity will stretch our understanding of what it is to be human, to be conscious, and how our moral intuitions can extend to a world of non-human and partly-human intelligences.

It is hypothesized that Machines will out think by Computers before the middle of this century.

Professor Hugo de Garis says in History Channel's documentary Prophets of Doom ""It is only a question of time now before humanity can build artificial brains that are far more intelligent than human beings. So this is a huge issue that will eclipse any other human issue this century...I call this 'Species dominance'.""

Although this sounds like science fiction, its starting to take this very seriously.  This year the Singularity has made the cover of Time Magazine, and the topic of a feature documentary 'Transcendent Man' has been .  You have people like Larry Page (CEO of Google) taking an interest in this stuff, prominent public figures willing to associate their names with the Singularity, its definitely a move from the fringes, if not yet into the mainstream, then a lot closer..

""If you go back 500 years, not much happened in a century. Now a lot happens in 6 months."" says Ray Kurzweil in documentary Transcendent Man.  ""Technology feeds on itself and it gets faster and faster, it's going to continue, and in about 40 years it is going to become so fast, the pace of change is going to be so astonishingly quick that you won't be able to follow it, unless, you enhance your own intelligence by merging with the intelligent technology we have created.""

This conference will challenge and enhance your view of the future.
