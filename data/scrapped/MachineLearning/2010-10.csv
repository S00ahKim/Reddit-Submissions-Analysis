I'm curious how it performs when compared with more common techniques like stochastic gradient descent, coordinate descent, and algorithm-specific optimizations like SMO. Does it have the same wandering/slow convergence rate as evolutionary and annealing algorithms? ",1,13
2,2010-10-4,2010,10,4,9,dme2x,How do you deal with grid search / cross validation data?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/dme2x/how_do_you_deal_with_grid_search_cross_validation/,anonygiraffe,1286152660,"I'm running some extensive tests on the effect of hyperparameters of a learning algorithm on a particular dataset. At each training epoch, I log various measures such as the current error. This is obviously generating a lot of data (roughly 500 training epochs per experiment, and there are over one thousand of those).

Some questions I am interested in answering are:

* Which hyperparameter combinations did the best overall, averaged over all cross validations?

* Did any of the individual experiments seem like they hadn't converged by the end of training? (""should I increase the maximum number of epochs?"")

* How much variation did the hyperparameters have across different folds?

* What's the general trend of a particular subset of hyperparameters if we fix the others?

All fairly basic questions. For now I have homebrewed scripts to answer most of these, but it would be nice to see what other people are using. The only other approach I tried was OpenOffice Calc but it didn't feel very intuitive and in the end didn't save me any time vs modifying scripts by hand.",8,8

I have set up a quick and dirty (read: nearly unusable) website for it.  Anyone in the hivemind have any experience monetizing something like this?  
Do I set up a paywall and subscription?  Can something like this make me money if its just ad supported?
Any guidance would be really helpful right now.  ",18,11

EDIT: 

to be more specific: 
Suppose there is a reinforcement learning algorithm that we want to display a certain stimulus X, let us assume it is a picture of some sort. it begins by showing stimuli to the subject. the subject's brain responds positively if it perceives the current stimulus to be close to the stimulus it wants(X) and negatively otherwise. This response in the brain is tapped using some sort of a brain mapping technique like EEG/fmRi etc. and the positive reaction is given as a ""reward"" to the reinforcement learning algorithm and negative reaction is given as a ""punishment"".",15,9
