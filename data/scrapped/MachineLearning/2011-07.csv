Magic the Gathering is a very broad game and a new set of cards is released every year so the cards people are playing with are always changing. There are some big competitions and money to be earned in it if you're good.

Magic got a pretty solid [rules](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/rules) so implementing the rules in code shouldn't be that much of a hassle (taking Hofstadter's law into account...) but hammering all the cards in would take some time.

My question now is, what method would you use to train an AI player? I was thinking about using monte carlo but then it occurred to me that I can't let the deck of cards be in a predefined state because then I would be allowing the player to ""see"" the future when he's drawing the cards. Some cards however allow the player to change the order of e.g. the top three cards of his deck so I can't let the player choose a random card from it.

Training a neural network for each possible deck seems out of hand because of the immense range of cards out there.

Would it also be possible to let two AI players play against each other to find the best possible deck?

My current gig involves some machine-learning, and a lot of the experiments I want to run take up to a day to complete. My previous programming work has been in domains where the edit/compile/test cycle has been much faster, and it's no problem to restart the program every few minutes if need be. I'm struggling with this: often bugs only become apparent several hours into the run, while I'm asleep or otherwise engaged, so it's easy to lose days to trivial mistakes. Some of the people here must deal with this all the time: what tools and strategies do you use to handle it?

Some things seem obvious:

 * Make the code faster, by parallelising it, distributing it to a cluster, running it on GPUs, running it on faster hardware, or just old-fashioned profiling and hotspot elimination. I've done some of this, and intend to do more - the 1-day runtime quoted above is after parallelisation.
 * Unit testing and static checks. I've been pretty lax about this, but I'm now starting to bring my code under test so I can have some confidence my changes will work before I kick off a full run.
 * Making my code self-monitoring: watching for anomalous situations and logging warnings then handling them, or aborting rather than continuing in an inconsistent state.
I learned this one in a nasty way: an external tool that I invoked as part of my fitness function was failing when given certain combinations of arguments. This meant that there was no ""total energy"" line in its output, so the simulated energy use for that test was zero; my GA proceeded to optimise until the bug was *always* triggered :-(
 * Periodically checkpoint the program's state, so you can restore from the last good state before a bug is triggered or the machine goes down.
 * Output log data in a machine-readable fashion, so you can copy-and-paste that line to get a ready-made testcase when something goes wrong.

... but I'm sure there's more to it than that.

I also have some more focussed questions:

 * People have suggested that I try watcher daemons or cron jobs to periodically restart my code if it hangs or dies. That makes sense for something like a web server, but I don't understand how it would help for a single long-running calculation. Do you do this? Does it help?
 * How do you handle the situation where your program is sitting there using up 100% CPU but producing no output?
 * How much logging do you do? How do you decide what to log?

Towards the end of December I'll start looking for a summer internship and working at an analytics company (think Mixpanel, AdMob) might be of interest to me so I'd like to work on a project that will help me decide if this is something that I want to pursue.

What would be a good data mining or web analytics related project for someone who doesn't know much about either topic? Also, keep in mind that, while I'm not a beginner, I'm certainly not an expert programmer. Having to learn new things doesn't faze me, but I'm sure there a limit to what I should try to do.

I'll be using Python for the programming and I'd like to make use of matplotlib.pyplot and numpy if possible.",6,7,False,self,,,,,
